<p>I beg to present a humble Petition on behalf of the two counties of Bugangazzi and Buyaga.<br/>
These counties were once part of the Kingdom of Bunyoro, until 1900, when they were taken over by the Government of Her Majesty Queen Victoria and placed under the control of the Govern-

ment of Uganda. This was endorsed by the agreement of 1900. This Petition is called for because there was a report called the Molson Report, following a special Commission, which made specific recommendations which were acceptable to the Bunyoro, namely, that two of the so-called lost counties of Buyaga and Bugangazzi should be returned to Bunyoro.<br/>
Prior to the granting of independence on 8th July, 1962, the Molson Report was greeted with cheers, drumming and great feasting in the counties of Buyaga and Bugangazzi when it was published on 3rd May, 1962. This Petition is signed by 37 people from the two territories. This may not seem many, but when one realises the short time they had to prepare it and the distance they had to travel, I think it shows that they are very anxious about their present position.<br/>
The previous Secretary of State's announcement on 27th June, 1962, which is unacceptable to them, advises the Government of Uganda to hold a referendum in these counties, and this is what the Petition is against. The recommendation of the Petition is that the Molson Report be implemented before British protection is withdrawn from Uganda.<br/>
And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray, etc.</p>

<p>I find myself in some difficulty today in framing my supplementary question. Without wishing to comment on the temporary nature of Ministerial appointments, may I ask my hon. Friend if she will be sure to leave a note for the future Minister of Pensions and National Insurance drawing his or her attention to the debate we had last Friday dealing with the plight of pensioners generally? Can my hon. Friend say, if the last Minister of Pensions and National Insurance was right in saying that the National Assistance rate was a holding operation, there is justification for doing the same for pensioners? Can she give me some idea what the present pension would stand at if it had been tied to the cost of living during the past two years?</p>

<p>I will tell my right hon. Friend, the Minister when I have one, what my hon. Friend has said in the first part of his supplementary question. Had the retirement pension kept pace with the rising cost of living, the 26s. single person rate introduced in October, 1946, would be 47s. 11d. and the married couple rate of 42s. would be 77s. 4d.</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance

what was the percentage increase in the basic retirement pension in each of the two periods June, 1945 to June, 1951, and June, 1951 to June, 1962; and to what extent the purchasing power of the pension was diminished in each period by rising prices.</p>

<p>There was no basic retirement pension in June, 1945. Such a pension was not introduced until October, 1946, under the National Insurance Act of that year. Between that date and June 1951, retail prices rose by about 25 per cent. There was no increase in rates of benefit. The purchasing power of the pension was consequently reduced by 20 per cent. Between June, 1951, and June, 1962, the percentage increase in the rate of the basic retirement pension was 120. As the increase in retail prices over that period was 48 per cent., the purchasing power of the pension increased by 49 per cent.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Lady aware that when the Labour Government came into power the pension, whatever it might have been called, was 10s.? It subsequently went up by very nearly 200 per cent. under the Labour Government. Is the hon. Lady further aware that, whatever might be the records of the respective Governments, the pension has been considerably eroded under both Governments and that therefore, there is an urgent case for reviewing the situation, particularly now, in view of the impending retirement of the Prime Minister himself?</p>

<p>I am aware that there was a 10s. old-age pension, which was on quite a different basis in 1945. I am also aware that the Coalition Government, in which all parties participated, agreed that the pension should be increased to 20s. for a single person and 35s. for a married couple. It was subsequently increased by the Labour Government to 26s. and 42s. and was not further increased until the erosion had amounted to 22&#x00B7;4 per cent</p>

<p>We have no means of knowing how many people over age 65 in July, 1948, were prevented from qualifying for retirement pensions solely by that fact, since many of them would at some time have had an earlier opportunity of becoming insured as voluntary contributors under the Contributory Old Age Pensions scheme. We estimate that there are about 330,000 men and women living today who were over age 65 in July, 1948, and who axe not eligible for National Insurance retirement pensions.</p>

<p>I will gladly join my hon. Friend in paying tribute to an outstanding Minister who was superlative even by the best of standards. I should have thought that Members of all parties would have paid tribute to the outstanding Parliamentary skill of my right hon. Friend. I will, of course, convey the second part of my hon. Friend's supplementary question to my next chief, but I would point out that there is very little point in saying, on the one hand, that to get the pension as of right one should contribute to it and, on the other hand, "Never mind whether you contributed or not, you will get it in any case." That seems quite contradictory.</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman is aware, the arrangements made for members of the Merchant Navy were an anomaly and, as such, I do not think they should be extended. They amount, in fact, to using unemployment insurance to subsidise the training of people in the Merchant Navy.</p>

<p>I will consider later in conjunction with others what the hon.

result in reducing the age of retirement and the age at which a person would draw a pension.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that since 19th February the House has been somewhat alarmed by the sensational increase in capital costs for the construction of the nuclear power station at Hunterston? Will not the same factors which operated in those cost increases apply to the three English nuclear stations which I have named?

<p>I appreciate the penetrating nature of my hon. Friend's supplementary question. I think that the answer to it is that the bulk supply tariff of the Generating Board to which retail tariffs are related takes into account the Board's costs as they arise. Therefore, I think that my hon. Friend can be assured that the electricity tariffs already reflect the increased costs of the nuclear power stations compared with the estimates which were originally made.</p>

<p>If one of my hon. Friend's considerations is the same as that of Sir Christopher Hinton, namely, to keep the assembled skill and talent in the consortia together for building these uneconomic power stations, would

<p>I think that the Generating Board's obligations in this matter are dictated by the contracts which they have made with the consortia. If the consortia have any complaints to make about the framework of the contracts which they have reached with the Generating Board, then naturally the Board would be very ready to entertain them.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend's earlier reply to me infer, as it seems to infer, that the increased capital cost of the nuclear power stations as completed is being offset or equated to reduced capital costs of the conventional stations? If that is not correct, then it follows that the cost per unit of electricity must rise. Can my right hon. Friend respond to that?</p>

<p>I will do my best to do so. I tried to explain to my hon. Friend that the bulk supply tariff of the Board depends on the costs, not only of the nuclear stations, but of the conventional stations. If there are compensating decreases in the costs of the conventional stations, they will be reflected in the ultimate bulk supply tariff. My main point is that the bulk supply tariff is adjusted as the differences in the costs of these two kinds of stations become apparent.</p>

<p>Part of the increased cost is due to changes in design. Obviously, spread over a period of years, there are bound to be changes in design worth incorporating in the newer stations.

<p>asked the Minister of Power what estimate has been made by the Central Electricity Generating Board, and put to him, of when further consideration will be given to the building of a new power station in the county of Durham.</p>

<p>It is expected that the Board will consider in about two years' time whether to resume the investigation of sites for a new coal-fired power station to be commissioned in the early 1970s, but this is a matter which is kept under regular review.</p>

<p>There is not much consolation in that. Why has Durham County been selected for such shabby treatment by the Central Electricity Generating Board? May we have the right hon. Gentleman's assurance that he will have further talks with the Chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board and instruct him that there should be a power station built in Durham irrespective of what he thinks? If he fails to do that, will he resign?</p>

<p>I do not think that the Central Electricity Generating Board has treated Durham shabbily. With the new Blythe B station which will come into operation in about three years, there will be sufficient capacity for local demand until the early 1970s. Therefore, any new power station would have to export, with consequent transmission lines, a large part of its output. I have undertaken to several of the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends to talk further with the Generating Board about the estimates of demand which it has made, but I should not like it to be thought that I had any doubt that the demand it has estimated is, in fact, correctly based.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend understand that there is vast unemployment in the North-East? In my constituency, it is 6&#x00B7;4 per cent. A year ago, I was given to understand that there was the possibility of a power station in the vicinity of my constituency, and I cannot understand why this cannot be looked into as a matter of urgency. I support my Socialist colleagues in this matter in trying to reduce unemployment in the area. May we have power stations, not pipelines?</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman cause an inquiry to be made into steel imports in the last twelve months, and particularly into the type of people importing steel? Is it the case that members of the British Iron and Steal Federation, which last year mounted a very powerful lobby to get an increase in British prices, are importing cheap steel, some from South Africa, including billets and strip, and processing and selling it at British prices, while very large number of steelworkers in Britain are unemployed or are on short-time?</p>

<p>Is it not the case that under the Treaty, after 1967 the Central Electricity Generating Board will not be able to combine supplies of nuclear fuels, even home-produced ones, without the permission of the Agency and except through the Agency's instrumentation and at the prices which it determines?

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.<br/>
This year marks the centenary of the discovery of the source of the Nile, by the explorers Speke and Grant and one hundred years later, almost to the day, and after so many years of darkness, Uganda will achieve her independence. During these years the history of her ancient kingdoms has become linked with our own destiny. The first few years of our protectorate were marked with events as turbulent as the cataracts of the Owen Falls themselves, but since then there has emerged a period of steady, indeed startling, progress, as hon. Members Who know Uganda will agree.<br/>
We came to find warring kingdoms; we leave a Christian country whose peoples have learnt from us the benefits not only of our civilisation but of our institutions. Wealth has increased; much has flourished; but, above all else, I believe, there has emerged a sense of political unity, and aspiration towards an Uganda nation.<br/>
Those who worked at the last two conferences, in September and October of last year and the conference so recently concluded, have all been impressed by the determination of the peoples of Uganda to work out a system of government which will safeguard the identity of the nations and tribes within it and yet, at the same time, give these peoples collectively sufficient cohesion and strength to enable Uganda to stand forth as a nation in the modern world.<br/>
I think that all those who took part in these negotiations will agree that they have not been easy&#x2014;neither for us, nor for the new African central Government, nor for the kingdoms and the districts. Last October the main framework of the future State was settled, and for this I think that the House owes a debt of gratitude to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House.<br/>
The essential success of that conference was that Buganda accepted its r&#x00F4;le inside a Uganda State. Great credit is due to His Highness the Kabaka and his advisers for the wise decisions they then took. Nevertheless, a further conference was necessary to tie up the details of the relationship between the central Government and the kingdoms, and to make the final arrangements for the transfer of our authority, and that conference which has just ended, has completed that task. For the success of this conference I would pay high tribute to Mr. Obote, the Leader of the U.P.C. and of the Coalition Government, and also to the delegates of the kingdoms and districts who accepted compromises in the interests of Uganda as a whole and for the achievement of early independence.<br/>
The House has before it this afternoon two documents, the Report of the recent conference, Cmnd. 1778, and the Independence Bill. The conclusions of the conference do not find a place in the Bill, but will find one, of course, in the independence constitution which will be enacted by Order in Council. It is only because full agreement was reached at the conference on the provisions which the Constitution will contain that Her Majesty's Government are able to bring forward this Bill today.<br/>
It was made clear and has been accepted that the time has now come when the individual kingdoms and districts can no longer look to us to safeguard their particular interests. This responsibility will fall inevitably, after independence, upon the Uganda Government themselves. In return, the new Constitution will contain much fuller provisions safeguarding the positions of the kingdoms. Thus, at the periphery the traditions of the peoples, tribes and rulers will be protected, whilst at the centre the independent Government of Uganda will have all the


powers which they need to govern effectively.<br/>
Whilst general agreement was reached on constitutional matters there was one matter on which, as the House will know, it proved impossible to obtain an agreed settlement. This was the boundaries dispute between Buganda and Bunyoro. Hon. Members will have read Lord Molson's Report on this problem. This Report, which was, I believe, a model of brevity and good sense, called on Buganda to cede to Bunyoro two counties in which there is a majority of Banyoro people. Much time during the conference was devoted by my right hon. Friend to trying to get an agreed solution between the Kabaka's Government and that of the Omukama of Bunyoro; and in this we failed.<br/>
Some hon. Members may suggest that, as we were unable to implement the ideal solution put forward by the Molson Report, the date of independence should have been delayed. I must disagree, and disagree most strongly, for here, I think, two matters must be paramount in our minds, first, the desire of the 6&#x00BD; million people of Uganda to proceed swiftly to independence, and, secondly, looking back at history, the necessity of avoiding a civil war.<br/>
It was for this reason that the Secretary of State decided that both countries, whilst remaining within the boundaries of Buganda, should have their administration taken over by a third force, the central Government. By doing this, I believe that we shall give the 60,000 people who live there security for the immediate future, and neutralise the threat to peace and good order in Uganda during the first years of independence. A period of impartial administration should create conditions in which a referendum can one day be held.<br/>
Now I turn to the Bill itself. Clause 1 is common form for dealing with a territory which is wholly a Protectorate. The only special point I would make here is that subsection (3) contains a reference to the Second Schedule by which agreements with the various kingdoms are ended. This is similar to the provisions of the India Act and the Act which gave Burma its independence.<br/>
Clause 2 refers to citizenship, and this, again, is in common form, the example

here being that of Tanganyika. Clause 3 is, again, standard form, and Clause 4, as in the Tanganyika Independence Act, refers to the East African Common Services Organisation and makes the necessary provision, by which funds can be made available under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1959. That, then, is the Bill.<br/>
In conclusion, I would just say two things. First, I am sure that the House will join me in paying tribute to all the British civil servants&#x2014;Lugard, Sir Harry Johnston and our own contemporaries&#x2014; who have done such great work in bringing forward Uganda to the state it finds itself in today. It is not only the great civil servants, contemporary and past, but also the missionary societies of all denominations to whom a special tribute should be paid. Of all our territories in Africa, Uganda has perhaps the most advanced and successful education system, and in this the missionaries have played a powerful and important part. I believe that the intelligence and determination of the people must stand them in good stead.<br/>
Proudly, too, I might remind the House that the recent conference expressed the unanimous wish that on attaining independence Uganda should be accepted as a member country of the Commonwealth and that the Queen should remain the Sovereign of its people as Queen of Uganda.<br/>
The difficulties which lie before Uganda are considerable. Clearly, there is great need for restraint, the sort of restraint which we saw at the recent conference. The aspiration of so many peoples, with different histories towards unity is something which must be nurtured carefully. I am sure that, with her political leaders, with the spirit of compromise which was achieved and with the potential wealth of the country &#x2014;the fact, for example, that there is no land hunger compared with adjacent countries in that part of Africa&#x2014;Uganda, well-governed and well led, and bearing in mind the Christian objectives of faith, hope and Charity, especially perhaps charity towards each other, can play at the centre of this part of Africa, at the head waters of the Nile itself, an important and vital part in our Commonwealth destiny.</p>

<p>Like the Minister, we on this side of the House welcome this occasion as an opportunity to congratulate Uganda on her achievement of independence and to wish her well in facing the many problems of the future in that part of Africa. Many of us on both sides will hope that Uganda's independence is the second step towards building a great English-speaking East African federation of nations which, by pooling their resources, will be able to raise their living standards more quickly than would otherwise be the case.<br/>
With one exception&#x2014;the issue of the lost counties&#x2014;which the Minister has dealt with and which I should like to deal with in more detail in a moment or two, I think that the former Colonial Secretary, the Prime Minister, Mr. Obote, and all those who took part in the recent constitutional conference deserve a great deal of congratulation upon the large measure of success which it managed to achieve. I do not think that looking at Uganda a year or two ago one would have thought that it would have been possible as quickly as this to create a federal structure in which great kingdoms like Buganda would have accepted a place within a framework of central government, and due tribute ought to be paid for that achievement.<br/>
The progress in Uganda over recent years&#x2014;I am glad to see the Leader of the House here, because he enjoys his share of credit for this&#x2014;has been fast and fascinating. The main difficulty lying in the way of freedom has been not the reluctance of the metropolitan Power to withdraw but the fact that inside Uganda there has been an entirely indigenous African conflict of ideas between modern political nationalism and traditional tribal patterns of government. I confess that sometimes, as a Socialist, I have found myself irritated at the reluctance of the kingdoms in Uganda to fit into a more modern pattern of development, and than I have remembered that, as a Scot, I find these prickly loyalties to kingdoms within a larger framework extremely understandable. Provided that the right sort of progress is made, the kind of loyalty that these kingdoms enjoy is an important element in stability&#x2014;but I

stress, provided that the right sort of progress is made.<br/>
The struggle between these two sets of ideas in Africa has been sharper and at times more dramatic in Uganda than it has been in other parts of the continent. But I think that what has developed in Uganda, and what one hopes will develop in future, will be of very considerable significance for other countries. How Uganda succeeds in reconciling these different concepts of African society will influence other parts of the continent. All who wish Uganda well will echo the final words of the Minister, voicing the hope that there will be enough tolerance, generosity and charity on both sides to bring about a successful synthesis.<br/>
It would have been a greater encouragement of those hopes if the independence agreement had also included an agreement about the vexatious dispute between the kingdoms of Buganda and Bunyoro about the lost counties. We had an indication of how much that dispute is still with us at the beginning of our sitting this afternoon, when the hon. Lady the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Miss Vickers), introduced a petition from Bunyoro people in the lost counties. In the petition they appealed to She Government even at this late date to accept the recommendations of the Molson Commission which would have returned two of the five counties in dispute to Bunyoro.<br/>
In discussing this it is important to appreciate that, from the Bunyoro point of view, the proposition in the petition was, in fact, a compromise. Bunyoro found the finding of the Molson Commission disappointing, as Buganda did. I myself would echo the words of the Molson Commission&#x2014;I am afraid that now they must be quoted with some disappointment&#x2014;when it said:
<q>We hope for a generous act of statesmanship on the part of Buganda. We can conceive of no other single act which would add more to the stature of Buganda within Uganda, or would contribute more to the stability of the Protectorate on the eve of independence.</q>
Looking over the history of this matter, I think that, although, in a legal sense, Buganda no doubt has a great deal on her side, she has been unwise to stick to the letter of the law on this matter. It would have sent the new Commonwealth country of Uganda off to


a splendid start if only Uganda had been able to leave this dangerous dispute behind her.<br/>
I do not think that Her Majesty's Government can escape a considerable share of the blame for the fact that it has not been possible so far to solve this dispute in advance of independence. The lost counties problem was born in as naked an act of colonial annexation as one will find in the archives, and I am afraid that it is ending in an atmosphere of delay and indecision on the part of the Government which in its way is as deplorable as the excessively arbitrary nature of the original annexation.<br/>
It is a long time since my hon. Friend the Member for Flint, East (Mrs. White) raised in this House the issue of the lost counties. It is more than a year since the Munster Commission recommended that the matter should be dealt with by a referendum. At the conference last October it was decided to send out the Molson Commission, but there were delays in appointing it, delays in getting it out there, and even longer delays in publishing its Report.<br/>
That Commission issued a very grave warning to the Government It said that there might be dangerous consequences if its recommendations were not implemented while we still held the ring in Uganda in advance of independence. Paragraph 106 of its Report says:
<q>We think it therefore an integral part of our scheme that the transfer of territory shall have taken place before the 9th October, while the Governor is still in office.</q>
The Commission was a small one. It included people of such great distinction as Lord Molson, a former Conservative Minister, and Earl Listowel. Men of that character do not lightly issue a warning of that gravity. A Government who delay until they have no room left for man&#x0153;uvre on this issue are taking upon themselves a heavy responsibility. Although we look forward to a prosperous future for Uganda, we have a duty to underline this problem on an occasion like this.<br/>
What the Government finally put forward at the eleventh hour, in the recent constitutional conference, was the proposal that there should be a minimum cooling-off period of two years in the lost counties, under the central Administration, to be followed by a referendum.

But the Government did not state any maximum period within which the referendum should be held. I understand that the Mukama of Bunyoro has written to the Colonial Secretary suggesting that a maximum period should be inserted. The people of Bunyoro have an understandable fear that without some limiting period during which a referendum must take place they might find themselves in the same sort of situation as exists in Kashmir, where the promised referendum has been indefinitely postponed.<br/>
I have great faith in the integrity and ability of the present Prime Minister, Mr. Obote, to find a successful and peaceful solution to the problem, but the further request from the people of Bunyoro, put in a spirit of compromise, should have careful consideration from the Government, and I hope that the Minister will say that it is possible to discuss this matter with Mr. Obote and the others concerned in Uganda. It is also of importance that if the Bunyoro people are to be reassured there should be more precise information than we have had so far about the way in which the central administration of these disputed counties will be carried out, and what it will mean in terms of police administration and the appointment of local chiefs. I hope that the Minister will give the House more information on this matter in winding up the debate.<br/>
I have expressed my disappointment at the lack of magnanimity on the part of Buganda on this issue, although I understand the internal political difficulties which its leaders have to face. It is also fair to say, on the side of Buganda, that it has its own substantial complaint about the way in which the Government have dealt with the matter. Its people had understood from the Government, over the years, that this was a closed issue. My information is that at the October conference Buganda understood that the Molson Commission did not have within its terms of reference any discussion of a change of boundaries.<br/>
I understand that Lord Molson himself felt in some doubt about this and took the matter up with the Prime Minister. Indeed, he refers to this fact at the beginning of his Report. I further understand&#x2014;and I shall be grateful for


correction if I am wrong&#x2014;that Lord Molson received a letter from the Prime Minister saying that his terms of reference did include possible changes of boundaries. This letter from the Prime Minister to Lord Molson remained a private matter for many months, until it was suddenly exposed at the constitutional conference.<br/>
Here again, we have an example of the Government engaging in what the parties to this dispute are bound to feel to be rather devious dealing, and it is extremely unfortunate that the Government's participation in the matter should at this point have been less successful and less creditable than their general achievements in respect of the whole constitutional development of Uganda.<br/>
Having said that, we must face the fact that our responsibility for the future political shape of Uganda ends on 9th October. But our responsibility for the future economic welfare of its people by no means ends then. Indeed our responsibility in this respect is likely to become greater rather than less in the years that lie ahead, if we are to match the obligations imposed on us. We are getting away from the concept that when a dependent territory becomes a new and indpendent member of the Commonwealth, at midnight on independence night a magical change takes place, and that all the kinds of help that we formerly gave, under the auspices of the Colonial Office, cease upon the stroke of twelve, or, if they continue at all, have to be reshaped under different conditions. The House and the Government are beginning to accept that there must be a great deal more continuity.<br/>
The last time we discussed this question was in our debate on the Jamaica Independence Bill, just over a month ago, when my right hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. Strachey) pointed out that one form of continuity could be achieved if the Colonial Development Corporation became the Commonwealth Development Corporation, so that it was able to carry on new projects in the formerly dependent territories where it had operated with such success.<br/>
We hope that out of the tremendous turmoil now taking place in Government circles we may have, as one of the new

ideas coming from the new Conservative Government, a realisation of the fact that a decision on this matter is long overdue, and that Uganda will be one of the first places which is able to enjoy the expanded operations of a Commonwealth Development Corporation, based on the foundations of the work done by the Colonial Development Corporation.<br/>
Uganda needs a great deal of sympathetic economic help from this country and the developed world generally. Uganda, perhaps as much as any other part of the underdeveloped world, has seen its standard of living falling in recent years because of the drop in prices of its basic commodities. Uganda is a striking illustration of the fact that by far the most important form of economic help which developed countries can give to under-developed countries is to buy their products at stable prices. Figures taken from the World Bank Survey recently carried out in Uganda show that during the period 1952&#x2013;60 the volume of exports from Uganda&#x2014; the goods that Uganda sold to the rest of the world&#x2014;doubled, but that during the same period the value of those exports dropped by about 8 per cent.<br/>
Uganda is dependent on coffee and cotton. Together, they account for nearly 90 per cent. of her exports, and one-third of her revenue. I understand that Uganda produces more coffee than Tanganyika and Kenya put together. According to the Colonial Office Digest of Statistics, coffee prices have been dropping rapidly in recent years. They were running at 278s. per cwt. in 1958, but are now down to 140s. per cwt.&#x2014;a drop of about 50 per cent.<br/>
Uganda is a strong reminder to us not to forget that the average developing country earns five-sixths of its foreign exchange through trade and only one-sixth through foreign aid. I repeat; Britain should take the lead among the developed countries of the world in trying to arrive at some form of stable commodity prices. This, far more than anything else, is the basic way to provide economic aid.<br/>
But this does not mean that we do not also have an obligation to provide direct financial assistance, and particularly direct technical assistance. The Minister may have had an opportunity of


studying the World Bank Survey which has recently been published. It provides some staggering figures, showing how poor Uganda is in the various forms of expertise needed for a developing country. To give one example, I understand that there is today only one trained African electrical engineer in Uganda.<br/>
The Minister mentioned that the educational development in Uganda bore favourable comparison with educational development in any other African territory. If that is so, it does not say a very great deal for what is happening in other African territories. The World Bank Survey says that only 1 per cent. of the 14 to 17 age group in Uganda enjoys any form of secondary education at all. Professor Arthur Lewis, the leading expert in this field, has laid down that the minimum for a developing country in secondary education should be 4 per cent. of that age group. That 1 per cent. is a very generous estimate, and includes everybody who could possibly be included in secondary schools.<br/>
The World Bank Survey also says that there were in 1961 only 40 African graduate teachers in a population of 6&#x00BD; million. In 1959 out of 246 rural grant-aided schools all but 28 of the teachers there were expatriate teachers. Here is a legacy of educational poverty which demands continued help from us on a very generous scale of assistance indeed. The World Bank team has done its usual competent job on development planning in Uganda, and has produced a draft five-year development plan. This would involve altogether development expenditure of about &#x00A3;34 million, and the World Bank says that about half of this can be produced from local resources, which is reasonably good, and is in many ways a tribute to the work that has gone on while Uganda has been the responsibility of the Colonial Office.<br/>
The Report goes on to say that there will be a gap, which will need to be met from foreign sources, of between &#x00A3;9&#x00BD; million and &#x00A3;15&#x00BD; million. It will be &#x00A3;9&#x00BD; million if the United Kingdom completely fulfils all its terminal obligations to Uganda, and gives aid of about &#x00A3;9&#x00BD; million. It will rise to about &#x00A3;13&#x00BD; million if the United Kingdom gives aid on a minimum scale of only &#x00A3;5&#x00BD; million. I hope that we shall get some information from the Minister, before the debate ends, on the scale of the financial help

which we are to give to Uganda, and if we are to play our part in helping to achieve the target laid down by the World Bank.<br/>
In conclusion, I want to mention one institution in Uganda which particularly interests me, and which, I think, is an outstanding creation of the period of colonial rule there. I refer to Makerere College, Which I hope will soon be one of the principal parts of a new university of East Africa. Makerere has the largest library in East Africa&#x2014;over 100,000 books and pamphlets.<br/>
I mention Makerere not only because I hope that we shall give all the encouragement we can to continuing development there, but because it is at present a training ground for a large number of young British and American graduates, who have gone straight out there from university to take their teacher training and to go on to commit themselves to spending the first year or two of their professional lives as teachers, giving the educational help which is so badly needed in that part of Africa. Makerere seems to be in many ways setting an example of the kind of mutual help which we ought to be developing between the advanced countries and the emerging countries of the world.<br/>
I think that Uganda can take that fact that there are these young people out there at the start of their lives as a sign of the keen sense that exists in this country and in America that the ending of a dependent colonial empire and its replacement by an independent Commonwealth does not mean that our sense of obligation to these countries will in any way be diminished. I hope that Her Majesty's Government, in giving assistance of various sorts to Uganda, will live up to the spirit that is being shown today by these young graduates at Makerere College.</p>

<p>I should like to add my voice to those from both sides of the House in expressing a welcome to Uganda as an independent member of the Commonwealth. If I have one or two criticisms to make, it is not in any way because I feel that this independence is not deserved, or should nave been delayed, but rather


that I believe that Her Majesty's Government should have been able to solve these problems before now, and before we were presented with this Bill, which gives Uganda its independence.<br/>
On a number of occasions in the House, I have made the point that it is very easy to give independence to a colonial territory, but it is not so easy to ensure that the country will be able to stand on its own feet when it becomes independent, and will face the stress and strains which we know so well await in the world of the 1960s. It has been said by those wiser than I that there are certain criteria to be fulfilled before a country can become independent, and five have been suggested. They are: there should be a national Government acceptable to the people; there should be a common loyalty and an ability to live as one nation; there should be economic self reliance and an expanding economy; there should be an efficient indigenous, and, if necessary, expatriate Civil Service; and, finally, there should be a true development of education producing an informed electorate, as well as national leaders.<br/>
I should like to apply these criteria to the country whose independence we are debating today. The first and most important is a national Government, acceptable to the people, and a common loyalty. Uganda has been bedevilled for many years by two important constitutional disputes. The first concerns the position of Buganda, which is the largest and most powerful tribal area in the country, and the second is that of the lost counties. I should like to discuss these two problems separately.<br/>
In the post-war world, we have had trouble in Buganda in one form or another in 1945, in 1949 and in 1953. This was ended by the 1955 agreement, in which the Kabaka returned to his country as a constitutional monarch. In spite of the agreement, two years later, Buganda boycotted the national Legislature from 1958 to 1961. In 1961, registration took place for a general election, but in Buganda, out of 700,000 people who could have registered, only 35,000 actually did so and considerably fewer actually voted<br/>
We may say that this is because of their loyalty to the Kabaka and his Government, or it may have been due to intimidation, but, as a result, the Democratic Party won 20 seats in Buganda with a very small number of votes and 24 seats outside Buganda. The other national party, the Uganda People's Congress, won no seats in Buganda and carried 35 seats outside, and the result was that the Democratic Party became the elected Government and its leader, Mr. Benedicto Kiwanuka became the first Prime Minister in the history of Uganda.<br/>
We come now to the 1961 constitutional conference, at which it was agreed that Buganda could have the alternative of making direct or indirect elections of its representatives to the central Government. That, straight away, put Buganda in a position of controlling the central Government. That is what was forecast by the Government delegation, and I would remind the House that the Chief Minister at the time, in Cmnd. 1523, which is the Report of the Uganda Constitutional Conference, 1961, recorded his emphatic dissent from the proposal that Buganda should be allowed to have indirect elections to the central Government. He objected particularly, in paragraph 87, to
<q>&#x2026; the Secretary of State's intention that this law, made by the Uganda legislature, should be abrogated by an Order in Council without reference to the people of Uganda. He considered that this would be tantamount to disenfranchising the electors in the Buganda constituencies.</q>
After that constitutional conference, the Kabaka-Yekka, the Kabaka's party, was formed, and at the recent general election in 1962, we find that the U.P.C. won 37 seats, which was two more than previously, and that the Democratic Party won 22 seats, which were two less than previously, all outside Buganda and Kabaka-Yekka won all 21 seats in Buganda. Now, we have the position which Kiwanuka feared would arise, at the time of the constitutional conference, that one party, which is the only party allowed in Buganda, holds the balance in the central Government.<br/>
This could be dangerous. I will put it no higher than that I believe that I shall receive the support of hon. Members on both sides of the House in saying that we rely on the good sense of


the present Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to find a way round these very great difficulties in which we have left the central Government.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman has been to Buganda he will realise that what the Kabaka says goes. There was considerable intimidation, as I implied earlier, in 1961, and it was virtually impossible for the other panties to register or be elected at the last general election.</p>

<p>To correct any possible mis-impression which I may have given to the House, may I say again that I believe there was considerable intimidation in Buganda in 1961, and again in 1962, which prevented either the U.P.C. or the Democratic Party from registering voters or of voting for members of those two parties in those elections. In the years since the war or, rather, in the years since the Kabaka returned to his country, the whole history of Buganda shows that the nominees of himself or his Prime Minister have carried the day. That is largely because of the intimidation which they are prepared to use.<br/>
I wish to go on to the second point, the recovery of the lost counties. This

dispute started in the last century, or at the 1900 agreement, and is still a live issue, after over sixty years. So it is a matter of considerable importance to the people of that country. In 1961, the Munster Report said, about this dispute:
<q>While feelings remain as they are at the present, the dispute is likely to make it impossible for Buganda and Bunyoro to co-exist amicably.</q>
In the next paragraph the Report states:
<q>There is also a distinct danger that the dispute over the 'lost counties' might become a <i>casus belli</i> involving other parts of Uganda.</q>
Those are serious warnings from a well-informed Commission which went on to recommend a referendum to settle the problem.<br/>
In 1961, came the constitutional conference, when the Kabaka rejected the idea of a referendum. The Secretary of State suggested a Commission of Privy Councillors and the Bunyoro representatives walked out. One can, therefore, appreciate the difficulty of the task of trying to get an agreement. However, the Secretary of State, rightly, carried on, and appointed his Commission of Privy Councillors. I should like to quote from the Report of this Commission, which stated:
<q>We must again emphasise the dangers of the present situation and the possibility referred to by the Monster Commission of civil war&#x2026;. Civil strife would gradually develop into civil war, which would not be confined to the disputants if the Bunyoro succeeded in enlisting the support of neighbouring tribes.</q>
On 16th June of this year, as a result of the Report, <i>The Times</i> had this to say:
<q>Bunyoro, however, has sympathisers and the Buganda are sometimes unpopular, and the Privy Councillors reported that the quarrel should be resolved before independence lest there should be bloodshed afterwards. Can that advice be set aside?</q>
When we study the Report of the 1962 constitutional conference we find that the advice was, indeed, set aside. There is to be no transfer of the territories. Administration of the counties is to be taken on by the central Government. That is perhaps a reasonable compromise, but the Report goes on to say that after not less than two years from the date of transfer the National Assembly will decide on the date for a referendum. In other words, we are washing our hands of the problem until after


independence&#x2014;a problem that two Commissions have already said could lead to civil war.<br/>
I believe that we are right in creating a federal set-up for Uganda. But I believe that because of expediency and a desire to cut our commitments, we are leaving a position where one part of the federation holds the balance&#x2014;and perhaps may prove predominant&#x2014;in the central Government. We are also leaving a dispute which has been simmering for sixty years and could break out after independence. I beg my hon. Friend to listen to the appeals made from both sides of the House to fix a definite date for this referendum. If he does not do so, I think it is extremely doubtful whether the referendum will ever take place.<br/>
I suggest that the precedent which we are creating is a dangerous one. We have left the most powerful tribe in Uganda in a strong position to bid for power over the whole country. Whether they will do so, history will show, but they are being left in a very strong position. Will that be the precedent for Kenya? Shall we leave the most powerful tribe there, Jomo Kenyatta's Kikuyu, in the same position? Or shall we ensure that the difficult federal, regional and tribal problems are settled before independence? If they are not, we may have more than a civil war on our hands.<br/>
I wish to move from constitutional issues and to mention one or two other matters. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) underlined the importance of the economic help to be given to newly independent countries. We know that Uganda has a &#x00A3;54&#x00B7;2 million five-year plan. My figures may not quite agree with those quoted by the hon. Member, but I understand that this country has promised &#x00A3;10 million up to 1964 towards financing that plan. About &#x00A3;2 million is being obtained from other international sources and the rest will be raised in East Africa. This, it would seem, will place a heavy burden on the finances of Uganda and I hope that the Minister will be able to give more details about the financial help which Uganda will need and which, I am sure, hon. Members will agree that we have a responsibility to give.<br/>
This is particularly so in view of the fact that 1961 was an extremely bad year for the country because of the weather. The cotton yield was the lowest for fourteen years. The coffee crop has been poor. Not only that, but coffee has had low world prices and the Uganda export quota under the International Coffee Agreement has been reduced. Again, because of the weather, copper, the third of the most important exports, is down by &#x00A3;750,000 in value, compared with other years. Therefore, Uganda had a rather bad year in 1961 and I hope that we shall be as generous as possible.<br/>
To look on the bright side, there is the new steel mill which is to be ready this year. There is also a new fertiliser factory and the Owen Falls Dam is undoubtedly paying enormous dividends and Will provide cheap power not only for Uganda, but also for Kenya. This seems the time to bring out the point that the economic future of Uganda is bound up with that of her neighbours. She is already supplying electricity to Kenya. She depends on one railway line, one road and one port, Mombassa. From an economic point of view the only thing which makes sense is a federation of the four territories of East Africa. That must be decided by the people on the spot, rather than by this House of Commons. I hope that both sides of the House will join in saying that we hope the leaders of these countries, as they assume responsibility for their own affairs, will give even more serious consideration to an economic federation than they have given in the past.<br/>
I wish to ask the Minister about the Civil Service. It is vital, particularly during the transitional period between dependence and independence. What is the present position in regard to expatriates? In Tanganyika, 75 per cent. of the civil servants have stayed on after independence but since then the picture has not been such a happy one. Many civil servants have left and the repercussions on Uganda and Kenya are bound to be serious. Can my right hon. Friend say what the future looks like for expatriates, both those who are designated and those who were recruited locally?<br/>
My hon. Friend stressed the importance of education. In 1960, 18&#x00B7;5 per cent. of the total income of the country


was spent on education. Hon. Members on both sides of the House will welcome the honour recently paid to the rector of Makerere University, Sir Bernard de Bunsen. The work of the missionaries has also been stressed. Much of this educational progress has been due to missionaries of all Christian denominations who have helped Uganda to move from the old world of tribalism and witchcraft into the new world of the 1960s.<br/>
Uganda is a rich country full of happy people. I think that in Buganda she has some of the most skilled negotiators in the world. I am very sorry that we in this country have not been able to solve all the problems associated with the constitutional advance of Uganda before giving her full independence. In spite of that, we have done a good job in that country. We all wish her well and hope that perhaps she may be one of the few African countries which will prove that a Parliamentary democracy can be maintained on the pattern which we in Westminster know, by having both a Government and an Opposition. It looks as though she is setting forth on the path of Western Parliamentary democracy and we all wish her well.</p>

<p>I do not wish to follow the hon. Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall) in detail into the question of controversy between the different sections in Uganda. In general, I Chink that the Government have been right to give independence even though these problems are not yet solved. It is the same decision as had to be made in India. There were differences of opinion there between one section and another, but the Government decided that the country should be given independence even if it meant that India would be divided into two parts. The right idea is to give freedom and let people there build on it.</p>

<p>That might be a dangerous parallel. Although I agree that we should give independence to Uganda, we should remember that in the case of India it led to over 1 million deaths. We do not want to see that in Uganda.</p>

<p>We do not want to see that, but we also do not want to see countries held in subjection because they have not solved all their problems. That

would be a wrong principle. It is not the principle which the Government are pursuing. I think that the Government are right in the action they are taking and I welcome the Bill.<br/>
It is now between sixty and seventy years since it was announced at Westminster that there should be a British protectorate over Uganda. Those years have seen very considerable success, much greater success than we have seen in some other countries which we have controlled. First, there is a greater degree of prosperity in Uganda than in most countries of East Africa and in many other African countries. Secondly, there is no race prejudice there.<br/>
I remember, when I went out there in 1950, on behalf of the Government, the difference I found between Kenya and Uganda. I remember what a joy it was to go to Uganda and leave behind all the race prejudice which existed in Kenya at that time&#x2014;I do not say it is there now&#x2014;and to go to Uganda, where there was no race prejudice. The principal reason was that it was rightly decided at that time that there should be no white land ownership in Uganda. There could have been exactly the same position as there was in Kenya, but that decision was taken. I think that it was rightly taken. The Under Secretary himself spoke of the fact that there is no land hunger in Uganda. One reason is that the land belongs to the Africans and there has mot been a large section given to the white population. I think that that was wise.<br/>
As others have done, I wish to pay tribute to the work of the civil servants who have made such a success of their task while we have been in control of Uganda. It is because of their work that Uganda is in the state of prosperity it enjoys today. We owe a debt of gratitude to them. I hope that they will be treated as well as possible both by this Government and by the new Uganda Government and that they will not fail between two stools in the way in which many civil servants have done in such circumstances in the past.<br/>
I wish to refer, again, to the prosperity which exists in Uganda. In spite of the fact that there are no British farmers there, much of the land is very well farmed, having regard to the limited tools and skills which the people have.


It is well terraced and well looked after, and generally it is fertile land, very much more so than in Tanganyika and other parts of East Africa. As hon. Members have said, the country depends basically on two main crops. That is always a very serious thing in the economy of any country, and I hope that we shall be able to introduce some kind of system by which their prices can be stabilised. That was done with considerable success in Ghana when that country was the Gold Coast and it has been carried on in other countries by bulk purchase and the levelling of prices through a commodity board. I hope these things can be done and continued in Uganda.</p>

<p>The problem is how to stabilise commodity prices on a falling market. I must point out that in Ghana the matter was comparatively simple. It was a question of giving stabilised prices on a rising market and money was put into the "kitty".</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1962-07-16a.51.1" hansard_membership_id="3629" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30092" speakername="Mr. Dugdale" colnum="51" time="">
<p>That was because the decision was taken at the right moment, when prices were rising. Obviously, it would be much more difficult to do it now in Uganda. The moment to choose is when prices are high rather than when they are low.<br/>
In spite of all the prosperity we have given to Uganda she has achieved independence only after a struggle, as has been the case in all countries of the Commonwealth. The first time I went to Uganda I went as a representative of Her Majesty's Government, and was escorted by police. The second time I went I was also escorted by the police. This time it was not to protect me, but to see that I did no wrong, because I was there at the invitation of some of the people of Uganda and it was quite a different visit. Some of the people I visited were at that time in prison. They have now come out of prison and are occupying positions in the Legislative Assembly. That is an excellent thing and it is in keeping with the best traditions of modern British colonial rule.<br/>
One person whom I visited in particular, Mr. Mulira, was in prison then. I understand that he is now a representative of the Legislative Assembly on the African Common Services Organisation where, I am sure, he will be able to do very good work. Even when he was

in prison I had an example of the kind of methods by which Britain carries on. I visited the Governor and took with me the wife of this gentleman. She said that she ought not to go to see the Governor because her husband was in prison, and she would stay in the car. I mentioned to the Governor that I had someone waiting for me in the car and he asked who it was. I told him and he said, "Oh, it's Rebecca. I must see her at once."<br/>
That is an extraordinary sort of thing to happen in any Colony, and I do not think that it happens in many Colonies other than our own. Mr. Mulira is, as I have said, now a representative on the African Common Services Organisation.<br/>
I very much welcome Clause 4, which appears to me to give wide powers to help that organisation. It is a good thing that that can be done, and may possibly make up for the fact that the C.D.C. cannot help countries which are free. I hope that this problem will be overcome before long, because I think that later &#x2014;not in connection with this Bill&#x2014;there may be some proposals to make it a Commonwealth and not a Colonial Development Council. C.D.C. has done considerable work in Uganda. It has helped in the Kalinde copper mines to great benefit, and it should be of even more benefit if permitted to help.<br/>
The Minister also mentioned the Uganda Development Corporation&#x2014;a very good form of public enterprise&#x2014; which we on this side of the House like very much, and I am glad that some hon. Members opposite also like it. It has been responsible for many activities, including the production of cement and the processing of fish, both of which have been done with considerable success. Uganda again has great resources in power and the Government scheme of the Owen Falls dam has been developed by the Government and could not have been developed otherwise. I am glad to know that industries are being started near it on a wide scale.<br/>
How can we contribute to all this? In the first place, presumably we can give money, and I hope that we shall do so through every possible channel in order to provide the capital needed to develop these schemes. We can also provide technicians, and I hope that we shall send there men with the skill to run some of these schemes.<br/>
That brings me to consider the question of education. It is undoubtedly true that while the Africans are better educated in Uganda than in many other parts of Africa, the level of higher education cannot possibly be called high and should be very much higher. I pay my tribute to Makerere, but it deals with only a very small number of students, and I hope that we shall continue to help, particularly through the Commonwealth education schemes which are now developing, in teacher-training and scholarships. I hope that in this way we shall help Uganda to develop her education service still further. In the past, much of the education has come from the missionaries, and I pay tribute to the missionaries of all religions for the fine work which they have done in education. But we cannot depend on them indefinitely, and they must be helped if we are to have a modern system of education there. I hope that that will be done.<br/>
Uganda is a country with very great charm&#x2014;a charm which is felt by everyone who goes there. I would say that it has more charm than many other countries in Africa. Sir Andrew Cohen described vividly his feeling when, sitting in New York, with all the skyscrapers around him, of longing to be back in Uganda with all its beauty. Many of us have had that feeling. I once met a teacher who was arriving in Uganda by aeroplane and said to her, "Are you not sorry to leave England?" She replied, "Not at all. I fed that I am coming back home to Uganda". She was a British teacher, but she was glad to get back to Uganda because she liked it so much. Whatever our feelings may be about the lost counties and any other disputes which have occurred, all of us join in saying to the people of Uganda, "We give you freedom. May you live in prosperity and 'peace".</p>

<p>I am very pleased to have the opportunity of taking part in the debate, especially as I have presented a Petition to the House about one aspect of the Bill. We have had two able speeches, giving a great deal of detail, by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) and my hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall), so I

do not intend to go into as much detail as they did, but will make one or two points in particular.<br/>
The history of this territory is fascinating. A series of tribal states have come together, mostly in agreement with Her Majesty Queen Victoria, and now they are forming a country which is to acknowledge the present Queen, and is to become an independent country within the Commonwealth. More than any other territory in Africa, there has been documented history of Uganda. Many books have been written, and tremendous interest has been shown in the territory. Going back to the days of Speke, there was discovered a very highly civilised Kingdom of Buganda and also the rather larger Kingdom of Bunyoro. The fact that today we are able to bring these together with the other kingdoms shows bow far there has been careful consideration and hard work between all the peoples, to make this possible.<br/>
I should like to pay tribute to the Christian missions, all of which have done outstanding work in this territory, probably more than has been done in any other territory of Africa. At one time education was left entirely to the missions. They have fulfilled a very great r&#x00F4;le, and I hope that they will be allowed to go on working in an atmosphere of peace.<br/>
I also pay tribute to the voluntary workers, having been connected with voluntary work in Uganda, particularly work for the blind. I think that Uganda was the first State to undertake work in this way through realising that the blind were human beings, working out schemes for earning their living. I sincerely hope that this work will continue.<br/>
In this territory the work done by women has been far more advanced than elsewhere. Women's clubs have played an important part in the education of older women, and young children in the informal manner. I have toad pleasure in visiting them, and I know the part which they have played in placing the education of the older women on a firm basis. I join the hon. Member for Dundee, East in praising the work of Makerere College, and I hope that in the future this College will keep its doors open to other students within Africa. One of the great pleasures of going to


this college, where I have on more than one occasion addressed the students, is to find that the students are integrated there and that one can see people from Tanganyika, Zanzibar and Kenya. I hope that this practice will continue after independence.<br/>
While in no way opposing the Bill, I should like certain safeguards to be placed in At, following the Petition which I have presented on behalf of the people of Bangamazzi and Buyaga. In Clause 1 (2) line 17, it is made quite clear that no action can be taken by this country about the future affairs of Uganda after October, 1962. I feel that before we agree to the Bill in its present form we should make some further recommendations. It is essential that action is taken prior to full independence to do justice to the people of Buyaga and Banganazzi. This was mentioned in the Munster Report and the Molson Report, which have been quoted by my hon. Friends. I agree with the recommendation of the Molson Committee, and I should like to see some action taken in the Bill. The Molson recommendations for independence should be implemented at once or Her Majesty's Government should give full and cogent reasons for refusing to implement those recommendations. We in the House are entitled to have some reasons why they are not being implemented.<br/>
Otherwise, they should have a referendum at once while the British are there, and not, as it is stated at present, mot earlier than three years after independence. Alternatively, a date should be written into the Independence Bill and, if the referendum does not take place by that date, the peoples should have the right of appeal to the Privy Council, as paragraph 34 of Cmnd. 1778 says that there is to be a right of appeal direct to the Privy Council. These people must have their future safeguarded, and I hope that these points will be considered by the Government.<br/>
I further hope that, if it is considered that a referendum should take place, either before or after independence, the roll of voters to be used for the referendum will be that used in the general election held in the two counties in March, 1962. It would be fairer to use this roll, as we know that it is a fully

compiled roll and therefore cannot be altered.<br/>
Paragraph 89 of the Molson Report says:
<q>It strikes us as being most significant that while Banyoro on both sides of the boundary were prepared to acquiesce under protest in the 1900 settlement while British Administration was still firmly in the saddle, the course of events since 1955 has shown clearly that they are not prepared to tolerate the present situation after independence.</q>
There were three very able men on the Molson Commission. They were sent to the lost counties for the purpose of finding what the people of the Territories thought. They put this, in their Report, and it is something of which we should take special note. The paragraph continues:
<q>Even during the later stages of the British, Protectorate it has been necessary for the Governor to ask the Katikiro of Bunyoro to make an appeal for order in the sazas, which he did with success &#x2026; We will go so far as to say that after the withdrawal of British Administration, it will be an impossible task for the Buganda Government to maintain law and order in Buyaga.</q>
Paragraph 90 contains these words:
<q>It is vain to hope that any improvement in social or economic services, or even a generous measure of internal self-government within Buganda, will mollify emotions so strongly felt.</q>
We know that national emotions are very high all over the world. There is a fear that these people, because of their national emotions, may find their outlet in some form of civil war, as has been said by one or two hon. Members.<br/>
It is very unwise of the Government to wash their hands in this very important matter. The Government are saying, "All right. You can have this referendum, but not when we are there to safeguard the position". There is, moreover, no certainty that the referendum will ever be held. Therefore, it is our task in the House to ensure that some Amendment is made to the Bill to try to safeguard the position.<br/>
Paragraph 157 of Cmnd. 1523 says:
<q>Bunyoro claims that historically a wide area in the western part of Buganda, comprising six counties, formed part of Bunyoro. that a large proportion of the population of the area are Banyoro, and that under Buganda's rule this section of the population has suffered discrimination. The area in question forms part of the territory of Buganda under the terms of the 1900 Uganda Agreement.</q>


There were six counties, and all that is in dispute now are the two counties, so there has been a very generous settlement on behalf of the Banyoro. Therefore, I suggest that we should ensure that their rights are entirely safeguarded in regard to the two counties under discussion.<br/>
Paragraph 158 says:
<q>The Munstar Commission emphasised the danger that other parts of Uganda might become involved in this long-standing dispute, and even foresaw that it might lead to civil war.</q>
The Munster Commission was looking at this matter only as a sideline; it was not its main object. Following this I presume that the Government were so worried that they agreed to send out another Commission made up of two Privy Councillors.<br/>
Paragraph 159 of Cmnd Paper 1523 says:
<q>The Secretary of State discussed the problem with His Highness The Kabaka of Buganda and R.A. The Omukama of Bunyoro. The Kabaka was unable to agree that a referendum should be held.</q>
If he was unable to agree then, what will be the pressure put upon the Government later not to have a referendum in the future?<br/>
The paragraph continues:
<q>The Secretary of State therefore suggested to the Conference that he should invite the Prime Minister to appoint a Commission of Privy Councillors to investigate the present position and to submit recommendations.</q>
We have had the Commission. Surely we sent it out because we could not get agreement before? We sent it to try to get some definite recommendations. We have now got the definite recommendations but we are ignoring them. It was useless to send out the Molson Commission if it was not the Government's intention to follow its recommendations. Therefore, in welcoming the Bill, I hope that we shall see that justice is done to some people who obviously the Government must have been worried about after the original conference, otherwise they would not have sent out the second Commission. I hope that ways will be found to write into the Bill some safeguards or, if for some technical reason this cannot be done&#x2014;my hon. Friend may tell me that it is not practical&#x2014;that some agreement will be drawn up between the parties concerned before independence inserting

a definite date for the referendum, so that, if that date is not adhered to, they can under the Constitution have the right of appeal to the Privy Council. I hope that ways will be found to protect these people of the lost counties. It would be not only for their benefit but I feel that in future we shall be very sorry if there is trouble there, because I think that we have been very weak on this occasion and not provided the proper safeguards for the people concerned.<br/>
After saying this, I should like to wish Mr. Obote and his Government every success in the coming years. We shall look forward to further co-operation between this country and Uganda and also between the four territories, Uganda, Tanganyika, Kenya and Zanzibar, I hope that these counties will form a very happy unit in the future.</p>

<p>I want to make only one or two remarks in support of the comments which have been made by my hon. Friends the Members for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall) and Plymouth, Devonport (Miss Vickers). Up to very recently it was commonly accepted in all parts of the House that the greatest danger to emerge in Africa was fragmentation and Balkanisation of the various countries. There were two ideas current at that time as to how the problem could best be coped with. Her Majesty's Government until comparatively recently leaned towards the view that the best way to prevent fragmentation was to pressurise the maximum degree of centralisation on the countries concerned and to resist, as far as possible, any tendencies towards tribalism or federalism appearing in the constitutions.<br/>
It is now fair to say that there has been a change of understanding about this problem, one aspect of which has been manifested in the case of Uganda. Only a few years ago this Government on the advice of those on the spot were strongly recommending a strong central unitary form of Government for Uganda as being the only one which could possibly suit the country. Now we hear precisely the apposite, but I am glad that it is thought that a federal form of Government is best for that territory. I hope therefore, that when the other remaining African countries, such as Kenya, have


their constitutional future considered we shall not again have to learn the painful lessons we have learned in Uganda.<br/>
The best way to prevent balkanisation in Africa, where tribalism is a reality, is to give to the various racial and tribal groupings&#x2014;which had loyalties long before the colonial Powers appeared on the scene 60 or 70 years ago&#x2014;sufficient grounds for believing that if they joined a central Government their own ways of life would be perpetuated, and that those groupings would not be under pressure to accept something they did not want. We are getting to the paradoxical position in East Africa that the more we allow federalism to develop the less chance there is of fragmentation taking place.<br/>
In the context of my earlier remarks, Toro is a magnificent tribute to what can be done if there is good sense on all sides, an understanding that economics demand some form of central authority and, at the same time, that one cannot ride roughshod over strong feelings which, Whatever we may feel about them, do exist in the smaller African areas. For instance, were we not to permit a degree of autonomy to Toro and the other kingdoms, there would not be a chance of a united Uganda emerging to independence in October.<br/>
I support what has been said by my two hon. Friends about Bunyoro. Some of us may regret that the Molson recommendations were not implemented, but I am realistic enough to appreciate that the day has passed when we could get a total reversal. Nevertheless, I cannot think why, if there is good faith, as I am sure there must be, on the part of Mr. Obote and the central Government, the suggestion made by my hon. Friends and myself that there should be a maximum time limit as well as a minimum one should not prove acceptable.<br/>
Unless it is proposed to delay indefinitely, there is no possible reason &#x2014;or, if there is, I do not know what it is, and I hope that my hon. Friend will enlighten me&#x2014;why a period of years cannot be fixed. I have no quarrel with the declaration of a minimum of two years&#x2014;it is probably a good idea to let things quieten down for a time&#x2014;but a period of not more than three years may prove too short.<br/>
I am interested to discover whether my hon. Friend will tell me that he will insert in the Declaration an amendment making the maximum period four years, or even five. If I hear that, I shall be content, as, I believe, will be the people of Bunyoro. I do not see any great risk of constitutional difficulties preventing that being done. As I said when I started, if there is a real determination to have a plebiscite in a given period, what possible objection can there be to showing good faith to the world by putting in a maximum as well as a minimum period?</p>

<p>I must apologise for coming in for this debate so late, but I was delayed by public duties elsewhere. I shall speak only briefly, but I can hardly let this debate pass without saying a few words, as I have taken a great interest in Uganda over a very long time, and on more than one occasion have raised matters affecting it in this House.<br/>
We all wish Uganda well, of course, though we all anticipate that it will not be one of the easiest countries to govern. Those who have taken an interest in Uganda's affairs over a period of years, recognise that there one has in a very acute form divisions caused by both tribal and religious differences, and one can only hope that the good sense and resilience of the people will be sufficient to see that the ship of state keeps afloat.<br/>
I wish that there had been a rather longer period of internal self-government before complete independence was granted. It is regrettable, though understandable, that, because other countries in East Africa were gaining independence, like Tanganyika, one should have speeded up in Uganda the process towards independence to such a pace. Obviously, we all desire independence, but to have internal self-government in March and complete independence in October causes me some doubts.<br/>
There has always been the argument &#x2014;we have had it in certain other territories, and we may have it again in, for example, British Guiana&#x2014;that if the point of complete independence is not reached, those persons concerned in the government of the territory will not bring themselves to face realities, but will all


the time be prepared to put some responsibility on Her Majesty's Government. I recognise the force of that argument, but March to October seems a very short period in which to put the full strain of responsibility of independence on persons who have had so little experience in the art of government.<br/>
That is no derogation whatever of the ability of those concerned&#x2014;I have great respect for Mr. Obote and his colleagues &#x2014;but government is not so simple as all that, and some experience of it would have been advantageous. However, that is now history. It is not often that we on this side complain of the Government being in too much of a hurry, but I think that in this case they have been.<br/>
I raised the very difficult and distressing problem of the dispute between Buganda and Bunyoro a number of years ago in the House. At that time one had the usual Government stalling &#x2014;that nothing really could be done; that the time was not opportune, and all the other clich&#x00E9;s one gets when raising such matters. As a result, that problem has been left as a very awkward legacy for the now Government. It has not been dealt with but, given more resolution and foresight on the part of Her Majesty's Government, it could have been dealt with in the past.<br/>
It is monstrous to have two Commissions and then to leave things as they are. I should have thought that the import of the Molson Commission's Report was definite and sensible. The Commission made a very careful study on the spot. It is quite right, as the hon. Lady the Member for Devonport said, that the Munster Commission had other matters to consider and that this particular dispute was only one part of the study it had to make, but the Molson Commission had only that as its terms of reference, and I find it very difficult to appreciate why Her Majesty's Government would not take a somewhat stronger line. One can recognise that it will be very difficult for Mr. Obote supported, as he is, by the Kabaka's party to do other than take the view of Buganda on this but, as things are, we shuffle off the responsibility for sorting this matter out.<br/>
I would assume that the Government's reason for not proposing to insert a final date for the referendum, but only a date

before which it shall not be held, is that they have some notion that the two counties should remain in perpetuity in charge of the central Government. If one is to have a date I should have thought that it would have been better to have it sooner rather than later, otherwise the people concerned will be left in a state of uncertainty, with the possibility of undesirable propaganda and intrigue occurring.<br/>
A limit of three, four or even five years has been suggested, but to adopt that would be unwise. If a decision is to be arrived at, the sooner the date the better, unless one is really aiming at having the two territories not included in either kingdom but having them remain as a sort of "Danzig corridor" indefinitely. I do not desire to make matters difficult by commenting further. I think that the people of Bunyoro have had a raw deal in this matter. As the weaker territory, they could have looked for greater support from Her Majesty's Government and we, the British Government, are failing to accept our responsibilities for something which does not go back to the mists of history, but only to the time when British rule was first established in Uganda.<br/>
We were parties, in the first instance, to this division. It is for that reason that we have a definite moral responsibility to see that the matter is sorted out before we give up any sort of trusteeship. I am deeply disappointed at the way this has turned out. I do not entirely blame the former Colonial Secretary for what has happened in the most recent negotiations, but I do blame the Administration in general for not having grasped this nettle more firmly earlier. We cannot now put right that omission of duty, but it would not be right if this Bill were passed without an expression of regret that this was not done.</p>

<p>I find on these occasions of independence that two of my most formidable critics are the two hon. Ladies the hon. Member for Flint, East (Mrs. White) and my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Miss Vickers). Before dealing with the wider questions that have been asked I will dwell on the matter of the dispute about the two counties.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. G. M. Thomson) elaborated the case, which was further elaborated by other hon. Members, that this was a dereliction of duty on the part of Her Majesty's Government. They stated that we should have forced acceptance by the people of Uganda of the recommendations of the Molson Report. What stood out clearly from the speech of the hon. Member for Dundee, East, and from the Conference, was that neither Uganda nor Bunyoro was satisfied with our decision.<br/>
Hon. Members have spoken of indecision on the part of the Government in this matter. If hon. Members really study the question they will see that a decision has been taken to take these two counties away and to put them under a neutral administration, the administration of the central Government. This decision was not well received by the Bunyoro delegation. It was equally ill received by the Buganda delegation and there has had to be a sacrifice by both sides.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East talked of a Kashmir situation developing, but it is precisely to avoid such a situation arising that we have taken the two counties away from the two participants in the dispute and have put them under the control of the central Government. The hon. Member for Devonport suggested that in the Constitution a minimum or maximum period before which there must be a referendum should have been laid down. I would make two points on this matter. First, paragraph 98 of Lord Molson's Report states that the idea of having a referendum within a short while is not practicable on security grounds. Secondly, when a country goes independent it really does go independent. Independence means independence and decisions as to when things like referendums should be held must be taken by the Government concerned.<br/>
The person or body to "carry the can" and to deal with this problem is the central independent Government of Uganda. I am sorry if I appear to be getting slightly vexed over this, but occasionally the tone of some hon. Members' speeches seems to suggest that when a country goes independent we still have some residual responsibility by which

we can exercise control. That is not what independence means.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is saying with some heat that decisions as to when a referendum shall or shall not be held must be left to the independent Government concerned. In this case, however, Her Majesty's Government are a party to the referendum on the question of when it shall not be held. Why should not the Government be an equal party, before surrendering their responsibilities, and create a time limit at the other end?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1962-07-16a.64.1" hansard_membership_id="4629" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29808" speakername="Mr. Fraser" colnum="64" time="">
<p>Because it is clear that if a referendum cannot be held now the time when it shall be held must be the decision of the central Government of Uganda. This is clear and necessary. It is the central Government which must deal with these matters. It is those who are responsible for running an independent territory who must decide on these matters. In fact, we have laid it down that when the central Assembly so decides, a referendum shall be held. I do not think that it is possible to ask Her Majesty's Government or the central Government of Uganda to go further at this stage, and on this I have the full support of the right hon. Member for West Bromwich (Mr. Dugdale).</p>

<p>Is it a fact that Her Majesty's Government have stipulated that a referendum shall not take place within two years?</p>

<p>Yes, but this has been stipulated with the agreement of the central Government and also on the ground that it would be improper and unlikely that there could be a peaceful referendum until there have been two years of orderly, independent government in these two counties.<br/>
The right hon. Member for West Bromwich and others raised the question of commodity price stabilisation. It should be remembered that at a time of falling markets this is a difficult thing to attain. Since the 1950s there have been arrangements by which the Uganda Government have put aside the money obtained from high cotton and coffee prices to meet these difficulties. But, alas, these funds are nearly exhausted. I agree that not only the British Government but Governments generally should


now consider this problem. Stabilising world commodity prices is not an easy matter. It is difficult enough when prices are rising, let alone in other circumstances. It is indeed a challenge to the West to see how we can cope with this problem.<br/>
When my right hon. Friend who has just ceased to be Colonial Secretary made his first speech in that office he referred even then to this problem. As Chancellor of the Exchequer he will now be in a better position to do something about it, and equally about the points raised in connection with the C.D.C. The House must know my views on this subject. They persist.<br/>
Regarding terminal obligations, as the House knows, there was a statement last March setting out what Her Majesty's Government could do. If my memory does not fail me, it was stated that a settlement of about &#x00A3;14 million was agreed with the Uganda Government. We hope, too, that, after independence, a technical assistance agreement will be negotiated.<br/>
One other point was raised by hon. Members on both sides of the House&#x2014; the question of the European expatriate civil servants. As hon. Members may know, a compensation scheme was introduced in March, 1962. One hon. Member referred to the adverse effect which past events in Tanganyika may have had on some of the civil servants in Uganda. Of course, such an adverse effect is to be deplored. The reports available at the end of May showed that slightly more than one-third of those concerned had given notice of their intention to retire, which, considering the problems involved, is not too bad.<br/>
I would draw the attention of the House to Mr. Obote's statement. He gave a solemn promise to all those in the service that their conditions of service would not be altered, adding that expatriates who decided to stay on would not be merely tolerated but would be most welcome. That is a statement which I know will give pleasure to the whole House.<br/>
In conclusion, I wish to apologise if I have not been able to meet my hon. Friends and the hon. Lady the Member for Flint, East on the question of the

lost counties. All will have been impressed by the burning pursuit of justice which is so rightly undertaken by hon. Members. Governments, alas, have to decide not on the question of expediency but on what is the course which will benefit the greatest number. I believe that had we taken the choice either of leaving matters as they were in the lost counties or of handing them over to Bunyono we should have been faced with the grave risk of civil war. Looking back at the history of Buganda, this is the one thing that we must seek to avoid.<br/>
The decision of the Secretary of State, which cannot be changed by alterations in the Bill and which met with neither the support of Bunyoro nor of Buganda, was a judgment, if not of a Solomon, then of a wise and courageous man and is, I think, the best thing we can do. We must leave it to the people of Uganda, with the good wishes of the House of Commons, to work out their own, I trust, successful, destiny.</p>

<p>As there axe other fishery Schemes and Orders to be con-sidered la-tar, I will not take up more of the time of the House than I need, but these are new Schemes which require some explanation. These Schemes, like the Schemes now in operation, make provision for grants by the White Fish Authority and the Herring Industry Board towards the cost of acquiring

new fishing vessels and engines. The Sea Fish Industry Act, 1962, authorises us to continue to make such Schemes for a further ten years. The main purpose of these Schemes is, therefore, to extend the assistance which would otherwise have expired under the old legislation. In other words, we needed new Schemes to fulfil this purpose.<br/>
The new Schemes make some important changes and I should like to say a word or two about these and why they are being made. Under this new Act grants can be made for distant water vessels and the limitation, which was imposed under previous Schemes, that grants could be given only for vessels up to 140 ft. in length, has, therefore, been removed. This is the first big difference. Then the Act has made it possible to remove the distinction which had hitherto been applied between working and non-working owners of inshore vessels, a distinction which led to difficulties and which we no longer think is justified. Up to now, under the old scheme, non-working owners have been able to get grants of only 25 per cent. for vessels instead of the 30 per cent. allowed to working owners, and this distinction, together with their not being able to get grants for engines, is now dropped. Non-working owners will be eligible in the same way as working owners.<br/>
The maximum amounts of grant have also been revised. New vessels under 80 ft. in length will still get a 30 per cent. grant but subject now to a higher maximum of &#x00A3;13,000&#x2014;it was &#x00A3;5,000 before&#x2014; and engines for such vessels up to a maximum of &#x00A3;2,500, which was &#x00A3;1,250 before. For vessels over 80 ft. in length&#x2014;and this includes the ones over 140 ft. as well&#x2014;grants of 25 per cent. will be available but up to a maximum of &#x00A3;50,000 instead of &#x00A3;37,500 as hitherto.<br/>
Another change made in the Scheme is that the period during which grants might become repayable if the conditions of the Scheme are broken has been reduced. This control period was 10 years under the 1953 Scheme but for vessels of 116 ft. in length or over under the 1955 Scheme it was increased to 20 years. The reason for this was to prolong the restrictions on voyages in the distant waters by these vessels, but since there


will be no such restrictions on vessels which will be built under this Scheme, there is no need to continue the control period for as long as 20 years and we are putting it back to the original 10 years.<br/>
The control period for engines is also being cut from 10 years to five years to relate it more closely to the actual life of the engine for which the grant is given. While on the subject of these restrictions I would add that the restrictions which at present apply to vessels built under the 1953 and 1955 Schemes are being dealt with under Section 31 of the new Act, not under these Schemes. Where these Schemes are concerned, vessels built under them will not have the restriction placed on them at the commencement of their life, as did those built under the old Schemes.<br/>
The present Schemes differ from their predecessors in that we have dropped the condition that applications can be entertained only in respect of vessels and engines built or to be built in the United Kingdom. This is, of course, the most controversial aspect, if not the only controversial aspect of these Schemes.<br/>
The basic purpose of these grants is to help the fishing industry to equip itself. This implies that owners should be able to buy the vessels that they need from the most efficient yards at the most favourable prices wherever these might be found. The question that the Government had to decide in making a new Scheme under the new Act was whether it would be right to write into the Scheme what was in the old one, a requirement to build only in home yards to get a grant or loan, which is plainly contrary to our international obligations. From the point of view of the fishing industry, which the Scheme is designed to help, there was clearly no case for it, and in relation to our international obligations, which are quite definite, we were going to put ourselves at a considerable disadvantage in arguing, as we often have to do, against discriminatory practices abroad if we were blatantly to prescribe one ourselves. This was highlighted when it came to the point of having to put in a new Scheme under the new Act.<br/>
As regards the trawler-building section of the shipbuilding industry, it will from now on be in the same competitive posi-

tion vis-&#x00E0;-vis, the trawler-building industry abroad as will the rest of the shipbuilding industry vis-&#x00E0;-vis, its competitors abroad. But it is not actually along these lines that the real criticism has come. There was real anxiety on two points. First, that the British trawler-building yards should have an opportunity of competing, and, secondly, that the competition should be on fair terms. I hope to be able to satisfy the House on both these points.<br/>
On the first point, the White Fish Authority will be directed to administer the Scheme in such a way that when an application is received for building a vessel abroad, the applicant will be required to obtain not less than three tenders from British yards, and the tenders will be based on the same specification. If any of the British tenders are lower than the foreign tenders, but the applicant still decides to build abroad, the grant will be related only to the amount of the British tender and no more.<br/>
On the second point of fair competition, what has worried hon. Members is that we should not grant aid orders placed with foreign yards which are subsidised by their own Governments. Let me assure the House that it is OUT firm intention to administer the Scheme so as to ensure, as far as is humanly possible, that grants are not given for boats built abroad in yards which can be shown to be in receipt of a material element of subsidy. This will be done by the White Fish Authority referring to Departments any proposal where they consider that on the basis of the tenders there is a good case for a grant to be given to a vessel which is to be built in a foreign yard. If the Ministry of Transport from the information available is satisfied that the foreign yard in question is receiving a material element of subsidy, the White Fish Authority will be so informed and will then tell the applicant that no grant will be given if he decides to go ahead with building the vessel in that foreign yard.<br/>
The points that I want to make to the House are that in our view it would have been wrong for the Government to have brought in a new Scheme which was in blatant contradiction to our international obligations, but that, on the other hand, we were determined to see


that we built safeguards into the way in which the Scheme will be operating, so that British yards will have the fullest opportunity to compete on fair terms. I believe that the Government's decision was perfectly justified and that the safeguards that we have included will ensure that what has been done in the interests of the fishing industry and within the framework of our international obligations will not prove to be detrimental to our shipbuilding industry. I trust that the House will give its approval to both Schemes.</p>

<p>We are grateful to the right hon. Gentleman the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for his explanation of this Scheme. We had some little doubt about who would give the explanation and we are pleased to see the right hon. Gentleman with us.<br/>
At the outset, I apologise for the non-attendance of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes), who is usually with us when we debate these matters. I am certain the House will be sorry to hear that he suffered a very sad bereavement during the weekend, and it is that which prevents him being with us.<br/>
This Scheme, in the main, changes the periods of time and the sums involved in previous Schemes, but, as the Minister said, it goes much further. The duration for repayment was determined by the change in the fishing grants, and because of the effect that this is having on a section of our fishing industry the Government have decided that there will be no limit on the number of sailings that will take place to grounds previously prohibited to the class of vessel covered by this Scheme.<br/>
We are concerned today with the proposal in this Scheme which will give to foreign shipyards subsidies previously reserved for shipyards in this country. We have many objections to this proposal. One objection is that this is the first time that this House has had an opportunity to discuss it. Secondly, we do not have freedom to amend this provision. Either we accept the Scheme as it stands, containing this provision, or we reject it, and by so doing we would

fail to provide fox ships built in this country. This puts the House of Commons in a very awkward position.<br/>
We are bound to express our feelings in this matter, because we had long discussions on the Measure out of which this Scheme arises and during the course of those proceedings the Government never once hinted that this alteration would take place. Indeed, in another place this proposal was rejected. The Government were incensed about this because, if the proposal had been allowed to stand, it would have come back to this House for discussion, but to prevent that happening the Government moved an Amendment to delete that proposal, restoring the Bill to its original state and depriving the House of Commons of the right to discuss this specific issue. We believed it to be a bit of sharp practice, and we still believe that to be the case.<br/>
We resented the fact that we in this House would be deprived of any opportunity of discussing the matter. We have been told that this will put British shipyards in line with foreign shipyards in the matter of competing for other classes of vessels. But the Minister has got the argument the wrong way round. Up to the present our shipyards have had the advantage of this subsidy. It is now proposed to take that advantage away from our shipyards and give it to the foreign shipyards, placing the foreign shipyards on the same basis as British shipyards for vessels built under this Scheme. That ought to be clearly understood; otherwise we shall get into difficulties in discussing this Scheme.<br/>
The Minister has argued that the Government have done this in order to conform to international agreements, and I am certain that he had in mind E.F.T.A. and G.A.T.T. But this is not so. The Secretary of State&#x2014;I refer to the departed Secretary of State, not the present one&#x2014;took part in a debate in this House on 8th June and made it perfectly clear that this alteration had not come about because of any representations by the owners or G.A.T.T. or E.F.T.A. Let me quote from his speech on 8th June. He said:
<q>It is true that, as yet, there has been no formal complaint against us under either the G.A.T.T. or the E.F.T.A. Convention in regard


to this matter."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th June, 1962; Vol. 661, c. 851.]</q>
Therefore, if the Minister seeks to found his case on these two conventions, I point out to him that neither G.A.T.T. nor E.F.T.A. made any such request to him. His case, so far as those two conventions are concerned, goes by the board.<br/>
These regulations have been in existence for many years. They were not produced merely a year or eighteen months ago. It is under these regulations that all this rebuilding of shipping is taking place, and without any complaint at all. What we wanted to know on 8th June, as a result of a Question which was put on the Order Paper, was who had complained against these regulations. The Secretary of State had to confess that he had received no specific complaint at all. All that the Minister has done this afternoon is to argue that it might have been possible to complain. I was on the point of calling him the Secretary of State. Of course, we do not know what he will be in an hour's time, but let me call him the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for the time being. The Minister has argued his case from the point of view that there has been some complaint from E.F.T.A. or G.A.T.T. and I am pointing out that there has been no such complaint at all.<br/>
The Minister said that, having agreed to do this, we ought to draft some rules so that the British shipbuilder would have a fair deal. He proposes to take three tenders from British yards and one from a foreign yard. Then he proposes to do something which he has been complaining about. He says that if we are going to conform to the E.F.T.A. and G.A.T.T. conventions it has got to be done on an equal footing. But he has just announced that we are going to differentiate between the countries. He says that we are going to tell the owner who orders a vessel that if he decides to take the vessel from a foreign shipyard and the price is greater than the British shipyard tenders, the White Fish Authority will differentiate and will say, "If you order from this foreign yard, you will be paid a subsidy less than the lowest British tender."<br/>
In fact, he is going to base his proportion of the subsidy on a price lower than would have been obtained by the

foreign shipbuilder if he had been successful. In other words, he is going to ignore the difference between the foreign tender and the British tender. It is not to be taken into consideration at all. Here is a differentiation that the Minister himself proposes to institute by his present proposal. This cannot be regarded as equal tendering. He himself is breaking the law, and breaking the agreement with G.A.T.T. and E.F.T.A.<br/>
I and my hon. Friends have opposed this proposal because at present one cannot say that British shipyards are so busy that they cannot cope with orders of this kind. But we find ourselves in a difficulty that if we reject the Scheme we are making it impossible for the grants and loans to be made to any trawler owner in the country. We think that the Government's proposal is iniquitous. We can only console ourselves with the thought this is a mere tampering with the fishing industry and that if we take all these Schemes together there is no solution. Perhaps our greatest consolation, in view of the present turmoil, is that we shall not have to put up with this Government much longer.</p>

<p>I hope that the House will forgive me for a rather inadequate voice. I speak on this Scheme only to ask the Minister to con-sider two short points. It has been said in relation to the grants that is it the Government's intention to make the fishing industry look for new grounds and go in for new methods of research in view of the troubles in Iceland, the Faroes and other places. The industry is only too ready to do this, but it considers that an unfair burden is imposed on the companies concerned in having to go in for some new experimental type of vessel and that the grants might therefore be increased. If such a vessel is being built, the Government could make things easier for the industry if they said that where there was a revolutionary type of vessel the industry would be given a slightly larger grant.<br/>
It is not in order now to go into the pros and cons of fishery protection, though I hope to be doing so later on. I would call attention, however, to the fact that the Cornwall Sea Fisheries Committee has built its own protection


vessel, and I would ask whether the Government could consider extending grants to the building of protection vessels by the fishery committees themselves.</p>

<p>I have great sympathy with what the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Hoy) said about the dilemma in which we are placed, in that we have to accept or reject the Scheme and there is no means by which we can amend it. Like the hon. Member, I was extremely anxious when we first heard of this new departure in the payment of subsidy to a vessel built in a foreign yard, but I was somewhat relieved by what my right hon. Friend had to say today about the safeguards which have been devised for the administration of the Scheme. I gather from my right hon. Friend's statement that it is difficult to see how these vessels will be built abroad in future.<br/>
The prime reason for my speaking to the Scheme is that I should like my right hon. Friend, or whoever replies to the debate, to clear up one point. My right hon. Friend said that the White Fish Authority will look at each transaction and will take into consideration any material element of subsidy which it may discover in any foreign yard when the three British yards have submitted their quotations and the price asked by the foreign yard is less. My point is not about the question of direct physical subsidy by the sovereign State to the foreign yard but whether it will be considered by the British Government as a direct subsidy if in future the position which arose in Germany, as implemented by Dr. Schacht, occurs again.<br/>
This is the position where there is a blocked currency and certain facilities are provided whereby that currency can be used to have a vessel built in a certain yard. In practice, nothing could be a greater subsidy than that. This was why a great deal of business flowed into the yards at Hamburg whan Dr. Schacht introduced it in the Reichstag by promoting the Sperrmark. I want to feel satisfied that if there were such circumstances this would be considered by the White Fish Authority and by the Ministry as a definite subsidy to the yard.<br/>
I should also like to echo what the hon. Member for Leith said about the hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes). I am sure that the whole House very much regrets that one more difficulty has confronted the hon. and learned Member, for whom so many of us have very sincere affection.</p>

<p>These Schemes are the result of a Measure which we have spent so much time in discussing during the last seven months. Perhaps the Minister now realises that the surreptitious way in which he brought forward the contentious proposal of subsidies to vessels built in foreign shipyards was a mistake on his part. I know that he and his ex-colleague, the Secretary of State for Scotland up till a short time ago, tried to justify it by reference to our international obligations. In the rather curtailed debate which we had on the subject we heard an explanation to that effect from the former Secretary of State.<br/>
But we have still been left without a satisfactory explanation why the proposal was announced to the House on a Friday by means of a Written Answer to a Question when there was no opportunity for us to probe the matter by means of supplementary questions. It has been left until now for us to receive from the right hon. Gentleman information about the safeguards which he says have been worked out to maintain the productivity of British shipyards in the face of foreign competition. I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman has treated the House at all fairly. We are entitled to know more about it.</p>

<p>I should like to make one point clear. It was on 18th May that I announced this in a Written Answer to a Question. The timing of that was in order to tell the House as soon as possible before anything leaked out, because consultations had had to take place beforehand. I was very well aware that Oral Questions to me at Question Time would not be reached in the immediate future. In fact, after 18th May, Questions to me for Oral Answer were not reached until 2nd July. Had I waited until then it would have been much too late to inform the House. It is quite a natural way to give by this method an outline to the House of what


is decided, and then the House is the right and proper place to have a debate upon it. I was anxious to give the House as long a notice as possible about it.</p>

<p>With all respect to the right hon. Gentleman and his intentions, that is not really satisfactory. It so happened that, on the day before that, there was the Second Reading in another place. The announcement which appeared on the Friday could have been made in another place on the day before. There could not have been all that importance in its being held over for one day. Furthermore, as the right hon. Gentleman knows&#x2014;he has been on the Front Bench long enough, perhaps too long&#x2014;the following Monday after the Friday when he made his announcement was his day for replying to Questions in the normal way.<br/>
I am quite sure that Mr. Speaker would not have objected if the right hon. Gentleman had asked permission to answer a Question which was so lowly placed on the Order Paper that it would not be reached in the ordinary course. This has been done many times. Ministers have asked permission to make statements in reply to Questions not reached because they wanted to give the House the fullest possible information.<br/>
It is quite obvious that the right hon. Gentleman did not want to give the House full information. He wanted to slide the thing through by means of a surreptitious Written Answer to a Question on the Friday so that the matter would go through without being subjected to any question from either side of the House. There are many hon. Members on both sides who have been uneasy about this, as the Minister must be well aware. However, I do not wish to pursue it further. The Minister knows out view about it. He knows that he has acted very badly. Although he has been trying his best to remedy the situation, he has not succeeded very well.<br/>
The terms and conditions which the Minister read out seem to me to be satisfactory. They seem to help to put the matter in a better way than appeared when it was first outlined to us, but I want to know whether those terms and conditions emanated only from his own Department and the Scottish Office or ware formulated in consultation and

agreement with the shipping interests in this country.<br/>
After the storm broke over the original announcement, we were told that the shipping interests had had an interview with the right hon. Gentleman and the Minister of Transport and that they had gone away partly satisfied at the sympathetic response which they had received. I want to know whether the terms and conditions which the Minister read out today are the result of those consultations and the shipping interests are satisfied with them, or whether they are only the result of his own fruitful mind and are being foisted upon the shipping industry without agreement.</p>

<p>I apologise to you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, and to the House for not being in my place at the start of the debate. I was unavoidably delayed.<br/>
At the outset, I associate myself with all hon. Members who have expressed sympathy with the hon. and learned Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Hector Hughes) in his recent bereavement. The hon. and learned Gentleman has had a very rough time lately. We can only hope that it is of some comfort to him to know that hon. Members on both sides of the House are thinking of him at this difficult time.<br/>
I do not intend to go again over all the arguments which were used during the Adjournment debate on the question whether these grants and loans should be extended to vessels built in foreign yards. Since that time, I have done my best to pursue the matter by Question to try to clarify some of the points which did not seem at all clear. I feel no happier about the matter now than I did at the beginning. I was not at all happy about the way the matter was introduced, but, above all, I do not consider that any clear or satisfactory explanation has been given to the House of why, at this moment, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade suddenly appeared to be so very important.<br/>
Since the end of the war, we have had many white fish and herring industry Bills before the House. The excuse given has been that, because this is a new Measure, now an Act, we could not continue the same arrangements having


regard to our obligations under the G.A.T.T. As I understood it, the reason always given hitherto for why we made no change was balance of payments difficulties, not our obligations under the G.A.T.T. I should have thought that this, of all times, was not the time suddenly to imply that the balance of payments difficulty is entirely remedied.<br/>
As regards the safeguards, I understand from some of the shipping interests in the Port of Aberdeen that people are a good deal happier about the arrangements since the consultations with the Ministry of Transport, but one has to remember that these consultations came not before but after the announcement. This still does not meet the point of principle that, while no one objects to a British owner building abroad if he wishes to do so in order to obtain specialised gear or new skills, people feel very strongly about an owner being virtually encouraged to do so with the British taxpayers' money.<br/>
This encouragement is being given at a time when the British shipbuilding industry is in acute difficulty. Had this arrangement been made at a time when owners have to wait two or three years to place orders in yards in this country because they were full, one might, perhaps, have thought rather differently about it. Even so, I still feel that the subsidy arrangements should, in the end, be directed to ships being built in this country.<br/>
We have not even tried to apply for a waiver under the G.A.T.T. It is a fact that the Canadians subsidise their shipping to the tune of 40 per cent. and the Australians do it to the tune of 33 per cent. So far as I am aware, it is not intended to make any formal protest under the G.A.T.T. that these Common-wealth countries are making these subsidies available for ships built in our yards; nor do I suggest that we should do so. But I do feel that it will be extremely difficult to find out what are comparable rates of subsidy in the countries concerned.<br/>
When there was an inquiry into ship-building practices a little time ago, it was said that it was almost impossible to assess what were called comparable degrees of subsidy when one took into

account hidden tax turnovers or other financial arrangements which might exist in other yards. I do not think that we have been given a satisfactory explanation.</p>

<p>It is not a question of whether it is comparable or not comparable as an element of subsidy. The question is whether there is any material element of subsidy, in other words, any visible and outward element, something one can judge as an element of subsidy. It is not a question of making difficult comparisons in the degree of subsidy as between one country and another. The question is whether there is a material element of subsidy in the country which has submitted the tender. This is the matter for judgment, and the difficulty of judging comparability of subsidy&#x2014; this is not really our subject in agriculture and fisheries, but I am sure that it must be difficult&#x2014;really does not come into this matter.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister who is to reply to the debate will explain how one will assess what is material. What is a material element of subsidy? Who is to decide what is material and what is not? I hope that the word "material" will be defined when the reply is given.<br/>
It has been known for very long, ever since the end of the war, that we had these obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Why was not an announcement made to the House when the Sea Fish Industry Bill was first put before Parliament? If the reason for this change is that it had to be made under a new Bill, we should have known about it at the start of the Bill instead of just before it was about to receive the Royal Assent. That being so, I still remain profoundly unsatisfied.<br/>
Since we are talking about general agreements on tariffs and trade, I hope that the Minister will start negotiating with the European Economic Community about the fishing industry. In answer to a Question which I tabled the other day, I was told by my right hon. Friend the Lord Privy Seal that negotiations on this subject had not yet begun. Perhaps my right hon. Friend, when he winds up, will give us some idea of what will happen under this heading.</p>

<p>In spite of what the Minister may say, it is clear that the way in which this matter was handled was quite disgraceful and not worthy of a Government which had the courage to face up to what they believed. Obviously the Government tried to man&#x0153;uvre this through in an underhand fashion, hoping to escape criticism which might come from various quarters. In other words, it was a cowardly thing to do and was not worthy of a Government which could call themselves a Government. I am beginning to think that this Government could not call themselves a Government. Even the Prime Minister thinks that, and he is trying to rectify the situation at the moment, I understand.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweeds-muir) that we are not satisfied about this matter. We must ask ourselves what injury will be done to the shipbuilding industry as a result of the proposal to subsidise ships built in foreign yards. I do not know what estimate is made of that, but if it is in any way substantial, then what the hon. Lady said was right and the Government should have applied for a waiver. I understand that this is a common thing to do and that it is a safeguarding provision in most international agreements. Even countries in the Common Market can apply for a waiver in respect of certain things which are likely to have serious repercussions on certain industries in those countries.<br/>
This proposal will have a serious effect on some of the smaller shipbuilding firms. We should bear in mind that most of the shipbuilders affected by this proposal are situated in the smaller ports. Therefore, we are doing injury to districts least able to bear it. If the burden falls on larger firms situated in larger ports, obviously its effect is not as great as it is a smaller industry based in a smaller port. This proposal will have a certain significance, particularly in Scotland, as the Undersecretary of State knows. I do not know whether he is still Under-Secretary of State, but for the moment I shall assume that he is. It is obvious that there will be considerable concern about this proposal.<br/>
A number of the smaller ports and smaller yards are situated in districts,

particularly in Scotland, where there is already high unemployment and which tend to lose their populations. In these circumstances, the Government should have thought very much more seriously than apparently they did before agreeing to this proposal and before deciding not to apply for a waiver. They could not have thought very seriously about it if they did not consult the interests concerned prior to taking the action. Any Government should find out what will be the effect before taking action. In Scotland, the effect could be very harmful to an economy which is already struggling to recover from blow after blow delivered by the Government.<br/>
For these reasons, I remain most dissatisfied with this proposal. If it were possible to vote against it without voting against the general scheme of grants for vessels and engines, I should do so, but, as has been said, this is not possible. If we did vote against it, we should be voting against the fishing industry and against the legitimate subsidies to which it is entitled to enable it to face the problems of the future. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Hoy), I register my vigorous protest against the Government's action.</p>

<p>I understand that when this Scheme of grants and loans began there were in Scotland thirty-five yards able to build boats under them. The number of these yards has now been reduced to nineteen because of the contraction of the industry. It is against that background that those engaged in the shipbuilding industry look at these proposals.<br/>
While I appreciate the difficulties in which my right hon. Friends find themselves in keeping faith with their international obligations, it is true that we are very busy at the moment trying to formulate new agricultural subsidy schemes which might be applicable if we joined the Common Market. Surely there would be opportunities to apply ourselves in exactly the same way in respect of the fishing industry.<br/>
If I heard my right hon. Friend aright, he said that if comparable tenders from English yards and from foreign yards are obtained and one of the British tenders is the lowest, the subsidy would


still be paid to a foreign yard on the basis of the lowest English tender. That seems to me to be an odd arrangement. If the tenders are comparable and if the boats which it is proposed to build are similar, why should British taxpayers' money go to the foreign yard, for some obscure reason? Perhaps I misheard what my right hon. Friend said, but I should like to be enlightened on that point. While we can welcome almost all the provisions in this Scheme, it is very difficult, in the present economic circumstances of the country, to see that it is right for us to make our money available to foreign shipbuilders.</p>

<p>Like my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir), I apologise to my right hon. Friend the Minister for not being here at the beginning of his statement. I hope that he will accept my apology.<br/>
I, too, wish to comment on the way that this matter has been handled. I hope that my right hon. Friend will forgive me if I point out that I know that he has not always been Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but for a long time we have found ourselves in some difficulty when discussing fishing interests. We have discussed them in the middle of the night. It took many very firm representations to get a debate at an appropriate time of day.<br/>
We never seem able to get from my right hon. Friend's Department the interests of the industry stated in terms which give one any confidence that fishing is considered just as important as agriculture in his Department. That is why I feel extremely perturbed.<br/>
I want to follow one or two of the points which have been raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South. I want to know whether both the shipping interests and the British Trawlers' Federation had got agreement with my right hon. Friend before the statement was made in that most unsatisfactory way on Friday, 18th May. I do not think that the British Trawlers' Federation had tied up the points to make the position satisfactory to them. I should like to know whether they are satisfied.<br/>
My right hon. Friend worsened his position when he jumped in to answer my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South about the position of material or comparable subsidies. Had he left the matter where it was, he would have been in a much better position at the end of what he had to say.<br/>
The difficulty over this whole matter always comes from the fact that we never seem to have the right Minister at the right moment. Ministers shuffle about and when one wants to make remarks concerning subsidies to ship-buiilding yards abroad compared with this country&#x2014;a matter which is pertinent to the Scheme&#x2014;one has to deal with the Minister of Agriculture, who really does not know much about shipbuilding or its problems.</p>

<p>The House always enjoys a Parliamentary joke. I am serious on this matter, and when I use the word "shuffle" I am talking not about the present shuffle but about the problems we have to face in our indus-itry, which seems to be divided between two Ministers. It always seems to be the wrong Minister who comes to answer the points.<br/>
I do not think that my right hon. Friend's answer about material and comparable subsidies was at all a good one. When my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport decided to have an investigation into shipbuilding and the reason for our losing orders, he appointed a distinguished body of chartered accountants to look into the matter. If I remember aright, when they reported my right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport came to the conclusion that in the case of subsidies, tax reliefs, or whatever they were, it was not possible to get to the bottom of what was happening abroad.<br/>
It did not matter whether the word "material" or "comparable" was used. The fact was that there was no answer to the investigations that my right hon. Friend had ordered. I do not mind which of the two words it is. What I


want to know is how we are to know whether we are on equal terms in the tenders that are submitted. I do not know whether my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would like to send for his right hon. Friend the Minister of Transport to give his version of this, but it is an extremely important matter.<br/>
When a situation such as we are discussing today arises, I always become very suspicious. It seems to me most extraordinary that, suddenly, G.A.T.T. and our obligations under it are blown up into an enormous balloon when nobody has mentioned them before. I have a shrewd suspicion that pr&#x00D2;bably the Foreign Office&#x2014;here is another Government Department coming into the matter&#x2014;has felt that unless we get ourselves, if we can, into an absolutely sound position so that we cannot be challenged, it will be difficult for us when we discuss the position of the fishing industry in the European Common Market. That is my explanation of why, suddenly, my right hon. Friend 'has come forward with the reason for producing this new Scheme and the terms that will be imposed in connection with grants and loans.<br/>
That emphasises once more what my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South said. As far as I can make out, we have not approached the matter of fishing in the context of the Common Market. One cannot expect the fishing industry to feel any great confidence in any Minister&#x2014;I include the whole lot&#x2014; unless we know that its interests are just as much in the minds of our Ministers as agriculture and other matters which have a great deal more steam behind them in the country than (hose of us who try to represent the fishing interests.<br/>
It must be clear to everybody that the future of the fishing industry as a whole is under great threat from all sorts of interests. I hope, therefore, that when my right hon. Friend replies to the debate he will let me and the House know specifically at what stage those who are entitled to be consulted were consulted, on what date they agreed that the action which my right hon. Friend has implied by the Scheme satisfied them, and whether they have any outstanding questions which they want settled. I should also like to know whether the

shipbuilding interests feel that with this Soheme their interests are being safeguarded.<br/>
Will my right hon. Friend make a note &#x2014;and put it in the file of the Department in case he does not stay there very 'long&#x2014;that in future it would be more helpful to those of us who are interested in the fishing industry if the Department appeared to give greater consideration to those who have to earn their livelihood toy the industry? It is obvious that those people feel that agriculture is of greater interest to Parliament; that it carries a great deal more implications and problems I fully realise. We have the right to expect, however, that if it is the decision of any Government to add fisheries to the responsibility of the Minister of Agrioulture, we are entitled to have as much consideration and interest given to our problems and difficulties as to agrioulture. It is on this aspect that I feel most strongly.<br/>
Whenever I have attended a fishing debate, nearly everybody has been unanimous and united against the Minister. It always happens that way. Perhaps my right hon. Friend can answer my questions specifically and in future, please, let us have a little more attention directed to this very important industry.</p>

<p>I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth (Dame Irene Ward) was entirely fair when making a comparison between the time devoted in this House to agriculture and fisheries.

<p>When I think of the time occupied by agriculture during the past year and compare it with the time occupied by fishing, I might be justified, speaking as a farmer, in saying that agriculture has not had enough consideration and that fishing has had too much. I make no bones about saying this, 'because I am certain that it will not be misunderstood by my friends in the fishing industry, who often tell me that they


are amazed by the amount of time that we devote to the fishing industry.<br/>
This debate today has really nothing to do with the fishing industry at all but is really much more concerned with the shipbuilding industry. I want to try if I can to prick this balloon my hon. Friend talks about as being blown up. I want to try to prick it because I think we have got to get this in the right proportions, and this, to me, is a comparatively small matter.<br/>
In the last few years a large number of ships have been built under the grants and loans Scheme for trawlers of under 140 ft. in length. No trawlers over 140 ft. in length have incurred a grant or loan. They are now eligible under this Scheme for the first time. Since the war, 70 vessels of over 140 ft. have been built, incurring no subsidy, and out of those 63 have been built at home and seven have been built abroad. One of those built abroad was the "Lord Nelson", and it was built abroad for the specific reason that no British shipyard was capable of building at that time a stern trawler. I do not think this reflects very well on the management of British shipyards.<br/>
Under this Scheme, we shall be allowing vessels of over 140 ft. to be built and also the continuation of the Scheme for vessels of under 140 ft., and I think we have to be frank: there will not be many more vessels of under 140 ft., from 80 ft. to 120 ft., built under the Scheme. Already the White Fish Authority has stopped building them at Lowestoft and Aberdeen. I think it is probably now doing the same in other ports as well. The fact is that the middle-water and the near-water fleet is not going to increase in size, and any building which goes on will be extremely limited. Therefore, to say that we are going to deny our shipyards the right to build ships because of the action which the Government have now taken is not really true.<br/>
When we consider the big ships, we are again concerned with comparatively small numbers, and the majority of them obviously will continue to be built at home, but I think the fishing industry has the right if it can to obtain competitive tenders on fair terms to build its ships abroad.<br/>
I come back to the "Lord Nelson". I am quite certain, knowing them, that the owners would have much preferred to have found a British shipyard capable of building that ship.</p>

<p>When my hon. Friend says that the "Lord Nelson" was a ship that could not be built in a British yard, he will recall, will he not, the "Fair Try" and also the "Junella", which has only just left Aberdeen, having been built at Aberdeen?</p>

<p>I am dealing with the shipbuilding industry because I think it is very important that it should face up to the facts of life. I have criticised the management of the shipyards. I want to criticise the trade unions as well. The sooner the shipbuilding industry as an industry realises that it cannot afford to have either bad management or restrictive practices in the industry the better and quicker it will be able to compete with foreign yards on its own terms, and then there will be no need to worry at all about ships being built abroad, because they will be built at home.<br/>
I think the Minister is perfectly right in taking this decision. After all, how can we expect other countries to play fair with us, and complain that they are using underhand methods, if we do not play fair with them? I think the terms are fair and it is up to the shipbuilding industry to make certain it can compete. I am quite confident that now it can compete and I hope that it will take this lesson to heart. I think everybody concerned is satisfied by recent efforts that it should be able to compete, and it has appalled me that we should have heard such nonsense talked, and I hope the industry will from now on behave in the way it should.</p>

<p>I hope that, on reflection, the hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior) will regret the discordant note that he has struck in the debate. I wish to assure the right hon. Gentleman that I do not intervene to cause him any discomfort and I hope from seeing him sitting so firmly on the Front Bench that he is happily installed there and that that appearance is not misleading. I do


not wish to discuss the fishing industry, but to pursue the debate we have had about shipbuilding.<br/>
This is what has caused anxiety in a Scheme which, I am sure, otherwise would have been generally welcomed by the House. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, over the past few years I have consistently expressed a good deal of anxiety about this great industry. No one can deny, however material this may be, that the industry will be at a disadvantage when this Scheme comes into force, compared with the position which it enjoyed before it came into force. I do not think that anybody can deny that.<br/>
What I find very difficult to understand is: who thought of imposing this disadvantage on the shipbuilding industry? I was fortunate enough to hear the debate on the day before we began the Whitsun Recess. It was quite clear to me that the former Secretary of State was not responsible for it. I have heard the lucid explanation of the right hon. Gentleman, who made it plain that he was not responsible. What I should like to know is: who is responsible, because a guess has been made that it may have been a civil servant in the Foreign Office? My guess is that it could easily have been done by a civil servant in the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, who, rather than resort to doodling, turned his mind to G.A.T.T. and E.F.T.A.<br/>
I object to this, as I have objected before. I object to government by men from Whitehall. It is quite clear from the way that this has been presented. We had no debate in Standing Committee, and there was no debate when we had the Second Reading in another place. It is clear that this was not a political decision, but it is a matter with very real political implications and repercussions. I do not think that we should go on tolerating this government by men sitting in the obscurity of the third room back. I think that it might be a good idea if they were brought to the Bar of the House. It would be very interesting to see the people who really are our effective rulers.<br/>
Here is a case where it has been made quite clear, from the embarrassment which Ministers have suffered since this matter has become the focus of political attention, that it was not a matter about<br/>
which the full political implications were considered before it was done. It was done by some George Washington type of official in a Ministry&#x2014;we are not even sure which one it was.<br/>
What is quite clear is that the fishing industry has not made representations to any Department about this. That is quite clear. I am not talking about consultation, but no initiative came from the fishing industry about this. This is important, because the right hon. Gentleman put this in the context of providing greater opportunity of choice to the fishing industry in obtaining new vessels. The industry has not asked for this, and I am not very impressed by his talking about a working party and about further arrangements through the Authority and the Ministry of Transport.<br/>
In fact, freedom of choice will be seriously limited. We are to have this reference to the Authority and to the Ministry of Transport. As I say, I do not want to trespass on the fishing industry, but I know from personal knowledge that some members of the fishing industry have expressed their concern about this and, that, contrary to what the right hon. Gentleman said, have asked to be assured that there will not be unnecessary interference with specifications. It is clear that no initiative came from the fishing industry. It is equally clear that there was no consultation with the shipbuilders until after the decision was taken.<br/>
As has previously been said, the industry is facing very grave difficulties. We have been given figures relating to the east coast of Scotland. In the earlier debate the hon. Member for Maidstone (Mr. J. Wells) gave figures&#x2014;they were accepted by the Government Front Bench&#x2014;to show that the number of men employed in the fishing vessel and boatbuilding industry had been halved in the last twelve months. We cannot lightly put this on one side. Although it might be a minor aggravation in other circumstances, this decision can be really serious for people in an industry as badly hit as this one.<br/>
We surmise that the difficulty relates to G.A.T.T. and E.F.T.A., but we have had no reply to the question persistently put to the right hon. Gentleman: why do this? I do not know what discussions the right hon. Gentleman has had with


the Minister of Transport, but shipping all over the world is riddled by subsidies. It may be for this reason that no representations have been made to us. The former Secretary of State told us in the previous debate that no formal complaints had been made. I do not know whether a change of Government would affect the position, but if a complaint were made in present circumstances presumably there would be discussions about balance of payments factors.<br/>
It is important to realise the purpose of the white fish and herring subsidies. We considered this as a broad national question. It is not unrelated to defence. The position of trawlers and small vessels was borne in mind when we considered generally whether the industry should be aided. These are factors which we should still bear in mind. It is not good enough for the former Secretary of State to say that it may well be that a few orders will go abroad. If orders go abroad, they will be for the large and expensive vessels.<br/>
I should like the Minister to say something more about his discussions with the Minister of Transport. I mention the question of the trawlers and fishing boats in the national context not only as fishing vessels, but as part of our way of life and of our national defence. But think what is happening when we look around our coasts. There are 200 or more smaller ports in desperate difficulty. We have the plight of coastal shipping and the plight of the smaller shipbuilding yards.<br/>
This is something which affects our position as a country. It seems to me that it is something which has been entirely neglected by the right hon. Gentleman in taking this decision&#x2014;entirely neglected in the sense that we are talking about, of utilising the natural resources near our shores. We cannot do this without not only fishermen but boat-builders, too. Also, generally, as an island, we have continually to think about defence.<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman had discussed this with the Minister of Transport, surely the Minister of Transport would have said, "I am perplexed and sorely worried about the whole business. The Rochdale Committee is looking into the matter of the ports, and I am await-

ing its advice. It is a matter of concern to us if the smaller yards are knocked out." Indeed, we may reach the position where the fishing industry may be driven to order abroad.<br/>
The main theme which has run through our debates on shipbuilding during the past few years has been the increasing volume of tonnage built abroad for British owners. The last returns from Lloyd's showed that we had reached the staggering total of 750,000 tons of construction in foreign yards for registration by British owners. Under the present Government we have become what we have never previously been&#x2014;a net importer of new shipping. We appear in Lloyds List as the largest importer of new shipping in the world. I should have thought that this would have upset and concerned the Minister of Transport. I should have thought that against that background he would not lightly take any step which might be thought to show lack of concern for the position which is arising in world shipbuilding.<br/>
This is a very odd moment to consider this Scheme. It is only a few weeks since the Minister of Transport said that while he was concerned about the volume under construction abroad, he was pleased to learn that the orders placed abroad had been reduced to a trickle. Just at the moment when public attention has been drawn to the problem and shipowners are responding the Government say, "We do not mind if a few orders go abroad which otherwise might not have done so." I should have thought that this was just the moment not to take any such action. While I appreciate what the Minister has said and accept his good faith&#x2014;that we will try as best we can to ensure that orders do not go to yards which are subsidised and that this is more than has been said previously&#x2014;I join hon. Members who have said that this is a task which the Minister will not accomplish.<br/>
We had a firm of accountants investigating this, and they told us, in effect, that they could not advise us about the question of subsidies. The Minister of Transiport spent the last Summer Recess visiting yards, and told us that he could find no evidence of subsidy. But we know that subsidisation takes place. There are subsidies in France and Italy, and we know that, when need arises,


subsidy is given to German yards. However, it is very difficult to find the subsidy. Some yards, for instance, are given grant in aid instead of the State incurring expenditure on unemployment benefit. How can one trace this to the construction of a vessel?<br/>
Throughout our debates on shipbuilding we have had all the arguments about the difference between the credit facilities provided for foreign yards compared with what is made available for our yards. I should think that the right hon. Gentleman would be unable to get any assistance from the Ministry of Transport on these matters. It is clear from our debates that the Ministry of Transport would say that they were not in a position to determine&#x2014;apart from the most obvious cases&#x2014;whether or not there had been subsidy.<br/>
I join my hon. Friends in complaining about this matter. We cannot oppose it, because it is only one part of the Scheme. We cannot amend it. However, I hope that the Minister will recognise that there is a great deal of anxiety about this provision and that everyone who is affected by it and concerned with it is convinced that it is unnecessary. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will assure the House that he will keep it very well informed of any orders which are placed abroad by virtue of this Scheme. I hope that he will confirm that the assurances that he gave us in opening the discussion will be fully honoured and implemented and that if he feels any difficulty or embarrassment in finding out whether the orders have gone to subsidised yards, as we believe they will do, he will not hesitate about amending the Scheme.</p>

<p>I believe that the main point in our discussion today related to the question of making grants available for vessels and engines built abroad. Certainly, the subject has not lacked discussion.

<p>The hon. Gentleman had better get it right. I did not say that at all. If an opportunity was given our thanks are due to Mr. Speaker, and not to the Government, that I was successful in securing an Adjournment debate. I said that this House could not make a decision on the issue of whether a subsidy ought to be extended to these foreign shipyards. That right has been denied to the House up to the present, and, in fact, it has been denied to the House tonight.</p>

<p>I do not quarrel with what the hon. Member said. I was saying that the whole question has been discussed before now. I make no complaint about the fact that we are discussing it more fully on this occasion. That is as it should be.<br/>
As was explained on a previous occasion, it is the Schemes and not the enabling legislation which hitherto have contained the requirements that grant-aided vessels or engines should be built in the United Kingdom. That requirement is not included in the Schemes which we are asking the House to approve tonight. Therefore, it is proper that the omission should be discussed. What I have said is the answer to the hon. Member for Leith who suggested &#x2014;echoing the discussion in another place on 26th June&#x2014;that this House had been deprived of its constitutional night to take an effective decision on the matter.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman suggested that had there been something in the Bill, or if the absence of any requirement to build in this country had been drawn to the attention of the House when the Bid] was being discussed, an Amendment could 'have been moved and a decision taken on the question of foreign building. Whereas, as things are now, that cannot be done, since, as has been said rightly, the House cannot amend the Schemes. It can either accept or reject them as they are.<br/>
As my right hon. Friend explained on 8th June, the requirement about grant-aided vessels or engines being British built has never been included in the enabling legislation. It has always been part of the Schemes. We did not in any way seek to conceal anything by not detailing with the point in the Bill. We were simply following precedent. It has always been a matter for the Schemes and a matter for debate when the Schemes came up for approval as is being done tonight. I have said to the hon. Gentleman that we are faced tonight with a situation in which it is not possible to amend the schemes. They must either be accepted or rejected.</p>

<p>Surely, if the Government had made an announcement at the time when the Bill was being discussed in the Standing Commititee an Amendment or a new Clause could have been moved which would have enabled us to take a vote upon the matter.</p>

<p>That may well be so. I am saying that precedent has been that this matter has come up in connection with the Schemes rather than the legislation. Year after year that has been the case.<br/>
What I think more important is that we should deal with the merits of the question. I hope that the hon. Member for Leith will not mind if I say that I cannot allow to pass unchallenged his statement that these are subsidies to foreign shipyards. They are not. They are subsidies to our fishing industry in order that those in the industry may equip themselves. There is no question of these grants being given to shipbuilders abroad, or to shipbuilders in this country either, for that matter.<br/>
I have listened carefully to what has been said this evening, and I do not think that anything new has emerged which would lead me to believe the Government decision to be wrong. Plainly, the present requirement that grant-aided vessels or engines must be built in the United Kingdom is a breach of our international obligation. The hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) raised the point that in the past we may have been in breach of our international obligation, but that we have done nothing about it. The point is that having become aware of this fact&#x2014;</p>

<p>I cannot say whether we have or not, but if the occasion does arise we shall be in a position to make representations to other Governments, whereas if we ourselves were in default in a matter of this kind we could not do so. I feel strongly that we must put our own house in order, especially if we are now to embark on this new series of Schemes.<br/>
As my right hon. Friend said when winding up the debate on 8tlh June, we do not believe that the removal of the Britisih-built condition will result in any substantial number of boats being built abroad. We believe that British shipyards are in general efficient and should be able to hold their own in fair competition with foreign yards. I thought that point was made very well by my hon. Friend the Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior).<br/>
The hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey) talked about the plight of our shipbuilding yards. We on this side believe that they are competitive, that they are efficient and that they will be able to compete. I must again make clear to the House that this subsidy is a subsidy to the fishing industry and not a subsidy to the shipbuilding industry. If we wanted to subsidise the shipbuilding industry we certainly would not have done it in this way.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Lowestoft made the point that the distant water owners until now have had no grants yet one-tenth of the 70 or so vessels they have built during the last ten years have been built abroad. In other words, only seven of those 70 have been built abroad. On a number of occasions that was for special reasons in regard to the type of vessel and on others it was because delivery dates offered by British yards were much longer than they are now. For the smaller vessels we believe the links between fishermen and builders should be closer.<br/>
There are all sorts of reasons why a fisherman should prefer to have his boat built in a local yard always provided that our own yards are reasonably competitive on price and quality The only real danger would be if our yards were exposed to unfair competition from foreign yards heavily subsidised by their Governments. I repeat the categorical assurance given by my right hon. Friend on 8th June and given again today by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture that we shall ensure that grants are not approved for the building of vessels by foreign yards known to be in receipt of a material element of subsidy. That, I am quite sure, will safeguard the position.</p>

asked about consultation and arrangements between the shipbuilding industry and the fishing industry. I assure them that the arrangements which have been made have been fully discussed with the shipbuilders and I understand that they are acceptable to them.<br/>
On the question put by my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth, a meeting was held with the shipbuilders on 26th June when proposals for ensuring fair competition was put before them. I have to admit to her that there was no consultation with the shipbuilding industry itself, the B.T.F.&#x2014;the British Trawlers' Federation&#x2014;for the reason that this action will be for the direct benefit of the fishing industry itself. We did not think it necessary, in those circumstances, to consult the fishing industry.</p>

<p>The difference between my hon. Friend and myself is that I would not consider that the fishing industry is vitally affected in a matter of this kind. It might vitally affect shipbuilders or the boat building industry, but it does not vitally affect the fishing industry. It can only be to its advantage to be able to purchase boats wherever it wishes to do so.</p>

<p>The interesting point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bodmin (Mr. Marshall) is one of the matters which my right hon. Friend will certainly keep in mind.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. G. R. Howard) raised two interesting points. One was in regard to grants and whether these could be given to owners who were to carry out experimental voyages or special kinds of experiments. I assure my hon. Friend that financial grants can be given through the White Fish Authority towards the cost of experimental vessels. There is no statutory limit on the size

of the grants which can be given and each case will be considered on its merits. I assure my hon. Friend that we have this point very much in mind.<br/>
My hon. Friend suggested that grants should be given for protection vessels by sea fishery committees, but we have no powers to give grants of that kind. I draw this attention to the fact that this might be a very expensive operation. From my experience I know that running a protection squadron in Scotland is a very expensive operation. I hardly think that a sea fisheries committee would be in a position to undertake this task.</p>

<p>I am most unhappy with what my hon. Friend said, which was that his right hon. Friend and my right hon. Friend will bear this interesting&#x2014;as he was kind enough to say&#x2014; point in mind. I put a specific question. If by currency manipulation one brings about a subsidy in a foreign yard, will this qualify as a subsidy? In the recollection of most right hon. and hon. Members, this was how Dr. Schacht did this during the r&#x00E9;gime in Germany.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend the Member for Bodmin believes that it is a subsidy to a material extent&#x2014;and he obviously thinks that it is&#x2014;this will apply in the same way as any other material element of subsidy which we have already discussed.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has said that the White Fish Authority could give grants for experimental vessels. Will he make it clear that in that case the responsibility for the specifications falls entirely in the hands of the owners and that the job of the White Fish Authority is merely to approve or disapprove the subsidy requested?</p>

<p>In a matter of this kind we should obviously discuss, and the White Fish Authority would discuss, with the builders what it was hoped to achieve with regard to the specifications of the vessel. We could not expect the White Fish Authority necessarily to approve that expenditure unless it were satisfied that it was money to be well spent. I hope that this explanation satisfies the House.</p>

<p>Before the hon. Member sits down, I remind him that I asked a specific question: how would he differentiate between a subsidy paid to a foreign shipyard and one paid to a British shipyard tendering for the same vessel, and what provision there is in G.A.T.T. or E.F.T.A. which permits the Government to take that action?</p>

<p>In the first place, there is no subsidy to the yard; there is a subsidy to the owner of the vessel. The point was also made to some extent by my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour), when he asked what would happen if the price of the boat which was to be built in the foreign yard was higher than the price of the boat to be built in this country, and the owner decided to build in a foreign yard. He asked how it was that we should pay only the subsidy on the lower price. This is only a sensible arrangement. We cannot decide where the owner will build his boat, but I do not think that it would be wise to use Government money to subsidise that boat at a price higher than that at which it could be built in this country. I could visualise a case in which the White Fish Authority would not necessarily pay grant on the full amount for a boat built in this country which could have been built for a considerably lower price at some other yard in this country. I do not think that Government money should go towards subsidising boats built at higher prices than are reasonable. I hope that I have answered the questions.</p>

<p>Epsom Downs.<br/>
It is a terrible thing to see a Scotsman struggling with his conscience, and that is what we have just seen. At some stage in the proceedings after the Bill had left this House the Government became conscience-smitten in that they had broken international law. They discovered this all of a sudden. Then, in another place, in circumstances which prevented us from having an effective discussion in this House on a matter of finance which is our prerogative, they made a statement. Was this made on instructions of the Secretary of State for Scotland or on instructions of the Minister of Agriculture? One or other of these two right hon. Gentlemen seems to have given instructions that the statement was to be made in the other place, which has caused all the trouble. The right hon. Gentleman this afternoon talked about outward and visible signs. That is always connected with inward and spiritual grace, and the gracefulness of it has not been made apparent this evening.<br/>
The hon. Lady the Member for Tyne-mouth (Dame Irene Ward) put some very pertinent points to the Ministry which the hon. Member has not answered, except to say that at a certain stage in these matters they became conscience-smitten. When did they discover that they had been committing this series of offences against international law? Was it while the Bill was before the House or did it come afterwards? Surely we can be told when that painful discovery was made. We ought also to be told why, if it were known before the Bill had left the House, the House was not then informed of it, because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) said, had we known of it in this House we could have taken steps by a new Clause or in some other way to see that the issue was raised here.<br/>
One can only hope that the Ministers in these two Departments have learned from this how serious the House is bound to take a matter of this kind.


Speaking for a shipbuilding and ship-repairing port, I know how bitter the feeling is there about the way in which this matter has been handled. In some astounding way, if the ship is built in a foreign yard, the money will get into the pockets of the shipbuilders responsible for that yard and not into the pockets of shipbuilders in this country. I cannot see that we have had any explanation from the Minister to make us feel satisfied that this matter was at any stage handled competently or with any regard for the final interests of this country.</p>

<p>The House is accustomed at this time of year to Statutory Instruments providing for operating subsidies for the fishing industry for the year ahead. This year there are some changes brought about by the new Act, though some of the familiar methods of subsidy payments continue.<br/>
I want, first, to say a few words about the familiar ones. The Herring Scheme and the White Fish Scheme provide for subsidies for inshore and herring vessels on the same basis as before. The House will remember that the Government intend to continue, as in the past, to fix the herring and inshore subsidies year by year according to the needs of each section. The

changes this year have been made in line with this principle.<br/>
Those classes of vessels which are doing relatively well have had the subsidy reduced and those doing not so well are to get the same subsidy or a higher rate. The daily rates for the larger herring vessels have been adjusted and the stowage rate for the smaller vessels has been substantially increased. As regards inshore vessels, the stonage rate has been increased by 1d. to 1s. 3d. and a daily rate has been introduced for vessels between 60 ft. and 70 ft., which it is calculated will bring them in 1962 roughly the same subsidy as they got in 1961. It will have the advantage of providing an income when catches are poor.<br/>
Vessels between 70 ft. and 80 ft. are now classed as inshore vessels rather than near water vessels, and the daily rate for them is being increased. The seiners which make long voyages are to be paid a daily rate the whole year round instead of six months of the year only. It will be at a lower rate than hitherto, but we believe that the net result will be advantageous to them.<br/>
The method of fixing the subsidy for trawlers over 80 ft. long follows the new policy set out in the Government's White Paper last August and incorporated in the new Act. Basic subsidies are to be paid to these vessels tapering off within a pre-determined range over the next ten years and additional special rates of subsidy to particular classes whose circumstances warrant it.<br/>
The basic rates of subsidy set out in the Scheme are those agreed with the British Trawlers' Federation and the Scottish Owners' Association and published last autumn. The Scottish Owners' Association have recently decided to repudiate this agreement and have asked for considerably higher basic rates of subsidy. The Government heard their arguments but have decided that it is right to adhere to the terms of the agreement.<br/>
One of the main features of the Fleck Report was that the basic subsidy rates should be designed to encourage efficiency. In the talks between the Government and the industry which followed the publication of the Report, both agreed that this should be a guiding principle. It was as a result of these


discussions that the three initial basic subsidy rates were decided upon and agreed to, designed, as they were, to give a fair relationship between distant, middle and near water vessels having regard to the differences in their costs of construction, operating expenses and catching capacity. It would be wrong to throw aside this principle, which we believe is a sound one for the trawler industry as a whole.<br/>
Moreover, the British Trawlers' Federation, whose members own four-fifths of the trawlers in the United Kingdom, still think that the agreement is right and are standing by it and the Government would not be entitled to tear it up, even if we thought it right to do so, which we do not.<br/>
Last year was not a good one for the industry as a whole, and Scottish boats have suffered along with the others. But the fortunes of the fishing industry are notorious for rapid fluctuations from year to year and we cannot look simply on one year's results. This has to be decided upon on a ten-year basis. We must remember that this time we are not fixing just one year's rates but the initial basic rates which will set the pattern for the next ten years.<br/>
Some sections of the fleet have done worse than others in the past twelve months. In our view, the way to tackle this is not to throw over a general agreement designed to be in the best interests of the fleet as a whole, but rather to give particular help to those in special need. There are three ways in which we are able to do this&#x2014;by a moratorium on debts to the White Fish Authority, by lifting restrictions on distant water fishing, and by supplementary payments. This has been our approach to the problem.<br/>
It was clear that a moratorium for those in financial difficulties who have failed on their payments under their loan agreements with the White Fish Authority was one of the ways in which we could help and the Trawler Owners' Associations asked that a moratorium should be extended to all those who have loans. But we see no reason for allowing those owners who are capable of paying to defer payment of their commercial debts, so the moratorium will be given only to those who prove the need for it and have a fair chance of over-

coming their financial difficulties within a reasonable period. The moratorium will be subject to a number of specific conditions, which we believe to be right, since public money is involved. These are set out in the letter a copy of which has been put in the Library. Hon. Members who have read it will notice that payments may be deferred for "a reasonable period". We have purposely not been specific about the period, but I take the point that more than one year will probably be necessary, in some cases at least, and we have in mind a period of up to about two years.<br/>
Then there is the second way in which we can help, the removal of the restrictions on distant water voyages by grant-aided vessels which the British Trawlers' Federation, representing the interests of all trawler owners, has itself proposed. I hope that the House will not underestimate the benefit that can flow from this for the middle water fleet. It is not possible to be precise, but the results which we have seen from vessels which have been able to make additional voyages to distant waters following the relaxation of the restrictions last year lead us to believe that the removal of restrictions will make a difference over a year of about &#x00A3;10 a day to those vessels which take advantage of it. With the bigger vessels able to fish further away, this will reduce the weight of fishing in middle waters and so be of considerable help to the smaller vessels, which cannot go elsewhere.<br/>
Finally, the House will remember that the Act provides for special subsidy rates up to a maximum of &#x00A3;350,000 in any one year. The whole purpose of these additional payments is to help sections of the fleet in real need. It is not a particularly enviable task to apportion these payments as between the various claims on behalf of individual classes of vessel, but we have been guided by what we thought fair justice as between the various claims. It would not have been prudent to commit the whole amount now, and we have kept some &#x00A3;120,000 in reserve. It will, therefore, be open to any port to make a further claim for special subsidy at any time during the year, and we shall be able to consider these claims on their merits in the knowledge that some money is available to meet well-founded claims that might arise later.<br/>
I want just to say a word about the Aggregate Amount of Grants Order, which will provide the moneys for these various subsidies. The maximum expenditure on subsidies authorised at the moment is &#x00A3;25&#x00BC; million, and that will soon be exhausted. The new Order is, therefore, being made under Section 1 of the Act to provide an extra &#x00A3;5 million, which will be enough to carry us through for the whole of the coming subsidy year. These subsidy schemes together lay down the initial basic subsidy rates which will set the main lines on which the Government will give financial help to the trawler industry over the next ten years. They also provide for additional special payments for the coming year to those sections of the trawler fleet that have so far made out the best case for some extra assistance. These, with the moratorium to individual owners, will help those who are in immediate difficulties.<br/>
As to the future, we all hope that last year's bad results will prove to have been only one of the ups and downs to which the fishing industry is constantly prone, and we have no reason to suppose that, in the longer term, the fortunes of the trawling industry should not recover, particularly with the help that the middle-water fleet will get from the removal of restrictions on distant water fishing next year.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) mentioned negotiations with the Common Market on fishing interests. The reason why there have so far been no such negotiations with the Six is that the Six themselves have not yet even started to consider what common fisheries policy they are to have. But we have carefully considered the provisions of the Treaty of Rome in that respect, and the general principles embodied in it in relation to our fishery policies, and we do not think that our general objectives would be in any way inconsistent, or make it difficult for us, in this regard, to accept the Articles of the Treaty of Rome. I can assure my hon. Friend that, at the appropriate time, we shall certainly make our views on fisheries policies well known to the Community.<br/>
These Schemes make provision for subsidies for the coming year; they

cover all sections of the industry, from the smallest inshore vessels to the largest trawlers. I think that they provide the best balance we can devise between the interests of the different sections of the industry, and I commend them to the House.</p>

<p>I should be out of order if I followed the argument which the right hon. Gentleman nearly developed about policy towards Europe on fisheries, but I hope that he will make his views known soon and that they will be better known than are the Government's views on agriculture. Very little has been known about the Government's views on agriculture, and we still wish to press the Minister on that subject.<br/>
I am very glad that the Minister has presented the group of Statutory Instruments we are now considering. I had expected that the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Vane) would have replied as Parliamentary Secretary, but we have heard (that he has been cast aside by the Government along with the other Parliamentary Secretary in another place. I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman has gone, because he was always courteous, efficient and, I believe&#x2014;and I say this quite sincerely&#x2014;one of the ablest junior Ministers we have had dealing with agriculture. Why he has been thrown aside by a Prime Minister who has been so ruthless, I cannot understand. It obviously means that in the Tory Party one must not do one's job efficiently, or one is cast out. I trust that the right hon. Gentleman will feel very sad at the loss of two diligent Parliamentary Secretaries.<br/>
It was those two hon. Gentlemen, and the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland&#x2014;the hon. Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Mr. Leburn)&#x2014;who carried the burden of the relevant legislation in Committee. Tonight we have heard the views of the Minister who is, in the end, responsible. We do not oppose the Orders. We accept the need for operating subsidies. The Minister said that some of the subsidies are due to changes in the new Act and that others are familiar subsidies carried on under previous legislation.<br/>
There have been adjustments here and there. In connection with the Scottish


trawler owners' repudiation of the amounts, the right hon. Gentleman made a rather unusual remark. He said, "Even if we thought that any changes would be right, we would stick to our agreement." Can the Minister explain that remark in more detail? Does he really mean that if in the next year or two it were found that the agreement on subsidies, and the other details that we are now discussing, ware not working, the Government would still carry on with their policy without any adjustments? I should like a definite answer to that, and I will gladly give way to get it.</p>

<p>I said that we made the agreement as to the starting rates only a matter of months ago. That agreement was reached after long and thorough discussion taking all interests into consideration. I said that even if we had agreed with the Scottish owners, which we did not, it would come ill from the Government themselves to break an agreement into which they had entered only a few months earlier. That was in relation to starting rates.</p>

<p>But even if, as the right hon. Gentleman says the British Trawlers' Federation owns four-fifths of the fleet, that is not a sound argument. The one-fifth, which mainly covers the Scottish side, faces greater difficulties over a period. Its members are smaller owners&#x2014;often family firms&#x2014;and they face difficulties. It is unfair to compare them in that way. Those hon. Members opposite who represent Scottish constituencies should press the Minister on this matter.<br/>
To take up the Minister's other argument. If we go into the Common Market, it may well be that the subsidies will have to go. We might find that there was a change of policy, probably dictated toy the Commission in Brussels, or by someone else. The Government would have to change their mind if they were out voted. That situation might arise if we enter the Common Market and sign the Treaty of Rome. Even if there is agreement between the British

Traders' Federation and the Scottish Section, it could happen, if we enter Europe, that these subsidies would have to be altered. I hope, therefore that the right hon. Gentleman will not be too dogmatic in his approach.<br/>
We accept in principle that there is a case for these subsidies. Nevertheless, hon. Members who have followed this matter, particularly those who represent Scottish constituencies, know that there have been difficulties. I do not intend to go at great length into the plight of the Scottish trawler owners. I will leave that to hon. Members who represent Scottish constituencies. I have with me a lengthy memorandum issued by the Aberdeen Fishing Vessel Owners' Association Limited and the Newhaven and Granton Trawler Owners' Association. This memorandum repudiates the agreement made by those organisations with the Government in October last year and asserts that they cannot accept the terms of the Bill, particularly its references to viability. Published on 13th June last, the memorandum states:
<q>The Scottish Trawler Owners are asking for a subsidy sufficient only to enable them to break-even and provide a small return on the capital which they have invested in modernising the industry.</q>
In other words, they believe that the subsidies now provided by the Government will not really help them. They are seeking an adjustment. The document continues:
<q>The meagre subsidy proposed by the Government will mean that, after depreciation, vessels will be operating this year at an average loss of between &#x00A3;4,500 and &#x00A3;6.000. Owners cannot consider maintaining their fleets in a modern condition and to suit changing needs under these proposals. Unless the Government gives the right amount of financial support now and for a few more years there will be no Scottish Trawling Fleet left operating to take advantage of any improvement in the situation &#x2026;</q>
The memorandum goes on to argue this case in detail and pleads for a greater degree of financial support.<br/>
We have not today received an answer from the right hon. Gentleman. In fact, the Minister casually dismissed the whole matter. It may be that my hon. Friends will press this matter, for we certainly would like a reply from the Minister responsible for Scottish affairs. There is a feeling in the industry that, despite the agreement, the industry may not be viable over a ten-year period. Indeed,


the British Trawlers' Federation admits this in its memorandum of 31st October, 1961. I used the following quotation from that memorandum on Second Reading of the Bill when I stated:
<q>'We accept the basic principle that the trawler fleet should be self-supporting within ten years and will co-operate fully with the Government to that end'.</q>
I assert that members of the British Trawlers' Federation are still concerned about whether or not that principle will work out in practice and that the industry will really be viable in ten years' time.<br/>
The Fleck Report indicates that there is a possibility that the industry will not be viable over a long period of subsidy arrangements. On Second Reading I quoted from the Report as follows:
<q>'The industry is, therefore, not likely to have any easy time ahead of it, and it may be all it can do to hold its own at about the present level of profitability, or an only slightly higher one, even if the subsidies continue as at present'.</q>
I continued to quote from the Report:
<q>'Any reduction of the fleet to a completely economic level, such as must eventually follow the withdrawal of the fishing subsidies, might lead to a decline in the supply and a rise in the price of home-caught fish'." &#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 14th November, 1961; Vol. 694, c. 301&#x2013;2.]</q>
I could go on for many paragraphs quoting the Fleck Report, but I will not weary the House. We have argued consistently that these subsidies, while we realise the need for them, may not result in a viable industry over a period of ten years. It could happen that many sections of the industry might be harmed by events quite outside the control of the Government.<br/>
I am, therefore, merely asking the right hon. Gentleman not to be too optimistic. I realise that he should be realistic, but in view of the situation regarding the Scottish side of the industry, he will appreciate that the people concerned are very worried about the matter. I appreciate, also, that an important argument could be introduced; the whole question of subsidies. I will not develop this argument at great length because I accept the need for subsidies. However, time and again it has been emphasised that we are subsidising private industry. On many occasions hon. Members have pointed

out&#x2014;so did the Fleck Report&#x2014;that we should exercise caution in this respect.<br/>
In this connection, it is worth bearing in mind the evidence given by Mr. George Middleton to the Fleck Committee. It is important to remember that we are also subsidising an important private section of industry which in certain circumstances may be financially stable. We must admit that there has been a growth of monopoly among certain sections of the fishing industry. There has been the classic pattern of vertical and horizontal integration. Page 21 of the Fleck Report reveals how certain groups within the industry are doing quite well and how the catching, processing, and distribution sections are becoming so intermingled that it is difficult to know just where the subsidy ends; that is, whether the subsidy, in the end, goes to the catching side or to the other sections.<br/>
On the other hand, there are many smaller owners in Scotland, particularly family concerns, who have not so far been affected by this growth of integration as much as other sections of the industry. That is why I expect the Minister to be a little more sympathetic to the difficulties of the Scottish owners as outlined by the Scottish Trawler Owners' Federation. Tonight he dismissed them rather too casually. Perhaps the Minister responsible for Scottish affairs will give a sympathetic reply.<br/>
Obviously the purpose of the subsidies is to make the industry more efficient. There will be structural changes in the fishing fleet as a result of these subsidies. This point was brought out in detail in Committee on the Sea Fish Industry Bill. On Second Reading, my hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland) explained how structural adjustments might take place.<br/>
We plead for flexibility and also for co-operation between the various authorities concerned. In the design of boats this flexibility must exist and this applies equally in combining the efforts of research workers. The subsidies must be used wisely to ensure that the fleet is modernised, for the taxpayers' money is involved. There must be accountability and the money being spent must improve efficiency within the industry.<br/>
Naturally, the owners have a responsibility in this. They must aim for


efficiency and this view has been expressed time and again by horn. Members. We are cautious in the sense that we expect that the industry will become viable, but in view of the difficulties now showing themselves it may be too optimistic to assume that the problems involved will be solved by subsidy arrangement which will peter out over the ten-year period. We support this aid to the industry.<br/>
Those hon. Members who are so critical of aid to public concerns, such as the Scottish coal pits which are being axed as a consequence of the Government fuel and power policy, should not be doctrinaire. Perhaps this evening they will appreciate we are giving a considerable amount of money to private industry &#x2014;and they should be as generous to public concerns as they are proposing to be to the Scottish and English trawler owners.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Peart) will not mind if I tell him that I certainly shall not be doctrinaire. I am also deeply conscious of the difficulties of the Scottish trawler owners, but I should like to leave that matter to my hon. Friends on this side of the House who are more closely connected with it than I am and who will cover those points.<br/>
I want to say a word or two about the problems of the inshore fishing fleets in Scotland. They are very serious. These subsidies are very important, but it is little use having a subsidy if there is no fishing industry at all, and that is the reality of the situation which faces us off the north-east coast of Scotland. There are no fish in the local grounds whatsoever, for the second year in succession.<br/>
The inshore herring fishermen are having to go to Lerwick to get the herring and the quality of the fish is good. Moreover, they are the only fish that they get at the moment and the price is good enough to obscure the grimmer realities of the situation for them.<br/>
Even then, though, the numbers are very scarce. The latest figures that 1 have show that for the best day in a week the catch was 1,100 crans and

that for the rest of the week it varied between 200 and 700 crans. Apart from that, the boats from Fraserburgh and Peterhead have to travel so far that they are at best only able to get back once or perhaps twice in the week.<br/>
In fact, the whole structure of what has been a traditional and very important form of fishing has been very greatly disturbed with the consequent damage and danger to the industries which have grown up there, based on a regular herring supply. It is an exceedingly scrious matter. In that light it will be a very sad disappointment to the men on boats of between 60 ft. and 80 ft. to find that their subsidy has been out from &#x00A3;8 10s. a week to &#x00A3;8&#x2014;a loss of 10s.<br/>
I asked about a week ago why there was this scarcity of herring in the North Sea. I can only say that the answer of the Secretary of State that this loss was due to natural causes excites a great deal of derision on the part of men who have to make their living from this industry. They have, generally speaking, been in the business for generations. They have watched the fish come and watched the fish go. They have seen two world wars and they have seen the renaissance of fish. Each time it has come about with a renewal of fishing after the wars and their forced period of conservation. Now we are told that it is due to natural causes, and the fishermen simply do not believe it.<br/>
We see day in and day out foreign trawlers scooping up the heritage of our inshore fishermen with nets through which nothing can pass; they look like curtains. They are catching everything, even sand eels. It is quite absurd to expect that the fishermen will believe that the effect on the death of fish is caused by natural causes, because they see what is causing their destruction. In the Moray Firth, as my hon. Friend says, it is particularly and most painfully obvious.<br/>
The question that I put to my right hon. Friend is: how much longer can we delay pushing out our limits to at least six miles? I am well aware of the delicate balance which has to be made between the interests of the national fleet as a Whole and our own inshore fleet, and also of the delicacy of the


negotiations on the Faroes which are due to come off shortly. But we are losing a tremendous national 'heritage of wealth for our inshore fishermen, and if the Government find it impossible to conserve abroad and internationally, why cannot they start a policy of conservation at home?<br/>
We are all aware of the difficulties of getting the nations of the world to agree on a uniform policy of conservation for world fishing. It is a sad fact that some of them seem to prefer to cut their own throats. If we cannot bring about conservation abroad why cannot we do something of the sort for ourselves at home, by expanding our limits to at least six miles and within that territory embark on a policy of control, if necessary, and also the development of our own natural fisheries?<br/>
One thing is obvious&#x2014;unless we can bring a rebirth to our inshore fishermen a very important industry to the whole of Scotland will suffer material damage.</p>

<p>I have every sympathy with the position of the inshore fishermen, but I cannot imagine a more irresponsible moment for this country to push out its limits within the short period before we start negotiations with the Faroes on the question of limits.<br/>
I want to speak briefly about two matters: first, about the middle-water fleet; and, secondly, the White Fish Authority. On the middle-water fleet, the Minister was, I think, extremely sympathetic. The fleet is still going through an extremely bad period and this reflects itself in a number of middle-water firms who are behind in their interest and capital repayments to the White Fish Authority. The question is what attitude we ought to take to this and what we think is the solution.<br/>
The Minister has described a number of possibilities. First, a complete moratorium on debt repayment for all firms in the industry. He rejected this, I am sure quite rightly, because I do not see how we could justify a total moratorium to people who are perfectly capable of making interest and capital repayment to the White Fish Authority.<br/>
The second possibility which, in effect, he accepted is that we should have a moratorium for two years, or however long it is needed, simply for those firms in difficulty which cannot make their interest and debt repayments. This the Minister has more or less accepted. I think that this is right although the disadvantage is that this means that the Government accountants have to get themselves heavily involved in the affairs of individual firms. This is a nuisance for the firms concerned. It is not a principle which one wants to support, but I do not see any way round it.<br/>
The next possibility is that we help this section of the fleet&#x2014;we are concerned mostly with the middle-water section of the fleet at the moment&#x2014;out of the supplementary fund for contingencies, a fund out of which the Minister can make payments up to &#x00A3;350,000 a year. Payments out of this fund are going to the middle-water fleet. The Minister mentioned that not all of the &#x00A3;350,000 has been covenanted to the industry. I believe that there is still &#x00A3;120,000 for which application can be made from sections which are particularly hard hit. It may be that some part of the middle-water fleet will have to apply for this part of the fund, and I hope that the Minister will be able to help if such application is made.<br/>
When we are discussing the difficulties of the middle-water fleet we should remember that these difficulties may, and indeed should, prove temporary. The situation should have improved two years from now. From the end of this year there will be no restriction on distant water sailing and this may make a number of the larger boats more profitable, enabling the remainder who stay at the Faroes more profitable, too, because there will be less fishing going on there. This should ease the situation in the industry.<br/>
When we add to that the fact that the more inefficient coal burners are going out at a rapid rate, the middle-water picture should look better in time. We should be able to treat this as essentially a temporary problem. Nevertheless, while this problem continues the Government must watch it. I think that the Minister will be sympathetic if applications are made for the reserve element


in the &#x00A3;350,000; and it may prove necessary, if these difficulties become aggravated, to increase the size of the supplementary fund beyond the &#x00A3;2&#x00BD; million at which it now stands.<br/>
I would be very disturbed if, after agreeing to this total aid to the industry, within a year we had to increase it. I hope that we shall be able gradually to see it decline over a period of, say, ten years, and I should be alarmed if we had to increase it. Nevertheless, I hope that the Minister will watch the position carefully.<br/>
Looking back over our discussions during the last year, my regret is that if I were starting again, of the total aid going to the industry I would cut down the amount going to the middle-water section. I recognise that this is being wise after the event, but I think that if we were all starting again many of us would take this view.<br/>
I am less sympathetic to the Scottish owners than some who have already spoken. I do not want to discuss the Scottish owners in detail because one would be mad to get into any discussion about the Scots. I am particularly vulnerable because a namesake of mine, T. W. H. Crosland, once wrote a book entitled "The Unspeakable Scot", in which he quoted Charles Lamb, who said:
<q>I have been trying all my life to like Scotchmen, and am obliged to desist from the experiment in despair.</q>
I am sorry that the Scots have felt it necessary to take the decision that they have, because the industry can only be weakened by lack of unity. The one thing that this industry needs more than anything else is unity. As it has gone off all on its own, the Minister must not think that if he is approached by the Scottish owners speaking mainly of their middle water problems, they represent the whole of the middle-water fleet. They do not. They tend to give the impression sometimes that they represent the whole of the middle-water section of the fleet, whereas we in Grimsby have a substantial part of the middle-water fleet.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will remember this when he or his colleagues are approached by the Scottish trawler owners, and that he should consult the British trawler owners as well. Aberdeen

will be largely a distant water port after the restrictions are taken off. It will no longer foe a middle-water port, and, presumably, a large proportion of the trawlers will sail to distant waters.<br/>
My only other point about the Faroes is that when the Minister comes to negotiate with the Faroese on limits I hope that he will bear in mind that one of the reasons why parts of the British industry are suffering is that there has been a spectacular increase in imports from the Faroes and Denmark in the last five years. In Grimsby, from 1957 to 1962, the increase in Faroese landings has been from &#x00A3;150,000 a year to over &#x00A3;800,000 a year, and Danish imports into Grimsby have almost trebled from &#x00A3;700,000 to &#x00A3;2 million. Unlike some people, I am not against all imports as a matter of principle. I am rather a free trader. Indeed, I am a European. Nevertheless, when negotiations start with the Faroes I hope that the Minister will bear this point in mind.<br/>
With regard to the White Fish Authority, through whom these loans, grants and subsidies are channelled, this is a suitable moment to discuss the matter because it has recently asked the industry for an increase in levy from &#x00BD;d. to 1d., and all our merchants especially are against this increase in the levy. One of the reasons that the Authority has gone into the "red" (this year is that its Income Tax liability is more than doubled. It seems absurd for a public body of this kind so to arrange its financial affairs that it has to pay &#x00A3;28,000 back to the Treasury in tax. I think that by a change in accountancy this considerable burden on the Authority would be saved.<br/>
A larger point is this. I myself would not begrudge the Authority the extra &#x00BD;d. and, indeed, a larger amount of money if I were certain that it was doing the job that we expect it to do, but I am doubtful whether it is. I am not criticising individuals in the Authorit. I am simply criticising the structure and the size of the Authority.<br/>
I should like to refer to one or two other points. The first, which has been raised in the House before, is whether the Authority is exercising enough influence on the type of trawler being built. Just as limits are being extended everywhere, we find ourselves with a largely


modern fleet consisting almost entirely of conventional trawlers. Of course, we are beginning to build unconventional trawlers, like the "Lord Nelson", but predominantly we have a fleet of new conventional trawlers. They are not adapted to a situation in which limits are being extended to 12 miles.<br/>
I believe that the owners are heavily to blame for this. Indeed, they admit that this is not the right way to deal with the new situation. They say that they could not foresee the extension of the limits. I do not believe it. From 1952 onwards, when the first Icelandic struggle started, any intelligent person could have foreseen that we were in for a bad time over the question of limits. The owners ought to have seen this and they ought to have experimented with new types of trawlers before they did.<br/>
The White Fish Authority should certainly have foreseen it. Indeed, it may have done so and done nothing about it. It says in its Annual Report that it is not its task to try to enforce a particular pattern of investment on the industry. Of course, it is not. It has not got the legal power to do so. But it administers all these large sums and it has considerable powers of persuasion, and it could have exercised more persuasion on the industry to start innovating new types of freezers long before it did.<br/>
Similarly, I feel that more research ought to be carried out by the White Fish Authority. This year's Annual Report mentions research into new fishing grounds, but, so far as I know, none is south of the Equator. Certainly, there is no hint in the Report that it is doing any new research into fishing grounds there.<br/>
On quality control, the Authority could do a great deal more than it is doing, for it is extremely complacent about this matter. There is no hon. Member directly from Hull in the Chamber at the moment, but there is one very close to Hull. The White Fish Authority always talks as if the quality control scheme in Hull really works. In fact, many people in the industry think that it is near to being a farce. Lip-service is paid to it by Hull because Hull wants to avoid something stricter. At any rate, it seems to me that this attitude on the part of the Authority

towards quality control is also too complacent.<br/>
Lastly&#x2014;and this is a serious matter, though going slightly away from the Authority&#x2014;there is the question of the three-man investigation committee at the ports. I, and I am sure many hon. Members, have put a great deal of weight on this, but now we hear that the chairman of the committee, after only twelve months' experience of the industry, is moving into the cereals industry, which no doubt is very important. I do not know whether this is true or not, but if this is so it is absurd and is messing the industry about.<br/>
This man has had a lot of experience during the last twelve months and we know him to be without question a man of extreme ability. It is messing the industry about if this man, having the industry at his fingertips as it were, is to be moved to another department. All the work done by the three-man committee will prove largely wasted because the chairman has gone to another job, and the whole thing will have to start again from scratch.</p>

<p>There are, of course, movements within a Department of officials from one important job to another. This is always happening.

<p>Obviously, as a general rule, that is true, but I was pointing out the effects on the fishing industry and that it would appear that the work already done would be wasted and that the whole thing would have to start again. We in Grimsby will have a new man and, presumably, the two same men coming to the port again as a committee of three to interview all the interested bodies and presumably the new chairman will have to learn the whole thing from the beginning. I and many of my hon. Friends believe that by far the most important thing in the fishing industry


is not the trawling side. It is the question of the organisation of ports. It is on this that we had placed great hopes which have been disappointed by this news.<br/>
I gather that the chairman of the Authority is now part-time. I believe that on the basis of the amount of money the Authority has to spend and the tasks it has to carry out that it is utterly inappropriate that this body should have a part-time chairman. We know that he is extremely able and we think that he should be full-time. I would not grudge the Authority the extra &#x00BD;d. if I thought that the body would be made larger and more powerful and have more teeth and would give greater leadership to the industry as a whole. Like the merchants in Grimsby and many other people, I would have considerable doubts about the right-ness of this organisation if it continued on a part-time basis.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland) that it would have been far wiser in apportioning the subsidies to have given less to the distant-water fleets and more to the middle-water fleets. At the same time, while I understand the hon. Member's interest in Grimsby and the middle-water fleet there, I should like to devote my remarks particularly to the position of the Scottish owners and the middle-water fleets. I very much regret that these owners have felt it necessary to repudiate this agreement not only by reason of their trading returns but also because they did it so late. While I believe that they have a strong case, I think that contrary to the position with the Scheme which we have just discussed, the Minister also has a case not to make a change at this late hour.<br/>
It is all very well to have had the Royal Assent given to a Measure which took months to go through Parliament and then to ask the Treasury to alter the subsidy rates which were originally agreed to by the whole industry. Nevertheless, I think that we in the Scottish industry made a mistake in agreeing with the British Trawlers' Federation to support the starting rates of subsidy, because I understand that at that time it was suggested that the rates should not be fixed until we had had one more year of trading returns. If we had waited

that long, I do not think that we should be in our present difficulties.<br/>
We have to face the fact that the Scottish owners have formed their own federation and that they will have to be regarded separately. It is unfortunate that we do not have a united industry, but it must be remembered that in Scotland, and particularly in Aberdeen, which has the largest preponderance of boats, the industry is entirely dependent on near- and middle-water fleets. There is also the peculiarity not to be found in the larger ports in the South that on the whole these are family businesses, whereas in the big ports, where there are long-distance trawlers, the big companies can balance profit and loss between long-distance and middle-water fleets.<br/>
It is also only fair to say that, as I understand, Granton and Leith did not agree to the original arrangements with the British Trawlers' Federation and they made a specific reservation on this point as long ago as last September. People in Aberdeen very well recognise the principle behind the Sea Industry Act and the Fleck Report&#x2014;that there should be increased efficiency throughout the industry. The oldest ship sailing from Aberdeen now is only four years old. We are, therefore discussing a very serious position, namely, the future of the Scottish fishing fleet and, in particular, of its major port of Aberdeen.<br/>
What new factor has arisen which has made it so difficult for these fleets which sail from Scotland and particularly from Aberdeen? It is, of course, the lack of fish due to the extension of the fishing limits. It could be said that one would not have needed foresight to know how bad the returns would be, but it must be remembered that the Scottish fleet was encouraged by the Government and the White Fish Authority to build a certain type of boat. Also, that it has been since the building of that type that there has been the extension of the Faroes limit and that there is now the possibility of the further extension of that limit to twelve miles.<br/>
This, therefore, is the excuse for asking the Minister, from now on until the new Session, to give careful thought to the position of the middle water fleets, and, in particular, the Scottish fleet, which has the personal characteristics of


a family business and the characteristic of fishing in the Faroes. The hon. Member for Grimsby said that Aberdeen would shortly become a long-distance port because of the removal of the restriction on the number of trips which can be made to fish in Icelandic waters. But I am sure he will appreciate that the removal of this restriction can only be of limited advantage because the boats in question can often fish these Icelandic waters only when the weather is good. This gives them only a limited number of trips in the year.<br/>
It must be realised that in the short time available the Minister has done what he can under the Act and within the powers he holds to try to help in this situation. I welcome the selective moratorium because I am sure that it is fairer even if it does involve the very close accounting of which we have been told. The Scottish owners have throughout repudiated this offer of a moratorium, but I think that it would, as the figures given this afternoon show, make a considerable difference to the possibility of keeping the fleet fishing throughout the year.<br/>
I am very glad also that it is possible to give supplementary payments either for certain classes of boat ox for certain ports on application. I am quite sure that the port of Aberdeen will shortly be applying for the rest of the &#x00A3;120,000 which, I think, is being kept back at the moment out of the total of &#x00A3;350,000.<br/>
In my view, we must look again at the whole matter of principle in making the fishing industry viable within ten years. The Fleck Report itself made a very important reservation that, if there were factors outside the industry's control such as, for instance, the pushing out of fishing limits for conservation purposes, this would be a ground for examining the whole question whether the industry could be viable in ten years. I consider that the time has come seriously to consider whether, in order to avoid these constant rows and disagreements every July with the fishing industry, we ought to regard the industry as one having a claim to be considered on a par with agriculture. This has always been repudiated, but Why?<br/>
The fishing industry produces food which is considered to be of strategic importance to this country just as agriculture does. It has great international difficulties confronting it. We are a maritime nation still. For strategic reasons alone, we ought to give continuing support, within reason and having regard to efficiency, to the fishing industry as we give it to agriculture. We support agriculture fundamentally for strategic reasons because we know that our community in this country cannot be supported if we do no do our best to make the agriculture industry viable. The fishing industry will try to make itself viable, but, at a time of difficulty, with fishing limits being extended, I suggest that we must make a complete recasting of our thoughts on this problem.<br/>
The figures agreed with the Department in relation to the Scottish fleet are that it is expected that for the near and middle-water fleets the loss in the coming year will be between &#x00A3;4,500 and &#x00A3;6,000 a boat. Aberdeen and Granton and Leith have between them 52 near-water boats and 78 middle-water boats. On 1st August this year, when this new subsidy will come into effect if we pass it tonight, the basic subsidy for these boats will amount to &#x00A3;440,000 which, together with the supplementary fund of &#x00A3;104,350, will total &#x00A3;549,000. In fact, this is &#x00A3;128,000 less than the subsidy in the last financial year.<br/>
The needs estimated for Scotland as a whole are that &#x00A3;1,158,000 is required for the industry to break even, in other words, an increase in subsidy of &#x00A3;609,000 taking the moratorium into account. In 1961&#x2013;62, the Scottish trawlers received &#x00A3;684,536 which was the equivalent of 29 per cent. of the total United Kingdom subsidy. This year, they will receive the equivalent of 19 per cent. of the total United Kingdom subsidy. Of course, the bone of contention which is very much in people's minds in Scotland is that there should be a subsidy paid of &#x00A3;17 a day for the distant-water fleet as compensation for the loss of its Icelandic fishing. In my view, they have a strong case when they ask also about compensation for the loss of fishing round the Faroes, particularly when one takes into account the size of our boats and the physical limitation placed upon us of


taking advantage of fishing very much further afield.<br/>
What owners want in Scotland is a higher rate of subsidy for about two or three years which would give them the opportunity to recast the middle-water fleet, to try to build a few ships which one could describe as small Junellas, not scrapping the whole of our modem fleet but try to recast and remould it. Whether this should have been done before, with guidance and persuasion from the White Fish Authority, is a moot point, but the fact is that this is required now if the Scottish fleet is to survive. Also, it would give time for research and practical experiment 'in regard to new fishing grounds.<br/>
Those sailing from Aberdeen believe that, within three or four years, the effect of conservation may mean that the fish themselves will increase and there will be a greater opportunity for fishing in the North Sea; but there will be, as there is mow, an extremely difficult period ahead. I ask the Under-Secretary of State to give an assurance that the Government will, in consultation with the industry, recast their whole thinking on this matter. The supplementary payments end in December, at the end of the year, and I suggest (that, if some amending legislation could be brought in in the new Session, this could be made to operate in the early part of the year. If we go on waiting for another year, parhaps we shall be able to keep the fleet fishing, but it will mean another year's delay. This is the moment to consider, with the fishing industry, exactly what the future of the Scottish fleet as a whole should be.<br/>
While we may not have a united industry in this country today, in my view, the importance of this industry for Scotland is in the employment it gives in so many of our coastal areas at a time when Scotland as a whole is in great difficulty and is going through a period of great change. I hope that the Government will 'give very serious thought to introducing amending legislation.</p>

<p>I hope that my noble Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) will forgive me if I direct what I have to say more to the speech made by her colleague, my

hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen-shire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon).<br/>
The hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland) spoke about the tax which the White Fish Authority has to bear. I hope that the Minister will bear this in mind and consider whether the impact of this tax upon the Authority is really necessary.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East spoke about fishing limits. I do not share the view of the hon. Member for Grimsby that this is one of the most difficult times to advance any suggestion for extending the limit to six miles. I am rather tired of hearing again and again that this is not really the time to do it and that some foreign country will find itself in greater difficulty in negotiating with us as a consequence. At the end of the day, we in Britain, as far as I can see, do nothing about these matters, and it is about time that we defended our own fishing industry, particularly the inshore fishing industry which means a great deal, by extending the fishing limits. Paragraph 16 of the White Fish Subsidy (United Kingdom) Scheme. 1962. mentions the different subsidies which are being paid to the inshore fishing industry. I am glad to note that in paragraph (<i>a</i>), which deals with eels, mackerel, mullet, and pilchards, which no doubt my hon. Friend 'the Member for St. Ives (Mr. G. R. Howard) has taken deep notice of, the subsidy is 1s. 3d. a stone. That is good, but what I wonder is whether the pilchard industry will last long enough to receive anything.<br/>
Two points arise directly from this. There have been two forms of approach on the part of the White Fish Authority to see what can be done about the pilchard industry. One approach dealt with the catching of pilchards and the other with the question of marketing. I think that fundamentally the authority made a mistake in the beginning. It should have spent the money on the marketing side before dealing with the matter of research.<br/>
Secondly, whatever subsidy is given to the inshore fishing industry or to any type of fish caught by the inshore fishing industry, such as pilchards, one must ensure that it has a capacity to fill the market. When South Africa was part of the British Commonwealth, difficulties


arose which we could do nothing about, but now that she is not part of the Commonwealth I fail to see why the Cornish pilchard industry should suffer. It seems that we are not willing to take any action whatsoever about the import of this canned fish, produced by an industry in South Africa whose employment conditions axe far below those which we consider right in this country.<br/>
These may appear to be small matters in some ways. Of course that may be so when talking about an industry which is not very great in itself. But the men and women in this industry have supported this country in innumerable ways when it has been in danger. They have manned the small boats. These are the people on whom we depend at the end of the day, and it is about time that the Government thought in those terms when dealing with the inshore fishing industry.<br/>
I hope that some day some Minister will do something about the two points which I have mentioned. Our fleet&#x2014; when I use the word "our" I include Scotland&#x2014;needs defending by increasing the limits of the sea to six miles. We do not want part of that fleet to be annihilated by imports about which we do nothing.</p>

<p>I have a great deal of sympathy, as I often have, with the points raised by the hon. Member for Bodmin (Mr. Marshall) in connection with the inshore fishermen, whether they fish for pilchards, for lobsters or for any other fish in the waters around our constituencies. I reinforce once again the hon. Gentleman's plea for greater protection for the people to whom, as he rightly said, we as a nation have turned in war very often for protection and, in peace, for the supply of our food.<br/>
There is a growing danger as the years go by of the concentration into the bigger ports of all the fishing of this country and the consequent decay of the smaller communities. That is a problem which we have particularly in the Scottish Islands and the Highland bays and creeks. As I say. I reinforce the hon. Gentleman's appeal and that of another hon. Member who spoke about the need for greater protection within the fishery limit waters around our coasts.<br/>
Among the problems mentioned as being most needing of consideration and on which there was a great deal of debate during the Committee stage of the Sea Fish Industry Bill was the lack of local capital for building up modern dual-purpose fleets. That is a problem which we in the Scottish Islands have long had to face. There has been a lack of local capital because of many years and, indeed, generations of ill reward for the fishing industry; partly, also, through the factors mentioned by the hon. Gentleman and partly through the overwhelming competition from other countries Which has, for some reason, been permitted even when our own fishermen were capable of supplying the needs of most of our own markets.<br/>
In addition, there have been runs of bad seasons and fluctuations and vicissitudes in the fortunes of the fishing round our shores. There has been a lack in the Islands, and certain other parts of the country about which I am thinking, of local shelter and adequate harbours, jetties and piers. That is a matter to which Government after Government have addressed too little attention. This is a problem which was repeatedly commented on as much as 70 and 80 years ago by Commissions of investigation into the fishing industry.<br/>
Another problem which I doubt whether these present proposals will solve, although they may mitigate it financially, is that of distance and consequent transport costs to rail and road-heads, especially in the North-West between the islands and the mainland coasts and the markets. That is a problem which probably only two things can solve in part. One is better and specialised transportation of the catch, and the other, which is even more important in the modern processing context, is increased plant and facilities on the spot, or as near the catching spot as possible, for the processing of the catches from the local fishing grounds.<br/>
Another problem which has been referred to so often during the past weeks and months is that of the fishery limits. The hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior) expressed concern lest the advice given by a Member representing an Aberdeen constituency were carried out too soon. That advice concerned the


extension of the fisheries limits. Goodness knows, this House and successive Governments have had long enough to think about this matter. It would not take anyone by surprise if any Government suddenly extended the fishery limits now. This could have happened 50 years ago, and we would have had fifty years' notice of it even before that. Commissions, local authorities and Members of Parliament representing fishing constituencies have been clamouring for this measure for years. Certainly no one would be taken by surprise if it came about. There may be other demerits about it, but that of surprise is not one of them.<br/>
There is one thing which the Minister may consider doing. I am not sure whether or not it requires legislation. There are precedents for it in other countries, such as Norway. It is to close, at least experimentally, certain fishery areas. I am thinking of areas like the Minch and, possibly, the Moray Firth. The closing of the Minch would have the support of all the Highland local authorities who, indeed, have demanded it. They have mentioned 12 and 6-mile limits, but that was as a compromise. The closing, at least for an experimental period, of the whole Minch area would we understood and, I believe, would be accepted by foreign countries, just as we in practice have had to accept, in spite of the general application of international law, the exceptions which the Norwegians claimed and have been allowed to enforce for several generations.<br/>
Had the Government listened to my own humble submission among many others at the time of the Neven-Spence Report in 1945, which advocated the closing of the Minch for, say, five or seven years to give a chance to the local fleets to be built up with the help of Government capital to make up for the lack of local resources, perhaps by now we should have had a more modern, up-to-date and efficient fleet in the Western Islands and around the northwest Highlands.<br/>
Belatedly, I agree, the Government have come in in a small way and they are operating the Hebrides fishery scheme, but it is very late in the day and the overfishing damage has been done. Many of the grounds have been

damaged, and even the trawlers no longer come into the area because it is no longer profitable for them to do so. It has been heavily overfished, as has been the whole of the North Sea, but, naturally, the smaller areas like the Minch arid Moray Firth have been even more heavily depleted. In consequence, if there is less poaching by trawlers today, it is because their own poaching was only too successful in past years.<br/>
Meanwhile, the whole question of policing and of the limits is a live question with the local fishermen and the local authorities. The Minister is well aware of all the arguments in favour of extending the fishery limits and of better policing, with more modern equipment, of the existing limit. While, however, on the one hand, the Government are handing out subsidies, while they are assisting sections of the industry in various ways financially and otherwise, when trying to operate a local scheme like the Western Islands fishery scheme and trading arrangements why on earth do they insist upon rates of interest from beginners, men launching out on these new ventures, of from 6 to 7&#x00BD; per cent? It is an exorbitant rate to charge these men. In two or three seasons of fishing failure, the debts will pile up and that debt, along with this high rate of interest may do more to discourage all further development of this kind and the development of fishing in general.<br/>
In spite of what my hon. Friend has said, this is the time when, more than ever, the Government should be directly addressing themselves to the closure of the Minch and, as a major, separate issue, the extension of fishery limits generally. These are two questions which can be treated separately. There are examples from other countries of extending the limits. For many years, the Norwegians have claimed in practice the right to follow the shape of their country drawn along the base lines and to extend for several nautical miles beyond the base lines. The Western Island of Scotland and the Shetlands and Orkney, and a good part of the Highlands, too, could well adopt something of the same kind. The base line principle advocacy is something with which the Minister is so familiar that I shall not start arguing it now. It has rightly been argued many times and frequently advocated in this House.<br/>
I suggest, however, that if the Minister wants to encourage a modern, efficient fleet of dual-purpose vessels which would be able to do all-weather fishing and not lie part-year idle, which would be disastrous at present cost levels for the purpose of making a success of the present policy, he must give adequate protection in the fishing grounds, not only, as the hon. Member for Aberdeen-shire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon) said, against foreign trawlers, but against those vessels of our own trawling fleets who see fit to come within the territorial limits.<br/>
Among the British offenders, it is not only the larger syndicates and the bigger fellows who do all the depredations and damage. As often as not, it is the smaller seine-net men themselves who come in with their little fleets of seven or eight or, sometimes, more vessels into the bays of the Highlands and trawl well under the noses of the fishery protection service.<br/>
The cruisers cannot be everywhere at one time. They cannot all be concentrated in the Lewis bays or around Eriskay or Barra or across at the West Coast&#x2014;it is unfair and unreasonable to ask them to do so; but it is not unreasonable to ask the Minister to supplement and assist the work of the longer-distance cruisers by means of locally-based speedboats. We do not ask that they should replace the cruisers, although they are uneconomic and are too easily seen by what I might call the enemy miles away and their movements are far too easily signalled from one to another of the poacher fleets and vessels. If, however, the Minister intends to operate what is ostensibly his policy of restoring prosperity, both to the inshore and the other fleets, he must give greater protection within the existing limits as well as contemplate urgent action to extend the limits also.<br/>
We suggest to the Minister that in supplementing the service of the cruisers with the services of locally-based speedboats, manned partly by men who know the local waters and the ways of the local poachers&#x2014;in other words, they should have a certain number of local men aboard&#x2014;the Government and their Department should by one means or another also urge the courts of law to

enforce higher penalties even within the existing maxima.<br/>
If anything like even the present maximum fines and other penalties were imposed, we could clean up a great deal of the trouble that is harming the inshore fishermen. The difficulty is that when the master of a vessel appears before the local sheriffs, their hearts always seem to melt at the sight of the poor character who has been caught robbing the local fishermen. Some of them take the view, or some courts have done in the past, that the person whom they would like to see in front of them is the owner of the vessel and not the man who carries out their orders or takes a chance on their behalf. I, too, should like to see the owner or some of the directors of the firms and syndicates themselves appearing in court and given some of the publicity that is certainly no more welcome to the skipper than it is to them.<br/>
We should like to see, in some cases, not merely fines imposed. What is more hurtful to people who are prepared to take chances on illegal fishing is the detention of their vessel in port. That could hurt a great deal more than a mere money fine, which very often can be allowed for in the first night's depredations. It can be costed up very nicely in advance.<br/>
These things which we have so often advocated are still the views of the local authorities of Inverness-shire, Ross and Cromarty, Caithness and Sutherland, and also of the fishermen themselves, as well as of every Highland and Island Member in this House. I do not think that any hon. Member representing the Highlands and Islands dissents from my view that the Government should have closed the Minch years ago and, with the aid of the infusion of Government capital, should have helped to build up local fleets to a condition of efficiency and modern methods of fishing which would in time make them independent of subsidy and help them to increase their contribution to the national wealth.<br/>
Somebody has mentioned the Common Market. There are so many Frenchmen, West Germans and Belgians poaching amongst the bays and creeks of the north-west Highlands and the Hebrides that one would swear that we


were in the Common Market already. The only step further that those people have to go is to land the whole of their main catch here, instead of taking it back to their own countries, and render our home market position even more disastrous for our own people than it is already.<br/>
One can imagine how resentful and what a deep sense of injustice our fishermen in the Western Isles felt when, a few years ago, they went to sea, at Last, armed with rifles to fight off the poachers. These are men who had learned something in war-time about protecting not only themselves but other people. They and their forebears have been called up in every war in our history. That they were armed with rifles for self-defiance became known to the Press and was splashed in national headlines.<br/>
I wrote to the Prime Minister at the time, four or so years ago. He was horrified by the rifles. He is a man who does not believe in violence, except, of course, when reshuffling the Cabinet. He wrote and said, "For goodness sake, do anything reasonable you like. The fishermen have very great provocation, and I can understand the resentment of the small fishermen who see the big fellows coming in and appearing to be robbing their fishery bays, but do not use violence of any kind." This was shortly after the Tory Government's violence in Suez, and so, of course, the fishermen thought that this caution against violence was rather a joke.<br/>
However, there followed a promise of action by the Secretary of State for Scotland. He is also, unfortunately, one of the departed now since the Government reshuffle. For personal reasons, I am very sorry that that is the case. But there was a promise of action then, and that promise is still open. It has never been honoured. I do not for that blame the departed Secretary of State alone; but I do blame the Government on whose behalf he was speaking, with the Prime Minister's authority behind him, because the Prime Minister's words, in the 'letter to me, were that he was passing this for action to the Secretary of State, and presumably with his full support. So we expected action, and the Lewis men oiled their rifles and stacked them back at their crofts and waited for action, but the Secretary of State took no action.<br/>
No action has yet been taken. I can assure the hon. Gentleman the Undersecretary of State that the day is coming when, unless something is done about it, it will not take a third world war to bring these men out again with their rifles. It is a measure of their resentment and sense of injustice that they had to resort to that threat against people who provoked them night after night throughout every fishing season, robbers whose fleets they saw, openly lit up as often as not, well inside the limits, off the local island coasts, from Lewis southwards for over a hundred miles to the Barra coast. It is understandable that our Islands fishermen are resentful and feel a deep sense of injustice. I hope that they will not be provoked and forced eventually to violence, but if ever they are, then it must be remembered that it is the Government who must bear a great deal of the blame.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) will forgive me for not following him into his impending wars in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, although I do agree with a lot of what he said in his speech, which covered both countries, north and south of the Border. I shall mention fishery limits later in my speech.<br/>
I think that the House will agree that the most important issue raised in the Scheme is the question of the English and Scottish middle-water vessels and whether they are to be paid sufficient subsidies to allow them to continue to operate. Before I consider the future I should like to draw the attention of the House to the immediate background of this matter.<br/>
We start off, of course, with the Fleck Committee. Section 3 of the Committee's Report recommended that an operating subsidy should be paid to all vessels, and that included for the first time the distant-water vessels, and that it should be related to gross proceeds. The Committee suggested 3 per cent. for the distant-water ships and 7 per cent. for the middle-water vessels. It also suggested a special fund for supplementary payments.<br/>
We then come to the Government's reply in Cmnd. 1453, in which they said


that they agreed to the general idea of operating subsidies, but, in view of the loss of fishing grounds off Iceland, they suggested that the percentatge paid to the distant water ships should be 5 per cent. and not 3 per cent. They also suggested that year by year there should be, as it were, an annual price review, of the amount paid to each section of the fleet, and they approved the Fleck Committee's recommendation about the supplementary fund and said it should be a total of &#x00A3;3 million, of which &#x00A3;400,000 could be paid in any one year.<br/>
Continuing the background story we then come to the reply of the British Trawlers' Federation to the Government's suggestion, and that is contained in a letter, circulated, I think, to most hon. Members of the House, and dated August, 1961. It asked for a compounded subsidy. In other words, the Federation wanted the operating subsidy and the special fund to be compounded together and the same subsidy to be paid for three years, and then reduced progressively over the next seven years, ending completely in a total of ten years. It was claimed that this would end the uncertainty inherent in an annual price review.<br/>
I understand that under the Fleck recommendations and the Government's amendment of those recommendations the subsidies paid for the three sections of the industry would have been &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;8 per day for inshore vessels, &#x00A3;10&#x00B7;1 per day for middle water vessels, and &#x00A3;19&#x00B7;8 per day for distant water vessels. Under the B.T.F.'s recommendations those figures would be &#x00A3;10, &#x00A3;15, and &#x00A3;20, respectively.<br/>
Then followed a great deal of negotiation with my right hon. Friends and their Departments, and out of the negotiations came an agreement, and that agreement is contained in a letter to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from the President of the B.T.F. and the Chairman of the Aberdeen Fishing Vessel Owners' Association. That agreement said that the industry, as represented by the B.T.F. and the Aberdeen Fishing Vessel Owners' Association, would accept an operating subsidy of &#x00A3;9 per day for inshore vessels, &#x00A3;13 for middle water vessels and &#x00A3;15 for distant water vessels and that in the first two years this subsidy would be reduced by

not more than 7&#x00BD; per cent. and in subsequent years by between 7&#x00BD; and 12&#x00BD; per cent. They also agreed that there should be a special fund of &#x00A3;2&#x00BD; million compared with the &#x00A3;3 million already suggested.<br/>
I quote the figures to illustrate the difference between the Government's original proposals and the proposals we are now debating, which have been finally accepted by the owners of English and Scottish vessels. The original proposal for middle-water vessels was roughly &#x00A3;10 per day, and the final figure is &#x00A3;13, an increase of &#x00A3;3; the original proposal for distant-water vessels was &#x00A3;19&#x00B7;8, or a round figure of &#x00A3;20, and the final proposal is &#x00A3;15, a reduction of &#x00A3;5 per day.<br/>
Therefore, I do not think that it can be maintained that the distant-water section has not been prepared to sacrifice a certain amount to help 'the middle-water vessels in the difficulties which they have to face. [HON. MEMBERS: "Come off it."] When the Scottish Association repudiated the agreement which it had quite openly signed and agreed to, it in no way consulted or even informed the British Trawlers Federation that it intended to take this action. We realise that the middle-water vessels, particularly the Scottish ones, are a special case, which should be considered sympathetically. But an operating subsidy of &#x00A3;45 per day seems to me to be a very high one indeed.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is obviously exaggerating the case to suit the distant-water fleet which he represents, but he ought to be fair and say that there were continual discussions as well as correspondence passing between the B.T.F. and the Aberdeen owners and certainly the Newhaven and Granton Trawler Owners' Association. He is not correct in seeking to convey the impression to the House that nothing like that happened.</p>

<p>May I point out to my hon. Friend the Member for Haltem-price (Mr. Wall) that the Scottish trawler owners, to break even, asked for &#x00A3;25 or &#x00A3;33 a day, according to length? Those figures are very different from the subsidies being presented to the House now.</p>

<p>On the first point, the agreement, which is contained in a letter to the Association dated 30th October, 1961, says:
<q>If these proposals are acceptable to the Government, both the Federation and the Association would be glad to give their full support to the speedy passage of legislation to bring them into effect.</q>
That is a perfectly clear and categorical acceptance of the arrangements, freely entered into with the Government.<br/>
I do not want to be castigated too much by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) or the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Hoy). I have admitted that the middle-water fleet is in a difficult position, particularly the Scottish section, but we have to remember that it can now fish off Iceland. The moratorium has been mentioned by my right hon. Friend, and he has a lot of supplementary payments in his pocket which could be used in certain cases to help. The real point is that the difficulties, particularly in Scotland, are probably only temporary.</p>

<p>&#x2014;of which &#x00A3;350,000 can be used a year. I understand that this year he has &#x00A3;120,000 which has not yet been allocated. I am sure that if I am wrong my right hon. Friends will correct me. I see him nodding, so I assume I am right. That is quite a sum of money, and is can be augmented year by year.<br/>
I was making the point that the difficulties facing the middle-water vessels, particularly the Scottish vessels, may be only temporary. If we go into the European Economic Community, then the partners in the Common Market must agree that the limits will be abolished by 1970 or that there must be a common limit existing between all the partners by 1970.<br/>
That would do a very great deal to help the middle-water vessels (based on Aberdeen, or elsewhere. It will be a

great help if Norway and Denmark come in, as, presumably, they will, and it may be that Iceland will be forced to join the Community. These countries will then have to negotiate a common limit, and we shall have a considerable amount of say in those negotiations if the Treaty of Rome is taken to mean what it says in the appropriate clause. However, that still leaves the difficulties of this coming year before a final decision is made. I hope, therefore, that the proposals of my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South will be given very careful consideration.<br/>
We have heard about the extension of the limits for Iceland, Norway and the Faroes. But what about the limits for the United Kingdom? It seems to me that we should do something about this most important matter. There are two lines of policy which may be adopted, a positive or a negative one. Regarding the positive policy, I suggest to my right hon. Friend that he does what he can to increase the number of patrol vessels. There are not enough of them at present. I know that this would impose a strain upon he Royal Navy, but it would provide good training.<br/>
To increase the extent of their coverage perhaps it would be possible to operate helicopters from these vessels. Modern survey vessels and frigates carry helicopters as part of their equipment and helicopters could be used to check poaching witihin the existing limits. The hon. Member for the Western Isles referred to the necessity to impose suitable fines upon poachers similiar to those imposed by the Icelandic authorities upon our vessels. That would soon stop this practice.<br/>
From the negative point of view, I support the extension of our limits to six miles from headland to headland. I accept the suggestion of the hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland) that it is not wise to do so just as we are deciding whether to enter the European Economic Community. There is also the question of the Faroe negotiations. I have a suspicion that these will not be concluded until a decision has been arrived at about whether Denmark and Britain will enter E.E.C. But surely we can do something now. Cannot we get rid of the anomalies which exist, particularly those relating to Scotland?<br/>
I do not wish to become involved in Scottish matters any more than I am already, but I should like the Undersecretary of State for Scotland to give a direct answer on this matter. We have heard a lot about the Minch, the Firth of Clyde and the Moray Firth. A letter from various fishermen's associations, addressed to the Secretary of State for Scotland, includes a definite request and I should like to know whether it is reasonable and could be granted. They ask for
<q>the immediate enforcement of the provisions of the Herring Fishery (Scotland) Act 1889 as interpreted by the High Court of Justiciary in the case of Mortensen v. Peters in 1906. &#x2026; The effect of this would be to ban trawling by foreign vessels in the Moray Firth, the Firth of Clyde and the other Scottish estuaries and firths enumerated in the Schedule to that Act.</q>
It seems to make sense and would be justice to subject foreign vessels to the same laws as British vessels and I cannot see why that should not be done. I hope that the Under-Secretary will deal with the point.<br/>
Fundamentally, the whole question of limits arises from the need for conservation, as I am sure the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Sir D. Robertson) would agree. I am particularly worried about the industrial fishing which is going on, especially by the Danes. We shall not get anywhere with this problem until we have an international agreement and inspection. That should foe one of the matters to be considered by the partners in E.E.C. if the Community is extended to include our membership.<br/>
I understand that research is paid for by the Government and toy the White Fish Authority and, as has already been mentioned, the Authority wishes to put up its levy by another &#x00BD;d. to pay for more (research. I should like to quote a paragraph from an article in the <i>Fish Trades Gazette,</i> which states:
<q>Among those primarily concerned with research and experimental work on commercial fisheries there are the laboratories of the Fishery Departments, and of the D.S.I.R.; the recently appointed Experimental Work Advisory Group; the Herring Industry Board and the White Fish Authority, with its retinue of consultative committees and advisory panels. To this already-crowded field the authority now intends to add a further runner in the form of an industrial development unit.</q>

The article goes on to suggest that there should be far better co-ordination among the research organisations. I hope that the Minister will take this matter up through the White Fish Authority to see what can be done to get co-ordination among these authorities which are trying in various ways to do the same job.<br/>
I suggest that the subsidy rates that we are discussing are fair, but this is only an interim measure because the whole picture facing the fishing industry, particularly the middle-water industry, will be affected by the decision whether or not this country joins the European Economic Community. Whatever individual views on the Common Market may be, it seems that the fishing industry will greatly benefit from our joining the Common Market.</p>

<p>The main issue in this debate is the question of the Scottish trawler owners operating from Granton and Newhaven, and Aberdeen.<br/>
The Government, in 1951 and onwards, pressed the Aberdonians and the New-haven people to renew their fleets. Everywhere old vessels had been written off for many years before they were ultimately made obsolete, and they were making money operating in these over-fished grounds. They responded to the appeal of the Government to accept grants and loans to rebuild their fleets. They have done that in recent years, but it is not paying. The reason is that the capital cost is very high, much higher than non-capital cost of the written off craft. The main reason why they are not profitable is that they are not catching fish in sufficient quantities to make it pay. In spite of the very high prices which are ruling, they are losing money.<br/>
One may ask why the middle-water trawlers from Grimsby, Hull, Fleetwood and Milford Haven, which apparently are making ends meet, do not join with the Scottish Trawler Owners but want to adhere to the agreement? I think that the answer is that the Humber, Hull, Fleetwood and other ports work co-operatively. Most of the big groups have their own repair shops, their stores, supplies and victualling departments and


plough back the profits to the voyage account of each individual ship. I do not think that is done in Aberdeen, but it is something which is worth investigation. By talking steps to help those in most need that will come out.<br/>
The basic problem is that the fish are not there. I have said in this House for twenty-three years&#x2014;my hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall) and other hon. Members may be tired of hearing me say it&#x2014;that I remember the days when fish were prolific. In the early days of this century there was an abundance of fish which were selling cheaply all over the country. That was because the grounds had been fished by steam trawlers only since 1892 or 1893, a limited time compared with the time that the North Sea has been in existence. I congratulate the Government on what they have done.<br/>
They have dealt well with this problem, and I think that the supplementary moneys which are to be made available will prove helpful to Aberdeen. I hope they will be applied if the need is there. I urge hon. Members who make the claim, such as I have made, that our limits should be extended to seek to get all the nations whose joint heritage is the North Sea to come together and agree to rest these grounds. I do not think that closing some of the grounds for seven years, as the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) suggested, is the answer. The answer is to give the fish a chance of spawning. We give salmon and trout a chance to spawn and we give grouse and other game birds a chance to reproduce their species, but we do not give cod, haddock and herring, which are so much more important, a chance of survival. Successive Governments have allowed the grounds to be over-fished.</p>

<p>My suggestion was rather a throw-back to a recommendation which I made as a minority comment at the time of the Neven-Spence Report at the end of the war. We had in mind the very point with which the hon. Member is concerned&#x2014;conservation and an opportunity to rest the grounds. Immediately before the recommendation was made, during the war, places like Broad Bay in Lewis had had this opportunity, and

afterwards they yielded tremendous amounts of first-class fish from 1946 onwards, when they were open to fishing again. The rest did them a lot of good, and another seven years would have done them even more good.</p>

<p>I appreciate that, but the hon. Member will no doubt recollect asking me in a recent fishing debate how the Canadian and American halibut conservation agreement was working. I told him that according to the best information I had, it was doing wall and had begun to show signs of results within one year of the quantitative control being introduced. Halibut is the No. 1 white fish in that ocean, and the scheme was introduced by two friendly neighbouring nations, and it began immediately to prove successful<br/>
From my experience following World War I and World War II, I am convinced that if grounds had a chance to be rested, as they were in those days, despite the nation's great need for food, there would be plentiful supplies. In those days the middle-water craft fished right up against the minefields and produced a lot of fish, but when the war ended there were supplies in abundance &#x2014;but not for long. The trawlers soon went to work, going back to the same place day after day and particularly during spawning seasons when fish, heavily in spawn, are easily caught.<br/>
I am tired of making these appeals, and possibly hon. Members are equally tired of hearing them, but this is the only answer to the problem. Things will have to be made worse before they are better. But there is a great opportunity. The seas are enormous; there is far more sea than there is land area. Off the coasts of Africa and South America there are abundant supplies of fish. I know that the Advisory Committee of Industry has been working with officials in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food looking into these grounds and considering the edibility of the fish there. I cannot speak of Equatorial Africa, but I have knowledge of South Africa. I ate fish almost daily there because I enjoyed it so much. The species were different from ours but were very palatable.<br/>
The hope of Aberdeen lies in using these fine, modern trawlers, which are capable of going anywhere and fishing


anywhere in the world. Diesel-engined craft can be refuelled from a mother ship. A mother ship is essential unless there are shore bases&#x2014;which are preferable but which raise all kinds of other difficulties. I have been talking to some friends in the industry who seem to be fearful about mother ships, but I cannot see that there will be any difficulty about them. The trawlers themselves would no longer carry ice and their holds would be available for freezing their catches as they came on board. A frozen catch could be taken to the mother ship, and the catch would be preserved from the moment it was brought on board. The mother ship could freeze even more and could cold-store refrigerated transport ships could come alongside the mother ship&#x2014;</p>

<p>I apologise, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, for going out of order. I will pass on. I have always tried to make constructive speeches on an industry about which I know something. I have some experience of expedition fishing. It is no good year after year going back to the same grounds to get diminished quantities of fish. That is what is happening. It has been happening for a long time. Nobody can deny that. It is happening with distant-water grounds, too. The distant-water people are very good companions in the way that they immediately agreed to the middle-water craft going to the grounds to which they normally went. There is a very fine feeling in the catching side of the industry. It applies even to other nations. Our trawling industry has always been very friendly with the Germans and others. There are great international communities in these distant-water grounds. In the early days when we went up from Hull and Grimsby we were about the only people fishing there. Now craft from all nations fish there. Now that Aberdeen craft and other North Sea craft go fishing in distant waters I hope that it will make their year's return more profitable.<br/>
However it would be utter folly to go on hoping, like Mr. Micawber, that something will turn up. If we did that,

we should only be postponing an evil day. We have been doing that for far too long. The Government must face up to the situation. Subsidies are fundamentally wrong. Any industry up against it would be entitled to say that the Government must subsidise it. Where will it end? Where is the money coming from? I wholeheartedly approve of what the Government have done in this case, but I warn them. Their own officials and advisers must know this. It is not only white fish that is over fished. Herrings, are over fished. They have almost vanished. A week or two ago my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. WolrimGordon) asked what had happened to herring. I think that the answer was that it is just a natural thing that has happened. It is the most unnatural thing that has ever happened. They have been fished out at spawning time by trawlers which found out where the spawning took place off Buchan Ness and on Smith's Knoll off the East Anglian Coast. It is a history of over-fishing and successive Governments for years past have been blameworthy.<br/>
I do not think I shall ever make another speech like this, because I am so tired of it. I referred to this in my maiden speech, when fish food was terribly important to the nation. During the Second World War I made many speeches on the subject. The Coalition Government responded, but unfortunately it has now become an issue between the parties. Money is provided to try to keep the vessels afloat.<br/>
The Aberdonians who are refusing the moratorium&#x2014;the cessation of their payments, if they are not able to make them &#x2014;are honourable men. Perhaps they realise that this would just postpone the day of bankruptcy, to the detriment of the other creditors. I hope that the Government will pay some attention to this. They think that what I advocate is right for salmon and trout and other wild life but not for these fish. Yet the ordinary sea fish&#x2014;cod, haddock, and so on&#x2014;are vitally important as food for the public.</p>

<p>I want to make three points very shortly. I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Bodmin (Mr. Marshall) said about the inshore


situation, and especially about pilchards. We are grateful for the subsidy, but my right hon. Friend will remember that a year ago I brought a deputation to him on this subject. We were hoping for answers in September. We have not got the answers yet. We still do not know what is happening.<br/>
As my hon. Friend said earlier, if something is not done soon we may get to a stage where we will not have an industry to help. Then, as the last straw, we have South Africa, which is no longer a member of the Commonwealth but which still gets Commonwealth Preference. What justification there can be for that, I just cannot see.<br/>
My right hon. Friend said that these measures will help all sections of the industry, but he knows jolly well what I am about to say. The one section they do not help&#x2014;and I make no apologies for having made this point time and again for at least eight years, and I shall go on making it as long as I am in this House&#x2014;is the shell fishermen. What are called Dublin Bay prawns, or scampi, are caught by trawlers, and that trade is flourishing, but some of the men in Morecambe Bay who are catching shrimps are not flourishing, and the shell fishermen in my part of the country are not flourishing, either.<br/>
One of the reasons is this. My right hon. Friend may have seen that at a meeting of inshore interests the other day it was agreed that every 24 hours of the day at least 150 foreign trawlers are poaching in our territorial waters. A large number of those poaching in my area are Frenchmen, who can come in because of our present limits.<br/>
It was for that reason that in debating an earlier Order I asked for enlightenment about sea fisheries committees having their own boats. The reply was that that would be a very expensive business, but that is not the right idea. What we need is a much smaller and faster vessel which can keep at sea locally based, manned locally, and with a local man in command who knows the waters, and knows where the Frenchmen are likely to be.<br/>
We know that today it is difficult for the Royal Navy to produce small vessels for the fisheries protection squadron, but

we want small vessels, with good sea-keeping qualities, and manned by fishermen who are a jump ahead of the Frenhmen. Why cannot we have some assistance to build those ships? We have one already in Cornwall, and other sea fisheries committees have them, too. As a result of the complexities of an Order still to be discussed, we shall have greater problems in policing the area, and small vessels such as these might help.<br/>
I want to emphasise what has been said about research. We have Torry, and Plymouth, the White Fish Authority and a number of other bodies, one of which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall), all doing research work, but it is highly important that there should be real coordination of their work so that they are not all working independently on their own. There should be properly co-ordinated research in the industry, otherwise we might have the White Fish Authority going in for one thing, Torry doing something else, and Plymouth researching something entirely different. There should be proper co-ordination of all these different forms of research, with full interchange of information.<br/>
While I agree with the comments of the hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland) about fishing limits, it should be remembered that, unfortunately for the inshore industry, it always seems to be the wrong moment. This applies to discussions re the Faroes at the moment. This brings me to the question of our entering the Common Market. People often speak optimistically about this, but do they really think that, if we enter E.E.C. the Icelanders or the Danes will automatically revise their limits or that they will allow our trawlers back in their waters? That is pure wishful thinking.<br/>
From the Scottish point of view, for heaven's sake let the Government do something about the Moray Firth, the Minch and the Clyde. How the situation has been allowed to develop and why it has been allowed to go on for so long, I do not understand. Something really must be done. Only if the Government take some action will the fishermen see Chat something is being done about conservation. Let us show everyone, even before we go into the Common Market negotiations, that we are prepared to do


something about our fishing limits. A new scheme for fishery protection vessels, as suggested, would show our inshore men that we really want to help them.<br/>
We are grateful for assistance from the Government, but they should remember that help to a non-existent fishing fleet will be no good to anyone.</p>

<p>I had intended to say that we all wish my right hon. Friend good luck in the difficult negotiations he will be undertaking.<br/>
This has been a difficult year for the fishing industry as a whole. It has experienced a good many set backs, many of which, I hope, will not be repeated in future years. The speech of my noble Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) showed clearly the difficulties under which the Scottish fleet has been operating and these hardships apply equally elsewhere. I suppose that my constituents have experienced this last winter some of the worst conditions for a long time. Apart from the weather, there have been increased imports&#x2014;at a time when we did not want them&#x2014;and the potato shortage with extremely high prices for potatoes. This has had a marked effect on the demand for fish, for example; the fish and chip shops not requiring so much. All this has meant the price of fish falling to an unremunerative level and, at the same time, there have been increased costs to the fishing industry.<br/>
The supplementary fund, which is designed to help out certain sections of the fleet in special circumstances, is

important. There is stall left in the fund &#x00A3;120,000 and some of it will have to go to Aberdeen and Grimsby. Some of it, I think, will also have to go to Lowestoft, and it will be seen that not much will be left. My right hon. Friend may, therefore, have to consider the Fund again because although it is desirable that the fishing fleet should stand on its own feet, that may not be possible. More than the &#x00A3;2&#x00BD; million at present allowed for over the ten year period may have to be increased.<br/>
I want to ask one or two questions. Is depreciation taken into account in the profit and loss accounts of the trawlers when they are submitted to the Minister? I got the impression that the Minister intends to disregard completely the depreciaition, and that would not be correct. Will he say whether or not the supplementary fund can be brought in at any time and cut off at any time, so that if the industry find that it is doing better it can do without it and if it is needed it can have it? I do not think that it is something that should go on for a long time if it is not required.<br/>
My own port has had a rough time during the last year and particularly in the last four months. I understand that when applications for supplementary funds were reviewed accounts for only the last four months were produced. This was not considered a long enough period in which to judge the profitability of that section of the industry, whereas if accounts could be produced for a longer period to show that it was losing a lot of money that would have been taken into consideration. For how long has a section of the industry to be doing badly before the supplementary fund can be administered?<br/>
Finally, on the question of the White Fish Authority, I agree very much with what was said by the hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland). Apart from the Income Tax assessment which must strike anyone as being quite ridiculous, there are some other items in the White Fish Authority's accounts which worry me. For example, I am not certain that it is the White Fish Authority's job to carry out publicity on behalf of the fishing industry. This should be left to the very large firms or groups of firms which are publicising their own policy. To spend &#x00A3;74,000 in this way is a waste. We


cannot get enough publicity for &#x00A3;74,000 to do any good, and in any case it is not the White Fish Authority's job. I hope that item of expenditure will be looked at carefully, and also the cost of administration. This has gone up considerably in the last few years from a total of &#x00A3;137,000 in 1960&#x2013;61 to &#x00A3;143,000 this year and an estimate of &#x00A3;162,000&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am very grateful to you. Mr. Speaker, for your advice. I should not like to pursue the matter at length except to say that the fishing industry is extremely worried about the activities of the White Fish Authority at the moment in the maldistribution of some of the money that it receives from the industry. I hope that my right hon. Friend will look very carefully at the affairs of the White Fish Authority before he allows it to increase the levy which it proposes to increase at the moment.<br/>
Concerning experimental work, I understood from the Fleck Committee's Report that this was to be a responsibility of the Government. It now appears that the White Fish Authority is to undertake this work and that the cost of doing so will come out of the White Fish Authority. I did not understand in the first place that this was the intention.<br/>
To sum up, I hope the industry will have a good year. I hope my right hon. Friend will realise the difficulties that it is going through, and I trust that next year when we debate these provisions again he will either have a happier tale

to tell or he will be able to do something more to help this industry.</p>

<p>In a very long and interesting debate we have travelled from Greenland to Africa. There has been mention of conservation and action against foreign countries. I know, Mr. Speaker, that you would rule me out of order if I were to attempt to cover those subjects. Therefore, I shall merely content myself by saying that I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. Malcolm MacMillan) and that action is called for to protect the fishing grounds against the depredations of foreign trawlers.<br/>
This Scheme extends these subsidies for ten years, and I must tell the Minister this evening what I said on Second Reading when the Bill from which the Scheme flows was introduced. I am glad to have the support of the hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir). I said during the Second Reading debate, and I repeat, that I thought the industry was foolish to agree to write into this agreement that in ten years' time in would be viable and that no more subsidy would be necessary. I thought that the industry was wrong then and I think that it is still wrong. That is why I do not approve of these Statutory Instruments as they are drafted.<br/>
As I said earlier today, whether we take these Statutory Instruments separately or together they will not provide a solution to the difficulties that confront the fishing industry. We are living in a fool's paradise if we think that they will.<br/>
I was a little surprised at hon. Members opposite, especially the hon. Member for Haltemprice (Mr. Wall), who, I am sorry to say, is not here at the moment, saying that this agreement, having been reached, is sacrosanct and that we must never make changes even if we find that mistakes have been made. Even the Scheme has been changed since it was presented. One only has to look at the names on the Scheme. It was promoted by the right hon. Gentleman the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and it bears the name "John S. Maclay", who, apparently, was Secretary of State for Scotland and has now departed from that office. There is a


further change. It was signed by a Lord Commissioner of the Treasury, a "Mr. Michael Noble". I understand that he is now Secretary of State for Scotland. Therefore, even the Scheme itself has changed. We cannot have control over all these things. If we find that a mistake has been made, even if the Minister himself makes a mistake, the House is always ready and willing to accept an apology. It is much better to own up to a mistake rather than persist in it.<br/>
The British Trawlers Federation signed that agreement. It does not seek to deny it. I do not know why the hon. Member for Haltemprice made such a to-do about it. Perhaps he wanted to speak tonight because he was not present during our debates on the Sea Fish Industry Bill. I believe that he was in Africa at the time. Of course, he has a right to go to Africa if he wants to go there, but he must not seek to make up for lost time tonight. Meetings were held with the fisheries committees of both parties. They did not seek to hide the fact that they had signed the agreement. Those who attended either of the meetings are bound to admit that they were, if not coerced, certainly pressed into making this agreement so as not to show any division within the British Trawlers' Federation, or between the Federation, the Aberdeen Association and the Government. I think that that is a fair summary of the situation. Indeed, the Newhaven and Granton Trawler Owners' Association wrote to the B.T.F. and said that the proposal would in no way meet their position.<br/>
It is no secret to tell the House that the B.T.F. said, "Let us go on negotiating, but do not let us show any differences. Let us show solidarity in the matter". So this agreement was reached. But it was not long before the trawler owners of Scotland came to the conclusion that what was contained in these proposals would not meet the needs of the Scottish situation. They have gone further, because today they have sent telegrams, which, no doubt, most hon. Members have received, asking us to vote against the proposals and saying that if we accept them it means the collapse of the Scottish trawling industry and a serious threat to employment. They say, also,

that the situation would be no less serious for the near and middle-water trawlers in England.<br/>
It is true that these provisions will have a greater impact in Scotland because there are more family businesses there than there are large concerns as there are in the constituencies represented by the hon. Member for Haltemprice and my hon. Friend the Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland). If my information is correct, there is an association in Grimsby which will collect more subsidies under these schemes than will the whole Scottish fleet put together.</p>

<p>I thought that this might provoke the hon. Member. I know that they catch more fish. I am not saying that they do not. It is unfortunate that as soon as one says something about which the hon. Member is stuck for an argument he immediately goes on to something else. I do not deny that they catch more fish, but surely he will not deny that if these small industries went out in Scotland it might mean the collapse of a whole village.</p>

<p>On this point of family businesses the impression was given by the hon. Lady the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) and my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Hoy) that the English middle-water fleet consists entirely of giant combines. This is not correct. In Grimsby a large part of the middle-water fleet consists of family businesses in the same way as it does in Aberdeen.</p>

<p>I agree that that is so, and I shall have something to say about it before I finish. If my hon. Friend will allow me to deal with the Scottish position first, I shall come south of the Border later.<br/>
During the past few weeks I have had the privilege of meeting one or two owners from the constituency of the hon. Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior), not that I went out of my way to do so but I was in the vicinity on other parliamentary business, and they, also, had a story to tell me. All I say is that these proposals will in no way meet the needs of the Scottish trawler owners, and the Secretary of State for Scotland,


if not the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, must take cognisance of this.<br/>
The reason why there has been this difference of opinion between Scottish owners and the British Trawlers' Federation is not that they want to be at war with each other&#x2014;far from it. The Scottish owners came to the conclusion that the distant water fleet had such great power inside the B.T.F. that in the case of the middle-waiter trawler owner was apt to get lost in the process of negotiations. They said that if the special difficulties of Scotland were to be recognised that could best be done by a purely Scottish association. That is why the Scottish Trawler Owners' Association has been formed. To suggest, as some have suggested, that it is only the Scottish owners who are complaining is quite wrong.<br/>
I had a letter from a trawler owner with a fairly large business in Lowestoft, a man with whom I have been personally friendly for many years, and he complained about the position of his middle-water fleet. I sent his letter to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and the right hon. Gentleman said that he would go into the figures which this owner had provided.<br/>
The peculiar feature was that the losses estimated by this particular owner approximated to the losses of the Scottish trawler owners. The hon. Member for Lowestoft must know that the vessels in this section of the fleet in Lowestoft have been making considerable losses this year. Although the Minister says that we cannot go on only one year, the past year, he cannot deny that these losses have continued this year and that boats in the middle-water fleet in Scotland and in Lowestoft&#x2014;at least in the section of which I know&#x2014; are making losses of from &#x00A3;4,000 to &#x00A3;6,000 per annum. The situation is not getting any better, and this is the situation which we must meet.<br/>
The hon. Member for Haltemprice says that a subsidy of &#x00A3;45 a day would be necessary, as if this were the only answer to the problem. I have argued times without number that a subsidy is not in itself a solution to the problem, but it might be as well, in view of the position of the Scottish economy today, when

so many of our basic industries are disappearing, that this price should be paid for the next two or three years to keep the industry going. The alternative can only be unemployment, and this will be much more expensive.<br/>
This is why the Scottish trawler owners have asked us to oppose these proposals. This gives us not great satisfaction. The difficulty about measures of this kind is that, by opposing them, one denies assistance which one can give to other sections of the fleet and even the mediocre assistance offered to the Scottish fleet. This is the difficulty we face tonight.<br/>
It has been suggested that it is only the middle-water vessel owner who complains. Nothing of the kind. Great tributes have been paid in the House today to certain vessels which have been built recently, vessels which are regarded as experimental, and tributes have been paid on this occasion, as on many others, to the firm which has built and is now operating the Fairtrys. These vessels cost about &#x00A3;450,000, three times the cost of a normal fishing vessel. I have raised this matter before because, although it does not fish from my constituency, the headquarters of the parent company which built these vessels is in my constituency. This company has said to the Minister that the boasted &#x00A3;15 may be all right as a daily payment to a company which has built a trawler costing &#x00A3;150,000, but what about those who have built vessels at a cost of &#x00A3;450,000?<br/>
If the argument of the hon. Member for Haltemprice has any weight, this company should have his support. I do not know why he did not speak up for it tonight. Vessels of this kind, apparently, catch three times as much as is caught by a conventional trawler, but only the same amount of subsidy is paid. The company argues, quite logically, I think, just as the middle-water fleet owners say that they are not getting sufficient, that the subsidy it is being paid does not in any way compensate for the tremendous outlay it has had in building these vessels or for the catches which they bring in.<br/>
All that I am pointing out is that the complaint comes not only from the middle-water fleet, but from the people who have spent money on building this type of vessel, to Which great tributes


have been paid. Although we have sent all the relevant facts to the Ministry, they have had no satisfaction from the replies which they have received. Therefore, at the end of the day they have willy-nilly to accept the proposals laid down in the Scheme.<br/>
A very serious problem confronts the Scottish trawler fleet. The Under-Secre-tary of State cannot escape that. It is obvious that this Scheme will in no way meet the situation. The Minister should be forthright and should make up his mind on whether it is just to sink&#x2014;that is the right word&#x2014;into oblivion. Is be prepared to make up his mind that it should go if it is economically impossible for it to live? Must it go? If that is the case, let the Minister say so quite openly and fairly, and then the industry will know where it is and Scotland will know what to expect.<br/>
If the Minister does not want this industry to go, what does he propose to do for it? That is a decision which rests only with the Government. The owners in Scotland do not regard the moratorium as any solution of their problem. They are worried about the &#x00A3;175,000 per annum which they are behind in their repayments to the White Fish Authority. Merely to say to them, "You will not have to pay what you owe us for the next two years" is no solution. All that that does is to put off the evil day, and eventually the repayments will be greater than ever.<br/>
In paragraph 7 of the proposals which govern the granting or otherwise of a moratorium, it is made clear that
<q>interest will be charged on the sums overdue in accordance with normal commercial practice.</q>
To think that by granting a moratorium for two years the owners will not only be able to meet their present commitments, but will be able to meet their back payments as well plus 6&#x00BC; per cent., is just nonsense.<br/>
A great deal of the money owed by the industry is not the repayment of capital but the very heavy interest charges imposed because of the Government's policy. This applies not only to the fishing industry, but to agriculture, housing, and so on. If the Government wanted tonight to make a real contri-

bution to solving the difficulties of this section of the industry, the best thing which they could have done was to make a substantial cut in the interest charges imposed by them. To insist on these high charges is to maintain the existing high debt.<br/>
I wonder whether any hon. Gentleman has ever heard of proposals such as these before an owner qualifies for the moratorium. The White Fish Authority will be able to go to every business and to send its accountants to look at the books. It will be able even to deny an owner the right to go in for new development without the Authority's approval. No director will get a fee, nor will any emolument be paid unless the permission of the Authority has been obtained. A sort of Gestapo has to go in on behalf of the Authority before a moratorium is approved. No self-respecting business would allow it to take place. The Minister must, therefore, find something different from the moratorium for solving the difficulties.<br/>
We shall look forward to what the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland has to say. His is a great responsibility tonight. He must, at the very least, be able to give us an assurance that the Scheme is not the final word of the Government concerning Scotland nor of those sections of the middle-water fleet who experience the same difficulty. If he cannot do that, let the country understand that he is, as has been said by the Scottish Trawler Owners' Association, condemning them. Scotland cannot afford to lose another of her basic industries.</p>

<p>We have had a wide-ranging debate on the two Schemes and the Order, and many interesting points and suggestions have been made from both sides of the House. I should like to start by taking up some words of the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Peart), who in opening the debate said that fishing has not had too easy a time. We would all agree with that. Certainly, I should be the last to be too optimistic for the industry. At the same time, however, it has been appreciated that not all the difficulties, but the main ones, facing the industry concern the near and middle-water trawlers, not only those of


Scotland, although I know fully about the trawlers both of Granton and Aberdeen. In discussing these United Kingdom Measures, we must be fair and remember that there are other near and middle-water trawlers in England and south of the Border which, at the same time, are also experiencing difficulty.<br/>
I agree very much with my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Lady Tweedsmuir) in saying that she regretted that the Scottish owners had found it necessary to repudiate the tripartite agreement which they made with the B.T.F. and with the Government. I, too, very much regret that they have found it necessary to do do this. At the same time, as my right hon. Friend the Minister said in opening the debate, the Government have to take into account that all the members of the B.T.F., comprising 530 out of 670 boats, are adhering to that agreement. Therefore, the Government have to take that fact very much into consideration.<br/>
What do we do about Aberdeen? My right hon. Friend and I have given deep and careful thought to the point. We have met trawler owners both from Aberdeen and from Granton in what, I understand, is now the new Scottish Trawlers' Association, although at the time we mat them it had not been formed. My right hon. Friend listened carefully to all the points they made.<br/>
It has been brought out in the debate that there are three matters in which the Government can help. First, as my right hon. Friend said, we are lifting the ban on fishings in distant waters. We should not underestimate the importance of this. It could be very important that some of the bigger vessels in the middle-water fleet should be able to go to distant waters and catch fish. Not only will that in itself help, but it will also relieve the amount of fishing which is taking place in the middle and near waters. Secondly, there is the question of deferred repayment of loans, which has been fully explained tonight. Thirdly, there is the supplementary fund. It is interesting&#x2014;it is very natural, and I understand it&#x2014;that various hon. Members, be they from Grimsby or Lowestoft or Aberdeen, are already starting to try to put their finger on that supplementary fund, or what is left of it. Here I would tell my hon. Friend the Member for Lowestoft (Mr. Prior) that of course these

amounts need not be fox any specific time. Orders can be brought in later to allocate what is left of the fund, provided, of course, we keep within the limits laid down by the Act of &#x00A3;350,000 a year and a total of &#x00A3;2&#x00BD; million over ten years.<br/>
After our full debate and the close understanding which all hon. Members have shown of this subject, I would not think it would be necessary for me to go fully into the background of the matter, the Fleck Committee's Report and the Government's White Paper leading to negotiations. I think all hon. Members fully understand the position. If I may I will go back for a moment to the Scottish position because the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Hoy) challenged me to face up to it.<br/>
I want to say this to him. While he may say and while the fishermen of Aberdeen may say that the industry there is faced with collapse, I do not believe that that is so. We in this House know the resiliency and the ingenuity and the efficiency of fishermen in all parts of great Britain, and I know about it in Scotland. We know, too, that this business of catching fish fluctuates from year to year. They have had a bad year; prospects for next year are not good; but in 1958 and 1959 fairly reasonable profits were made. We really must wait to see how this works out. Of course, if the Secretary of State fox Scotland were faced with the total collapse of the Aberdeen fleet in, let us say, a year's time or two years' time, and if it were likely to happen just like that, we could not allow it, but, on the other hand, I think it would be unreasonable, in view of the agreement which had been come to, in view of the fact that the B.T.F. are adhering to it, and in view of the fact that the Government have taken steps through the supplementary fund and the moratoria and the lifting of the ban on distant-water fishing, not to leave the matter there for the moment.<br/>
A number of hon. Members have raised this very difficult and very delicate question of the fishery limits. Several hon. Members have urged that we should at once adopt the six to 12-miles fishery limit and measure that limit from straight base lines. The proposals which the Scottish inshore fishermen have put forward, with the support of their


English colleagues, are being very carefully studied. We appreciate that there are arguments for reviewing the United Kingdom policy on this matter, and that we are doing. I am extremely sorry that tonight I cannot at this Box go further than that.<br/>
The hon. Member for Grimsby (Mr. Crosland) raised the subject of the White Fish Authority levy. I understand that the position is that under the statutory procedure the Authority is required to advertise its proposals and consider any objections made to it and, if it decides to proceed, to submit the regulation to my right hon. Friends for confirmation, together with the objections. It then falls to the Ministers to consider the Authority's proposals and the objections, and, if they decide to confirm the Authority's regulations with or without modification, to lay before the House an Order Which is subject to negative Resolution.<br/>
At present the Authority is only at the stage of consulting the interests concerned and considering the objections which those interests have raised. No regulations are yet before Ministers, and, therefore, I must not prejudice the consideration of this matter, which we are required to carry out in a judicial manner, by making any comments at this stage. However, I think it will be clear to the hon. Gentleman from what I have said that there are ample safeguards to ensure that all views are taken into account.<br/>
My hon. Friends the Members for Bodmim (Mr. Marshall) and St. Ives (Mr. G. R. Howard) raised two specific points. The first concerned the research programme for pilchards in the south-west. I know that this has been going on for some time and that perhaps patience is becoming exhausted. However, what the White Fish Authority is trying to establish is where pilchards can be caught during the winter months to make worth while the type of arrangements we would all like to see made. The Authority is pressing on with this programme, and I understand that Sir Louis Chick is at present in Truro discussing next winter's programme.<br/>
The other point was about the coordination of research, which interests

a great many hon. Members. The activities of the Government laboratories at Lowestoft and Aberdeen and the Government-assisted laboratories at Plymouth and Millport are coordinated by the Advisory Committee on Fisheries Research of the Development Commission, which also keeps an eye on the research and development work of the White Fish Authority and Herring Industry Board, and there is also close interdepartmental contact with the Torry Research Station of D.S.I.R.<br/>
I would conclude by referring to the adventurous spirit of my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Sir D. Robertson). His speech tonight, like his speeches in the past&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>]&#x2014;I am not ashamed of this&#x2014;shows in regard to fishery matters that he has the right spirit of adventure to go forth and try to find fish in other parts of the world. At the same time I heartily endorse his views about the need for conservation. I believe that the British fishing industry will succeed if it faces up to its problems in that spirit.</p>

<p>The prohibition Order and the landings ban Order have been introduced to implement the announcement made during the progress of the Bill for the recant Sea Fish Industry Act that the Government proposed, when the powers became available under that Act, to introduce an Order prohibiting drift-net fishing for salmon off the coasts of Scotland and the Tweed as from 15th September, 1962, and to support that prohibition with a ban on the landing of salmon.<br/>
My right hon. Friend first announced the Government's intention of taking this action on 1st August last year, when it became evident that the new practice of drift-net fishing for salmon was growing with great rapidity in certain areas off the East Coast of Scotland. The licensing Order has been introduced with a view to preventing the development off the coasts of England and Wales of a similar situation to that which has arisen in Scotland, and, at the same time, make allowances for boats which have practised drift netting for salmon for many years.<br/>
I think that by now hon. Members are familiar with the reasons for the action we are taking. This new fishery started in Scotland in 1960 and has developed very rapidly. It has developed so rapidly that the growth has greatly exercised the Government on its possible effects in two ways. First, the effect on the established commercial fisheries which give employment to 1,600 or 1,700 men who see their jobs in jeopardy. I might also mention the salmon angling which plays an important part in the Scottish economy.<br/>
Secondly, and of even more importance, is the effect upon our valuable salmon stocks. On this matter, I know that there is a unanimity of views. As we have explained in earlier debates, we were advised when drift netting started that if it developed to a large extent over a wide area it could be damaging to stocks, though direct evidence might not be available for four or five years. I do not think that I need to labour these points tonight. The fact is that the drift-net industry has continued to expand rapidly and steadily.<br/>
The catch rose from about 9,000 fish &#x2014;all off the Tweed&#x2014;in 1960 to about 28,000 in 1961. For 1962, the figures

which we have show that up to 7th July of this year more than 65,000 salmon have been caught by this method. The number of boats participating&#x2014;</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman tell us what has been the catch by methods which he regards as legal? Is it not the fact that there has been such a superabundance that it has caused embarrassment in the Billingsgate fish market?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1962-07-16a.162.1" hansard_membership_id="7694" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17130" speakername="Mr. Leburn" colnum="162" time="">
<p>I am not aware of that. I was trying to show the steady increase from 9,000 in 1960 to 28,000 in 1961 and to 65,000 this year. I think that it is clear that there is no let-up.<br/>
I realise that the drift-net fishermen are anxious that they should be allowed to continue what, admittedly, we realise has been to them a lucrative form of fishing. As we expected they are strongly opposed in principle to prohibition and suggested that no action should be taken until we have the report of the Hunter Committee, which is reviewing the whole law on salmon and trout in Scotland and which was asked particularly to give priority to that part of its remit dealing with the regulation of fishing which, of course, includes drift-netting.<br/>
I know that the Committee is giving priority to this matter and is pressing on with all speed with the taking of evidence about it from the appropriate bodies. But the Chairman has reported that the Committee is not yet able to say whether it will be possible to submit an interim report on the question, and naturally, it cannot say yet, if that proves practicable, when it will be able to do so.<br/>
In view of this we have felt it essential to take action now. I am quite sure that it is better to be safe than sorry. Certainly, when the Committee's report is received&#x2014;or the interim report if it makes one&#x2014;the recommendations it makes on drift-net fishing will receive immediate and careful consideration and the action which has been taken will be reviewed in the light of the Committee's report.<br/>
The prohibition Order provides that during the period 15th September, 1962, to 15th February, 1965, fishing for salmon and migratory trout shall be prohibited in a specified area off the


coast of Scotland and the Tweed. Inside territorial waters the prohibition applies to all fishing boats. Outside territorial waters it applies to British-owned fishing boats, whether registered or not. The area to which the prohibition applies is set out in the Schedule to the Order. I do not think I need take up the time of the House in describing the boundaries in too great detail.<br/>
Broadly, what we have done is to make the prohibited area a kind of box completely enclosing Scotland and the mouth of the Tweed with its sides far enough off the coast to include all the waters where salmon returning to Scottish rivers and to the Tweed might be caught by drift-nets. Except in the south-east, where we start with the area of the Tweed district as defined by Statute, the whole of which is included in the prohibition, the boundary lines all run east and west or north and south.<br/>
The boundary is thus fairly simple and I do not think hon. Members will have much difficulty in following it. Only on the south-west does it look a little involved. Here, it follows a rather zig-zag pattern in order to avoid encroaching on an area off the north of Ireland where there has been a traditional drift-net fishery for salmon.<br/>
I turn to the position in the area south of the prohibited area. Inside territorial limits off the coasts of England and Wales drift-net fishing will continue to be subject to control by river boards, as hitherto. Outside those limits it will be subject to licensing by my right hon. Friend under the licensing Order within the area described in the Schedule to that Order. In this case it has not been practicable, because of the configuration of the coast, to define the area by straight lines of latitude and longtitude and for the most part the boundary is drawn 25 miles from the coast.<br/>
The purpose of the licensing Order is to control drift-netting off the coast of England and Wales to prevent a situation developing similar to that which has arisen off Scotland, and, at the same time, to allow the small number of fishermen who traditionally fished with drift-nets inside and outside territorial waters to continue to do so.<br/>
My right hon. Friend proposes to consult the river boards before granting

licences and to impose conditions as to close seasons, close times, types of nets, and so on, corresponding to those in adjacent river board areas. The prohibited area&#x2014;particularly those parts of it where drift-net fishing has been taking place&#x2014;will be patrolled by protection ships, but it would be very difficult by this means alone to ensure over the extensive area that there is no breach of the prohibition.<br/>
That is why we have introduced the Restriction of Landing Order. Under this Order the landing of salmon caught in waters to which the prohibition Order and the licensing Order apply will be prohibited, but exception is made for fish caught under licenses from either river boards or from the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.<br/>
I think that I have said enough to show what the Orders will do and why I think they are necessary.</p>

<p>After about six hours on fishing&#x2014;I see that one or two other hon. Members have arrived since 10 p.m.&#x2014; we are getting to the tail end of the debate. The official licensing hour, closing time, in Scotland is 10 p.m. One or two other hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry), have arrived for the closing stages of the debate.<br/>
I do not wish to prolong the discussion, nor have I much more to say on this Order. This is a rotten Order. I have said so before. It is brought in under the most dubious circumstances. I will briefly recall what has happened. Certain private interests wanted this Order introduced to protect the private rights of private river owners, and the Government felt that there was not sufficient evidence for this. In fact, the noble Lord, Earl Waldegrave in another place made it clear that they had not sufficient evidence to do what the Government were being requested to do. As a result of that, he got the sack today.<br/>
This having been done, what I have called a shoal of noble Lords arrived from Scotland, including the Queen's Factor. They descended on another place and stampeded the Secretary of State for Scotland&#x2014;he was involved, not the Minister of Agriculture, who has nothing to do with this Order&#x2014;into taking action against the drift-net fishermen.


He has been sacked, too. The only difference is that he was sacked yesterday.</p>

<p>He got the sack, anyway. Both Ministers have disappeared. The Government are so determined that this Order shall be enforced against the poor drift-net fishermen that tine Chairman of the Tory Party in Scotland has been made Secretary of State for Scotland has been made Secretary of State for Soot-land to see that it is carried out.<br/>
Do they intend to apply it to all fishermen? Not a bit of it. This prohibition against drift-net fishing for salmon is against only British fishermen. Despite all the verbiage with which the Under-Secretary of State wrapped up this statement&#x2014;and it is becoming a habit of the Scottish Office never to say quite what they mean but to surround it with a lot of padding&#x2014;it means that foreign fishermen can come into our waters and fish up to the three-mile limit for salmon, drift-netting and all. The only fishermen who are prohibited under the Order are British fishermen.<br/>
To bolster up his case the Joint Undersecretary of State quoted a lot of figures about salmon which have been caught by drift-net fishermen. He has given us some meticulous figures. I only wish that he could produce them when they are needed. Apparently they can be produced only when he wants to bolster up this very flimsy case. He does not even make comparison with the large amount of salmon being caught at present by ordinary methods. If he were to do so he would weaken considerably the case which he has made against the drift-net fishermen. I do not object to the ordinary fisherman doing well out of it; that is why they are in business. But we cannot consider the problem of salmon and migratory trout without taking into consideration not only the methods of the drift-net fishermen but also those of the stake-net fishermen and all the rest. Indeed, one has to remember the considerable power of the Tweed Fishing Company and the many thousands of &#x00A3;s which they earn by catching salmon.<br/>
If the Government had been really interested in all this, they would have

examined that question and would have had a look at the question of the salmon which are destroyed by river pollution, which might be wreaking much greater havoc on our salmon stocks than drift-net fishermen. One of the extraordinary things about the Order is this. When a Government want to do somethihng they normally first want to put off doing it and they appoint a committee. The committee usually reports after two or three years. If we follow the practice of this Government whether it be the Devlin Commission or the Pilkington Committee, the Government then decide to do nothing about the Report.<br/>
On this occasion they did not take the chance. The Government introduced the Order to prohibit drift-net fishing for salmon. Having enacted this legislation, they set up a committee under Lord Hunter to see if it was the right thing to do. They first introduced the prohibition and than set up the committee to find out if the prohibition was necessary.<br/>
If all these salmon were being caught, why should Lord Hunter have this difficulty? The Under-Secretary said in introducing the Order that the Committee was giving priority to this question. He said&#x2014;I think I quote his exact words &#x2014;"Lord Hunter thinks it might be difficult to bring in a report in a very short time, perhaps not even by 15th September". If drift-net fishing for salmon is producing so many salmon, why is it difficult for Lord Hunter and his Committee to find this out for themselves and report accordingly? The hon. Gentleman cannot have the argument both ways.<br/>
I have great faith in most of the Scottish Law Lords. I think that Lord Hunter will do a very good job, together with his Committee. I can only express the hope that he will. If it is so apparent that drift-net fishermen are doing all that they are supposed to be doing, Lord Hunter and his Committee should have no difficulty in finding the evidence to submit to the Secretary of State for Scotland. Apparently it is going to be a little more difficult than at first envisaged.<br/>
I condemned the proposal at the beginning. I condemn it today. I do not think that the Order will do any good.


The Secretary of State has given way to the pressure of the noble Lords of Scotland and the interests of the Tory Party. We on this side have argued for years for the conservation of our fishing stock &#x2014;salmon stock or any other fishing stock. We think that that is a sensible thing for any country to do and for any group of countries to do. But let us at least produce some evidence about it. If it is necessary, I assure the Government that we should be only too delighted to co-operate, but the flimsy evidence that they have produced so far can only make us believe that they are giving way to some selfish private interests against which they care not to stand.</p>

<p>I am very pleased to follow the hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Hoy) but I hope that he will accept my sincere apology in this instance that I cannot follow him with regard to Scottish legislation and the effect of the Order on Scottish interests. Throughout all the discussions on the Sea Fish Industry Bill I have concentrated on the interests of England and Wales. Therefore, I should like to refer to the two Orders which affect the licensing position in England and Wales and also the restrictions on landing of salmon and migratory trout in England and Wales.<br/>
I want to say at the outset that I welcome the two Orders that affect England and Wales. They bring in a licensing system which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has explained will be operated to give the present licensees under river board regulations power to go on with the particular forms of fishing which they have been carrying out for a long period of years. I entirely approve of that approach, because in England and Wales we have been fortunate in having a committee under Lord Bledisloe which has reported that the present balance between the various interests is satisfactory.<br/>
My hon. Friend said that the licensing would be done by river boards, but I believe that when we may be thinking of licensing of fishing outside territorial waiters it would be advisable for the sea fisheries committees to be consulted. Now I am thinking of another of these

Orders, under which my hon. Friend the Member for St. Ives (Mr. G. R. Howard) asked for grants for the fishery protection vessels that are operated by those committees. I think that it will become necessary for the sea fishery committees to co-operate with the fishery protection squadron in the necessary policing and they may need some assistance in the provision of rather more vessels to be used in conjunction with the fishery protection squadron in order that the policing may be effective and fair.<br/>
In the debate on the Second Reading of the Sea Fish Industry Bill, I said that I did not like such enabling Measures. We have had to deal with a number of Orders tonight. Admittedly, we have had plenty of time to discuss them, and I am grateful for that; but the Orders have been in my hands only for about a week and, I believe, have been available for only just over a week. It is just not possible to get Orders back to fishery organisations, and get their reactions to them so that we can speak with authority. When Orders come forward as swiftly as they do in Parliament I often find myself having to use my own judgment.<br/>
In this instance, I was able to get the reaction of the Salmon and Trout Association, through a consultation with the secretary but, as a generalisation, Orders of this nature are not satisfactory When they come so swiftly after an Act of Parliament has received the Royal Assent. It is not a satisfactory way of carrying through legislation, and I make a mild protest&#x2014;not against my right hon. Friend's Orders but against the Order-making procedure in general.<br/>
I very much hope that these Orders will effectively control the fishing for salmon and migratory trout in England and Wales, but I have some doubts about it. Rather than a prohibition of drift netting it would have been better had the Orders been framed entirely differently. Had they prohibited all forms of fishing other than that specified in the Order we would have known that all other forms of fishing were prohibited. We would have known that the licensed netsmen alone could fish, and the way in which they could fish would of course have been specified. As it is, it will be very difficult to prove that the fish were


caught in a particular area by a particular means. Therefore, although I hope that such Orders as these will be effective, I have grave doubts about it.<br/>
I thank my right hon. Friend for the consultations he permitted the various interests to have with his Ministry prior to the laying of the Orders. I cannot say that his officials were particularly receptive of the points put to them, but it was fair and reasonable that the various interests were afforded those consultations.<br/>
One of the English Orders prescribes a maximum licensing fee of &#x00A3;20. The sum of &#x00A3;20 is a very modest figure for a maximum. It represents about the price of four salmon and I suggest that, should we discuss these matters again, a higher maximum licence fee might be envisaged

because &#x00A3;20 these days is quite unrealistic.<br/>
I hope that the fishery protection squadron will be extraordinarily active in patrolling the waters where this new form of drift-netting might start in England and Wales. A delicate position exists over the English and Welsh salmon stocks and it would be a tragedy if these stocks were decimated by illegal fishing. I trust that these measures will be effective and I can promise my right hon. Friend the co-operation of all the interests for which I have the honour to speak. If they are not as effective as they should be I can assure the Minister that we shall have pleasure in assisting him to bring in Orders, in due course, which may be more effective.</p>

<p>I would like to say a few words on another aspect of the matter, one which particularly affects my constituency. I would, first, endorse what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Hoy) about the need for taking steps to preserve fishing in the rivers. The River Forth, for example, is one of the big salmon rivers and considerable trouble is being caused by the discharge of effluent which is poisoning the fish.<br/>
I am told that when the water gets covered by a film of this effluent the oxygen is prevented from getting into the water so that salmon can neither breathe nor get up the river. Great destruction is taking place because of this pollution. The Secretary of State has assured me that steps are now being taken to put the matter right. I hope that he will consult some of the industrialists and local authorities which may be responsible for polluting the rivers. There seems to be a dispute going on as to whether, scientifically, sewage feeds or destroys fish, but there is no doubt in the minds of the fishermen that this de-oxygenisation of the water destroys fish.<br/>
Fishermen in the upper and lower reaches of the Firth of Forth want the salmon protected. They do not want their livelihood destroyed by the simple massacre of the salmon stocks. The anxiety in their minds is that the proposals under discussion do not necessarily guarantee the safety of the salmon stocks. This is not a matter solely for this country, and I hope that when the Minister goes into the Common Market negotiations he will point out the importance of taking steps to stop the poaching of fish on other people's shores and to control fishing generally.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leith, at the Council of Europe some time ago, persuaded the Council to pass a resolution regarding the control of the size of nets. I understand that the resolution was ratified by all the countries concerned. Protection of salmon should also be controlled by all the countries bordering the North

Sea. We ourselves can control it only partially, so that full co-operation to achieve this aim is necessary.<br/>
The hon. Member for the City of Chester (Mr. Temple) referred to licensing. I recall that when there was a dispute about salmon fishing by drift-net inside the Forth Estuary the question arose of whether or not there should be licensing of the fishermen. At the moment fishermen can be interdicted or prosecuted if they fish by any method other than sweep net. My constituents feel that it is hard luck on a fisherman who is prohibited from drift-netting in the Estuary if someone fishing down the river by drift-net gets away with it. It was during the dispute I have mentioned that the question of licensing came up and I can inform the hon. Member for the City of Chester that if he wants to protect fishermen it is somewhat risky to try to do so by subjecting them to licensing. If a man breaks the law he can be fined and at least he gets the chance to live another day, but if his licence is withdrawn that is capital punishment. Therefore, it is very risky for fishermen to get themselves placed under a system of licensing rather under a system by which they are punished in the customary way for breaking the law.<br/>
I should have thought that from the fishermen's point of view it would be very unwise to become involved in a licensing system whereby a man who broke the law was prohibited from plying his trade. If we were half as enthusiastic about withdrawing licences from drunken drivers as we are about withdrawing licences from fishermen who commit offences, there would be fewer deaths on the roads and more salmon in the rivers.<br/>
I hope the Minister will take these points into consideration, especially when dealing with Europe, and will obtain European control over these practices as soon as possible.</p>

<p>So many species of wild life have suffered that it would be wrong to oppose out of hand any method of conservation. That not only this country but Norway is worried about drift-netting for salmon is proof of that fact.<br/>
Several items worry me about this Order as it stands. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, in giving the figures for the number of salmon that were caught by drift-nets, showed that it had gone up from 9.000 to 65,000. During the ten years from 1950 to 1960 I understand that the total number of salmon caught, as returned to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, has varied from 150,000 to 220,000. which means that there has been a variance of up to 70,000 fish in a year, which is not as much as has been token by drift-netting.<br/>
I have seen in my part of the world a fleet of foreign boats fishing just outside the three mile limit in the estuary of the Tay, and I cannot help feeling that the upsetting of the balance of our salmon stocks has not been caused by drift-netting alone, which has only come about in the last two or three years. There must be something far more to it than merely the question of drift-netting for salmon.<br/>
Whilst I feel that we must accept this Order in the interests of Scottish salmon fishing, because it is a central part of our economy, I am certain that if the Minister thinks that by passing this Order he will have done all he need do to conserve the salmon stocks of this country, he is wrong. There must be something more, because the figures do not show that drift-netting is responsible for our troubles.<br/>
My hon. Friend may be able to tell us what were the total numbers of salmon caught by all methods during these years when drift-netting has increased from 9,000 to 65,000, to see what relationship there is between the fish which have been taken out of the sea but cannot be caught in the rivers. If we look on this simply as a problem of drift-netting I am certain that we shall get it wrong.<br/>
I would also commend to those who are interested in fishing an article in last week's <i>Field</i> in which an American gentleman interested in the rod angling side of fishing wrote that after he had caught a fish he could see no reason why he should not put it back into the river and let it spawn. He had had his fun and he felt there was no reason why he should deplete the stocks.<br/>
I am certain that there is some financial implication behind this, but it seems a good idea that this interest in conserving fish should be encouraged. I do not understand why we are so keen to prohibit drift-netting but not so keen on putting a limit on the number of fish taken out by other means. Why not put a brake on every method until we are certain what is the cause of the trouble?</p>

<p>I agree very much with what the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) has said. We have been panicked into this step at the behest of a group of landed interests. It is the group that commenced to panic in another place. We have been driven to take hasty action. As has been pointed out, that was agreed and that was the Government's case twelve months ago against the people who were asking for this form of legislation.<br/>
I find difficulty in accepting the Order because we do not know the facts. The Under-Secretary quoted figures to show how the catch by drift-net fishermen had increased, but a report in <i>The Scotsman</i> last week said that catches by river netters on the Tweed were record catches this year. When he was interrupted and asked whether this was the case, the Undersecretary could not answer. If it is the case, then surely it makes nonsense of the argument which the hon. Gentleman used in putting this legislation before us in Standing Committee when we were given figures showing the great damage being done to salmon stocks. We ought to be told whether it is the case that catches of migratory trout and salmon have been at a record level this year.<br/>
Another point about the figure of 65,000 is that the drift-net fishermen have been more or less under sentence by the Government for the past twelve months and they have spent large sums of money on nets which they will not be able to use after the Order comes into force. They have been trying to make hay while the sun shines and to cover the cost of the nets, in other words catching as much as they could before the Order came into effect. If the drift-net fishermen had not been under this guillotine I doubt whether


the catch on the Tweed would have been anywhere near this level.<br/>
The hon. Member for Fife, East gave a number of instances to show that we do not know all the facts. I agree with him about the importance of conserving stocks, but the question is who does the conservation. Research is carried out by the Hydro-Electric Board and at Pitlochry. We recognise the importance of these stocks and it would have been more to the point if the Government had brought forward legislation which would have encouraged this work and had done something more about it instead of prohibiting the catching of salmon. In Committee on the Measure I read a quotation from the First Report of the Scottish Fisheries Department in which this point was made. The quotation which I read referred to the fact that whereas we were more concerned with controlling the catching of salmon, America was more concerned with increasing the stocks of salmon. We could not do that, of course, because we spent so much on armaments&#x2014;this was way back in 1870&#x2014;that we could not afford to go in for conservation of stocks at that time. That appears to be rather humorous today, but the point that it makes is a good one.<br/>
The other point about the Order is that we are acting without knowing the facts. We have not awaited the report of the Committee which was set up. That is fantastic. I think of the time that it takes to persuade the Government that an industry is dying and needs their assistance. We listened to a debate a short time ago in which the Undersecretary said, "If Aberdeen is to suffer and we see the middle-water fleets gradually dying, of course we shall have to do something about it." There was not much urgency about that. When it was a matter of protecting salmon, however, we had a Bill passed and the Orders introduced within twelve months. This difference in the approach of the Government to the various events that happen in Scotland and to industries which are dying or threatened is rather strange. If the landowner is concerned, we get legislation quickly; the Parliamentary timetable always permits it. If, however, it is a matter of protecting people and their jobs, that is rather

different and we are quite content not to do much about it.<br/>
In this case, we have been rushed into the matter rapidly and without any proper report on the problem. We have been pushed into it without any recom-mendations about what should be done and we have been rushed into it mainly as the result of a powerful pressure group in the Tory Party&#x2014;that is, the landowning interests, who first raised the matter in the House of Lords and compelled the Government to act, ably assisted, of course, by certain Scottish back-benchers. Perhaps I should not use the word "ably," because none of them have been given jobs in the new reshuffle of the Government.<br/>
Whilst I agree about the necessity for conserving salmon and taking action to increase stocks, there is the question of the pollution of rivers. There is in my constituency the River Esk. The last salmon that came up there gave itself up in disgust to a wee boy with a pin. At one time, it was a fine salmon river. This is happening all over the place. Every year, I ask what the Government are doing about the pollution of the Esk, but I never get very far. It is still almst an open sewer. We do not find the same urgency about it. If the Government are to tackle the problem correctly, they cannot do so simply by producing Orders of this kind, which penalise one section of the community as against other sections.</p>

<p>I agree with a lot of what has been said on both sides of the House in the debate so far. There is a great aura of indignation around salmon interests. It arises whenever the matter is even discussed&#x2014;the question that men have a right to take salmon by drift-nets. I feel that if those interests had shown half as much energy and determination in dealing with pollution or even the seal menace that would have had an extremely healthy effect on the salmon industry. As it is, the whole weight of the assault has fallen on the drift-netters, and this Order is the result.<br/>
The effect of it is that freedom is being denied to our own fishermen to fish inside our territorial waters or outside our territorial waters while foreigners can scoop the lot. What


action can the Government take to control foreigners who want to scoop the lot, and what action will they take to control those foreigners? This is a matter about which our own fishermen feel very deeply indeed. What they want and what they seek is justice in this matter.<br/>
Even in the debate tonight the Undersecretary of State would not give the comparable figures of the salmon caught by all the traditional methods, as opposed to the number he gave of salmon which had been caught by drift-net That is the kind of way in which this debate has been conducted up to now. Our inshore men who have taken salmon by drift-net in this last year do not want to destroy the salmon, but they feel very strongly that no case has yet been made against killing salmon with drift-nets and that instead they are the victims of propaganda and real prejudice.<br/>
I really do think it is incredible to interfere with the liberty of the subject to this extent, without an adequate survey of the facts of the matter. The Hunter Committee, as we all know, is sitting in Edinburgh at the moment. Why could we not wait at least till the results of that Committee's work are known and we could have a properly created policy fox salmon? In my part of the world salmon used to be so numerous that they ceased even to be a popular form of food, one could have them so often. That was not a long time ago&#x2014;about fifty years ago. Could we not have some hatcheries, and less pollution, and a more effective policy against seals, which have destroyed so many of these fish?<br/>
I personally feel that total prohibition is wrong. It means loss to the men who have invested their money in gear. There are not enough facts on which to base this decision of the Government, and it is a derogation from liberty. Total prohibition makes the Government guilty, for whatever reason, of unfair discrimination against a group of men who have made their living from catching fish in the sea, and whatever kind of fish they would. This is the first time this prohibition has happened.</p>

<p>I agree largely with what the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr.

Wolrige-Gordon) said, and I have considerable sympathy with his point of view in defence of the salmon netters. I certainly agree with him that the practice the Government have been following for the past few years is a curious one&#x2014;of first producing a Bill and then appointing a committee to see whether any Bill is needed. That is partly the reason for the sense of grievance which the drift-net fishermen feel in this case, but the same practice was followed in connection with the licensing (Scotland) Bill which was recently before the House. The Bill was produced while a committee was still skiing and had produced only half its report. We had the same process in connection with hydro-electricity in Soot-land. The Mackenzie Committee was appointed, but in the meantime the Secretary of State decided to cut off practically all development before the Committee had given any recommendations to that effect. This practice is becoming a habit, so that perhaps the hon. Gentleman should not concentrate all his attack upon the Government in connection with this salmon fishing Measure but extend it a wider front and upon the Government practice as a whole. This practice is becoming a highly objectionable habit with the Government.<br/>
There was such a characteristic speech a few minutes ago from the other side by an hon. Member who has now departed. In an earlier debate tonight, when some of us were pleading for additional vessels to reinforce the fishery protection cruiser fleet in Scotland, particularly around the Islands to protect the livelihood of the people, there was not a great deal of support from that hon. Member. I do not think he joined in the support which some of his colleagues on that side gave to us. But when it came to enforcing this Measure against the drift-net fishermen, when it came to salmon and migratory trout, the hon. Member rose and proposed that the already inadequate fishery protection fleet should be diverted from its main object of protecting the fishery limits for white fish and other fishings, and that we should even get the Government to spend more money by adding speedboats and additional protection vessels to the fleet; all to protect private salmon and trout. It shows what is behind the advocacy of the Government and those who support them. During the dis-


cussions on the Bill&#x2014;of which these Measures are obnoxious by-products, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) would have said &#x2014;we have had clear evidence of the interested character of the advocacy of hon. Members opposite and even more so of noble Lords in another place.<br/>
I have a considerable amount of sympathy for the drift-net fishermen because I feel that they have been harmed in two ways. First, they have been put to considerable loss by this Measure, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East pointed out. Many bought gear in the ordinary way before or at the beginning of the season, and then they found that they would not get even the cost of it back, let alone make a profit on it. Some, it is said, have gone all out to make sure that they caught enough fish in the short period legally open to them to make up for any possible loss. It seems to me that they even have a claim for compensation against the Government, because they bought their nets in good faith, having no reason to anticipate that their activities would be made illegal so abruptly and that they would not recoup, at least, the full value of their purchases of gear. The second matter is that they have been condemned, as has been said, without a full trial, without full knowledge of the facts. That is unpardonable.<br/>
We have all paid more than lip service to fish stocks conservation. I do not know anyone who dissents from that policy and the prosecution of it so far as it can be done without unreasonable damage to innocent parties. As the hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) said, there is no evidence that the drift-net fishermen alone are the cause of the depletion which has worried the Government so suddenly and so much. I agree with him that if one is to take their activities into consideration, one should take comprehensively into consideration the activities of all parties and all interests which may be causing depletion, and possibly do something about all of them. What exactly should be done is a matter which one could develop fully only if one took all the established facts into consideration in the right way.<br/>
I am worried about the fact that our own Scottish fishermen will more

than ever before feel a sense of injustice because, while they can be stopped, prosecuted and punished severely, as, of course, they must be for illegal fishing, they can see foreigners day and night throughout the season coming quite openly into our fishing grounds and taking all they want and getting away scot free. There is nothing that one can do about that use of the high seas for salmon or anything else without international agreements, and ratified agreements at that. As a representative of lobster fishermen and other fishermen, I know how deeply they resent the difference in treatment between themselves and the people who come very often illegally fishing, within our territorial limits and on our own fishing grounds.<br/>
An example in passing is that our fishermen are not allowed to take berried lobsters or land lobsters of less than 9 ins. in length, but foreign trawlers take everything that is going and no one can stop them landing them in their own or other countries. What will happen if we join the Common Market I am not sure &#x2014;nobody is&#x2014;but I understand that negotiation, or at least discussion, on fisheries is beginning. But there is a sense of injustice with regard to the lobster catchings and landings, and in respect of the prohibition on British trawlers in the whole Moray Firth, while the foreigners can practise as they will. This new salmon protection provision will add to that sense of injustice.<br/>
While we are in favour of conservation, many hon. Members on this side of the House feel that we are conserving for the wrong people. When I make speeches in support of conservation, I am conscious that, unfortunately, the people who benefit most from the conservation are not the general public or the general body of British fishermen. In an area such as my constituency where there are fine salmon and trout rivers, it is not the ordinary people who benefit, but people like Lord Baillieu, who writes to me protesting when I say that there is insufficient conservation. There are protests from the House of Lords and from interest in the City which apparently have no legitimate connection with the Western Islands. But when one makes a protest against their apparent monopolies they spring from all sorts of extraordinary quarters to


claim that they own whole areas of the islands or the fisheries.<br/>
Everyone, as I say, is in favour of conservation. But unfortunately, everyone does not benefit from it. The people who benefit are not the small people but those who are concerned with trying to get out of it for themselves the greatest possible commercial advantage. One example of this is afforded by the Grimersta River on the Island of Lewis which is one of the finest of our salmon rivers. But no ordinary person from the Western Isles or elsewhere can gain access to the river except by permission of the landlord which is very seldom granted.<br/>
There was a prospect of developing hydro-electricity from this river's water-power for domestic needs and, possibly, for the introduction of industry. But because of the salmon monopoly interests that was initially killed, ostensibly in the name of conservation, but in fact it was in the interests of private individuals. only later was this officially denied. So while we agree with conservation, and preached it long before the surviving members of the Government came to this House, we do not like to see conservation only in the interests of a small group of monopolists. Secondly, we do not like to see the drift-net fishermen being condemned before the facts are known and understood.</p>

<p>Tonight we have heard a great deal about people not knowing the facts. I can forgive the hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Mr. Willis) for not knowing the facts, because the only place one would find salmon in Edinburgh, East is on a fishmonger's slab. But I cannot forgive my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon) because he has not taken the trouble to learn the facts. In my part of the world we have reason to know the facts. They were not told to me by the landowning interests, but by working men, anglers on the River Don in my constituency. I have also heard them from hotel keepers, shopkeepers, and others in my constituency concerned with the tourist trade. It has been said that this question was first raised by the landowning

interests in another place. That is not so. It was raised in this House by me as the result of the representations made to me by the working men anglers in my constituency.<br/>
We have been told tonight of 1,700 men round the coast of Scotland whose livelihood is in jeopardy because of the drift-net fishing. Hon. Members opposite do not know the facts. The facts are that on the River Dee in my constituency the catches of salmon by orthodox fishing methods, including orthodox nets, to the end of May this year were about one-third what they were last year, which is completely different from the suppositions we have heard from articles in <i>The Field</i> and elsewhere. These are the facts. Salmon fisheries, which are the heritage of all the northern countries, Scotland, Norway, Finland and the lot, will be in jeopardy unless steps are taken, and taken now.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for the City of Chester (Mr. Temple) had some doubts about the wisdom of my right hon. Friend in bringing in these Orders so suddenly. I congratulate my right hon. Friend on bringing them in, because unless they were brought in now the whole fishing in the North could disappear overnight. A careful balance has been kept between salmon fishers and breeders, but in the last two years that balance has been going. These Orders are a temporary measure to restore and maintain that balance. Some of the facts we do not know. That is what the Hunter Committee has been set up to find out&#x2014;how to increase salmon. Until the Committee reports we must do what we can to keep that balance. I therefore congratulate my right hon. Friend on bringing in these Orders and commend them to the House and hope they will be passed.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) seems to know more facts than the Minister, who refused to give statistics. He must have known the official Government policy as announced in the House of Lords by Lord Waldegrave, that we could not be dogmatic, there were no facts and there were difficulties. I shall not repeat his speech,


but he announced the Government policy and I remind the hon. Member of what the Joint Parliamentary Secretary said:
<q>&#x2026; this is not a matter on which it is possible at present to make any firm predictions.</q>
He went on to say:
<q>There are many factors which affect the stocks of salmon and it is difficult to disentangle the effect of any one of them. Moreover, in order to get any relevant information of what is happening to the stocks, statistics over a fairly long period are required &#x2026;"&#x2014; [OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>House of Lords.</i> 22nd June, 1961; Vol. 232, c. 773.]</q>
The hon. Member must agree, as the Minister and the Secretary of State did, that that was official Government policy. My horn. Friend the Member for Leith (Mr. Hoy) and others have argued over and over again that there was a change of Government policy.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman knows that he is on bad ground. We have argued over and over again in Committee as we do tonight that this was a bad part of a very important Bill. The Government injected into the Bill which dealt with wider problems of the white fish industry this matter from which these Orders ensue. These Orders are bad, unjust and unfair. The Government should have waited until they had more facts. We all accept the need for conservation. In the Council of Europe, in this House and elsewhere when speaking on fish matters, my hon. Friend has stressed the need for conservation. We stress it tonight, but we argue that the faots are not yet available. The Committee of investigation should have reported before action was taken. We should not only have had legal people making pronouncements but scientific evidence which has not yet been produced. Figures should have been provided before anyone was dogmatic about the situation. I trust the Minister tonight will give us the figures for which

his hon. Friends have asked&#x2014;his hon. Friends who have criticised the Order.<br/>
The hon. Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour) made an important point when he said that people operating in the Tay, beyond the three-mile limit, may be causing harm to the salmon stock. This point was taken up by the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon), who strongly criticised the Order. We have the spectacle of foreign fishermen being able to fish for salmon just outside the three-mile limit and possibly doing much more harm to the salmon stocks; they can fish for salmon but British fishermen are penalised if they do so. We suggest only that before the Government take such action as they envisage in the Order there should have been a scientific inquiry. This was, indeed, the Government's view before they caved in to pressure from certain Scottish landed interests.<br/>
The Government are in difficulties. The Order prohibits drift-net fishing in an area surrounding Scotland. The southern boundary, on the western side, will intersect an area of the high seas within the Solway Firth. I am interested in this area because my constituency borders the Solway Firth, and some fishermen from Cumberland, under licence from the Cumberland River Board, have been drift-netting for salmon there for some time. I trust that they will be able to go on doing this, with a licence. No doubt in Scotland fishing into the Solway Firth will be prevented, and yet I hope that the Cumberland fishermen will be able to go on drift-netting. That is anomalous. We shall have foreign fishermen who can fish for salmon outside the three-mile limit while British fishermen cannot, and an anomaly in the Solway Firth because of the prohibition area.<br/>
We say that the Order is bad and that the Section of the Bill under which it is made is bad, penalising unfairly an important section of the fishing industry. We cannot dismiss lightly these people who are engaged in the industry. It is all very well for the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West (Mr. Hendry) to say that this Order will protect the livelihood of 1,700 fishermen; that is not true, and he knows it. Many of these men are not full-time fishermen and will


not be harmed in any way comparable with what will happen to the inshore fishermen who are engaged in drift-netting for salmon. There is no comparison, and the hon. Member knows that. He should consult his hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East and other Scottish Conservative Members who have spoken against the Order. I hope that the Minister will give us the figures for which we have asked and that the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, West will listen to them.<br/>
We say that this is a bad Order, unfair and unjust, because it will prevent Scottish and English fishermen from fishing while others will remain scot-free. We have pressed the point, and we shall not dwell on it unduly. We have criticised the Order, and we hope that even at this late hour the Minister will give us better reasons for introducing it than we heard when we discussed the subject in Committee and on Second Reading of the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Edinburgh, Leith (Mr. Hoy) said that this was a rotten Order and the hon. Member for Workington (Mr. Peart) said that it was a bad Order, so that it is getting better as the evening wears on. We regard it as a necessary Order. There is a lesson to be learned from the fact that in the debate, we have been told from both sides of the House that the Order goes too far and too fast and that there is doubt about its efficacy.<br/>
The chief argument of those on both sides who advocated greater delay on the part of the Government before making the Orders was that we should have waited for the Hunter Committee to report. They quoted the remarks of my noble Friend in another place at about this time last year. Evidence as to the depletion of stocks of salmon is terribly difficult to obtain and to be of any use; like as not, once found, it is too late. Where I think hon. Members have gone astray is in talking about fishermen who have been earning their living at this, as if it is something to which they have been traditionally accustomed. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. Wolrige-Gordon) referred specifically to fisherman who have bean earning their living at this for a year or two. Before

that they caught other fish. So it cannot be said that this is their traditional form of fishing.<br/>
The figures rose from 9,000 in 1960 to 28,000 in 1961. It was at that point that the Government asked themselves, "Are we now going to legislate?" At about this time last year, or perhaps a little later, bearing in mind the time it takes to get legislation though the House, we finally decided to legislate knowing that it would not be on the Statute Book until about now. If we had not done it this year, we should have had to wait for another year before doing it. What would have been the figures of catches this year? What would they have been next year if we had not legislated?</p>

<p>I hear the hon. Member for Workington saying "No, no, no". Two views can be taken about this. One is that things should be allowed to let rip and that there should be no legislation. There is all the difference in the world between indulging in the luxury of criticism and being responsible for the stocks of salmon and for deciding on the extent to which a risk could properly be taken or whether no risk should be taken by not allowing this type of fishing to continue.</p>

<p>The Minister should not argue that we were prepared to let it rip. We would have preferred a committee quickly. The right hon. Member, with his colleague the Secretary of State for Scotland, delayed it. We could have had a committee immediately to investigate the whole problem of the conservation of salmon.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is saying that he would not have legislated this Session. If the Hunter Committee had started work this time last year, he would have had to decide whether to legislate this year, because these things take time. A Bill cannot be drawn up in two days. We believe that we were right to legislate this year. Where I believe that the hon. Gentleman can argue with us is as to whether we should have legislated. I do not believe that he would have chosen to set up a committee, wait perhaps a year for the committee's report, and then wait another year while legislating. How much time


would have been lost and how much damage would have been done? If the hon. Gentleman argues that we should not have laid the Orders now but should have awaited the Committee's Report, that is a different argument from that on legislation. We do not know when the Hunter Committee will report, but this year we have to face the fact that there has been a very steep rise in the numbers of fish caught by drift net. I believe that in the last full year the figure was 28,000, and I think that up to the end of June of this year it had gone up to 65,000.<br/>
Hon. Members have asked how those figures compared with catches other than drift net catches. Over the last ten years, the average numbers have been 225,000 salmon and 151,000 grilse, making a total of 376,000. I know that last year the figure was 370,000, which was about average. Against that, 9,000 salmon were caught by drift net in 1960, 28,000 in 1961, and 65,000 up to the end of June, 1962. This is a very steep rise, and the current figure represents a very considerable proportion of all salmon caught off the Scottish coast &#x2014;particularly as it is by a new and un-traditional system of fishing.</p>

<p>Those are collected at the end of the season. I do not have them for the first six months of this year, but I have no reason to suppose that they are unusual; I should certainly be surprised if they showed anything like the rise in the drift netting figures.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, East (Sir J. Gilmour), referring to the Hunter Committee, asked, "Why pick on one type of fishing?" The answer is that it is not the traditional type of fishing that has been going on. The terms of reference of the Committee are:
<q>To consider in the light of current scientific knowledge the extent to which fishing for salmon and trout by any method whether in inland waters or in the sea should be regulated, and to recommend such changes in the law as might be thought desirable.</q>

Until the Report is in our possession, we have thought it right to prohibit in Scottish waters this new system of fishing which has caught such very large numbers of salmon in the last few years. Of course, when the Report is made, we shall be able to reconsider our decision in the light of the Report. It is not an agreeable thing to prohibit the catching of any type of fish on the high seas, but we felt that in the circumstances it was necessary for the preservation of this species.<br/>
Several hon. Members have said, in effect, "You are stopping your own fishermen but you are allowing foreigners to fish." The point is that we have been faced with a threat to our salmon stocks. We have met this threat, which has come from our own fishermen and not from foreigners, by these Measures. It may happen that we may change them when we get the Hunter Committee's report. We are meeting the threat in this way and at this time. There has not been any evidence of foreigners indulging in this form of fishing off our shores. However, it is our intention to protect our salmon stocks. This we have now done as best we can. With respect therefore, it is pointless to say, "But what are you going to do about the foreigners?" because we have no evidence that foreigners are indulging in this form of fishing here.<br/>
The House will recall that there is in operation in this country a landing ban on salmon applying to boats of any sort. We will do our best, should this threat extend to boats of foreign nationals, to meet it if and when it develops. As I say, the comments about foreigners do not present a case for our not meeting what we consider, rightly or wrongly, to be an existing and actual threat to our salmon stocks from this new type of drift netting from largish boats with extremely long nets.<br/>
I was asked a number of questions about the licensing of fishermen in England and Wales as opposed to a prohibition in Scottish waters. The two situations are different because there has been a traditional history of fishing by smallish boats with smallish drift-nets for a century or more off the English rivers, mostly within three miles, but occasionally going beyond that limit.


At the moment they are licensed by river boards. As I say, this is a traditional form of fishing and it is not our intention to interfere with it. In other words, while it is not our intention to interfere with these vessels which have been fishing off the English rivers for one hundred years or more, it is equally, not our intention to permit Scottish boats to transfer their attention to English rivers.<br/>
In saying that we intend to permit the continuation of the traditional types of fishing, I should point out that all the fishermen concerned have licences issued to them by the river boards. We shall, therefore, be guided by the boards on the question of issuing licences for fishing outside territorial waters.</p>

<p>This matter is the subject of a special Act, and I am sure that the right hon. Member for Clackmannan and East Stirlingshire (Mr. Woodburn) knows all about it.<br/>
I have explained what we intend to do. Some have taken a different view and have said that we should "wait and see." However, we shall await with interest the results of the Hunter Committee's deliberations. When one has a responsibility in these matters one is, perhaps, more apt to err on the side of caution than one's attitude might be without such responsibility. The Government have a responsibility to maintain our salmon stocks.<br/>
it has been said that there is as yet no direct evidence to show that the stocks are being depleted by what is happening. But it is because we fear that they might that we have thought it necessary to introduce these Measures. I believe that the new Orders are the best that can be devised to suit the circumstances of our traditional salmon fishing interests, and I hope that the House will agree with the course we propose.</p>

<p>Of all the engineers in the Kingdom who may claim that they are making a major contribution to the nation's productivity, none, in my view, could claim to excel the contribution of the social engineers, of whom probation officers form perhaps the most important group. Their preventive work, at a cost of some &#x00A3;16 a case, has saved thousands who would otherwise be confined in prisons at a cost to the taxpayer of about &#x00A3;435 per prisoner each year.<br/>
There is no doubt that the probation officer assists large numbers of people from being absurdly under-employed at almost useless work in a closed prison. If the criteria for the assessment of anyone's wages were to rest solely upon his productivity, in a fair assessment who could doubt that the probation officer would have nothing at all to fear? In fact, however, as we all know, the probation officer does work which cannot be measured in grossly material terms. Who could assess the value of the happiness brought about because of their success as marriage menders? Who, indeed, could assess in non-material terms the contribution which they make by giving to the community a healthy-minded child instead of an incorrigible delinquent?<br/>
Nor when we speak of probation officers are we speaking of work amongst a small marginal fringe. How extraordinarily involved the probation officer has become in the life of the community is dramatically revealed in my own County of Monmouthshire, which has no more and no less of the world's troubles than any other county, where one person in every 120 for some reason ox another sought a probation officer's aid last year. In the County of Monmouthshire their help was sought in the case of 500 marriages. Most of that help was sought directly without the intervention or the prompting of any court. Of those 500 marriages where the parties substantially overcame their disharmony, in 300 the


probation officers had a r&#x00F4;le that was all-important<br/>
All this is known of the distinguished work which this service is giving. The Morison Report has acknowledged the r&#x00F4;le of the probation officer. The late Home Secretary, whose pusillanimity in failing to fight for the probation officers in the Cabinet and who will rightly not be easily forgiven, and undoubtedly the present Home Secretary, will give praise to the probation officer.<br/>
The probation officers however are not concerned with praise. They are today primarily concerned with pay. They do not seek a princely salary, but there is no doubt that their devotion and their dedication at this moment is being pitilessly exploited. They have seen the substantial increase which was recommended by the Morison Report completely ignored. They have seen that amount whittled down to the 10 per cent. increase recommended by the Joint Negotiating Committee. They have had offered this insulting 2&#x00BD; per cent. and an equivocal statement that substantial increases will be made "at the appropriate time."<br/>
The probation service, if it is to do its exhausting and harrowing work with any &#x00E9;lan, which it must possess to be successful, has to have an answer to some important questions if it is to be saved from near demoralisation. I would put three of these questions tonight.<br/>
Firstly, since it is said by the Government that there is no rigidity in the incomes policy and exceptions must be recognised, does the hon. and learned Gentleman unequivocally and unambiguously accept that the probation service is such an exception? The service is entitled to know now. By any yardstick, by the contribution they make productively or by their acceptance of the White Paper criteria of more exacting work or more onerous conditions, this service, in my view, qualifies.<br/>
But the Government have not said that they regard it as an exception. By preferring 2&#x00BD; per cent. they have implied otherwise. If the Government will not say so and do not believe that the service is an exception, the men in the service have a right to know this and judge their future. They have a right to know where they stand with a

Government who up to the present have been so badly equivocating.<br/>
Secondly, the Government have said that there will be a substantial increase at the appropriate time. What is that substantial increase? If it is not to be given now, as I think it should be, those in the service are entitled to know at this time how much it is. Quite clearly, the Government could not talk of a substantial increase unless they had directed their mind to the nature and quality of that increase. Why, therefore, should there be this procrastination? Why should not the probation service be told now what is in the Government's mind? It is certainly necessary if the service is to be kept together.<br/>
Thirdly, if the Government speak of giving them a substantial increase at the appropriate time, they are entitled to ask what is the appropriate time. Are the Government so lacking in plans and direction that they are unable or unwilling to give a definite date? I have no doubt that that date should be now, but if this cannot be or is not intended, let us know when it is to be, otherwise the demoralisation of the service will continue and will increase with what can only be lamentable results.<br/>
How urgent these answers are and how important it is that there should be an end to the parsimony is revealed in the present state of the service. In the Principality of Wales, for example, it has led to large areas being without any full-time or Home Office trained probation officers. In Carmarthenshire, Breconshire, Cardigan, Montgomeryshire and Radnorshire there is not one full-time probation officer, never mind one who has had Home Office training. I believe that the same situation applies to Merionethshire. There is only a well-intentioned but professionally untrained part-time service. The case loads which are being borne both by the amateur probation officers who are unfairly called upon to do such delicate work without training and by those who are Home Office trained is scandalous. I know of one officer in Monmouthshire who at this moment has a case load of 242, or five times more than the figure recommended by the Home Offices.<br/>
So primitive and parsimonious is the training system conducted by the Home


Office that in Wales it is the officers who are carrying case loads of this order who are expected to train those officers&#x2014;and they constitute the majority in an area like Wales&#x2014;who come into the service without any training at all.<br/>
I believe that there are serious results as a consequence of the service being under-trained and over-burdened. Who can doubt that when the number of cases rise there must be a decline in the percentage of cases which expire satisfactorily? I have examined the position in South Wales and Monmouthshire. The statistics show that whereas 75&#x00B7;8 per cent. of cases expired satisfactorily in 1950, the percentage was 70&#x00B7;88 by 1956 and it had fallen to 60&#x00B7;66 by 1960. It is statistically inescapable that failure to pay and train probation officers satisfactorily has contributed directly to the growth in the incidence of crime.<br/>
I sincerely hope that, for the sake of the community, the probation service this evening will not be given a dusty answer. I hope that on this occasion at last before the Recess they can hear something definite and categorical, and I believe that unless this is done we are in serious danger of a large number of good, dedicated men drifting away from this very fine service.</p>

I am sure that both sides of the House will understand the very real regret with Which my right hon. Friend found it necessary to disappoint the probation officers over their salary increase. It was indeed a painful and difficult decision.<br/>
The facts and history axe pretty well known by now, I think. The Morison Committee was appointed in May, 1959, and the Government's appointment of this Committee was a recognition that

the time had come to reassess the place of the probation officer and the probation service in the community, to consider whether the service needed improvement, and, if it did, to see how improvement could be effected.<br/>
I should remind the House that in August, 1960, while the Committee was sitting, the probation officers received a negotiated salary increase of about 12&#x00BD; per cent., but this was designed to enable the probation service to keep up with the general movement of incomes and it is not part of the Government's case that it at all anticipated the revaluation which the Morison Committee was later to make. The Morison Committee recommended very substantial salary increases indeed&#x2014;for the basic grade, something of the order of 20 per cent. at the minimum, and 31 per cent. at the maximum, and for the higher grades greatly improved differentials involving increases for some officers of more than 40 per cent. It also made a number of recommendations about the salary structure.<br/>
My right hon. Friend's immediate step on receiving the Report was to refer the proposals to the Joint Negotiating Committee for the Probation Service. He was criticised for taking this course when he knew that the Government's policy ruled out any immediate increase of more than 2&#x00BD; per cent., but there are factors which this criticism ignores. Not only did the Morison Committee itself say that certain details of the pay scales would have to be left for negotiation, and, indeed, in paragraph 353 of its Report, deliberately left them for negotiation, but it was in the probation officers' interest that the matter should be brought within the ambit of the Joint Negotiating Committee so that they could if they wished take advantage of the right which the negotiating machinery gives them to seeking arbitration on their claim that the proposals should be met in full. If they had not been sent to the negotiating machinery they could not have claimed arbitration if they so wished.<br/>
The Government did, however, make it clear to the Negotiating Committee from the outset that in the present phase of their incomes policy a recommended increase of more than 2&#x00BD; per cent. was unlikely to be implemented by my right hon. Friend. The Joint


Negotiating Committee in full knowledge of the Government's attitude nevertheless recommended that there should be a 10 per cent. increase from 1st April last. The Government carefully considered the arguments which the Joint Negotiating Committee adduced, but could regretfully find no ground for departing from their previous view on the 2&#x00BD; per cent., and my right hon. Friend so informed the Committee that he would not implement fully the 10 per cent. increase but would make rules giving an increase from last 1st April of 2&#x00BD; per cent. and that he was ready to examine the wider claims of the service at the beginning of 1963.<br/>
The Government have made it very clear but I want again to emphasise that the increase of 2&#x00BD; per cent. in no way represents their view of the just salary level for probation officers. It is the probation officers' misfortune that the revaluation of their service should have become an issue at this difficult and critical stage in the development of an incomes policy.<br/>
For the future, it must be possible to revalue one occupation relatively to others and the Government fully accept this need. The limitation of the probation officers to a 2&#x00BD; per cent. increase has been imposed solely while the working out of an incomes policy is in the critical and intermediate phase to which I have referred. The need for a substantial increase in probation service salaries is accepted and the Government are prepared to consider the claims of the service at the beginning of 1963. I will not continue to repeat the natural disappointment which, I know, the probation service feels and which it has expressed.<br/>
For the future, I can say this. The Government have certainly contemplated that the employers' side would proceed before the end of this year with their detailed consideration of the Morison recommendations, so that negotiations with the staff side could be resumed very early in 1963. This is in answer to one of the hon. Member's questions about dates. I assure the House that the Government would not wish to retard the progress of discussions one moment longer than the development of an incomes policy makes necessary.<br/>
I come now to the immediate position before that date. As I said earlier, my right hon. Friend informed the Joint Negotiating Committee that he proposed to make rules awarding a 2&#x00BD; per cent. increase. The National Association of Probation Officers, at its annual conference on 18th May, passed a resolution in which it said that it rejected this proposal. My right hon. Friend thought it right to take no further action until the Joint Negotiating Committee had had the opportunity of considering the position. The Committee met on 5th July and I understand that the staff side made it clear that it was now interested in nothing short of the full implementation of the Morison Committee's recommendations as soon as possible and that the committee stands adjourned until a future date. My right hon. Friend will, of course, consider any recommendation that the Committee may make to him as to the eventual implementation of the Morison figures. I must, however, repeat that he cannot, at this time, go beyond his undertaking to examine the wider claims of the service at the beginning of next year.<br/>
Meanwhile, however, my right hon. Friend has decided that he should no longer delay the implementation to the extent that is consistent with Government policy of the salaries increase that the Joint Negotiating Committee has recommended to him. He is, therefore, making rules which will increase the salaries of probation officers by approximately 2&#x00BD; per cent. with effect, retrospectively, from 1st April last.<br/>
The hon. Member for Pontypool echoed the anxiety expressed by the Morison Committee about the great influx into the service in recent years of persons who were not trained on appointment. As was stated in reply to a Question in May, nearly 45 per cent. of those entering the service in the last three years were in this category. My right hon. Friend wishes to create conditions as soon as possible in which only trained men and women can be appointed.<br/>
It is, however, important to understand the circumstances in which this influx of direct entrants, as they are known, has taken place. Hon. Members will see from paragraph 265 of the Morison Report that the strength of the probation


service in England and Wales at the end of 1954 was 1,200. At the end of 1958, it had risen to 1,391, an increase of about 16 per cent. in four years. At the end of June this year, the strength was 1,838, an increase of nearly one-third in three and a half years.<br/>
Over the whole short period of seven and a half years, the increase has been over 50 per cent. These figures indicate the enormously increased demands that have been made upon the probation service. No one could have foreseen the extent and persistence of that increase and it is accordingly an over-simplification to suppose that the intake of direct entrants could have been avoided if salaries had been higher. The reason for that is that the pre-entry training takes from one to three years and however many students had been attracted to the training by the thought of relatively higher salaries later, it would have been extremely difficult without resorting to direct appointments for an expansion of the necessary rate to have been accomplished in any case.<br/>
Faced with this situation, my right hon. Friend's policy has been to provide the best possible training for the direct entrants while they are in posts, and this training takes usually one of three forms. These are described in the Morison Report, and I do not think the House would want me to repeat them now. They are geared to the needs of the situation, and have been most valuable, but, of course, they are only temporary and are not what we want to see as permanent arrangements because, exactly as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, we want to see the end, when we can, of the direct entrant and that of those who come along before going in for the relatively long period of training.<br/>
This brings me to reminding the House that my right hon. Friend is reconstituting his Probation Officer and Training Board in September and that the new Committee will have an independent chairman, Mr. T. A. F. Noble, Vice-Chancellor-designate of Leicester University, as the Committee recommended. My right hon. Friend looks forward to the help of the Board in considering the valuable suggestions about recruitment and training that the Morison Committee has made.<br/>
Since I know that the hon. Lady the

Member for Leeds, South-East (Miss Bacon) wishes to say a few words, and since this is a subject on which we very much value advice from all quarters of the House, I shall sit down. I should like to end by saying that it is, of course, not possible for me to answer the first two questions of the hon. Member tonight. He will understand that I have no cats to let out of the bag, or even kittens, but I can assure him that it is quite wrong to think that it would have been possible consistent with Government policy to have gone any further so far than we have gone in this very painful question of the probation officer's pay, but that the process of revaluation and the implementation of the spirit behind the Morison Committee Report has a very high priority in any relaxation of the incomes policy or any development of it which may take place in the near future.</p>

<p>I congratulate the hon. and learned Member on being in a position to stand at the Dispatch Box tonight to reply to the debate. I cannot congratulate him, though, on what he has said. We understood that because of events which have happened in the last few days we should probably see new policies with regard to increases in pay and perhaps see an end to the pay pause. But what we have heard from him takes us little further forward from where we were a few weeks ago.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman has gone over the history of the salary position with regard to probation officers. I stress what my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypool (Mr. Abse) said, that it is very shortsighted to keep probation officers with very low salary. Looking at it from a strictly financial point of view, it would surely be very much better to spend money in giving them better salaries so that we might save money on keeping people in detention centres, borstals, prisons and so on.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman who is now the First Secretary of State said on 10th May that he had sent this decision to the Negotiating Committee and it had come forward with a suggestion for a 10 per cent. increase. After that there was a debate in another place when the Government accepted a


Motion moved by a noble Friend of mine saying that there should be a substantial increase in salary for probation officers. The hon. and learned Gentleman has tonight repeated that. He said that the need for a substantial increase is accepted. What the probation officers want to know is when they are going to get that substantial increase.<br/>
I am not sure whether I understood the hon. and learned Gentleman correctly. He made one announcement and has taken the position one stage further. If I understood aright, some time ago the probation officers rejected a 2&#x00BD; per cent. increase in their salaries which they regarded as an insult. Now I understand from what the hon. and learned Gentleman has said that they are to be compelled to accept the offer which they have rejected.</p>

<p>Orders will be made and quite a considerable backlog of increased salaries will be paid consequently. If the probation officers reject the increase, that is something which the Chancellor of the Exchequer will like. The intention of the Home Secretary is to make the Orders and increased salaries will become legally payable. But what the recipients do with the money is their affair.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has put in more legal language what I was trying to say in the language of a layman. In other

words, they are to be compelled to accept a 2&#x00BD; per cent. increase. We have had a disappointing reply from the Government. Far from being satisfied, the probation officers will regard this as an added insult. We thought that as a result of the events of the last few days we should see an end of the 2&#x00BD; per cent. figure, particularly in respect of people like probation officers and nurses who are doing valuable work for the country. Now we learn from the hon. and learned Gentleman that although the shop window had been dressed, the goods axe still the same as ever. We still have the pay pause and the 2&#x00BD; per cent. As my hon. Friend has said, these people are to have the insult rammed down their throats.</p>

<p>Is it not an extraordinary position, and quite unheard of, that a pay claim should be imposed on workers in this way, unilaterally? It is an extraordinary thing that, despite what they said to the Joint Negotiating Committee, the Government should attempt in this way to deal by compulsion with a body of this kind. It is an undoubtedly serious psychological error to do this&#x2014;one of the many blunders on which the Government have insisted against sections of employees who axe motivated not by grab but by dedication. The statement which has been made will be received not only with disappointment but, in view of this singular method of imposition of a payment, with considerable resentment.</p>
