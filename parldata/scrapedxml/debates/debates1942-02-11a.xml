<p>The information in my possession does not support the statements made by my hon. Friend. Prior notification of the men's arrival was sent to the aerodrome to which they were proceeding and service transport was sent to meet them at the nearest railway station. When the men reached the aerodrome they were temporarily accommodated in a hut equipped with beds and bedding and warmed by two fires which were lit before they arrived. On the second night snow was blown under the door, causing some dampness, but no flooding took place.


Although the unit is full, there is no overcrowding, and the men were sent on leave not to relieve congestion, but in conformity with the usual practice of granting a period of leave on completion of a course. The guard of six men referred to is not the aerodrome guard, but the guard provided at a house, situated some miles from the aerodrome, which was requisitioned for the purpose of billeting airmen, and is now unoccupied after having been partially destroyed by fire. The guard is on duty for 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>The right hon. and gallant Gentleman has admitted that these people were sleeping in damp huts. It is true that there were stoves there but no fuel to light a fire; that while transport was provided, it was only after these people had arrived at the station and telephoned for it and that the transfer papers were not collected for four days after they had been there. Is it not strange that men should be moved from the West of England to an aerodrome in the East, and when they get there should be sent back to the West on leave, and further&#x2014;</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Air whether he is aware that a recent Air Council instruction, printing a list of about 3,000 Air Force passes and entry permits, which have been lost, and ordering sentries and others not to admit a person presenting one of these specified passes, is causing concern to those who have to act upon it; and whether he will make it clear to what extent sentries are to detain pass-holders while satisfying themselves that the proffered pass is not among the 3,000 which are cancelled?</p>

<p>Particulars of lost passes and similar documents are circulated to those concerned from time to time in order to prevent their misuse by unauthorised persons. The list is confidential and it would not be in the public interest to disclose the precise measures taken to prevent impersonation.

<p>Does the right hon. and gallant Gentleman really think it

satisfactory that while 3,000 lost passes are in circulation this list should merely be circulated to sentries and others, so that when passes are presented it is impossible to say whether they are valid or not, without looking through a list of 3,000 cancelled passes. Is there no common sense left in the Security Department of the Air Ministry?</p>

<p>Naturally when this Question was put down I went very fully into this subject. Of the list of 3,000, only a very small percentage are passes. The hon. Member would not expect me to give exact figures. The remainder are forms which are accepted as sufficient to allow entry and which carry the photograph of the holder. It is when the photograph does not tally with the man who has presented this form or pass, or alternatively, when it looks as if the pass had been tampered with, that the sentry has cause to look at the list. Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is wrong when he says that a list of 3,000 has to be gone through; it is only in a very small percentage of cases that any question arises.</p>

<p>In general, contracts are allocated after competitive tendering, the lowest tender being accepted wherever possible, having regard to the amount of work already allotted to the firm and to their technical capacity to carry out the particular work in the time required.

<p>Contract prices are in most cases fixed in the light of estimates by technical and accountant officers of the man-hours, labour costs, quantities and costs of materials and overhead expenses involved; subsequently, checks by accountants control progress payments. The small proportion of contracts paid for on a cost basis is subject to the same general supervision, and, in addition, the ascertained costs are checked by accountants employed by the Department. Progress payments are made to finance contractors on account of and within expenditure actually involved during the running period of the contract. The human element has on a very few occasions resulted in overpayment, which, in every case, it has been possible to set off against further earnings. All claims for progress payments are required to be certified by a responsible representative of the contractor, and are subject to periodical test checks by the Department's accountants.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. I am informed that the Governors of the R.B.C. have for some time past been concerned with regard to the executive control of the organisation. For this reason, they appointed Mr. Robert Foot, some three months ago, as general adviser. Mr. Foot has had important business administrative and organising experience. The Governors discussed these matters fully and came to the unanimous conclusion that the chief executive control of the Corporation under wartime conditions, with the great growth of the organisation and the complexity of the administrative and financial problems arising daily, in addition to those relating to the general programme policy and output, called for different qualities and experience from those suited for peacetime. They felt that the circumstances of to-day were completely different from those which existed at the time of Mr. Ogilvie's appointment in 1938.

placed his resignation in the hands of the Governors. It was accepted and announced in terms agreed with Mr. Ogilvie.</p>

<p>As regards the first part of the Question, the air postage on air mail letters from members of His Majesty's Forces in the Far East to this country is payable in local currency and it approximates to the rate of 1s. 3d. a half-ounce for air mail letters sent from this country to the Far East. The charge is admittedly high, but it was necessary to fix it at a high level so as to keep the loads within the limited aircraft capacity available for mails. As regards the second part of the Question, members of the Forces in the Far East are allowed to send letters home free of charge by surface mail without restriction as to number; they may also send home each week by air mail one light-weight letter-card for which the postage in local currency is approximately 3d.

These drives are being carried out through the Directorate of Demolition and Recovery recently established in my Department. The drive in Wiltshire is one of the first three to be made. The number of staff detached for this special duty is twelve, and the cost, inclusive of travelling and subsistence expenses, will be about &#x00A3;120 a week.

<p>asked the First Lord of the Admiralty whether he can make a statement upon the practice of his Department in relation to the supervision of contracts let to private firms; and to the check exercised by his accountants or other representatives upon the costing charges of such contractors in relation to the use of materials, delivery of orders, number of men employed, and the number of hours worked; and whether he is satisfied that contractors cannot be overpaid in relation to the goods supplied, and/or services rendered, at any point during the running period of the contract?</p>

<p>Wherever possible, contracts are let on a fixed price basis. In such contracts, it is in the interest of the contractor to exercise every economy in the use of labour and material. Nevertheless, costing by means of accountants or technical officers is employed over a very large field in the settlement of these contracts. Where contracts have to be let on the basis of actual cost, an Admiralty representative is normally associated directly with the work, and it is his responsibility to ensure, as far as possible, that only expenditure actually and necessarily incurred, is admitted for payment, and if excessive costs are found to have been incurred, they are disallowed; the Admiralty have also the right to allow only a reduced profit in such cases. In both types of con-


tract, any progress payments made are regulated by the value of the work done and of the materials accumulated.</p>

<p>The importance of welfare work among women is fully realised and domestic science classes were started at Luanshya more than two years ago by the United Missions to the Copperbelt. Excellent work has been done in the teaching of cooking, knitting, handicrafts and hygiene. Similar classes are now being held in the Mindolo compound, near Nkana. A third woman welfare officer is being sent out by the London Committee of the United Missions to the Copperbelt. The managements of all the copper mines have undertaken to do everything possible to encourage the making of flower gardens, and the Rhokana Corporation now gives prizes for the best kept flower gardens in any compound block, although it has not so far been found possible to increase the size of the plots. The whole question, including the provision of allotments, is being further studied by the labour commissioner in consultation with the Agricultural Department. Everything possible is being done to establish shade trees in mine compounds. The Governor is confident that the mine managements can be relied upon to do all in their power to increase the number of shade trees and the forestry officer is helping and advising them.</p>

<p>The Government have had under consideration the best means of carrying out their pledge to establish a Central Planning Authority and have reached the following decisions. The existing statutory duties in regard to town and country planning, exercised by the Minister of Health in England and Wales, will be transferred to the Minister of Works and Buildings, whose title will, with His Majesty's approval, be changed to Minister of Works and Planning. The Minister's planning functions will be to guide the formulation by local authorities in England and Wales of town and country planning schemes which will adequately reflect the national policy for urban and rural development. The Ministry will be recognised as the Department which local authorities in England and Wales must consult on the general lines of town and country planning, and it will exercise the powers of the central Government under the Town and Country Planning Acts, including the powers which will be available under forthcoming legislation to give effect to the First Report of the Uthwatt Committee, and it will lay down the general principles to which town and country planning must conform. The Secretary of State for Scotland will be, responsible, as heretofore, for the exercise in Scotland of the functions in regard to planning to be exercised in England and Wales by the Minister of Works and Planning.<br/>
It is evident that the work of the Minister of Works and Planning and of the Secretary of State for Scotland will touch upon the work of other Departments of State at very many points. The Minister of Works and Planning and the Secretary of State will, therefore, be assisted by a committee of senior officials representing the Departments concerned. The main functions of this committee will be to ensure that, so far as possible, the national policy of urban and rural

development is carried out as a single and consistent whole. Much of the work of interdepartmental co-ordination will be carried out by means of this committee of officials. Questions which cannot be settled by this committee will be dealt with by a committee of the Ministers concerned, under the chairmanship of the Minister without Portfolio by virtue of his special responsibilities for reconstruction matters generally, and will be settled by them unless reference to the War Cabinet is necessary. The Council of Ministers, the appointment of which was announced on 17th July, 1941, will be dissolved. It will of course be understood that these arrangements do not divest individual Ministers of their responsibility for taking action within the spheres of their respective Departments.<br/>
In reaching these decisions, the Government's intention has been to secure the most appropriate development and use of the land of this country, and they believe that by a procedure of this kind the various activities of the Departments concerned in post-war reconstruction, including the speedy provision of houses for those who need them, the redevelopment of devastated areas, the clearance of slums, the relief of overcrowding, the provision of all necessary public services and the general promotion of rural development in the light of a positive policy for the maintenance of a healthy and well-balanced agriculture, can be welded into a single and consistent policy. The Government will review, haling regard to subsequent developments and experience, the objectives stated in paragraph 4 of Section 428 of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Distribution of the Industrial Population, namely:
<q>
<ol>
<li>"(<i>a</i>) Continued and further redevelopment of congested urban areas, where necessary</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Decentralisation or dispersal, both of industries and industrial population, from congested areas.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) Encouragement of a reasonable balance of industrial development, so far as possible, throughout the various divisions or regions of Great Britain, coupled with the appropriate diversification of industry in each division or region throughout the country."</li>
</ol></q>
The Government will study and concert, in the light of the review, the steps that should be taken to reach these objectives.<br/>
In furthering their policy for urban and rural development, the Government will seek to avoid measures which would interfere with the overriding aim of raising


the standard of living to the highest possible level. In particular, the Government: (<i>a</i>) Will seek to ensure that fresh development is planned with due regard to the use which can be made of existing capital equipment and existing public services, and will not wantonly countenance the break-up of old and valuable industrial concentrations; (<i>b</i>) Will seek to avoid the diversion of productive agricultural land to other purposes if there is unproductive or less productive land that could reasonably be used for those purposes. The necessary legislation to give effect to these decisions will be introduced at an early date.</p>

<p>This scheme has the whole-hearted approval of the Secretary of State.

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Debate this day on the Shipping situation on the Motion for the Adjournment of the House be not restricted by the rule against anticipation.</q>
I move this Motion in order that the Debate on the shipping situation shall not be restricted in any way. I think the House would wish that, otherwise the rule against anticipation would restrict the Debate. The hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for East Renfrew (Major Lloyd) secured first place in the Supply Ballot and has given notice to call attention to the condition of the shipyards on going into Committee of Supply on the Navy Estimates. If the House agrees to this Motion, it will enable a wide Debate to take place to-day, and it will not affect my hon. and gallant Friend's right to move his Amendment at the appropriate time.</p>

<p>This is a novel Motion, though I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that it is a necessary one, but I think someone should make it clear&#x2014;and it is advisable to do so from this Box&#x2014;first that this is a procedure which should only be resorted to occasionally, as it involves great hardship on a Member who has been successful in the Ballot, and secondly that it is a debatable Motion and that it would be open to the House to discuss it.</p>
