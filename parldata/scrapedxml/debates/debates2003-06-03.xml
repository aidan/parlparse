	<p pid=".1.5/1">We have issued detailed guidance on how to measure the number of patients attending accident and emergency departments, and the number of those patients seen, treated and admitted or discharged in four hours or less from arrival. All trusts with an A and E department are required to measure and report these numbers.</p>

	<p pid=".1.6/1">But patients are no better off for being treated in other parts of the hospital while being taken off the four-hour wait times, and they are still being treated on trolleys. The recent BMA survey showed that both before and after the monitoring period in March, A and E departments met much lower thresholds. Doctors are worried that the process is distorting clinical priorities. Does not the Minister share my concern that hospital trust administrators are finding ever more inventive ways of treating targets rather than patients?</p>

	<p pid=".2.0/1">No, I do not. The hon. Gentleman knows that the Royal Cornwall hospital, part of his local trust, is taking positive steps towards the A and E target and exceeding it, because of the new medical assessment unit that is in place and because of the &pound;2 million that the trust has put in to establish a new ward. People should not wait longer than four hours in our emergency departments. His trust and trusts around the country are making tremendous progress on the target that we set for the end of 2004.</p>

	<p pid=".2.3/1">Is not the Minister embarrassed about the number of trusts that are forced to cheat to meet the target? Is he not concerned that the British Medical Association survey showed that a majority of respondents in A and E felt that the measures taken</p>
	<p pid=".2.3/2" class="indent">&quot;had distorted clinical priorities . . . and many said that waiting times for patients with the most serious conditions had increased.&quot; It was also reported that there were concerns that</p>

	<p pid=".2.3/4">Does not that make the target a sham, undermine confidence in statistics, undermine the Government's credibility, and involve the distortion of clinical priorities and resource allocation? Should he not stop it now?</p>

	<p pid=".3.0/1">The hon. Gentleman knows that the BMA surveyed only 30 per cent. of its members. Only the Liberal Democrats could think that that was a majority. It is not a majority, and indeed the BMA did not survey all trusts. There has been tremendous performance towards the A and E target that we set for the end of next year, because of the hard work, dedication, innovation and commitment of nurses and doctors in our A and E departments across the country. There has been investment and the target has focused and concentrated minds. The hon. Gentleman should make a distinction between the extra resources and capacity that go into trusts to achieve that milestone and those targets, and the fiddling, which is a disgraceful accusation to make of nurses and doctors across the country.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/963" speakername="David Hinchliffe" colnum="3"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-01.htm#30603-01_spnew6">
	<p pid=".3.1/1">My hon. Friend will be aware that A and E services have been monitored over many years by community health councils, which are due to abolished at the end of August. Could he explain to the House why CHC staff received a letter this weekend indicating that they will not be made redundant within the three-month period as they expected, and what the statement that the Department is to make later this week will tell us about the future of CHCs and their replacement bodies?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.3.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1033" speakername="David Lammy" colnum="3"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-01.htm#30603-01_spnew7">
	<p pid=".3.2/1">My hon. Friend is right that by independent monitoring, CHC staff made a great contribution to our A and E departments through casualty watch. There are on-going discussions with the Association of Community Health Councils for England and Wales and CHC members about that. I shall make a statement in due course about the issues that my hon. Friend raises.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.3.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/899" speakername="Liam Fox" colnum="3"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-01.htm#30603-01_spnew8">
	<p pid=".3.3/1">The Minister must accept that the entire monitoring exercise on A and E was a charade. The hospitals knew when they were to be measured, and they knew that they had to meet the Government's targets or they would be punished, because this is the &quot;Targets R Us&quot; Government. More importantly, the majority of doctors&mdash;not just those in the BMA&mdash;have said that the waiting time for those with more serious conditions went up during the monitoring period, and that operations were not scheduled at all or were cancelled. In effect, patients suffered so that Ministers could take credit. What does that say about the moral foundations of the Government's policy?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.3.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1033" speakername="David Lammy" colnum="3"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-01.htm#30603-01_spnew9">
	<p pid=".3.4/1">The milestone focuses minds. It means that hospitals across the country put in investment, resources and innovation to ensure that people are waiting no longer than four hours in our A and E departments. Does the hon. Gentleman want to return to the situation under the Tories, in which people were waiting six, seven, eight or nine hours in our A and E departments? Does he want to return to trolley waits in our A and E departments lasting 24 or 36 hours? Of course not. When he quotes the BMA, he is being selective. The chairman of the BMA's A and E committee said:</p>
	<p pid=".3.4/2" class="indent">&quot;Many of the doctors surveyed were proud of the level of service they provided in the week of monitoring&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".3.4/3">and said that that is clearly dependent on continuing staffing levels. That is because of the investment that the Government are putting in. The hon. Gentleman knows that and he should support our A and E doctors and nurses, not seek to undermine them.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.4.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/899" speakername="Liam Fox" colnum="4"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-01.htm#30603-01_spnew10">
	<p pid=".4.0/1">What fantasy is this&mdash;the idea that no patients are waiting more than four hours? Simply because the Government fiddle a survey, it does not mean that that is what is happening in the real world. In the real world, extra staff were taken on, staff were asked to work longer shifts and patients were shifted from one part of the system to another. It is not us who are undermining the staff, but the Government, with their constant interference and imposition of targets on them. The targets are now the only thing that matters, irrespective of their effects on doctors, nurses or patients in the system, and no matter what the distortions of clinical priorities. As long as Ministers are kept happy, that is the main thing. We have seen the waiting list figures fiddled and the star ratings distorted, and while the Prime Minister struggles with his 45 minutes to Armageddon and the Chancellor plays fantasy economic growth, the Secretary of State is doctoring the casualty figures. Is it any wonder that in this country it is not only Cabinet Ministers who feel that they are being duped?</p>

	<p pid=".4.1/1">It was a milestone set for the end of March. That is very straightforward. The target is for the end of the year, next year. There has been improvement month on month in our A and E departments since September. As to the hon. Gentleman's suggestion that that figure for the end of March was not sustainable, we saw average improvement in April as well.</p>

	<p pid=".4.2/1">Will the Minister reflect on the fact that, if we are trying to ensure sensible use of A and E services and maximise throughput, the corollary is that minor injuries units must be effective? Like many hon. Members, I am concerned that minor injuries units that are seen, rightly or wrongly, as a substitute for some withdrawn A and E services, should have the maximum availability in terms of hours. Will he please address that issue and, in particular, consider the Orsett hospital in Thurrock, where the minor injuries unit is not open to a sufficient extent in terms of compensation for my constituents?</p>

	<p pid=".4.3/1">I shall undertake to do that. My hon. Friend will know that minor injuries units and walk-in centres make a tremendous contribution to emergency services and should sit alongside mainstream A and E services, medical assessment units, clinical decision units and a lot of other initiatives to ensure a quick throughput in our A and E departments and across the board.</p>

	<p pid=".5.2/1">Over the next two years, we are investing &pound;94 million to make the benefits of digital hearing aids fitted as part of a modernised service available more widely on the NHS. All NHS hearing aid centres in England will be providing digital hearing aids by April 2005.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid=".5.3/1">I am glad to hear it, but my constituents are concerned that they have to pay for digital hearing aids, while in wealthier places on the mainland, they are available free on the NHS. Will the Minister explain why she wrote on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-27">27 May</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/2" class="indent">&quot;If the services commissioned by a PCT . . . do not meet the needs of a particular patient, then GPs do also have freedom to refer elsewhere using the Out of Area . . . arrangements&quot;,</p>

	<p pid=".5.4/1">That is why it is important that everybody, wherever they live, gets access to digital hearing aids on the NHS. St. Mary's hospital in the hon. Gentleman's constituency is keen to take part in the modernising hearing aids scheme, and by April 2005 it will have the opportunity to do so. His constituents, along with those in the whole of England, will, for the first time, be able to get their digital hearing aids not by going private, but through the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".5.5/1">My hon. Friend will be aware that there are some 2 million hearing aid users and perhaps another 2 million who should be using hearing aids. Will she take it from me that to move in three or four years from a position in which no digital hearing aids were available on the NHS to one in which they are 100 per cent. available is a highly commendable achievement? Does she accept that that speed of progress is related to the training and availability of audiologists; and will she assure the House that appropriate training and recruitment of audiologists is taking place to complement the measure?</p>

	<p pid=".5.6/1">My hon. Friend, who has some expertise, is absolutely right. It is important that we not only introduce new hearing aids, but support that with a modernised service so that people can have the check-ups and preparation that are necessary to make the best use of digital hearing aids. We can do that, first, by helping staff to work in a different way and, secondly, by increasing the number of audiologists. My hon. Friend will be pleased to know that from this September, three additional degree courses for audiologists are starting, with more to follow in coming years. Those courses, which are funded by the Department of Health, will ensure that we have the staff in place to match the extra investment that will make the service available to people using the NHS in England.</p>

	<p pid=".6.0/1">I am interested not in encouraging people to go out of the NHS privately, but in enabling people within the NHS to get digital hearing aids for free. That is why we have started private sector pilots in Leeds and Shrewsbury that use capacity in the private sector to ensure that more NHS patients get digital hearing aids, and why we are developing a national framework contract to allow us to use capacity in the private sector for NHS patients.</p>
	<p pid=".6.0/2">The hon. Gentleman's question highlights the difference between Members on this side of the House and those on the other side. He, like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/899" name="Liam Fox">the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)</phrase>, wants to encourage people to pay and get out of the NHS; we want to encourage people to get the service that they deserve in the NHS, and that is what we will do.</p>

	<p pid=".6.3/1">Improving services for people with mental health problems is a priority for the Government. We aim to help those who may have difficulty in paying prescription charges, rather than extending the exemption arrangements. By using a prescription prepayment certificate, no one need pay more than &pound;32.90 for four months, or &pound;90.40 for 12 months, for all the NHS medication that they are prescribed.</p>

	<p pid=".6.4/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. However, what does she make of the report by Mind and <i>Health Which?</i> on the hidden costs of mental health, which found that 83 per cent. of people with experience of mental distress had not received the care or treatment that they needed and felt that they could not cope with life or recover, and that 59 per cent. of them were unable to afford the treatments and drugs that were on offer? Does not that represent a lack of boldness?</p>

It covers not only medication and prescriptions, but psychological therapies, art therapy and complementary therapy.</p>
	<p pid=".6.5/2">On access to prescriptions, if more people got pre-payment certificates they would find that a tremendous help in meeting the costs of medication. It is important to try to expand the non-drug treatments that are available in the range of mental health services. We are doing a great deal of research into therapies involving psychological counselling, and to get more capacity into the system we have 1,000 people training to be able to provide those non-drug therapies within the NHS.</p>

	<p pid=".7.0/1">Is the hon. Lady aware of the survey conducted by the Depression Alliance which showed that up to 50 per cent. of those suffering from mental problems are now turning to herbal medicines, and to aromatherapy in particular? Does she not think that it would be helpful if the certificates to which she referred could encompass herbal medicine and aromatherapy, to help those affected? Is she not also absolutely ashamed of the Food Standards Agency report on vitamin supplements, which has caused such confusion? Does she agree that many doctors prescribe and encourage patients to take vitamin supplements, and that the idea that the whole nation is on the same quality of diet is absolutely ridiculous?</p>

	<p pid=".7.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is fully aware that primary care trusts can now commission a whole range of therapies, because they have the resources at the front line of the service. He is also aware that there has to be a proper evidence base for those therapies to be provided. Continuing to raise the game of complementary practitioners is an important part of the service and increasing regulation. In the mental health field, a whole range of therapies is beginning to be evaluated, and the involvement of people with mental health problems in arts projects, for example, is proving extremely helpful in alleviating some of their problems and symptoms. So this is not just a matter of traditional complementary therapies; a whole range of alternatives is beginning to be offered under this Government to people with long-term mental health problems.</p>

I would draw Members' attention to its recommendation on ensuring that, in accordance with the Mind prescribing protocol, people with mental health problems are involved in the clinical decisions about the kind of medication that should be prescribed. Time and again, we have found that when we get expert patients involved, the medical outcomes are much better. The Mind protocol is an excellent piece of work and we shall certainly look at all the report's recommendations to see what we can take up.</p>

	<p pid=".8.0/1">The West Midlands South strategic health authority is currently working with both trusts to ensure a return to financial balance at the earliest possible opportunity.

	<p pid=".8.1/1">I thank the Minister for that answer. Despite the increase in resources of which he speaks, however, the South Worcestershire primary care trust is consulting on a range of painful options involving cuts in the local health service, including downgrading the minor injuries unit at Evesham community hospital, and the Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust is suffering in a real struggle to bring its large cumulative deficit back into balance. On three occasions, Ministers have refused to answer my parliamentary questions on when the hospital trust will be obliged to write off its cumulative deficit. It is important for the doctors and nurses at the hospital to know what cuts in their services might be threatened, in order to bring the deficit down. I would ask the Minister&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]&mdash;</i>I have asked this question three times before; this is the fourth time. When will the hospital trust be obliged to write off its cumulative deficit?</p>

	<p pid=".8.2/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns about the health service in his constituency. He will know that NHS regulations require trusts to restore financial balance within three years of the deficit arising, and that is the time frame within which his local trust must operate. I hope that that answer is helpful to him. As he is not being partisan today, I would like to offer him this comment in an equally non-partisan spirit. I hear his concerns about the resources going into his local NHS&mdash;we all do, on this side of the House&mdash;but I would simply ask him to reflect on the plausibility of his critique, given that his party voted against the resources going into the national health service at all. I hardly think that he is in a position to bemoan the lack of resources going into the NHS in Worcestershire when he and his hon. Friends voted against the increases.</p>

	<p pid=".9.4/1">I am grateful for that reply. Although I have no objection in principle to my right hon. Friend's plans to devolve power within the NHS, I still struggle to understand his proposals on accountability. How will candidates be selected? Will they nominate themselves or will they be chosen in some other way, as yet undecided? Is there not a danger that, if we are not careful, we shall end up with foundation hospitals that are less rather than more accountable to the public they serve? I know that that is not what he is aiming at.</p>

	<p pid=".9.5/1">My hon. Friend is right about that. The principle is that we want to ensure that local staff and local members of the community have a greater say in how local hospitals such as his own, which have applied to become an NHS foundation trust, are run. That must be right. If we are to achieve more responsive local services, with the best will in the world, that cannot be imposed from Whitehall or from the top down. There has to be a much greater local element of accountability than there has been to date.</p>
	<p pid=".9.5/2">On the provision for how people will be elected, obviously, the NHS foundation trusts are a membership-based organisation and we want to ensure, as far as we can, that as wide a swathe of the local community as possible become members of NHS foundation trusts. I think that my hon. Friend is aware that the Bill provides for secret postal ballots from among the members who will be involved in direct elections to the hospital governing board. He is also aware that local members of staff will have an opportunity to be represented on the governing body, so, for the first time, local staff and local members of the community will have a direct say in how the hospital is being run.</p>

	<p pid=".9.6/1">I welcome the Secretary of State saying that he wants to encourage the widest possible membership of foundation hospitals. In that spirit, will he consider extending membership to all people on the electoral roll in the relevant area? If he does not want to go that far, will he tell the House what active measures he will take to promote wide membership, which many of us would welcome?</p>

	<p pid=".10.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. It is important that the membership of NHS foundation trusts is as large as possible, representing the local community. There are a number of options, and one is to achieve that through advertising in the local media, which would encourage local people to become members. Alternative options include allowing people to register to become a member of an NHS foundation trust when they register, for example, to vote in a local election.</p>

	<p pid=".10.2/1">As my right hon. Friend and I have discussed previously, the position of specialist hospitals is somewhat at variance with that of most district general hospitals, for example. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Although <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/899" name="Liam Fox">the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)</phrase> laughs, he is the first to say that the NHS is not a uniform service. Indeed it is not. Specialist hospitals have a very different make-up and serve a very different catchment population from district general hospitals. That is why it must be right, as the Bill does, to allow some flexibility in the governance structure.</p>
	<p pid=".10.2/2">Specialist hospitals, in part, serve the local community, and members of the local community would have the right to become members of the NHS foundation trust. Equally, the vast majority of users of a hospital such as Christie are drawn not from the local community, but from patients and, due to the hospital's excellent services, those patients come from not only the north-west, but across the whole country. That is why the Bill gives flexibility&mdash;precisely so that patients and the public can be represented on the governing body of such organisations.</p>

	<p pid=".10.3/1">Will the Secretary of State reflect on criticism from the Labour-dominated Select Committee on Health? It said that the plans for the constituencies to elect the governing boards would be determined by unelected NHS organisations. As a result, the Committee said that the board of governors would function simply as focus groups, advisory panels or talking shops. On reflection, does the Secretary of State not think that it would have been better to be more consistent in deciding on the constituency bodies that would elect governing boards, and thus to avoid confusion, anomalies, disappointment and a system that prevents the boards from carrying out their functions effectively?</p>

It is through them that the NHS has an impact on our lives. That is why the extra &pound;1 billion that the Government are investing in primary care over the next three years is so crucial. It will have an impact on my hon. Friend's constituency and on the constituencies of all Members, regardless of whether they voted for the money in the first place.</p>

Friend will be aware that the new contract negotiated between the NHS Confederation and the BMA represents a real step forward not just for GPs but for NHS patients&mdash;not least because it guarantees a 33 per cent. increase in funding for primary care services.

As he is aware, the way out of the financial difficulties that arose in his own area, for example, was for it to borrow NHS resources from other areas that underspent on their budgets in a particular year, so it cannot be right simply to wipe the slate clean, thereby penalising those areas that have managed their budgets properly. We need the right incentives in place to ensure that, in all parts of the country, financial management is always given the priority that it deserves. Equally, as the hon.

Dr. Coleman says that it would be possible to state that if the new contract can work in his practice, with high disease prevalence, it can work in any practice throughout the country. He also volunteers the Avenue as a pilot programme for the new contract. Could the Secretary of State spread this enthusiasm to other areas, in order to develop the contract?</p>

	<p pid=".13.2/1">I will do my best. Although there has been controversy about the new contract, when GPs see the detail they will understand how they will benefit. Of course, their surgeries will benefit and there will be additional financial investment, but like most people working in the national health service, family doctors are after an improvement in services to patients. Crucially, that is precisely what this contract offers.</p>

	<p pid=".14.0/1">Early diagnosis and early treatment are top priorities for the Government, because it has been shown that they result in much better health outcomes for patients. That means increasing capacity, and I can tell the hon. Gentleman that the New Opportunities Fund has provided for 57 extra MRI scanners and cancer plan funding for 50 extra MRI scanners and 50 CT scanners&mdash;a vast improvement in the amount of modern equipment in our NHS, which will enable many more scans to be carried out. In 2001&ndash;02, the last year for which figures are available, an extra 73,000 scans were carried out in this country to secure early diagnosis and much better treatment. Capacity is improving, and the hon. Gentleman's local hospital was provided with a new CT scanner in April this year, which should go some way towards improving the local position.</p>

	<p pid=".14.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. As well as making more equipment available, we also need trained and qualified staff to operate it, and we have increased the number of radiotherapists in training by 55 per cent. We are also working on programmes to enable assistant and advanced practitioners to carry out procedures that were previously carried out only by radiologists. A report published today on pilot programmes carried out across the country shows that radiographers can extend their skills and make a real contribution to shortening waiting times for patients, which is so important.</p>

	<p pid=".14.3/1">Ninety-five per cent. of patients attending hospitals for scans require diagnostic imaging services that are delivered by radiographers. However, last year the Audit Commission found that 250,000 patients had to wait up to five months for MRI scans, with an estimated national shortage of 5,000 radiographers. Since then, the Royal College of Radiologists believes that the position has deteriorated. Given that new recruits are simply not entering the profession, that too many radiologists are leaving early and that the Society of Radiographers has just become the first health service union to vote against &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, which would have meant a working year that was three weeks longer without extra pay, how on earth is the Minister going to meet her new recruitment targets by 2004 and bring down waiting times for scans without counting it as yet another top priority?</p>

	<p pid=".14.4/1">The hon. Gentleman has a cheek, in view of the cuts in training places&mdash;not just for radiographers, but for GPs, doctors, nurses and a whole range of services&mdash;that took place under the Conservative Government. We are not only turning around those cuts but securing growth in the service.Radiotherapy training places are now up by 55 per cent. from 1997 levels. Furthermore, radiographers are welcoming the new ways in which they can extend their skills. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Gentleman listens to the information that I am providing, he might learn something. I urge him to read, in detail, the report on radiography published today, which shows that projects on skills mix have enabled advanced practitioners to interpret X-rays. They can now put the markers on the X-rays, which identify where breast lumps are, and other practitioners can carry out basic radiotherapy. It is not just about increasing capacity, but reforming and redesigning how the service works, using imagination and creativity, which the hon. Gentleman lacks.</p>

We also support some innovative ways of reaching carers, including the ring-around carers scheme, which uses telephone conferencing to ensure that carers are aware of their new rights to assessments and their ability to access some of the increasing investment that is being made to support them.</p>

	<p pid=".16.5/1">My hon. Friend makes a very important point. He is right: carers make a massive contribution to this country and to the people whom they serve. In fact, six carers out of 10 have suggested that short breaks are often their most effective support. To enable us to provide such breaks, the Governmenthave doubled the amount of money going through the carers grant. In addition, we must make sure that the provision is more flexible. That is why we issued regulations&mdash;I think just last week&mdash;to develop the short-break voucher scheme. It is now easier for local authorities to issue carers with vouchers for their breaks, so that carers can take breaks at times, and with providers, that are more flexible and useful for them. However, my hon. Friend is right. The Government will do all that we can to support carers and the vital work that they do in our communities.</p>

	<p pid=".17.3/1">The general practitioners committee of the BMA is currently balloting GPs on the new general medical services contract. Subject to approval and the passage of the necessary legislation, we hope to begin implementation of the new contract next year. The new contract will bring significant benefits to both doctors and NHS patients, by rewarding improvements in care and by widening the available range of primary care-based services. The new contract will also mean that expenditure on primary care will rise from &pound;6.1 billion this year to &pound;8 billion by 2006.</p>

Last year, 66 per cent. of GPs threatened to resign if a new contract was not negotiated successfully, and the Minister was able to ensure that the BMA would ballot members only by inserting a minimum practice guarantee. How long will that guarantee be in place, and who will decide when it is no longer necessary?</p>

The result has been a good deal for GPs and for NHS patients. I hope that the hon. Lady will join me in urging GPs to endorse the contract, because of the significant benefits that it will bring. We have made it clear that there will be no time limit on the minimum practice guarantee. It is not part of the new arrangements that any practice should lose out financially. Quite the opposite: there are significant financial benefits for GPs, and reciprocal benefits for patients. The hon. Lady should exhibit her usual good grace and welcome what is an important development for primary care, in her constituency and in the NHS as a whole.</p>

Friend is well aware, not least from his own close working relationship with the health service in Newcastle, that specialist hospital trusts, such as the Freeman and the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, provide a range of services, which are, as he rightly says, not just district general hospital services, but more specialist tertiary services as well. Inevitably, therefore, those hospitals are in negotiation with a number of primary care trusts. In such situations, what normally happens is that one local PCT has the responsibility of becoming the lead commissioner and acts on behalf of a number of local PCTs. If that is not happening in my hon. Friend's area, I shall gladly look into the matter. He might also like to be aware that the NHS bank will shortly be conducting a review of how money flows around the system, precisely to ensure, first, that it gets to the front line, and secondly, that it does so in a timely way that does not jeopardise the provision of front-line patient services.</p>

	<p pid=".23.1/3" class="indentitalic">Proceedings in Committee, on Consideration and Third Reading</p>

	<p pid=".23.2/1">I am, frankly, a little mystified. The Minister's statement, when taken at face value, is very interesting but, by my calculations, we have gained precisely an extra nine minutes of debating time out of which we must take the time to debate the motion. As the Minister knows, we are not generally supportive of programme motions&mdash;we voted against motion No. 1&mdash;and I shall reiterate a couple of points.</p>
	<p pid=".23.2/2">We have said from the outset that we will support emergency legislation if it effectively removes the burden that the fire dispute is placing on our troops, ensures public safety and ensures that our emergency services are ready and able to respond to the increased threat of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid=".23.2/3">We have said that we will support not only a Bill that achieves that, but the unusual parliamentary arrangements for its consideration if the Government accept amendments that allow it to fulfil those purposes. If, however, the Bill is not an effective emergency measure of short duration to deal with the present crisis by the time that it completes its passage through this place, it cannot be justified because it is a draconian measure that gives the Secretary of State powers to impose settlements in a way that would not usually be acceptable. In addition, it goes against the grain of everything that the Government have said about devolving power and decision-making responsibility to local fire authorities in their attempt to reform the fire service. The Bill will recentralise on a massive scale and give the Secretary of State huge power to impose a settlement.</p>
	<p pid=".23.2/4">If the Bill itself is not justified then neither is the special parliamentary passage that is being made available for it. I hope the Minister accepts that there is a problem with taking all the remaining stages of a Bill at one sitting of the House. It is normal practice to consider the details of a Bill that need to be addressed during the Committee stage and for Opposition Members, and I suspect in this case some Labour Members, to consult outside bodies and to review what the Committee decided before it is considered further. That will clearly not be possible today because we will move straight from the Committee stage to Report or Third Reading, which places us in some difficulties.</p>
	<p pid=".23.2/5">In our opinion the special procedures to deal with the Bill are justified only if it is an emergency measure of short duration which addresses the immediate and present problem, but in those circumstances it is surely not justified to curtail the debate further by placing a time limit on it. Surely it is necessary to allow the House as much time as it needs. I will urge my hon. Friends to vote against the programme motion.</p>

	<p pid=".24.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that. It might be very interesting to know whether such prior consultation has taken place. I suspect from the comments that the Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister made on Second Reading and from what I recently read in the press about the relationship between Government Front-Bench spokesmen and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, that it is unlikely that cosy fireside chats have taken place. No doubt the Minister will alert us if something is going on that we should know about.</p>

	<p pid=".24.2/1">Our problem with the programme motion is that it allows the Government to rush the Bill through at an unnecessarily fast pace. If the Fire Brigades Union conference accepts the settlement in about a week's time, as it may do, the Bill is unnecessary. The timing of that conference means that there is certainly more time to consider the Bill's measures than the six and a half hours allocated for the remaining stages.</p>
	<p pid=".24.2/2">The Government have indicated that if the FBU accepts the settlement on offer, they probably will not pursue the Bill further at that stage. There is therefore time to consider the Bill, since the Government are clearly not trying to get it on to the statute book in time for the conference.</p>
	<p pid=".24.2/3">The Liberal Democrats will join the Conservatives in opposing the programme motion. The Bill is being pushed through at a tremendously fast rate and it is almost certain that there will not be sufficient time to consider all the groups of amendments. There are serious issues to be debated this afternoon&mdash;issues that are the subject of considerable disagreement across the House&mdash;but I am strongly of the opinion that they will not be reached.</p>

	<p pid=".25.0/1">I rise to support my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" name="Matthew Green">the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green)</phrase> in their opposition to the programme motion. I have several reasons, which I shall advance briefly.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/2">First, I am bound to say that I am against programme motions per se. There is very little justification for them, and I do not believe that there is justification in the present case. One of the malign consequences of a programme motion is that it discourages participation by right hon. and hon. Members in discussion of the Bill, because they know that there will be limited time in which to speak. Frequently, they simply do not turn up, far less do they table amendments and new clauses. That is of particular importance when a Bill is taken on the Floor of the House. This is the only occasion on which the Bill will be subject to detailed scrutiny, yet because of the programme motion many right hon. and hon. Members who might otherwise have participated or made proposals for change have been discouraged from doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/3">My next point follows on from the comments made by my hon. Friend the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. We have, of course, the theoretical option of having a Report stage. Amendments have been tabled, some of which are Government amendments. We can hope that the non-Government amendments will be carried&mdash;that is possible&mdash;but we can be sure that the Government amendments will be carried because the Whips are here to ensure that they are. Consequently, the House has the option, in theory, of having a Report stage.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/4">I agree that some of the Government amendments are pretty trivial. Some of the non-Government amendments&mdash;mine, for example&mdash;are not, and if they were carried right hon. and hon. Members would want to have proper time to reflect on them and to take representations from outside the House before proceeding to Report. However, we are to proceed forthwith to Report and then Third Reading, concluding at 10 o'clock or thereabouts. That means that the House will not consider in detail any amendments made in Committee, or if it does it will be uninformed consideration because we have not had time to take representations from outside.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/5">I have a further point. I tabled three new clauses, the object of which was to prevent industrial action by fire brigade members. They were not selected. Now, as you know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I would not dream of complaining about that&mdash;after all, you would be the first to tell me that Mr. Speaker never gives reasons for not selecting amendments and that it would be impertinent of me to raise the point. All of that, I willingly concede. However, some might suppose that the reason my new clauses were not selected is that they lay outside the long title of the Bill&mdash;that is possible. On reflection, it might have been possible to construct the new clauses so as to bring them within the long title; they would then have been capable of being tabled on Report. However, because I learned only today, at 1 o'clock or thereabouts, that I had had the misfortune not to have had my new clauses selected, and because we are to proceed forthwith to Report, I am unable, barred, precluded, disqualified from tabling significant amendments for proper discussion by the House.</p>
	<p pid=".25.0/6">It is surely right that Members of Parliament have the opportunity on Report to consider whether or not FBU members should have a right to go on strike. However, the effect of the motion is to prevent me having an opportunity to table new clauses in a proper form. That is a lamentable betrayal of democracy and yet another example of the ill effects of the motion.</p>

	<p pid=".26.0/1">A guillotine is, of course, a denial of the rights of Members to represent their constituencies and to express their views. It is an abrogation of freedom of speech. At the heart of all this is a Government intent to exercise total control over the business of the House, as they have been doing since they first came into office. I agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase>, who spoke from the Opposition Front Bench, and with my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/967" name="Douglas Hogg">the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase>. Their points are true and just.</p>
	<p pid=".26.0/2">I ask the House to reflect on the fact that in this Session 23 Bills have been subject to the guillotine, or, as we call it now, a programming motion or whatever. All but three have been opposed by Opposition Members and by Labour Members on Divisions. In addition to the 23 Bills that were subject to the guillotine, 10 motions, including the one before us, were applied. Twenty-three Bills, in the short time since November, equals half the number of Bills that were guillotined by Baroness Thatcher during her time as Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".26.0/3">Labour Members well know that Baroness Thatcher's guillotining of Bills, of which I was a vigorous opponent, was considered to be a major authoritarian and almost autocratic instrument of her control over the House. Yet, within six months of the start of the Session the Government have already guillotined half the number of Bills that were guillotined during 11 years. It is intolerable. That is the truth of it. One day, Labour Back Benchers will wake up and understand that there is almost no purpose in their being here if they can be denied the right to speak on matters of great importance.</p>
	<p pid=".26.0/4">The fire service is undoubtedly one of those matters. It has given rise to what the Deputy Prime Minister insists is emergency legislation. Those are the pieces of legislation that require caution and proper examination. Yet we have the twenty-third Bill of the Session experiencing its second guillotine motion. I ask the House to consider whether that does us justice in the face of the genuine anxieties and beliefs of our constituents. The motion is intolerable and it should be opposed.</p>

As a sensible and entirely reasonable move, which we discussed with other parties through the usual channels, we suggested that there should be arrangements to ensure that the House had a full six and a half hours to discuss six groups of amendments to a two-clause Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".27.0/2">I say to Opposition Members that, put in that context, much of the rhetoric that we have heard appears to be little more than that.</p>

	<p pid=".27.2/1">I will give way in a moment. I know that the hon. Gentleman has strong feelings on these matters. Before he intervenes, I put it to him that there is a world of difference between the application of a guillotine motion to a large and complex Bill, with the result that it will not receive detailed consideration, and a programme motion that is designed to ensure orderly consideration of a very short Bill that can be considered properly and fully within the time available, and that is what we are considering this afternoon.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.27.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1220" speakername="Richard Shepherd" colnum="27"  time="015:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-08.htm#30603-08_spnew3">
	<p pid=".27.3/1">It is not good enough to be quite so dismissive by speaking of a two-clause Bill. The Minister will remember that Maastricht was the subject of a two or three-clause Bill, and that that had huge ramifications. The present Bill also has ramifications. As the right hon. Gentleman well knows, it gives the state enormous powers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.27.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1182" speakername="Nick Raynsford" colnum="27"  time="015:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-08.htm#30603-08_spnew4">
	<p pid=".27.4/1">I am only surprised that the hon. Gentleman should want to rake up in his party's psyche the uncomfortable memory of the Maastricht treaty. Many of us feel genuine sympathy for the wider issue of the need for proper time for consideration. Many of us felt unhappy about the old arrangements, under which Bills were considered at enormous length for several weeks, and then inevitably a guillotine had to be applied, or they would not have completed their passage.</p>
	<p pid=".27.4/2">The purpose of timetabling is to ensure that there is a proper, orderly process in which all parts of the Bill can be considered. That is what we are doing. This is a two-clause Bill. There are six groups of amendments. There is more than adequate time to consider them, and if we were not spending so much time on the programme motion, we would be able to give more time to the details of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".27.4/3">I offer my sympathy to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/967" name="Douglas Hogg">the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase> on his failure to prepare his three new clauses in a form that allowed them to be considered. I am sorry that he feels that he has been precluded, debarred and prevented from tabling new clauses. I think it is simply the way in which he drafted the new clauses that is to blame.</p>
	<p pid=".27.4/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> knows only too well that the Bill is a short-term measure. It is not designed to be in place for long-term strategic purposes. It is necessary because of the circumstances relating to the fire dispute, which have been discussed at considerable length in previous debates in the House, many on statements from my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. We have always made it clear that we would introduce the measure if necessary, to ensure that a line can be drawn under the dispute. That is why the Bill has been prepared. There has been close consultation with Opposition parties all the way through the process. The purpose of taking the Bill through in one sitting today has been discussed fully and does not justify the criticism levelled by the hon. Gentleman.</p>

	<p pid=".28.0/1">I am interested to hear the Minister's assertion that the Bill is to be a short-term measure. He knows that the first group of amendments is led by an amendment tabled by me and my right hon. and hon. Friends to ensure that that is the case, but I am afraid I have missed the Government amendment delivering a similar outcome, if that is the Minister's intention.</p>

	<p pid=".28.1/1">I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman was not paying attention in the Second Reading debate when I made it clear in my winding-up speech that we would consider carefully the option for making this a time-limited Bill. We always made it clear that our intention was to introduce the measure to deal with the unhappy short-term situation existing in relation to the fire dispute. That was the reason for introducing the measure and the reason for timetabling it. I hope that hon. Members will accept that there is good reason.</p>

	<p pid=".28.2/1">I am afraid that that sort of rhetorical blather does not meet the needs of the case. If it is the right hon. Gentleman's intention to table the measure only for use in the short term, and in light of the existence of the precedent of the Electronic Communications Act 2000 introduced by his Government, can he explain the absence from the Bill of a sunset clause?</p>

	<p pid=".28.3/1">I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman, who knows a great deal about rhetorical blather, has not had sufficient time to read the Order Paper and to realise that in the next group of amendments we will consider that very issue. I suggest that we would do the House a service if we now brought an end to proceedings on the programme motion and proceeded to the substantive matters. I urge the House to support the motion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.34.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="34"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-09.htm#30603-09_spnew1">
	<p pid=".34.0/1">This broad group of amendments deals, first, with the duration of the powers to be granted to the Secretary of State, and the Committee is spoilt for choice. Amendment No. 29, which was tabled by the Liberal Democrats, proposes that the powers should last for 15 months, whereas amendment No. 17, which was tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1052" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd)</phrase> and is, I understand, supported by the Government, proposes two years. We find ourselves, perhaps untypically, between those two extremes, as we suggest 18 months in amendments Nos. 35 and 2.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/2">There is broad agreement that the Bill must be seen as a short-term, defined-life measure to deal with a particular situation in which the country finds itself at this moment. We made it clear on Second Reading that we view the short term and the long term quite differently. We can accept measures to deal with the immediate short-term problems that have arisen in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, but certain matters will have to be dealt with differently over the longer term.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/3">Let us consider the immediate situation that the country faces. The fire service dispute has dragged on for a year; lives are being put at risk and a burden is being placed on the military when our forces are already substantially overstretched, with other potential tasks hurtling at them seemingly from every corner and continent of the world at every moment. So, there are two issues there, but it is also clear that the fire dispute is having a negative impact on the Government's plans to prepare the country properly to defend itself against possible terrorist attacks at home. Nobody in the House can tolerate that.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/4">In relation to anti-terrorist preparations, the Deputy Prime Minister said on Second Reading:</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/5" class="indent">&quot;If the FBU will not co-operate, the Government will take action to provide that protection against terrorist attack by whatever means necessary.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-05-08.858"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 May 2003; Vol. 404, c. 858</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/6">That implies that if the Fire Brigade Union did not begin to co-operate in the deployment of decontamination units, the Government would take other steps. Will the Minister let the Committee know whether any progress has been made on the important issue of the training and deployment of those decontamination units?</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/7">We see the Bill, if it has a role, as a time-limited, effective measure&mdash;it will be effective, however, only if other amendments, which we and others have tabled, are accepted&mdash;to end the dispute, lift the threat of strikes and create a breathing space in which to consider in a less pressurised atmosphere the future organisation of our fire services.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/8">The Bill is not about fairness or any other abstract concept; it is about public safety, which should be the No. 1 consideration of any Government.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/9">Indeed, the imposition of a settlement by the Secretary of State, unilaterally, is a draconian measure that can be justified only in extreme circumstances. We are prepared to acknowledge that the present circumstances are extreme and could justify extreme measures, but if that is the case the measures must be presented effectively, and deliver the objectives that have been set out.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/10">On Second Reading, the Deputy Prime Minister referred repeatedly to an arbitrated settlement. This is, of course, no such thing. The Bill proposes giving the Secretary of State power to impose a settlement that he has devised; he is in no sense an independent or impartial arbitrator. The Bill represents a huge step back from the decentralisation of the fire service that is embraced by the Government's modernisation agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/11">We are in a strange position. A few weeks ago we were asked to vote on the repeal of section 19 of the Fire Services Act 1947, as a result of which the Secretary of State would no longer be involved in, for example, sanctioning the closure of individual fire stations. Now, we are effectively asked to reinstate a power under the 1947 Act that was abolished in 1959&mdash;to return the Secretary of State's right to impose a settlement relating to pay and to terms and conditions of employment.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/12">These measures can, however, be justified because of the public safety issues that have arisen&mdash;because of the terrorist threat in the short term, and because of the impact on the military, which, given its current overstretch, cannot provide adequate cover during an ongoing dispute in the fire service. The Deputy Prime Minister himself told us that in the event of a future dispute military cover would be reduced from the 19,000 troops that were available during the strikes before Christmas to only 9,000, with 250 fire appliances&mdash;or &quot;goddesses&quot;, as the Deputy Prime Minister likes to call them&mdash;and some 300 further specialist vehicles. Just 250 pumps would be available to cover the entire United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/13">On Second Reading, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the powers that he seeks will enable him to secure a pay and modernisation deal. I reaffirm the Conservatives' strong support for the Bain agenda, linking higher pay to improved productivity; but that agenda will be delivered effectively only if the Bill is amended. It is clear that whether it succeeds or fails, it seeks to settle the current dispute by means that would normally be judged unacceptable because there is no element of independent arbitration. For that reason if for no other, this must be seen as an emergency measure&mdash;and an essential feature of an emergency measure is its limited duration. It must, in fact, be limited to the duration of the emergency.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/14">One of the challenges that face us is the task of estimating the likely duration of the present emergency. That task has a number of facets, perhaps the most prominent being the need to deploy large numbers of British troops for peacekeeping duties in Iraq. There is also the possibility that as the war on terrorism unfolds, British troops will be called on for missions elsewhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/15">The duration of the Bill should be limited so that more complex&mdash;and perhaps, in the longer term, more acceptable&mdash;solutions can be adopted, with the benefit of mature consideration: far more consideration than we are able to devote to all the Bill's remaining stages in a single afternoon. We believe that 18 months is probably an adequate initial period for the existence of the proposed powers, although the Government could of course seek to extend it at some future time.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/16">Perhaps the Government intend to support amendment No. 17 because it specifies a different period&mdash;two years&mdash;or because they find the face of its mover slightly more amenable. If they can make a case for a two-year period, we would certainly accept it and withdraw amendment No. 35. Desperate efforts have been made behind the scenes, involving a roll of sticking plaster and a pair of scissors, and I am sure that it is purely coincidence that it is the chairman of the Labour party trade union liaison committee who happens to have tabled amendment No. 17.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/17">We want the White Paper that the Government have promised to map out a long-term solution to these problems. I doubt whether anybody in this place regards the measures and powers in the Bill as a satisfactory long-term solution to the big issues facing the fire service. We expect the White Paper to map out options in terms of mechanisms for a fair pay determination system in the fire service, and to address the question of the use of strikes as a bargaining tool in an emergency service that is of such vital importance to the safety and security of our communities.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/18">The latest version of the draft agreement&mdash;the employer's offer&mdash;has become a bit more than an offer; it has been discussed at such length by the two sides that it is in fact the draft of an agreement. The previous draft contained a reference to the White Paper, but it has been expunged from the current draft, which appears to internalise the whole process of developing a mechanism for pay determination and dispute resolution within national joint council procedures. Perhaps the Minister can explain to the Committee the significance of that. We are all waiting with bated breath for the White Paper, but it seems that its significance is being eroded by the minute. I would be greatly reassured if the Minister could confirm that it will address the issues of pay determination, dispute resolution and the possibility of a no-strike environment.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/19">Perhaps the Minister could also tell us when we are likely to see the White Paper. On Second Reading&mdash;on <phrase class="date" code="2003-05-08">8 May</phrase>&mdash;the Deputy Prime Minister said that we would see it shortly, but the Minister said a few hours later, at the end of the debate, that it would be published in the very near future. I rather felt on that day that we were edging towards it by the hour, but here we are, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-03">3 June</phrase>, and still no sight of it. I should be interested to know whether the Minister expects that we will see it before or after <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>. That might be a fact of some significance, given that the FBU recall conference is meeting on that day.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/20">It is on the basis that a White Paper and a subsequent new fire service Act are coming that we are willing to support this Bill&mdash;provided that it is amended to ensure that it is workable and effective. On that basis, consensus has emerged&mdash;on both sides of the House, I am delighted to say&mdash;in favour of a sunset clause. It would be good if the Minister could confirm that, notwithstanding the changes to the draft agreement, the Government are still going down the route whereby the White Paper will set out the long-term mechanisms for resolution of these issues. The reintroduction of a draconian power, relinquished in 1959, cannot be allowed to be anything other than a temporary measure. This Bill has to be a step on a clear route map to a long-term solution that is both fair to firefighters and secures the safety of the public at all times.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/21">Amendments Nos. 31 and 34&mdash;our amendments, Mr. Lord&mdash;are essentially drafting changes to accommodate the imposition of a time limit through the mechanism in amendment No. 35, and need not detain the Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/22">Amendments Nos. 22 and 23, tabled by my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/967" name="Douglas Hogg">the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase>, propose that orders under subsection (1)(a) shall be made by affirmative resolution of both Houses following a debate. Amendment No. 16, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, in, perhaps, a curious alignment with my right hon. and learned Friend, is designed to achieve a similar objective. In view of the draconian nature of the power being exercised and the undoubted level of interest of the Committee in the detail of the order that the Deputy Prime Minister will lay, the requirement for an affirmative rather than a negative procedure&mdash;and, indeed, for a debate on the Floor of the House&mdash;is not unreasonable. I look forward to hearing my right hon. and learned Friend's speech putting the case for that proposition and also to the Minister's response.</p>
	<p pid=".34.0/23">Amendment No. 28 looks like another example of Liberal Democrat enthusiasm for curbing the sovereignty of this Parliament at every opportunity and making it subject to external constraints. The Liberal Democrats are apparently concerned that the Bill's powers may not be compatible with the European social charter or the International Labour Organisation convention. I am not clear about whether that is so, but I point out to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" name="Matthew Green">the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green)</phrase> and his colleagues that this is, by consensus, a short-term emergency measure&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".37.1/1">My right hon. Friend asks &quot;What colleagues?&quot; with some reason. I am sorry to see the hon. Member for Ludlow in such splendid isolation, but I am sure that, when the time comes, he will deliver mightily on behalf of his party.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/2">I know not whether these powers contravene the European social charter or the International Labour Organisation convention; quite honestly, when the issue is one of public safety, I care not either. I take the view that the public safety of this country's citizens is the main issue of concern in Committee today and I suspect that the hon. Member for Ludlow may learn to his cost that that, rather than compliance with some obscure treaty, will be the issue of principal concern to the good people of Ludlow.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/3">We want to ensure that we move as soon as possible from an emergency powers regime to a longer-term, more equitable and more sustainable arrangement that delivers the same objectives. I am usually all in favour of constraining the Secretary of State's powers, but I recognise that the Bill does not provide for normal circumstances and that substantial powers are being bestowed on the Secretary of State for a specific reason, so the constraints advocated by the Liberal Democrats are not helpful and will hinder the delivery of the objectives that the Bill is designed to achieve.</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/4">I hope that in replying to the hon. Member for Ludlow on amendment No. 28, the Minister for Local Government and the Regions will do better than he did in response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/840" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase>, who raised a similar point on Second Reading. On that occasion, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/5" class="indent">&quot;On the European social charter, the Bill does not affect the right to strike, nor does it seek to prevent collective bargaining. On the International Labour Organisation convention, article 8 says that a settlement shall be reached through negotiations between the parties. That is our objective&mdash;to achieve precisely that negotiation.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-05-08.921"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 May 2003; Vol. 404, c. 921</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".37.1/6">That may be his objective, but it is not the Bill's purpose, which is to impose a settlement. I do not support the attempt of the hon. Member for Ludlow to impose further constraints, but the Minister will have to do better than he did on Second Reading in addressing the substantive issue.</p>

	<p pid=".38.0/1">If I understand my hon. Friend correctly, he is saying that it would have been more candid of the Government to admit that they might be in breach of article 8, but to say, in the light of the pre-eminent consideration of public safety, &quot;What of it?&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".38.1/1">That would certainly be my inclination, but no doubt the Minister will try to have his cake and eat it by saying that the Government are not in breach, but that if they were he would put public safety first. I have spent enough time opposing the Minister on various occasions to be able to predict, to some extent, what he is about to say.</p>
	<p pid=".38.1/2">I owe you an apology, Sir Michael, for addressing you by your former title earlier. I have had to make a similar apology to my hon.

	<p pid=".38.1/3">I am glad that consensus has emerged on the need for a sunset provision for the powers bestowed by the Bill. I shall listen to the Minister's remarks, but I am optimistic that the first of the three conditions for our support for the Bill, which were set out by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> on Second Reading, will be fulfilled this afternoon. The Government have accepted the need for a sunset clause, in one form or another, and we will be magnanimous about whether it comes into force in 18 months or two years. The important fact is that the Bill is seen as a temporary, short-term response to an immediate problem.</p>

	<p pid=".38.2/1">I was intrigued by the debate on the programme motion, when my right hon. Friend the Minister was challenged on the concept of a sunset clause. I was about to stand up and tell him, &quot;Minister, I am your sunset&quot;, but being the sunset for the Labour Government is a task rather bigger than I wish to take on, no matter how much the Opposition might like to see that.</p>
	<p pid=".38.2/2">I normally listen with enormous respect to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">the hon.

He mentioned the emergence of a consensus today, but I must tell him that I shall ensure that a copy of his speech is sent to the general session of every trade union as soon as I can lay my hands on it. One of the very real differences between the modern Conservative party and almost everybody else could be seen in the words that he used and those that he nearly said.</p>

	<p pid=".39.1/1">I shall attempt to shade in the gaps in a moment. Historically, Conservative Governments have tried to honour and protect our international treaty obligations. They were seen as the very centre of what one nation commits to fellow nations, and signing up to such treaties was not seen as a restraint on the rights of Parliament. Indeed, such matters are gifted by Parliament to the Executive to perform on our behalf. The idea that abrogation of our obligation under the International Labour Organisation treaty should be dismissed as irrelevant, or as something that we can trample all over, is outrageous. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reflect on that.</p>
	<p pid=".39.1/2">The ILO exists to protect employees all over the planet and, in fair societies, it protects good employers against rapacious employers. As Winston Churchill put it many years ago, we need to ensure that the worst employers do not drive down standards for the better ones. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will reflect on whether the Conservative party wishes to stake its name on ripping up international treaties on labour law or anything else. The signals that he has given will be read widely as showing that the Conservative party is still in retreat from the rest of the world and, especially, from the rest of Britain.</p>
	<p pid=".39.1/3">The hon. Gentleman was right to say that the Bill introduces draconian powers. I have enormous misgivings about it, as do many Labour Members. It will remove the ability of fire service personnel to take part in proper negotiations, and that will not help to resolve the dispute, in either the long term or the short term. If the Bill becomes law, it may not even contribute to the process of dispute resolution, but instead be massively counter-productive.</p>
	<p pid=".39.1/4">A modernised fire service must be able to deal with conventional emergencies and with the greater difficulties arising out of, for example, terrorism. It is in everybody's interest that fire service personnel can negotiate properly in connection with the changes that take place. In the end, it is not possible to impose an operating structure on any service&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".39.3/1">I am sorry, Sir Michael. I was trying to respond to the comments of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, and I thought it necessary to set out the context for the amendment tabled in my name.</p>
	<p pid=".39.3/2">The Bill has a role in the narrow sense that the most important development in the fire services dispute will take place, not on the Floor of the House this evening, but during next week's recalled Fire Brigades Union conference. I profoundly hope that the union will accept the recommendation by its general secretary and executive, and that we can move away from the period of dispute.</p>
	<p pid=".39.3/3">I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and the Regions will repeat today what he and my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister have said before&mdash;that the Bill will become unnecessary and redundant if the dispute is resolved. Such a statement would have great importance, as it would amount to the sunset clause that everyone wants. It would not set an expiration date in 15 or 18 months, or two years, but apply in a matter of days.</p>

	<p pid=".40.0/1">I accept the general principle that this country should honour its international obligations, unless there is an extraordinarily compelling reason not to do so. However, does the hon. Gentleman accept that, if either the social charter or the ILO convention had the perverse effect of denying this House's right to pass a Bill such as this for a short period to attend to a specific problem, it would be equally perverse for this House to acquiesce in such an arrangement?</p>

	<p pid=".40.1/1">I am sure, Sir Michael, that you want this exchange to be as rapid as possible. Most international treaties to which this country is a signatory contain emergency provisions that detail the circumstances under which it is possible and necessary for the Government to abrogate certain rights. These are difficult matters, and require enormous caution. All hon. Members expect such powers to be used with restraint, even in the most extreme circumstances. It is important to put on record the fact that restraint is exactly what was displayed by the FBU and its members while the conflict in Iraq was going on. At that time, industrial action was&mdash;de facto, if not de jure&mdash;suspended. That is very important, as rational people do not seek to exploit national emergencies. I hope that Opposition Members will join me in paying tribute to the FBU for the restraint that it showed in that period. The spirit of the FBU's response to the conflict was consistent with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/730" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow)</phrase> asks me to endorse.</p>

	<p pid=".40.2/1">The hon. Gentleman has drawn the Committee's attention to the fact that the FBU recall conference takes place next week, and he is trying to elicit from the Minister for Local Government and the Regions a commitment that the Bill will, in effect, be scrapped if the conference accepts a settlement. Is it not a curious use of scarce parliamentary time to take up a whole day to push the measure through when it is clear that in 10 days' time we may find that it is otiose? In those circumstances, does not the Bill look more like a negotiating tactic than a genuine piece of legislation?</p>

	<p pid=".40.3/1">That question is probably not best addressed to me, given that I have already expressed reservations about the Bill. Perhaps the official Opposition will join me and others in hoping that there will be a proper settlement that is honourable for the FBU and the people who work in our fire services and, of course, for the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".40.3/2">My reason for going along with the Government is that I recognise the steps that the Deputy Prime Minister and the Government have taken during recent weeks to try to bring an end to the issue. That view has also been placed on record by Andy Gilchrist, the general secretary of the FBU. In the end, the whole House should see the issue not as some polemical political game&mdash;I regret that there were shades of that in the hon. Gentleman's speech&mdash;because it is far too serious for us to be playing party politics and seeking political advantage. This is genuinely a moment for the nation to reflect on the role of Government, and to call on the employers and employees in the fire service to operate in that spirit, as the FBU is now doing.</p>

	<p pid=".41.3/1">My hon. Friend will be aware of the old adage about political literature: it has to be good enough to be read between the letterbox and the bin. <i>Progress</i>, alas, has not, for whatever reason, made it to that state. Perhaps, as at Passover, certain doors are marked as not to be called at and, for Jehovah's Witnesses and the purveyors of <i>Progress,</i> my door is marked with secret symbols that I do not yet understand. If so, I am only too grateful to those who marked my door.</p>
	<p pid=".41.3/2">My right hon. Friend the Minister indicated that he was aware of my hope that the Government would make clear the value of the Bill if there is a proper end to the dispute when the recall conference takes place next week. If we have to revert to using the measure, we shall be in extremely troubled waters. It would pay all of us to use today's debate as an opportunity not to muddy the waters but to lower the political temperature. My right hon. Friend tried to do that during his Second Reading speech and I know that he will do so again today.</p>
	<p pid=".41.3/3">I hope that he will resist the voices of those who want to raise the temperature. The Bill is not of itself draconian, but it will be seriously unhelpful and set a difficult precedent for Labour Members at least to stomach. That is why we need a sunset clause.</p>
	<p pid=".41.3/4">I place on record my great concern at the remarks of the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, which should be weighed carefully by all hon. Members. He sought from my right hon. Friend the Minister comments about the role of a ban on strikes in the emergency services. I hope that the official Opposition will now begin to flesh out their views, because we know where they are going. They would seek a ban on industrial action by those working in the fire service. That would be totally unacceptable not just to Labour Members but to many people throughout the country.</p>

Which trade unions and groups of employees do the Opposition consider part of the emergency services? To whom would a ban on industrial action apply? What sort of penalties would the Opposition impose on those who sought to take industrial action, limited or otherwise? How would those penalties operate? For example, would those in the fire services or elsewhere who took industrial action be jailed? It would be helpful to get answers to those questions on the record.</p>

	<p pid=".42.2/1">The hon. Gentleman correctly identifies&mdash;it did not take much detective work&mdash;that we propose that, if the Bill is going to work, it must have a power for the Secretary of State to impose a no-strike provision. However, our target is specifically and exclusively the fire service in which there is a current dispute and a real threat to public safety. I will not fast forward to the fourth group of amendments, but I suspect that we will have this debate in some detail when we come to them.</p>
	<p pid=".42.2/2">I heard what the hon. Gentleman said, but I am sure that he has read the Second Reading debate carefully and noted that the Minister for Local Government and the Regions specifically did not rule out the possibility of a no-strike arrangement as part of the longer-term solution to the fire service settlement. He said that the White Paper would make the Government's thoughts clear. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman would like to press the Minister on that.</p>

	<p pid=".42.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his comments, and I shall come to his final point first. He should examine carefully the words of my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, who was straightforward on Second Reading. I think that he ruled out the idea of a prohibition on industrial action. It is up to Conservative Members to press my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and the Regions, but I take the view that such a prohibition would be unachievable. There are many practical difficulties attached to bans on industrial action.</p>
	<p pid=".42.3/2">It is difficult to take seriously the idea that the Opposition would seek to ban strikes in only one part of the emergency services and that they would not use such a ban as a precedent for the rest. There is no logic to their position. It is ridiculous to suggest a ban for the fire service but not for other emergency services. That shows the difference between the Opposition's position and that of the Government and Labour Members.</p>
	<p pid=".42.3/3">The sunset clause is designed for a difficult Bill that I do not want on the statute book. I hope that next week will see the end of the talk about the Bill. However, the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge is suggesting that the Conservative party will campaign for legislation that would impose, come what may, a ban on industrial action by the FBU and those in the fire service. The Opposition are not seeking a sunset clause but a way to halt this Bill so that they could introduce something massively more draconian. That is the message that will go out today. There is a world of difference between the Government, who have their own view, and the Opposition who would seek to implement such legislation on a virtually permanent basis.</p>

	<p pid=".43.0/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman knows from the national news yesterday about the large fire at Waitrose in Finchley that required the attendance of 100 firefighters and 25 pumps. Does he agree that, had the fire service been on strike, there would have been considerable difficulty in amassing 25 green goddesses to deal with the emergency? For that reason, while the Army is recovering after the war in Iraq, it is important that the fire service is not allowed to go on strike.</p>

	<p pid=".43.1/1">That was a churlish remark because the FBU and the serving personnel who put out the fire in Finchley yesterday did not take industrial action during the Iraq crisis. Rather than again trying to increase difficulties, the hon. Lady should reflect on the fact that the best thing would be for the recall conference to bring the dispute to an end next week. Conservative Members do not want that to happen because they want to increase political difficulties. They want political advantage at the expense of the public because they hope, in their narrow way, that the Government are on the defensive. That approach cannot be in the nation's interest.</p>

	<p pid=".43.2/1">The hon. Gentleman speaks from the Back Benches but I hope that the Minister recognises that the Opposition have tried to co-operate with the Government in dealing with the crisis. I have made it clear on many occasions&mdash;and I do so again&mdash;that Conservative Members fervently hope that the outcome of the <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase> recall conference is a vote for the employers' offer that is on the table. That would be the best outcome for everyone, and it is wrong for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that Conservative Members do not want that to happen.</p>

	<p pid=".43.3/1">That is helpful because it means that I do not have to tell people up and down the land that the Conservative party wants to continue industrial difficulties or that it is in the habit of provoking such things and seeking political advantage from them. Of course, I shall still have to tell people that the official position of the Conservative party is to try to ban people in the emergency services from taking industrial action&mdash;it is well worth ensuring that that message goes out.</p>
	<p pid=".43.3/2">I shall draw my remarks to a conclusion, entertaining though the debate has been for me. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will make a further thing clear: the Bill must reach a conclusion in a finite time, even if it is successful. We can argue about different time periods but, frankly, I do not think that the periods on offer today are helpful or necessary because we will be in a very different situation after 15 months, 18 months or two years. I hope that we will find an answer to the problem in 10 days, not two years. Nevertheless, it is important for the Government to send a clear signal that they will dismantle the legislation. In that light, I hope that my right hon. Friend accepts the necessity of introducing a sunset clause.</p>

	<p pid=".44.0/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/840" name="Edward Davey">the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase> would have been speaking at this point but he is absent because he has had to attend the funeral of a close family member.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/2">The major amendments in the group would add sunset clauses to the Bill. There are three time periods on offer: our 15-month period, the Conservatives' 18-month period and the two-year period suggested by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1052" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd)</phrase>. The Government seem to be minded to accept one of the amendments and I suspect that they will err toward their friendly face on the Back Benches, although that will be more for party political reasons than because of specific differences among the seven-month range on offer. However, it would be welcome if they accept one amendment because it is better to have a sunset clause than not to have one at all. We will be grateful if they accept the purpose of such a clause.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/3">We would have welcomed its inclusion at the outset. Much of the debate on Second Reading was on that very issue and we could have moved on to more substantive matters had that become clearer earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/4">It is obvious that a sunset clause is necessary. Ministers were reluctant to introduce the Bill. We do not blame them for that, and perhaps it should not even have reached this stage. The best sunset that it could have is for the FBU to accept the settlement on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>. I hope that the Government will say that they do not intend to proceed further with the Bill if that happens.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/5">I especially hope that the FBU accepts the settlement because one group in particular has been penalised by the dispute. The retained firemen&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".44.1/1">I did not mean to interrupt the hon. Gentleman mid-sentence. The Minister might decide to enlighten the House on the Government's position if the vote goes their way on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>, but simply getting the conference to agree to the settlement on offer is not the same as getting the settlement, with all its ramifications, implemented. I caution the Committee on taking the view that all problems will be solved in all areas if the conference agrees the offer on the table.</p>

	<p pid=".44.2/1">There is broad agreement that the preferable solution is a negotiated settlement. The Bill is a draconian last resort and we do not want it pursued if it is clear that a negotiated settlement is proceeding. It is not in the interests of that negotiated settlement to rush the Bill through. The hon. Gentleman is in great danger of sending out the wrong signal to the firemen. We want them to take a rational and sensible decision on the offer on the table.</p>
	<p pid=".44.2/2">The hon. Gentleman touched on the absence of the White Paper. The amendments relate to several aspects of the Bill and we would have welcomed publication of the White Paper. The imminence of the White Paper is apparently pressing every time it is spoken about, but we still have not seen it. I wonder whether its publication is being delayed until after the 12th. It would at least be open and accountable government if the Minister were to let us know that it will miraculously appear on the 13th after the FBU conference.</p>

	<p pid=".45.0/1">I am sorry to interrupt the hon. Gentleman, but he was about to mention retained firefighters before <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> intervened. One has to accept that there is usually some rancour between the two unions, but it is my understanding that retained firefighters are strongly behind the FBU. Many of its concerns have received a degree of support from retained firefighters.</p>

	<p pid=".45.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for bringing me back to that point. I was about to say that retained firefighters are some of the people who have suffered most from the dispute. They have not received pay award increases because they have been held back during the dispute. I am not sure where the hon. Gentleman has talked to retained firemen, but in my constituency, where all the firemen are retained, they have a bit of sympathy with some measures that the FBU has pursued, but they do not have sympathy overall with the way in which its leadership has handled the dispute. Not much has been said about the unfortunate position in which the Retained Firefighters Union finds itself. It cannot negotiate with employers and the FBU negotiates on its behalf. That is an odd situation because retained firefighters might not have the same concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/2">I hope that the White Paper will herald a shift away from that approach.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/3">We have a great deal of sympathy for amendments Nos. 22 and 23, which would ensure that if the procedures were needed, an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament and a debate on the Floor of this House would be required. Given what hon. Members on both sides of the House have described as the draconian nature of the Bill, that is a minimum requirement.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/4">The Conservative Front-Bench spokesman chose to rubbish amendment No. 28. The Conservatives appear to have spent more time discussing that amendment than any of the ones that they tabled, so they are clearly glad that the Liberal Democrats tabled it. Perhaps they got excited because the amendment contains the word &quot;European&quot;&mdash;it was probably a red rag to a bull.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/5">The purpose of amendment No. 28 is to draw attention to the fact that the Joint Committee on Human Rights has alerted to the Government to two potential conflicts arising from the Bill, the first with article 6 of the European social charter 1961. I acknowledge that, at the end of Second Reading, the Minister touched on the potential conflict with the International Labour Organisation convention, and to some extent he dealt with the European social charter, but I do not think that he has fully answered the concerns that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/6">Under article 31(1) of the European social charter, restrictions or limitations are permitted if they are</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/7" class="indent">&quot;prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others or for the protection of public interest, national security, public health, or morals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/8">On the face of it, it appears that the Bill does not conflict with article 6. However, because the Bill would not restrict the power to make orders to circumstances in which there is a public emergency or collective bargaining has failed to produce a satisfactory result it is possible that an order will be made that contravenes article 6. Perhaps it is not the Government's intention to use the Bill to make such an order, but a more detailed explanation from the Minister of why he does not share the Joint Committee's concerns would be welcome.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/9">The amendment also deals with article 8 of the ILO labour relations (public services) convention No. 151 1978, to which the UK has signed up. Exemptions from the guarantees provided in the convention cover high-level policy-making or managerial personnel, employees whose duties are of a highly confidential nature, and the armed forces and the police. There is no exemption for members of the fire services&mdash;they are not mentioned. The Government may argue that the article does not prevent them from imposing a solution if collective bargaining has failed to produce agreement, but the Bill will not restrict the use of the power to make orders in circumstances in which collective bargaining has been attempted but has failed to produce a satisfactory result within a reasonable time, so it is possible that an order will be made in circumstances that give rise to a violation of article 8 of the ILO convention.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/10">The Minister might say that those circumstances will not arise, but clearly the Joint Committee did not raise those concerns lightly. Until today, no substantive comment has been made on the Floor of the House about the two concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".45.1/11">We were right to table the amendment, with a view to ensuring that the Government at least address the concerns that have been raised. We await the Government's reaction. Overall, the sunset clause is the most critical. We do not want the Bill to contain an open-ended power that can be used by the Government or future Administrations in unnecessary circumstances. We hope that there is agreement across the Floor of the House and that the Government have seen the light. Perhaps I should say that they see the light ending. We look forward to their acceptance of the sunset clause.</p>

	<p pid=".46.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1052" name="Tony Lloyd">the Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd)</phrase> that it is important that we say nothing today that will jeopardise the opportunity of a negotiated settlement next week, despicable though the Bill is as an attack on trade union rights, but I will put that to one side.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/2">My amendment does not provide for a sunset clause, although I support amendments that contain such clauses. Indeed, I support the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/3">Amendment No. 16 provides a trigger clause. I remember my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister saying in the House that he was the only Secretary of State to introduce a Bill that he did not want to see implemented. He said that in the hope that the negotiations would lead to a settlement before there was a need to introduce legislation, to finalise it and eventually to gain Royal Assent. I drafted an amendment in that spirit.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/4">Before the Act is implemented, my amendment would require the Secretary of State to return to the House with an order that the House would have to determine by affirmative resolution. Obviously, negotiations would continue. The Secretary of State would have the opportunity to return to the House with a report on the progress of those negotiations, on the basis of whether they were satisfactory for the employer and employee and for the Government overall, and therefore representatives of the community overall. My amendment is in the spirit of the Deputy Prime Minister's approach to this legislation. Indeed, my right hon. Friend was applauded for his conciliatory approach during the debate that took place in May.</p>

	<p pid=".47.0/1">I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman's premise that it would be good to determine the order by affirmative resolution.

	<p pid=".47.1/1">I welcome the hon. Gentleman's comments. We should ensure that we should have a debate whenever we can.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/2">The purpose of my amendment is to enable my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister to report back to the House. We can then determine whether the Bill is necessary and whether it should be enacted and implemented. It would provide an opportunity for the Government to get off the hook, because the Bill has ramifications that go wider than the fire service. Indeed, it has ramifications for overall trade union rights. It could set a precedent&mdash;not, I hope, for this Government&mdash;for other Governments who may wish to introduce legislation to impose settlements in other disputes. As soon as we go down that slope, we start to undermine some basic human rights that the Labour party has campaigned for since its inception. Other parties that are represented in the House have also signed up to them in terms of national legislation and European-wide legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/3">I will not press my amendment to a Division, but the purpose behind it is to try to help the Government to get off the hook, given the intemperate legislation that they have introduced, and to do so before that legislation is implemented. We hope that there is a settlement and that the proposed legislation will not be necessary. However, if the Government wish to proceed, I shall certainly support the sunset clause that has been proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central.</p>

	<p pid=".48.0/1">I support what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> has just said, at least in part, because I can sympathise with his amendment No. 16.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/2">I support the sunset clause. I hope the Government will accept the amendment moved by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1052" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd)</phrase>, which I understand is their intention. I am slightly surprised that such a provision was not written into the Bill, but on the principle of welcoming a sinner that repenteth, I suppose we should not be too churlish and grumble now, though I am very surprised that we are having a Committee stage on the Floor of the House rather than having the Prime Minister making a statement, as was requested in points of order, but that is a wider matter that I shall not address now.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/3">My amendment No. 23 is the standard affirmative procedure resolution. Amendment No. 22 is not, and I shall explain in a moment why I tabled it. We need first to understand the extensive nature of the powers set out in clause 1. There are three substantive powers in that clause on which we need to focus. First, it gives the Secretary of State a unilateral power to vary contracts of employment. In other words, the Secretary of State can by unilateral action change contracts of employment already in place. That is a wide power.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/4">Secondly, under clause 1(1)(b) the Secretary of State can direct the disposal of property of which he is not the owner. Again, that is a pretty wide power. Lastly, though perhaps not surprisingly given that it emanates from the Government, clause 1(2)(c) includes the power to impose charges on third parties. Those are extensive powers&mdash;the power unilaterally to vary a contract of employment, the power to direct the disposal of property and the power to impose financial burdens, all at the fiat of the Secretary of State. We need to ask ourselves what fetters and constraints are imposed on the Secretary of State. Precious few, is the answer.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/5">I recognise, of course, that the negative procedure is envisaged by the Bill, and I shall say a word about that in a moment. I acknowledge that the Bill contains provisions for consultation&mdash;consultation with lots of people, rather unspecified, but not with the House. The House is cut out of the process, save by the negative procedure, notwithstanding the fact that we are dealing with the variation of contracts, the disposal of property and the imposition of financial burdens. The one set of people who do not have a decisive say is us, the representatives of the people&mdash;not surprising, as I say, coming from this Government.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/6">Those are the problems that my amendments are designed to address. Amendment No. 23 is the standard affirmative resolution procedure&mdash;that is to say, the statutory instruments cannot become law unless they are approved in both Houses of Parliament. That, I should have thought, was the very minimum that the House would wish to require of the Government. However, it does not address the real problem.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/7">Affirmative resolutions are just affirmative resolutions of statutory instruments, and statutory instruments are not amendable. They can be rejected in their entirety or approved in their entirety. What the House does not have the power to do is to amend a statutory instrument, by adjusting its terms, deleting part of it or inserting something else in it. It is an extraordinarily imperfect method of controlling what is effectively legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/8">That is the reason for my amendment No. 22. Very occasionally&mdash;I regret to say, very occasionally&mdash;Governments lay before Parliament a draft of the statutory instrument before Parliament is asked to vote on it, so that there can be a debate, sometimes 14 and sometimes 21 days before the substantive discussion. That gives hon. Members an opportunity to make a point about the statutory instrument and, hopefully, affect the outcome.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/9">That is a pretty miserable way of controlling government itself, but it is the only mechanism that parliamentary procedure currently allows. We should give ourselves the power to amend statutory instruments just as we amend Bills, but we have not done so and we must use the procedures that are available to us. Amendment No. 22 would use one of the few methods that is open to us.</p>
	<p pid=".48.0/10">Using the amendment, I would wish to argue the case for imposing on members of the fire brigade unions a prohibition on the right to strike. I certainly think that that is a proper issue to discuss, as it was in respect of the police service. After all, the police regulations and the Police Act 1996&mdash;incidentally, their terms are replicated in new clauses 1 and 2, which were not selected for discussion&mdash;prohibit such action in respect of the police. I see no possible justification for members of the fire brigade to go on strike at any time. I think that it is very reprehensible indeed that, in pursuit of an industrial action, they should put at risk the life and property of their fellow citizens. I think that that is quite wrong.</p>

That is the inevitable consequence of strike action and I happen to think that it is profoundly wrong. I think that this House should have a proper opportunity to debate that. Speaking for myself, I would like such prohibitions to be incorporated in statute law.</p>

	<p pid=".50.0/1">One does not have to be very bright to spot that, as it is the inevitable consequence of members of the emergency services going on strike. While individual members might break strike action on occasion, the inevitable and probably intended consequence is to put pressure on the Government. Those on strike put pressure on the Government by putting at risk the lives and property of their fellow citizens. I happen to think that that is profoundly wrong.</p>

	<p pid=".50.1/1">I do not agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman about the right to strike, which I think is a hard won right that we should preserve in this country. Nevertheless, does not his logic, which I shall accept for a moment, drive him to conclude that, if no right to strike is allowable in the fire service, no right to impose a settlement should be allowed on the part of a Government? If there is no right to strike, the fire service should have an independent decision-making process for agreeing proper wages and conditions for firemen and women.</p>

	<p pid=".50.2/1">I start from the first proposition&mdash;that there should not be a right to strike. Let me say that when I was Prisons Minister, I argued the same in respect of prison officers, as I thought it entirely wrong for them to take industrial action. I also happened to be Police Minister some way back, and I am extremely glad that the Police Act 1996 and police regulations prevent police officers from going on strike. The same is true of the armed services&mdash;and quite right too.</p>
	<p pid=".50.2/2">The question whether the Secretary of State should have a power unilaterally to impose a prohibition on the right to strike is another matter.</p>
	<p pid=".50.2/3">The important point is that the House, not the Secretary of State, should decide the matter. Amendment No. 23 would at least provide for the affirmative resolution procedure to allow the House to give its support.</p>
	<p pid=".50.2/4">I have gone a little wide of what I wanted to say&mdash;I am grateful for your indulgence, Sir Michael&mdash;in arguing vigorously the case against strike action by fire brigade members, which I feel very strongly about. In any event, these powers are important because they constitute both a unilateral variation of contracts of employment and a right to impose financial burdens and to dispose of property. That should be done only with the proper authority of this Committee. The measure would be imperfect even if the House accepted amendment No. 22, but it is the least that we could properly do, and I hope that right hon. and hon. Members will consider that.</p>

	<p pid=".50.3/1">First, I record as a declaration of interest my membership of a trade union and say that we should fiercely defend the right to strike, which is so important for trade unions.</p>
	<p pid=".50.3/2">I want briefly to speak in support of amendment No. 16 and the amendments tabled in the name of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1052" name="Tony Lloyd">the Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd)</phrase>. The overall point is that we are spending an enormous amount of time debating these issues when we should be talking about the future modernisation of the fire service and the part that the pathfinder report can play in that. In that context, many hon. Members, including me, will listen carefully to every word that the Minister says in response to this group of amendments so as to judge whether the Bill may be unnecessary, given that a negotiated settlement may follow the conference that is taking place in Glasgow next Thursday. Firefighters, too, will listen carefully to his comments, especially in relation to the sunset clause and the affirmative resolution, to determine whether the Government intend to allow a negotiated settlement to be reached. Whatever happens, without such a settlement we will not have the necessary goodwill from everybody to take the agenda forward.</p>
	<p pid=".50.3/3">I respect the generosity that my right hon. Friend the Minister extended towards Staffordshire MPs when he met us shortly before the recess. We told him how important it was that a negotiated settlement should be reached, irrespective of the Bill, and that, having met FBU members and the chief fire officer, we want to ensure that not only the FBU but the employers are able to advance the modernisation agenda. His response will be carefully scrutinised, and I await it with great interest.</p>

	<p pid=".51.0/1">The amendments predominantly deal with the issue of whether the Bill should be time limited, which was raised by several hon. Members on Second Reading. At the time, I said that that could be considered in Committee, and so it has proved. As we have made clear on several occasions, the Bill is part of our strategy for dealing with the exceptional set of circumstances presented by the current fire dispute. It is not a vehicle for dealing with our longer-term vision for the fire service, which will be set out in the White Paper that we expect to publish shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/2">I hope that hon. Members will understand that there are always timetable issues involved in the publication of important documents, but it is our intention to publish the White Paper in the very near future.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/3">As the Committee will know, we are committed to modernising the fire service, and the forthcoming White Paper will describe our proposed reforms in detail. I hope that it will be helpful to the Committee if I take a little time to describe how the Bill and the White Paper will complement each other. Before I do so, however, I want to make it quite clear to my hon. Friends that there is no wider application to any other industrial relations situation implicit in the Bill; it relates specifically to the current position in the fire service. That has been clearly stated by the Deputy Prime Minister and me on many occasions, and I want to make it absolutely clear to the Committee tonight.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/4">The powers that the Bill would confer would enable us to draw a line under the present dispute. The Bill should therefore be a temporary measure, designed solely to address the current dispute and its immediate aftermath. For the longer term, the White Paper will set out comprehensive proposals for a new framework for the fire service that I believe will give it a new sense of purpose and prevent the kind of stalemate that has characterised this industrial dispute. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> asked me whether the Bill would address some of the difficult issues that have been thrown up by the negotiations, and I can give him the assurance that he is seeking: we shall certainly set out proposals for a longer-term framework which should ensure a better future without the kind of unproductive stalemate that we have encountered in the course of the last few months.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/5">I should also say to the hon. Gentleman that there is absolutely no significance, so far as I am concerned, in the textual changes in the later stages of the employers' offer. The employers assure us that those changes are entirely compatible with their objective of ensuring the modernisation of the fire service while giving reassurance to worried members of the Fire Brigades Union that some of the wilder fears that have been expressed about some of the consequences are completely unfounded. Those assurances were used as a basis for changes to the document, to give reassurance. That is an entirely sensible and proper thing for the employers to have done, but it in no way changes the fundamental principle that the pay offer of 16 per cent. must be linked to modernisation, and that modernisation must achieve the necessary savings to ensure that the offer is affordable.</p>

	<p pid=".52.0/1">I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says about the deletion of the reference to the White Paper, but does he not see at least a message, if not a specific significance, in the removal from paragraph 1.1 of the following words?</p>
	<p pid=".52.0/2" class="indent">&quot;This is a package agreement, which integrates changes to modernise the fire service with associated pay rises, which depend upon the implementation of the entire package.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".52.0/3">Those words have been expunged. Is there no significance to that?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.52.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1182" speakername="Nick Raynsford" colnum="52"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-14.htm#30603-14_spnew6">
	<p pid=".52.1/1">We have made it quite clear to the employers on many occasions that the interim funding of &pound;30 million that we have pledged to make it possible for them to meet the costs of this settlement&mdash;given that it will take some time for the benefits of modernisation to flow through and to meet the costs implicit in the offer&mdash;is the maximum that is on offer, and that we shall not meet any additional amount. The employers are quite clear about that, and hence about the fact that the offer has to ensure that savings can be made over that time scale to enable them to keep within their budgets. They have made it clear to us that they are satisfied that the latest offer achieves that objective, and of course it is in their interest to do so because, financially, they will have no other means of meeting the costs of the settlement.</p>
	<p pid=".52.1/2">The White Paper will articulate the Government's vision for the fire service. It will set out the reforms that we have in mind to ensure that the service is well managed and efficient, serving the needs of the community and able to respond to the challenges of the 21st century. We intend to set out the legal, institutional and managerial changes required to deliver that vision. One of the keys to this is to set clear targets for fire and safety outcomes, to support local analysis of how these can best be achieved, and to insist on best value in the way in which services are delivered.</p>
	<p pid=".52.1/3">In the context of this long-term approach, we are prepared to accept the principle that the Bill should be time-limited. However, we believe that the time limits of 15 months, as set out in amendment No. 29 tabled by the Liberal Democrats, or 18 months, as proposed in amendments Nos. 2 and 35 tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge, are too short. I will explain why.</p>
	<p pid=".52.1/4">Even when a settlement has been achieved, whether by agreement or by imposition, the new direction that modernisation requires will not be achieved overnight. It therefore makes sense to retain the powers that the Bill will confer until we can be reasonably clear about the fact that the improvements that we want to see are well on the way to being achieved.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.53.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1182" speakername="Nick Raynsford" colnum="53"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-15.htm#30603-15_spnew1">
	<p pid=".53.1/1">I will give way to my hon. Friend in a moment, but I want to make a little more progress. It is important for the time scale to be fully understood.</p>
	<p pid=".53.1/2">A time limit of 18 months would last to around the end of 2004, assuming that the Bill receives Royal Assent this summer. That sounds a long time away and it might just allow sufficient time for any Bill introduced in the next Session&mdash;one designed to implement the White Paper policies&mdash;to come into effect, although that could not be guaranteed if the parliamentary passage of such a Bill were prolonged. With a 15-month time limit, there would be a serious risk of those powers lapsing before any Bill setting out our long-term strategic framework even received Royal Assent, let alone came into effect.</p>
	<p pid=".53.1/3">We should also bear in mind the fact that the fire service pay settlement date is November each year. The deal now on the table would change that by bringing the date forward to July, but if it were not accepted&mdash;of course, the powers in the Bill are designed for a situation in which there is no negotiated settlement&mdash;we would face the possibility of having to make an award not only for November 2002 and November 2003, but perhaps for November 2004. If we were in that situation, it would not help to be working against an 18-month time limit that ran out in December or January, and certainly not a 15-month time limit that ran out in September or October.</p>
	<p pid=".53.1/4">In any event, experience has taught us that we need a back-stop. Fire service reform and the legislation that that entails are Government priorities. The Bill should be a stop-gap that enables us to deal with the immediate future, but does not tackle all the long-term challenges. At the moment, there are grounds for optimism about the outcome of negotiations between the employers and the FBU. We may not even need to use these powers at all. As we have always made clear, that is our hope.</p>
	<p pid=".53.1/5">I respond to my hon. Friends the Members for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd) and for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) by saying that the Deputy Prime Minister and I have clearly indicated on many occasions that our objective is that there should be a negotiated settlement and that if that is achieved we will not need to use the powers in the Bill. That is a clear commitment. This is a stop-gap. We hope that it will not be necessary to use these powers.</p>

	<p pid=".54.0/1">I would be grateful if the Minister clarified the distinction between not using the powers and abandoning the Bill, because it seems to me to be important. It is perfectly possible that on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase> the offer will be accepted, but that we will find further down the line in some areas, although perhaps not all, that there are difficulties with implementing the changes in working conditions that are integral to the offer.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.54.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1182" speakername="Nick Raynsford" colnum="54"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-15.htm#30603-15_spnew3">
	<p pid=".54.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly fair point that is obviously in our mind. There have been worries over the past few months that agreements appeared to be on the verge of being reached, but were not achieved. There may well be areas that are less enthusiastic about reaching an agreement than others. I sincerely hope that an agreement is reached, that next week's recall conference votes decisively in favour of what is a good offer from the employers, and that there will be wholehearted commitment to implementing the agreement. Of course, it would be foolish of us to assume that that will be the case.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/2">As I have made clear, we believe that there is a need for provision to cope with the circumstances between now and the implementation of the Bill that will give effect to our White Paper proposals, which is why I have said that the 18-month and 15-month periods are probably too short. So I confirm our belief that this Bill should proceed to the statute book, but we do not intend to invoke its powers if there is a settlement and it is implemented in the way that we all hope it will be.</p>

	<p pid=".54.3/1">No. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has made clear on many occasions his earnest hope that he will not need to use these powers, which is different from saying that he does not want the Bill to be enacted. We believe that the Bill is necessary.</p>

	<p pid=".54.4/1">Earlier, my right hon. Friend made it very clear that the Bill was intended to deal with the current dispute and its immediate aftermath. I understood him then to say that he needed it as a back-stop for implementation of the White Paper. That surely flies in the face of the trust that we need in order to secure a settlement by agreement. I am sorry to return to this issue, but is the Bill intended to deal with the immediate dispute&mdash;which was my impression&mdash;or to enable the White Paper to be implemented?</p>

	<p pid=".54.5/1">Let me try to explain. This is an important issue, and the two elements are closely related.</p>
	<p pid=".54.5/2">The offer from the employers involves a settlement over two and a half years, during which modernisation will fund much of the cost of the firefighters' increased pay, which will be given in three stages. The two must go hand in hand. Without implementation, the employers would clearly find it impossible to meet the commitment to increased pay. That is why the period after agreement is closely, and rightly, associated with our current position.</p>
	<p pid=".54.5/3">As I have made plain to the Committee, in parallel with that we intend to publish in the near future a White Paper providing a modern framework for the fire service. We recognise that the current arrangements, which date back to 1947, are out of date in many respects and need to be reformed. The White Paper will set out our vision for the future of the fire service. We intend to seek legislation at the earliest opportunity after that, but, as my hon. Friend knows, it cannot happen quickly.</p>

	<p pid=".55.1/2">The implementation of the subsequent Bill is likely to take at least until the end of the 18-month period specified in the amendment. If it were delayed, there would be a hiatus between the lapsing of this Bill and the implementation of the new one. We do not think that that would be healthy or sensible. We think that the new framework for the fire service should be introduced as early as possible, but that the lapsing of this Bill should not precede that.</p>

	<p pid=".55.2/1">I am trying to be constructive. Can my right hon. Friend explain why the combination of a sunset and a trigger clause does not satisfy his requirements and those of the Deputy Prime Minister? A sunset clause recognises that the Bill will lapse in due course.

Then we will come back to the House, explain the difficulty, and if necessary proceed to implementation.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".55.3/1">If my hon. Friend will bear with me, I shall deal with that when I deal with his amendment, which seeks to introduce such a trigger clause. He stressed that the amendment had been tabled in a constructive spirit, and I hope to respond in the same spirit.</p>
	<p pid=".55.3/2">As I have said, we know from experience that recommendations to conference from the FBU executive are not always accepted. We would rightly be open to criticism from Members, and indeed from the wider public, if in 15 or 18 months we found ourselves facing further disruption and frustration, but without the powers in the Bill. A two-year time limit would, we believe, provide more certainty. I am pleased to say that we will therefore accept amendment No. 17, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central.</p>
	<p pid=".55.3/3">In addition to providing a sunset clause to a realistic time scale, his amendment has the added benefit of permitting the Secretary of State to revoke orders made under the Bill after its order-making power has ceased to have effect, should that be necessary. 5.45 pm</p>
	<p pid=".55.3/4">Opposition Members have suggested that only the power to fix or to modify conditions of service should be time limited, so that the Secretary of State can continue to give directions to fire authorities about the use of property or facilities after 18 months have elapsed following Royal Assent. That is not appropriate either, for the reasons that I gave earlier. The White Paper and consequent substantive legislation will address the Secretary of State's relationship with the fire authorities in the round.</p>

	<p pid=".56.1/1">I understand that point. The hon. Gentleman has two amendments in his name and they would have different effects. Amendment No. 35 would have the effect that I just described, so I hope that he will accept that our proposal is the sensible way forward.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/2">Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 deal with the parliamentary procedure for making orders under the Bill and are, as we heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/967" name="Douglas Hogg">the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg)</phrase>, alternatives. Both require orders made under clause 1(1)(a), on conditions of service, to be approved by a resolution of both Houses. However, amendment No. 22 would require that an order also be debated in draft by each House not even than 14 days before it was laid. I heard the justification advanced by the right hon. and learned Gentleman&mdash;that that would allow amendment of a statutory instrument that would otherwise not be possible. However, such orders would be made only in circumstances where there was a serious short-term need for action because of&mdash;as the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge rightly pointed out&mdash;a potential risk to the public.</p>
	<p pid=".56.1/3">The powers contained in clause 1(1)(b) in particular, relating to the deployment of equipment and appliances in the interest of public safety, would need to be used very quickly indeed. That is why, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman will understand, we have not made provision for parliamentary approval of those powers. If there were a process whereby the powers could be used to ensure that aerial appliances or other firefighting equipment that otherwise might not be made available could be made available in a hurry, he would find it difficult to justify a procedure involving two&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".56.3/1">I shall give way to the right hon. and learned Gentleman in a moment; I am trying to explain my reason for not accepting his amendment. The public would find it odd that not just this House but the other House was expected to debate, on two separate occasions, whether it was appropriate for the Secretary of State to use those powers to ensure the deployment of fire appliances to protect public safety and save people's lives. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will accept that that rather elaborate procedure simply would not be appropriate in such circumstances.</p>

	<p pid=".57.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman has focused on the power to order the deployment of facilities of various kinds. Of course, the argument that he advances does not apply to the power to</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/2" class="indent">&quot;fix or modify the conditions of service&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/3">particularly remuneration. No such urgency exists there; perhaps he would care to confine his remarks to the power to deploy the facilities.</p>

	<p pid=".57.1/1">With the greatest of pleasure, because, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows, in terms of the power to fix conditions of service there is a separate requirement&mdash;an obligation on the Secretary of State to undertake consultation. So there will be a full opportunity for the views of those most closely involved&mdash;including those working in the fire service, the employers and the public&mdash;to express their views before any decision is taken. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman regards that as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid=".57.1/2">We are openly seeking these powers on a temporary basis, so the procedures laid down will have only a limited life. As I have said, we will set out in the forthcoming White Paper our longer-term strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".57.1/3">If amendment No. 16 were accepted, the Bill would be commenced by order, which would be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. As currently drafted, the legislation would commence on enactment and the order-making powers would be immediately available to the Secretary of State. Subject to the Bill's other provisions&mdash;such as those on consultation, to which I have just referred&mdash;the Secretary of State would be able to make a pay award or give directions to fire authorities straight away. I believe that that is desirable, for the reasons that I have outlined.</p>
	<p pid=".57.1/4">It would mean that firefighters could receive their pay award relatively quickly. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" name="Matthew Green">The hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green)</phrase> rightly pointed out that many retained firefighters have not received a pay increase since November 2001 and, quite reasonably, feel aggrieved about it. Many have not been involved in the dispute, and with the prospect of continued protracted delay much can be said in favour of taking action to ensure that firefighters receive a pay increase relatively quickly.</p>
	<p pid=".57.1/5">Secondly, in the event of further strikes, the Secretary of State might need to give urgent directions to a fire authority to ensure that property and facilities are available to those providing emergency cover in order properly to protect the public. The amendment would inevitably cause delay, frustrating the wishes of many firefighters to receive a pay award and placing the public at unnecessary risk.</p>
	<p pid=".57.1/6">Amendment No. 28 deals with human rights, about which hon. Members are understandably concerned.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.57.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="57"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-16.htm#30603-16_spnew4">
	<p pid=".57.2/1">I am incredulous about the process that the Minister suggests would encompass delay. He makes two specific points, the first of which is about the pay award. If agreement is reached next week, will the Secretary of State determine the pay award under the Bill, or will previous negotiation procedures apply? If the new legislation applies, we would have to wait for it to pass through the House of Lords before we could proceed with the pay award. I thought that current negotiations related to current negotiating practices and that an award could be agreed on that basis.</p>
	<p pid=".57.2/2">Secondly, if disputes arise in future, are we suggesting that the Secretary of State would not have time to discuss the matter, produce a report and decide whether the legislation should be implemented? Disputes can arise without necessarily incurring delay. The Government are not suggesting real practical problems and the trigger mechanism would assist rather than obstruct the resolution of future disputes.</p>

	<p pid=".58.0/1">It has always been clear that our objective is to secure a negotiated settlement. If such a settlement is secured, it will proceed and the powers in the Bill will neither be needed nor used. If a negotiated settlement is reached, there is no question of the Bill causing delay. If it is not, many firefighters have waited a long time for a pay settlement and might welcome a settlement being imposed quickly in preference to further prolonged negotiation and discussion, which the amendment would require.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/2">Secondly, if the dispute were to continue without agreement being reached, strike action could take place at seven days' notice. My hon. Friend will know the relevant industrial relations legislation that applies. In those circumstances and in the light of evidence that the Deputy Prime Minister provided to the House a month ago about the limited ability of military personnel to cope with such an emergency, having powers in place to ensure that facilities are available to protect the public&mdash;the public have paid for them&mdash;is surely an overriding requirement. It would be perverse to prevent the Secretary of State from using such powers urgently to protect the public interest.</p>

	<p pid=".58.1/1">The amendment is not designed to prevent the Secretary of State from using the powers, but to enable him to report back to the House so that the House can decide whether to activate them. Are we saying that the House could not clear the decks to deal with an order presented to it? A statement would be made to the House in any case. I simply do not understand what the practical problems are; they seem to be invented. The purpose of the amendment is to get the Secretary of State off the hook and abide by the spirit of the Deputy Prime Minister's commitment to the House that he did not want the legislation enacted.</p>

	<p pid=".58.2/1">I have to tell my hon. Friend that the Deputy Prime Minister's concern is different: he wants to ensure that he has the power to act expeditiously if necessary to protect the public. I am sure that my hon. Friend can envisage agreement not being reached next week&mdash;though I hope it will be&mdash;and the dispute rumbling on for another couple of months with the threat of strike action during the summer recess. In those circumstances, no mechanism would be available other than the recall of Parliament to allow the Secretary of State to use his powers, which is clearly an unsatisfactory position.</p>

	<p pid=".58.3/1">The Minister may have made a slip of the tongue in that exchange. He said that if a settlement were reached, the powers would not be used. I am sure that he would want to clarify that, because he said earlier that the powers would not be used if a settlement were both reached and implemented. Surely he would want to retain the ability to use the powers.</p>

	<p pid=".59.0/1">I made that clear earlier and it is our wish to see a settlement reached and implemented. In responding to my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West, I highlighted the fact that the settlement depended on pay and modernisation going hand in hand. That has applied for two and half years. The two have to be linked and implementation has to proceed to be fully honoured.</p>
	<p pid=".59.0/2">Human rights are, as I said, a matter of concern to hon. Members on both sides of the House, so it might be helpful if I explain the Government's thinking in some detail.</p>
	<p pid=".59.0/3">My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister made it clear from the outset that he believed that the Bill was compatible with the European convention on human rights. The Joint Committee on Human Rights carried out an initial examination of the Bill and its report recorded its provisional view that it is compatible with the convention. The Joint Committee did, however, raise concerns about the compatibility of the Bill with two conventions, neither of which is incorporated into UK law. The first is the European social charter, article 6 of which is designed to ensure the effectiveness of the right to collective bargaining. The Bill does nothing to interfere with the right of the fire service to engage in collective bargaining, and nothing to make it less effective. In fact, we all wish that it had been more effective than it has been over the last 12 months.</p>

	<p pid=".59.1/1">The Bill may not have that effect, but the regulations introduced under it may have. Clause 1(1)(a) makes it absolutely clear that regulations can determine pay and conditions, contrary to the outcome of negotiations.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid=".59.2/1">As I was about to say, and as the right hon. and learned Gentleman will understand, many of us wish that the collective bargaining procedures had been more effective. The dispute began more than a year ago when the claim was lodged. Sadly, despite frequent efforts to find ways of bringing the two sides together, securing a negotiated solution has so far proved unsuccessful. I hope, as does the whole House, that next week the Fire Brigades Union recall conference will agree to the latest offer of the employers&mdash;a good and generous offer and a good basis for ensuring a good future for the fire service and a sound settlement for firefighters. We hope that there will be no need to use the powers in the Bill. However, in the event of no agreement being reached, it cannot be right to allow the position to continue. As the right hon. and learned Gentleman and the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge repeatedly emphasised, the public could be put at risk. In those circumstances, it is right to ensure that effective action can be taken to safeguard the public.</p>
	<p pid=".59.2/2">I would draw attention to the fact that rights under the charter are not absolute. Article 31 permits some restrictions or limitations, if they are</p>
	<p pid=".59.2/3" class="indent">&quot;prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others or for the protection of public interest, national security, public health, or morals&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".59.2/4">We believe that it is now necessary to draw a line under the dispute if the parties fail to bring it to an end through the normal processes of bargaining. Naturally, it is for the Committee to determine whether it agrees: that is the nature of democracy. We are satisfied that both the Bill and the order-making powers, if we are forced to use them, are compatible with the charter.</p>

	<p pid=".60.0/1">The Minister said that, even if a settlement were reached, the Bill and its powers of direction would remain necessary in order to bring it into effect.

	<p pid=".60.1/1">At the risk of going over the ground again, I hope that I have made it clear that we believe that the Bill is necessary to oversee the period during which the implementation of the settlement takes place. On the employers' offer, the settlement will cover a two and a half year period. The Bill is necessary to ensure implementation because pay and modernisation are inextricably linked as part of the settlement. That is why the powers are necessary, but we have repeatedly said that it is not our intention to invoke them or use them, assuming that agreement is reached and implemented.</p>

	<p pid=".60.2/1">When we talk about the employer, we need to be clear that we do not mean central Government or an employer, but a number of employers. Will my right hon. Friend assure me that if a fire authority failed to settle with its employees, for whatever reason, the Government would not seek to impose a deal retrospectively on that authority? Otherwise, this process looks like the Government telling each fire authority what it should do with every one of its conditions of employment, and that is not desirable.</p>

	<p pid=".60.3/1">No one would regard a settlement as satisfactory if it applied only to some areas of the country and not to others. People expect a properly functioning fire service in every part of the country, and it is our objective to achieve a national settlement. All the parties, including the employers&mdash;the local authority and other fire authority employers&mdash;the union and the Government, want an agreement that applies nationally. However, I hope that my hon. Friend will recognise that circumstances could arise&mdash;I have outlined them in response to earlier questions&mdash;in a continuing dispute, in which certain authorities were more helpful in making equipment available to others to protect the public interest. In such cases, it might be necessary to use the powers selectively to protect the public. That is why the powers in the Bill may be applied generally or to particular authorities.</p>

	<p pid=".60.4/1">The implication of that is that we will have a national settlement for not only pay, but all conditions. If that is the case, we should be honest and open about it, and we should tell local authorities that their room for manoeuvre will be considerably constrained, regardless of the passage of the Bill. That appears to be the direction in which the Government are going, and it may be the right direction, but we should put it on record.</p>

	<p pid=".61.0/1">My understanding is that all parties, including the local authority employers and the FBU, want a national agreement.

	<p pid=".61.1/1">If we are to assist in the resolution of the dispute next week, it is important to achieve clarity in our debate. The union and the employers want a national settlement that applies to all parties, but the Burchill proposals allow for local resolution of individual issues, especially conditions and operational matters. That is the key message. Our concern is that the legislation offers a vista of detailed interference at local level if the agreement is not implemented. We need to assure the union and the employers that that is not the process that the Government envisage.</p>

	<p pid=".61.2/1">I agree that everyone involved agrees that we seek a national settlement, not a fragmentation. The proposals that Professor Burchill made a couple of weeks ago are not on the table and do not form part of the current offer made by the employers and recommended by the FBU executive. Of course there will be a role for individual fire authorities in the future in assessing the appropriate way to respond to the needs of their areas. Indeed, they are preparing integrated risk management plans to ensure that they are well organised to meet those needs. However, as far as pay bargaining is concerned, the objective of all sides has been a national settlement. That remains the case, and the Government do not wish to do anything to prevent that from happening. We want to see a national settlement.</p>

	<p pid=".61.3/1">The Minister said that the Bill was compatible with article 6 of the European social charter because it would address a risk to public safety. However, the Bill makes no mention of public safety and it will confer a power that has nothing to do with a risk to public safety. That is not what the Minister intends, but will he make it clear that he will use the powers only in the case of a direct risk to public safety? If so, we will have no concerns about article 6.</p>

	<p pid=".61.4/1">The theme that has been repeated time and again in the debate is the inevitable risk to the public of a continued or repeated incidence of industrial action in the fire service. If firefighters withdraw their labour, the public are put at risk, especially if the military resources, which have responded magnificently in the past, are seriously stretched and we cannot deploy comparable numbers. In that situation, the public would be at risk and the provisions of article 31 make it clear that any use of the powers would not be incompatible with the charter.</p>

If he has not, I repeat that it is not our intention to use the powers in the Bill if a negotiated settlement is properly implemented.

	<p pid=".62.0/2">The second concern that the Joint Committee raised with me was about article 8 of the Labour Relations (Public Services) convention, known as ILO convention 151. The article requires that settlement of disputes about conditions of employment of public employees should</p>

	<p pid=".62.0/4">No one could argue that a settlement has not been sought through negotiation. We have done all that we can to encourage and facilitate that. The question is how long the fire service can go on seeking a settlement without finding one. Article 8 describes what should happen but does not define what to do when negotiation fails. That is what we are now seeking to address. I can therefore confirm&mdash;as I said on Second Reading&mdash;that in our view the provisions in the Bill are compatible with article 6 of the charter and article 8 of ILO convention 151. Requiring the publication of reports to that effect looks like just another obstacle put in place by Opposition Members. As we can give them the assurances that they seek now, there is no merit in delaying commencement of the Act.</p>
	<p pid=".62.0/5">The powers in the Bill have a specific purpose: to draw a line under the present dispute so that the two sides can start afresh. We are heartened by the progress that they have made, and we are sure that the whole House hopes for a positive outcome, but we must be prepared for all eventualities. In the event of a negotiated settlement not being reached, accepting any of these amendments would delay a resolution to the dispute. I have made it clear that the Government are happy to accept amendment No. 17, but I request that all other amendments be withdrawn.</p>

	<p pid=".62.1/1">This has been a very interesting debate, if somewhat lengthy. The Minister's remarks about the time scale for the introduction of new legislation following the publication of the White Paper were entirely plausible, and I accept what he said. I suspect that some Labour Members may not have realised that the Government's intention was that the Bill should act as a bridge to a piece of permanent legislation covering the same areas. However, I certainly anticipated that that would be the Government's intention, so I am happy to accept the two-year sunset provision that the Minister deems adequate.</p>
	<p pid=".62.1/2">It is amusing to think what the Minister's speech would have looked like if I had proposed a two-year sunset clause in amendment No. 35, and if <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1052" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd)</phrase> had proposed a period of 18 months in his amendment. No doubt the Minister would have found time in the legislative timetable for the House to deem an 18-month period to be adequate. However, I am very happy with the outcome. The Government have cleared the first of the three hurdles set by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase>.

	<p pid=".63.2/1">We now come to the second condition proposed by the Opposition. Amendment No. 32 would introduce an obligation to conduct a postal ballot, but it would leave the Secretary of State with wide discretion as to the ballot's subject matter, whether it were the proposed order under clause 1(1) or any matter that appears to the Secretary of State to be relevant. Clearly, the intention is to give the Secretary of State the opportunity to put to FBU members in a postal ballot an offer that has been made and debated. If the amendment were to apply today, for example, the ballot would cover the employers' draft offer that is to be considered by the recalled FBU conference on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>. However, the amendment is drawn widely enough to allow the Secretary of State to put the content of his own proposed order to all employees in a ballot, regardless of whether the union chose to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/2">It would be simpler, and preferable, if the principal unions involved were to organise proper postal ballots of all their members. However, amendment No. 32 would give the Secretary of State the power to deal with the situation where the unions do not organise such ballots.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/3">I thought very carefully about the wording of the amendment, and about whether the Secretary of State might need powers to require a third party such as a trade union, for example, to deliver information to him and thus enable him to hold such a ballot. I concluded that the fire authorities, being public statutory bodies, have control of all the information that he could need to conduct a ballot. The amendment is therefore drafted to require fire authorities to deliver information to him and places an obligation on them to comply with such a requirement. In that way, the Secretary of State can get the data that he needs to conduct a postal ballot without involving the unions. It thus avoids the need for penalties for non-compliance, and all the hullabaloo that would follow.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/4">In practice, of course, I would expect the Secretary of State to contract an external organisation to conduct a ballot. He might even agree that a trade union should conduct the ballot, or he might look to a third-party body such as the Electoral Reform Society.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/5">Amendment No. 33 is a drafting amendment that relates to matters dealt with in the previous group of amendments. I do not intend to say anything about it.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/6">I tabled amendment No. 32 because I am not convinced that the approach taken by Liberal Democrat Members with amendments Nos. 25 and 26 would work. Amendment No. 25 would not give the Secretary of State the power to make the order that amendment No. 26 refers to. I accept entirely that the intention behind that amendment is similar to that which underlies amendment No. 32, but amendment No. 32 is not a probing amendment. I hope that the Government will be able to accept it, so it was necessary to put it in a technically satisfactory form. Even so, I am very much on the same page as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" name="Matthew Green">the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green)</phrase> and his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/7">I understand that the Government also support the idea of a ballot of all fire brigade members to test any offer that might be on the table before a settlement is imposed. Certainly, the remarks made by the Minister in his winding-up speech on Second Reading suggest that he is sympathetic to the idea. Hon. Members of all parties in this House, and people outside the House, would look askance if we did not seek to ensure that all relevant employees were given a proper chance to express their views on any negotiated settlement before we concluded that such a settlement was impossible and proceeded to allow the Secretary of State to impose his own settlement.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/8">Two agreements have been approved by the employers, the Government and the union's executive. One agreement was rejected, through the conference, by the union membership, and the other is to be tested on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>. I think that there is a broad feeling in the House that the pithead ballot method of mandating delegates to the conferences may be a problem. As I understand it, members at individual fire stations mandate a delegate, usually to a county meeting, by an open show of hands. At the county meeting, the position of the brigade representative will again be mandated by an open show of hands.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/9">The Government are seeking to change things, but I suspect that most people would acknowledge that the fire service, although not unique, is at the extreme end of the spectrum when it comes to macho workplace environments. There will certainly be what might be described as peer pressure in the environment in which the ballots take place, and others might even describe it as intimidation. However, there is at least a hope that a postal ballot of all fire brigade members would allow more sober judgments to be made.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/10">Of course, I repeat that we all hope that sober judgment will prevail on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>. However, if it does not, I should not want to move to having a settlement imposed by the Secretary of State without taking the offer on the table now around the loop one more time. We should take it directly to fire brigade members through a postal ballot organised by, or on behalf of, the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/11">Perhaps it would be useful to recap the present state of the dispute, as that is essentially the background to the postal ballot proposal. Pay claims of 40 per cent. for firefighters and 50 per cent. for control room staff remain on the table, without any commitment to reform of working practices. The employers tabled a final offer that was rejected in April after having been recommended to the work force by the FBU executive. The Government rejected the intervention by Professor Burchill on the ground that it would add costs of &pound;100 million to the proposed settlement by watering down the link between modernisation and increased pay. Following that, the employers tabled a revised final offer. The FBU executive has again recommended to fire service personnel that the offer be accepted, and it has been approved by the Minister, on behalf of the Government. It will be voted on at a delegate conference on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/12">Meanwhile the Government remain committed to the position that any settlement above inflation must be paid for through productivity: the modernisation agenda. The Government have stated repeatedly, and the Minister said again today, that they will not finance any of the proposed settlement. They will advance &pound;30 million, to be repaid in future years, to deal with the cash-flow effects of funding a pay settlement immediately and then claw back savings through modernisation over time. The whole of the above-inflation element must be met by savings made through productivity gains.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/13">In practical terms, if the revised final offer is agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>, the measure is likely to be used only if the agreement were reneged on by members of fire brigades in one or more areas of the country. From previous experience, we know that militancy among firefighters varies enormously. Most hon. Members in the Chamber could reel off the names of three or four brigades where the implementation of an agreement could be difficult, although we would expect that, in many other brigades, an agreement reached on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase> would be implemented smoothly.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/14">I do not want to talk down the chances of the conference, but we are considering a measure for use if <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase> does not go according to the Minister's plan. If the offer is rejected then, it is likely that it would, and should, be the one tested in any ballot prescribed by amendment No. 32. It is thus worth probing the Minister on some of the unanswered questions about the offer.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/15">On Second Reading, the Minister made much of the cost of the Burchill proposals, due to the weakening of the link between pay and the reform of working conditions. However, the revised offer omits the key words from the beginning of the first paragraph that I have already quoted: it is</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/16" class="indent">&quot;a package agreement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/17">It</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/18" class="indent">&quot;depends on implementation of the entire package.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/19">Those words made it clear that pay and modernisation are linked, but they have gone from the latest draft.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/20">The previous version specified redeployment obligations. The section dealing with the duty system stated that there is:</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/21" class="indent">&quot;an obligation for employees to be based and deployed anywhere and on any duties appropriate to their competence, within the reasonable requirements of the fire authority.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/22">Those words, too, are missing from the revised text, which has the new words</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/23" class="indent">&quot;Pre-arranged overtime will not be used to make up any planned shortfall in the overall staffing levels set out in the fire authority's risk management plan.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/24">In that case, how is the fire authority to cover a staff shortfall to reach the level required by the integrated risk management plan?</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/25">The reference to the joint secretaries and the independent chair of the national joint council being available to assist in the event of any disputes on implementation of the agreement has also been removed from the latest text. There is thus no clear procedure for dealing with implementation disputes.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/26">I know that the Minister scrutinised the text in detail before it was agreed by the employers and the FBU executive, but all those points seem to weaken the link between working practice reform and increased pay. They weaken the commitment to reform of working practices and, thus, on the Minister's logic as applied to the Burchill proposals, they reduce the likelihood of our being able swiftly and smoothly to implement the working practice reforms and harvest the savings.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/27">Given the Minister's comments about Burchill and his costing of the proposals at &pound;100 million, can he quantify his Department's assessment of the extra cost of the revised final offer as opposed to the former final offer? In other words, what substance does he accord those significant changes of wording that I cited?</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/28">Will the Minister answer a question that I put to the Deputy Prime Minister on Second Reading? After the right hon. Gentleman's statement that the proposals were not an attack on firefighters' second jobs, I asked whether he could give an assurance that no individual firefighter would be forced to move to a different shift pattern. From my discussions with ordinary firefighters&mdash;not union activists&mdash;that seems to be the key issue; people do not want their daily life to be disrupted by fiat, but to have a say in the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/29">I asked the Deputy Prime Minister if he could give such a commitment and he replied:</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/30" class="indent">&quot;This is an important point, and I shall come exactly to it if the hon. Gentleman will allow me to complete my speech.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/31">Needless to say, the Deputy Prime Minister never came &quot;exactly to it&quot; and I should be most grateful if the Minister could throw any light on the question.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/32">On a related point, will the Minister address another of my concerns about the Deputy Prime Minister's statement on Second Reading, as it is relevant to the current package of proposals? The Deputy Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/33" class="indent">&quot;Between now and 2005-06, the fire service will lose 1,500 firefighters through compulsory retirement at age 55.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-05-08.863"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 May 2003; Vol. 404, c. 863-65</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/34">Wearing another of my hats, I am conscious of the article 13 directive and of the preparations being made by the Minister's colleagues to bring into UK law the requirement to remove discrimination on various grounds, including age. Is the Government's policy that the new arrangements in the fire service will preserve compulsory retirement from all posts at the age of 55? Is their assessment that such a policy will not fall foul of their proposals for the implementation of article 13 in respect of age discrimination? If compulsory retirement at age 55 is to go, the Deputy Prime Minister's assumption about natural wastage will be wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".63.2/35">All those important issues relate to the offer on the table, which will, I hope, be accepted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>. In that case, we need to understand the implications of the offer, so if the Minister can answer my questions, I hope that that will help to clarify matters. If the amendment is accepted, as I hope that it will be&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".67.1/1">I am disappointed to see the Minister shaking his head. I hope that he has an extremely good reason for not accepting such a sensible amendment. If it were accepted, I should expect the current offer to be voted on in the sad event that agreement could not be reached on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/2">I shall touch briefly on the Liberal Democrat amendment, No. 27. On Second Reading, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/840" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase> intervened on me to agree that the Deputy Prime Minister's powers under the Bill appeared to ignore the integrated risk management programmes. The right hon. Gentleman's powers are not constrained so that they can be used in a way that is supportive of the integrated risk management programmes adopted by individual fire authorities. However, amendment No. 27 also fails to address that point.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/3">If the integrated risk management programme requires that conditions of service change, what is the relevance of arbitration? Clearly, delivery of the integrated risk management programme will require a change in those conditions of service. Arbitration can be used to settle pay&mdash;the compensation required to work under different conditions. That is a perfectly legitimate consideration, but to subject changes to other conditions to arbitration could undermine the integrated risk management programme, and I do not think that the hon. Member for Ludlow really wants to do that. Perhaps he is considering pay only. I look forward to him clarifying that point.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/4">Finally, I turn briefly to amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 15, which were tabled by the awkward squad on the Government Back Benches. Their effect would be disastrous and give the FBU a veto over any order that the Deputy Prime Minister might make under the powers granted to him by the Bill. If those who tabled the amendments are successful, we can be assured that our consideration today would be entirely wasted. The Bill would have no purpose whatever. The amendments would effectively allow the FBU to usurp Parliament's role, and that probably neatly encapsulates the bizarre and often offensive view that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> takes of the world. These are wrecking amendments and not worthy of consideration in the House. If those Members want to wreck the Bill, the correct course of action for them is to vote against Third Reading, not to table such amendments. We certainly will not support them.</p>

	<p pid=".68.0/1">This group of amendments is particularly important because it addresses the issue of postal ballots. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> has suggested, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives come to the issue from broadly the same direction. He said that our amendments would not work, but I suspect that the wording of the Conservatives' amendments probably would not work either. The difficulty is that amendment No. 32 does not say that the ballot would decide whether FBU members have accepted the conditions. It says only that it would &quot;ascertain their views&quot;. Therefore, it appears to be more a consultation than a ballot, and there is concern about the way in which it would be carried out.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/2">If the Minister cannot accept Conservative amendment No. 32 and our amendments Nos. 25 and 26, I hope that he will say that the Government can find a way of inserting similar provisions into the Bill. Because of the rush and the guillotine motion, the opportunity for the Government to do that on Report will be limited. However, the Bill has to go to another place and I hope that the Government will consider tabling an amendment there.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/3">Two issues of concern arise from what happened when the FBU executive accepted a settlement and it was rejected by a conference. The first was outlined by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge. There is the potential for peer pressure to be exerted at a fire station when a show of hands mandates the person going to the conference.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/4">The second concern is that a mandatory system can lead to the same problems that were faced in the last American presidential elections when fewer people voted for the current American President than voted for the Democrat candidate. That happened because people voted in areas for a mandated delegated to take a bloc vote forward. Under a mandatory system, even if secret ballots were held in fire stations, a majority of FBU members might want to accept a deal but the minority might be able to ensure that there were enough mandated votes to defeat them.</p>

	<p pid=".69.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of that, but it is probably the case for many hon. Members. However, there is a slight difference. We are the representatives not the mandated delegates of our constituencies. My point about the American election was that, although the people from the individual states are technically representatives, they are to all intents and purposes mandated.</p>
	<p pid=".69.1/2">The key point is that a secret postal ballot of all members would ascertain the view of the majority of FBU members. I have spoken to FBU members in Shropshire, and I am certain that a majority of them would have accepted the previous settlement. Indeed, many of us suspect that that is true across the country. A postal ballot would ensure that, instead of the Government imposition of a settlement, all the FBU's members would have an opportunity to decide whether to accept it. That must be preferable to the Secretary of State imposing a settlement.</p>
	<p pid=".69.1/3">Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 may be technically defective but I suspect that Conservative amendment No. 32 is, too. We do not have the Minister's access to the skills of the parliamentary draftsmen, but I hope that he will accept that we have a strong point and that he will be willing to table amendments at a later stage to satisfy our demands. If he does, many of our overall concerns about the Bill will be removed.</p>
	<p pid=".69.1/4">On amendment No. 27, I take on board what the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge said. It was our thinking that the provisions in the amendment should apply primarily to pay. Although the amendment may not be technically perfect, its intention is to ensure that the Secretary of State could modify the conditions of service only following the recommendations of an independent arbitration process. Clearly, as the hon. Gentleman attempted to elicit from the Minister, if a settlement from the Government is unfortunately needed, we hope that it would probably be the one on the table from the employers. It has gone through a process of arbitration, and the intention of the amendment is to ensure that that would happen in future.</p>
	<p pid=".69.1/5">I accept that the amendment may not be perfect&mdash;I do not pretend that it is&mdash;but I hope that the Minister will accept the need for any pay settlement to be tested. I am sure that that is his intention, but the problem is that the Bill will effectively give him the powers to impose whatever settlement he chooses. If the FBU reject the settlement, the Minister could in a mean-spirited mood suddenly say&mdash;I am sure that he and the Deputy Prime Minister would not do this&mdash; that the award will be 1 per cent. a year for the next three years. I am sure that that is not the Minister's intention, but the Bill would give him that power.</p>

	<p pid=".70.0/1">I am sure that that is not the Minister's intention However, he will leap to his feet to correct me if I am wrong when I say that I have the distinct impression that the Deputy Prime Minister told the House that, should the settlement currently on the table be rejected, it is likely that an imposed settlement would be less generous.</p>

	<p pid=".70.1/1">The hon. Gentleman may be right that that impression has been given. It is perhaps an attempt to force the union to accept the offer and we shall wait with interest to hear what the Minister says.</p>
	<p pid=".70.1/2">The Bill gives Ministers open-ended powers to impose a settlement as they choose. Liberal Democrat amendments Nos. 25 to 27 suggest the use of ballots, arbitration or both as an attempt to ensure that Ministers could not abuse the process. I am sure that the Minister would not abuse the powers but they could be abused to achieve retribution for a long and drawn out dispute. I am sure that he will be only too keen to tell us that that is not the Government's intention. If that is the case, we would feel a great deal happier if the Bill included a provision indicating that the Government would propose a settlement that had been through arbitration or put to a ballot. They are two further ways in which our concerns about the Bill could be mollified.</p>
	<p pid=".70.1/3">It has already been said that amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 15 are essentially wrecking amendments. They would take decision-making power away from everyone else and put that straight into the hands of the Fire Brigades Union. We have been in that position for at least a year and that is why the Government are doing what they are doing, although we would do things differently. The amendments would take us back to square one, meaning that we would have wasted all our time and effort on the Bill, so we shall not support them.</p>
	<p pid=".70.1/4">However imperfect the various amendments in the group are, I hope that the Minister will say in the spirit of understanding that the Government will table amendments that will satisfy some of our worries. If he does that, the remaining significant concerns that we have about the Bill will be largely satisfied.</p>

	<p pid=".70.2/1">I shall speak to amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 15, which are tabled in my name. However, I set the amendments to one side because <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> referred to my offensive view of the world. I do not think that I have ever had a conversation with the hon. Gentleman&mdash;I offer him the opportunity to have that conservation now. If he was alluding to recent reports in <i>The Sun</i>, <i>Daily Mail,</i> or <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, may I suggest that he reads my article in today's edition of <i>The Guardian</i> before he has a conversation with me, rather than making such allegations?</p>
	<p pid=".70.2/2">Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 were not designed to be wrecking amendments. If the Bill had become permanent legislation without the sunset clause that we have just agreed, it would have been the permanent negotiating machinery for the fire service in the future. The amendments would have introduced the requirement for a negotiated settlement before any order was brought forward&mdash;it is as simple as that. The amendments are no longer relevant because I hope that the implementation of the sunset clause will allow us to return to the normal negotiating process. Amendment No. 10 would have ensured that a report would be laid before Parliament on the views of the negotiating body on any proposal for an order. I thought that that would enhance the democratic process.</p>
	<p pid=".70.2/3">I do not understand why amendment No. 15 is offensive. It would ensure only that the organisation that represented the workers in the industry would be the organisation representing the majority of the workers.</p>

	<p pid=".71.1/1">If that is the case, it is due to inaccurate drafting. The drafting was undertaken with the advice of the drafting Clerk. The word &quot;majority&quot; is meant to refer to the employees' overall representation&mdash;the majority union. There may well be a printing error. The words &quot;some or all&quot; in clause 2 will allow employees to be represented by a minority organisation. The amendment would ensure that the employees, at least, would be represented by the majority membership organisation. I cannot understand why that is offensive or undemocratic in any way.</p>

The hon. Member for Ludlow referred to people who were elected by a minority of votes cast and the hon.

I did a little research and I can tell the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge that he is in the same position, because the majority of electors in his constituency voted against him.

	<p pid=".71.4/1">I shall not go into enormous detail because I fear that I will be out of order, but I concede that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge secured 47 per cent. of the electorate in his constituency, which was a higher percentage than that secured by the hon. Member for Ludlow but a lesser percentage than the 60 per cent. secured by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1182" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".71.4/2">It has been made clear that the amendments address two separate issues: the role of secret ballots and the steps that it is reasonable for the Secretary of State to take before using the powers that the Bill will confer on him. I shall address the issues in turn.</p>
	<p pid=".71.4/3">We believe that secret ballots are a fundamental part of good industrial relations. Only industrial action that has the support of a ballot is protected under trade union legislation. It is well known that the Fire Brigades Union held a secret ballot before it embarked on the dispute in which a large majority of its members voted in favour of action. However, the union did not hold a ballot on whether to accept a particular offer, but on whether to take strike action. I do not hold that against the union because it was in line with section 229 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, which requires that a ballot should contain a question about strike action or industrial action short of a strike.</p>
	<p pid=".71.4/4">The FBU has not balloted its members about any of the latest offers made by the employers. We should bear it in mind that the employers' offer at the time the ballot was held was only 4 per cent. over one year. The employers more recently offered 16 per cent. over two and a half years. We have repeatedly made clear our view that the FBU should put the employers' latest offer to a secret ballot of its members so that ordinary firefighters have the opportunity to make up their minds in private. The kind of collective meetings that are held to gauge opinion do not guarantee the fundamental principle of democracy that people should be able to express their view in a secret ballot. However, we have no plans to legislate to require the FBU to hold a secret ballot. Such an approach would mean treating the FBU differently from every other trade union, and there is no logical reason for doing that.</p>

	<p pid=".72.1/2">Let me address the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge first. Amendment No. 25 would mean that the Secretary of State could make an order only if a secret ballot of all fire brigade members on an employers' offer had been held in the previous three months. One problem with that is that there is no mechanism for a secret ballot of all fire brigade members. The FBU could ballot all its members, but not those who are members of other unions or of none.</p>

	<p pid=".72.3/1">I apologise unreservedly. I have confused the order of the amendments because amendment No. 25 comes before amendment No. 32.</p>
	<p pid=".72.3/2">The problem with the Liberal Democrat proposal is that there is no mechanism by which a ballot of all members could be held. Other unions are involved and they could ballot their members, but they are not party to the negotiating body. Whether that is right or not is a different matter, but that is the situation and strictly speaking no offer can be made to them by the employers. It is not easy to understand how they could be asked to express a view when they are not party to an offer.</p>

	<p pid=".73.0/1">Those unions may not be party to the negotiations, but they will receive the benefits or otherwise of the settlement that is either negotiated or not, and it is right that they should be balloted as well. The amendment might not provide for how that ballot should be carried out, but it is not impossible for the Secretary of State to get the names and addresses of those people who work in the fire brigade.</p>

	<p pid=".73.1/1">There may be a perfectly good justification, as an academic exercise, to test the views of all the people who work in the fire service, including those who are members of other unions such as the GMB, Unison, the National Association of Fire Officers and the Retained Firefighters Union, but that is not relevant to the negotiating procedure. We have said throughout the debate that we hope for a satisfactory outcome to the negotiations that have been going on for more than a year to resolve the dispute. The amendment would not help to resolve the dispute through the agreed negotiating procedure. Perhaps the procedure is not satisfactory and contains inequities that the hon. Gentleman might want to change, but we have to deal with the existing machinery.</p>

	<p pid=".73.2/1">I suspect that the Minister will apply the same criticism to my amendment. I recognise that what he is saying is true, but as far as I am concerned the purpose of the ballot is twofold: to test opinion and to make that opinion widely known before the Secretary of State intervenes with his leaden-booted power to impose a settlement, and to create an environment in which the Secretary of State's own proposed solution can be given legitimacy. If the vast majority of members of fire brigades accept a settlement, the Secretary of State would have a good basis on which to impose it. The militants might rail against that, but the great majority of people in the country would see it as fair and reasonable.</p>

	<p pid=".73.3/1">I shall come in a moment to the procedures that we will adopt. They will ensure that the Secretary of State seeks evidence of opinion before imposing a solution.

	<p pid=".73.4/1">Will the Minister acknowledge that the problem with the existing negotiating method is that firefighters are being asked to agree to a pay settlement that is linked to changes in their conditions of service? As those will arise from the risk review, they are as yet unknown. The firefighters do not know what they are being asked to agree to, which is why we need a separate arrangement for them to be consulted in this instance.</p>

	<p pid=".74.0/1">I agree that there are uncertainties. That is one reason why individual firefighters may have been nervous about accepting the generous 16 per cent. offer on the table. Compared with what most other public sector workers are being offered, that is a good deal. However, I accept that uncertainty exists. In my judgment, it has been a major cause of alarm for many firefighters. That is why the employers' latest offer makes a number of changes to the text. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge mentioned those. They have been proposed to deal with the anxieties and concerns felt by many firefighters.</p>
	<p pid=".74.0/2">The introduction of the new arrangements following integrated risk management plans is likely to give rise to changes, but it is our understanding that the majority of firefighters will continue to operate the same shift system. The numbers who might be asked to move to a different shift system will be relatively small. That should be containable on a voluntary basis. In any case, different shift systems will be attractive to firefighters who do not find the present shift system wholly conducive to family life, for example. There are alternatives. It will be up to individual fire authorities to explore those, but it is our understanding that that is compatible with a consensual way forward that does not impose unreasonable changes or prevent firefighters from operating a similar shift system.</p>

	<p pid=".74.1/1">One of the major concerns is that the watches of firefighters who work closely together and know one another well will be broken up. They know their colleagues' strengths and weaknesses and how they will react in life-endangering situations. Similarly, leading firefighters who are managing a fire know the strengths and weaknesses of the members of the watches to whom they are giving instructions. There is a concern that operational efficiency could be jeopardised by people working together at random. If they are not used to working together, they will not be as efficient or effective as the established watches.</p>

	<p pid=".74.2/1">I hear what the hon. Lady says and I know that some firefighters are concerned about that, but many fire stations already have mixed crewing whereby a full-time crew and a retained crew operate from the same station. The flexibility that allows those arrangements will often ensure a more effective response in a cost-effective way. It will be for each fire authority, under the integrated risk management plan process, to explore how it can best meet the needs of its area to provide the most effective service. That is what we are about. We are interested in safety and in ensuring the most effective response to the risks of fire. We want to achieve that in a more cost-effective way than often applies at the moment, because constant crewing can result in inefficiencies.</p>
	<p pid=".74.2/2">The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge asked whether the changes to the text on overtime would make it impossible for employers to make the savings that had been envisaged. That is a classic example of one of the changes that was designed to allay anxieties. It was thought that firefighters might assume that fire authorities or chief fire officers would reduce the numbers of employed firefighters and force up hours through overtime to compensate. That is not the intention. The objective is to allow extra flexibility. For example, if gaps are caused by sickness or other absences, that could be covered by overtime, but it should not justify reducing establishments arbitrarily to put them below the level that would be regarded as appropriate to provide proper fire cover.</p>
	<p pid=".74.2/3">Flexibility is very much the objective. That must be understood widely. It is in all our interests that we have the most effective fire service possible. No one wants the fire service damaged by change. Modernisation is not about reducing the quality of service or putting the public at risk. On the contrary: it is about ensuring a more effective response that accepts the need to do more on prevention while ensuring the continuation of a highly effective responsive service when fires occur.</p>
	<p pid=".74.2/4">One of the things that causes me the greatest alarm and concern is evidence of the growing number of fires that could have been prevented. There is a serious upward trend in incidents of arson, and more effective action is necessary to tackle that. There is still an extremely high number of false alarms: crews are dispatched for no good purpose because of malfunctioning alarms and other such incidents. Again, more effective action must be taken to ensure that people can concentrate on the important job of preventing fires and tackling them where they occur. That is what modernisation is about.</p>
	<p pid=".74.2/5">Those are decisions that must be taken in the light of local circumstances, and that is what integrated risk management plans are about. The employers' aim is to ensure that that is better understood by firefighters, who have, in part by misinformation that has been put about, been led to believe that the proposals are a serious threat to their future, to their patterns of work and to the safety of the public.</p>

	<p pid=".75.0/1">The Minister says that overtime would not be used routinely. I am confused, because the Deputy Prime Minister has previously said in the House that it is absurd that firefighters can have second jobs as cab drivers, gardeners or decorators, but that they cannot when off duty deploy their skills as firefighters in retained duty. I thought that the Deputy Prime Minister was advocating encouraging firefighters to deploy as much time as they want to for the benefit of the fire service. Now, the offer appears to impose a limit on the amount of overtime.</p>

	<p pid=".75.1/1">That is not the case. There is something curious about the FBU having regarded it as appropriate for firefighters, if they wish, to work in their spare time as taxi drivers, decorators or whatever, but not to work as firefighters, either doing overtime at their own fire station, or acting as retained firefighters in another area, perhaps the one in which they live. The option under discussion will allow greater flexibility and ensure a more effective and more cost-effective service, but it is not designed artificially to depress the number of firefighters employed regularly. It may well be that it will result in savings and in reductions to the establishment being possible, because the establishment may artificially be higher than it needs to be because of the current ban on overtime; but there is a difference between that and deliberately depressing numbers through excessive use of overtime.</p>

	<p pid=".76.0/1">But how can the firefighters who want to give up their second job outside and to deploy themselves for the benefit of the fire service do so, given that the draft text states, at paragraph 3.8, that employees will be free to undertake pre-arranged overtime at premium rates of pay for no more than 24 hours per month?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.76.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1182" speakername="Nick Raynsford" colnum="76"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-21.htm#30603-21_spnew7">
	<p pid=".76.1/1">Clearly, it is not sensible for firefighters to work a full-time job as well as a long period of overtime&mdash;more than 24 hours a month. Safety is an issue. The proposal is about allowing greater flexibility than comes from making overtime impossible while rightly respecting the concerns of firefighters, their union and chief fire officers that firefighters should not be put in a position where they are exhausted by working excessive overtime. These are practical, sensible, common-sense arrangements that are designed to ensure a better fire service, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that.</p>
	<p pid=".76.1/2">Amendment No. 26 provides an alternative to amendment No. 25, perhaps because the hon. Member for Ludlow realised that amendment No. 25 was not a practical proposition. Under amendment No. 26, the Secretary of State may make an order requiring a secret postal ballot of all fire brigade members about an existing offer, organised independently. Similarly, amendment No. 32 suggests that the Secretary of State should conduct a postal ballot on his own proposals to make an order, rather than on an offer by the employers.</p>
	<p pid=".76.1/3">The difficulty that I have with the amendments is that what is proposed would take time without getting anywhere. Under the normal process of negotiation, employers and unions discuss; they reach an agreement that the negotiators think acceptable, which is put to their members for endorsement. They may, in some cases, use a secret ballot as part of that process. The powers in the Bill are not designed to deal with those circumstances. They are designed to deal with the different and exceptional situation in which the normal process has broken down, not to enable the whole thing to be rerun by the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".76.1/4">Anyway, it is not clear what we would do with the results of a ballot. If it were a ballot about an offer made by the employers and the offer had been rejected, we would not necessarily impose it. An offer linking pay rises to changes in working practices, like the one on the table now, is designed to work with the agreement of both sides. I am sure that hon. Members accept that what can be achieved by agreement between two parties acting in good faith is often different from what can be achieved by imposition. If no agreement is reached by the negotiating body, it does not follow that we would or could simply impose the same deal as the employers put forward. If we have to use the powers, we must be able to act decisively on the basis of our own judgment.</p>
	<p pid=".76.1/5">That does not mean that we would act unreasonably. The Bill as it stands requires the Secretary of State to consult the negotiating body&mdash;that is, the employers and the FBU&mdash;before he makes an order. He must give them at least 21 days to comment on his proposals, then consider any comments they make. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister said on Second Reading that he would also consult the statutory advisers, the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council. That body, which is chaired by the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1041" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie)</phrase>, includes a number of organisations and trade unions that are not on the negotiating body. That is a way of engaging some of the other groups that would not otherwise be involved in the current negotiating procedures. We have made it clear that we would not use the powers arbitrarily. They are there to enable us to act decisively, but after consultation with those affected. That must be the right approach.</p>
	<p pid=".76.1/6">Amendment No. 27 appears to be designed as a hurdle to be jumped before an order setting or modifying conditions of service can be made&mdash;another hurdle that does nothing to help to create an effective fire service.</p>

	<p pid=".77.0/1">The Minister describes the amendment as a hurdle, but all our amendments are attempts to ensure that if the Secretary of State imposes a settlement, he does so with at least some indication that a fair number of fire brigade members will support it. The Secretary of State can impose a settlement, but that does not mean that fire brigade members will turn up for work. That is why the amendments are important.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.77.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1182" speakername="Nick Raynsford" colnum="77"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-22.htm#30603-22_spnew1">
	<p pid=".77.1/1">We discussed that issue at some length on Second Reading. We have made it clear that the route followed in the Bill is designed to cope with the current situation. We are acting reluctantly&mdash;these are not powers that we want to use, but we have to have them in case a settlement is not reached through the normal negotiating procedures. We hope that one will be reached, but the Bill will be there as a stop-gap. If a settlement is not reached, we have to be able to act decisively. The hurdles erected by the amendments would make that impossible.</p>
	<p pid=".77.1/2">Under amendment No. 27, an order would have to follow the recommendations of an independent arbitration process. The implication of that is that the Secretary of State could not impose changes proposed by the employers&mdash;or by a union&mdash;unless they had been recommended by an independent arbitrator, let alone changes that he thinks are appropriate. That goes against the whole thrust of the Bill, which is that if the two parties to the negotiation cannot agree, the Secretary of State with responsibility for the provision of an effective fire service and for public funding of that service should step in and make a settlement.</p>
	<p pid=".77.1/3">That requires some hard decisions, and those decisions cannot and should not simply be handed over to a third party. The issues that have caused the most difficulty in the current dispute include how the fire service should move from prescribed national fire cover standards to local risk-based approaches to fire cover, and what the implications are for staff&mdash;the very points made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1308" name="Angela Watkinson">the hon. Member for Upminster (Angela Watkinson)</phrase>. Those are serious issues requiring serious answers, but they are not necessarily issues capable of arbitration.</p>
	<p pid=".77.1/4">In the end, one cannot arbitrate about policy questions, such as the right basis for fire cover. One can arbitrate about some of the implications, especially for pay, but it is hard to see how even the best independent arbitrator would be better placed to make informed judgments about issues such as the appropriate level of fire cover, and how new shift systems might be introduced in a way that achieves both a more effective and safer service and cost savings, than a professional who is expert in the field. It is difficult to envisage how that could happen.</p>
	<p pid=".77.1/5">I understand the purpose behind the amendment, but it is not realistic. We do not believe that it would work. The Government must have policy responsibility rather than handing these matters over to somebody else. Even if an arbitrator were involved, there is another hurdle in the amendment. The recommendations have to be rejected by one side or the other before the Secretary of State can make an order. The history of the current dispute shows that things can drag on for long periods without a clear outcome. After all, the FBU executive first felt able to recommend to its members an offer from the employers on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-18">18 March</phrase>. However, that did not lead to a clear outcome. We must be able to deal with a situation in which there has not been outright rejection. Yet the amendment would make it impossible for us to act if there had not been outright rejection by one party. That is a clear obstacle and such a procedure would not work. If it is wished to have an effective power to deal with the dispute, and if the dispute is not resolved otherwise, the amendment should be withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid=".77.1/6">I am equally unable to accept amendments Nos. 9, 10 and 15, which were tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>. Amendment No. 9 would mean that the Secretary of State could only fix or modify firefighters' conditions of service with the agreement of the negotiating body.</p>
	<p pid=".77.1/7">Our strategy is bringing forward the Bill is to draw a line under the dispute by making a fair and reasonable award. We are doing this in a situation where the negotiating body&mdash;the national joint council&mdash;has so far failed to reach agreement for nearly a year. Against that background, it is hardly likely that both sides of the NJC would be able to agree on the terms of any settlement proposed by Ministers.</p>
	<p pid=".77.1/8">As we have made repeatedly clear, we have no wish to use the powers that the Bill would confer. There is still time for the two sides to reach agreement, and we very much hope that they will. We welcome the progress that has been made over the recent period. That has been made in the knowledge that if there is no agreement the Government will have the powers to impose a settlement. It is not for me to say how much the two sides may have been influenced by the knowledge that we are bringing forward the Bill, but it is clearly one factor. Accepting my hon. Friend's amendments on this point would therefore be counterproductive.</p>
	<p pid=".77.1/9">Amendment No. 10 would also require the Secretary of State to lay before Parliament a report of the views of the negotiating body on his proposals to make an order. That seems to me unnecessary. It would clearly be open to the negotiating body to make public its views, but that should be a matter for that body. The Secretary of State, at all events, will have to justify his decision to the House if the order is subject to challenge. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge made it clear that in the event of any order being made to impose pay and conditions, he would ensure that it was challenged. There would be a full opportunity for the House to question the Secretary of State on this issue if the matter were ever to come to that stage.</p>
	<p pid=".77.1/10">Amendment No. 15 would mean that the negotiating body would need to be constituted so that it represented the &quot;majority&quot; of fire authorities, rather than &quot;some or all&quot;, as the Bill is drafted.</p>

That is provided by the provisions in clause 2(2)(b). I hope that my hon. Friend will understand that that effectively gives him the object that he is seeking. I ask him and other hon.

	<p pid=".79.2/1">I am disappointed with what the Minister has had to say. On Second Reading, in respect of secret ballots, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid=".79.2/2" class="indent">&quot;I make it clear to the House that my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister and I have said, on several occasions, that that could be a sensible way forward.&quot; &mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-05-08.920"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 May 2003; Vol. 404, c. 920</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".79.2/3">In good faith we have proposed a set of amendments that would ensure that the grass roots, the fire brigades' members, were properly consulted and their opinion tested before the draconian powers that the Secretary of State is taking were implemented and acted upon.</p>
	<p pid=".79.2/4">I think that the Minister has been slightly disingenuous in his response. He said that he would show why amendment No. 32 was technically defective and he has not. He has said that the amendment did not create the possibility of putting an existing offer on the table to a ballot. It does, by allowing the Secretary of State to consult fire brigades' members on any other matter that he considers relevant. I do not think that the Minister has made a case against the secret ballot test. We have made it clear that that is one of our conditions for being able to support this draconian emergency legislation, and I am disappointed that the Minister has not risen to that challenge. I will therefore be urging my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote for amendment No. 32.</p>

	<p pid=".83.2/1">I shall be fairly brief in speaking to the amendments. I tabled them because there is some anxiety that the Secretary of State is taking significant powers of detail. In particular, the provision on disposal of property is a remarkable power of detail if it is to involve the wholesale closure and sale of individual fire stations. The amendments give the Government the opportunity to reassure the general public that the power will not be used extensively for the closure of fire stations.</p>
	<p pid=".83.2/2">In addition, I have tabled amendments that would reinforce the rights of individual Members of Parliament and local authorities to be consulted on any local changes in practice involving the dispersal of facilities in an area. I accept that section 19 of the Fire Services Act 1947 has been amended in previous legislation, but it would be helpful for the Government to reassure Members and others that, where the powers are to be exercised, there will be consultation with Members of Parliament and local authorities. As the Bill stands, the Secretary of State can consult whomsoever he thinks fit, but I think that we need to tighten the legislation to ensure that Members of Parliament have a role in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".83.2/3">In addition, I suggest that when the consultations have taken place, a report should be laid before Parliament. I am not proposing that there should be reports on all individual consultations about minor changes of practice, but I believe that at least some form of conglomerate report should be made regularly, so that we can have an overview of the changes of practice that are taking place in our name as a result of the legislation. Such a report could be made annually or when the Secretary of State sees fit, but it would give the House an opportunity to assess the implications of the Bill and how effective the changes are locally in practice, especially with regard to the introduction of risk management.</p>
	<p pid=".83.2/4">The amendments on property are probing amendments that seek to tease out the Government's intentions with regard to the specific interventions that they envisage on the disposal and dispersal of property. It would be helpful if the Minister enlightened and reassured us that the provision is not about the wholesale selling off of fire stations, that Members of Parliament and local authorities will have a distinctly direct consultative role in respect of any changes and that Parliament will have an overview.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.84.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="84"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-23.htm#30603-23_spnew2">
	<p pid=".84.0/1">I have a few questions for the Minister about the powers to direct property and assets, and I want to try to get some clarity about precisely what the Government have in mind.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/2">Primarily, I want to clarify whether the purpose of the powers in clause 1(2) is to implement integrated risk management plans. If so, would it not have been better to include a specific reference on the face of the Bill? Such plans will be prepared after proper consultation. The Minister has already issued a circular setting out the consultation that he expects. If the powers set out in subsection (2) explicitly related to the implementation of adopted integrated risk management plans, it would be relatively easy to justify them, although the need for them would not be so clear. Perhaps the Minister has it in mind that some fire authorities may not have the bottle to implement their own integrated risk management plans and to make the necessary changes, and that they may need the Secretary of State to come along and stiffen their resolve by using his powers to impose the changes that their fully consulted on and properly adopted plans envisage.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/3">That is one possible scenario, but it is equally credible to suggest that the powers will be intended primarily to direct the use of assets. In that regard, I take it that the word &quot;disposal&quot; has two possible meanings&mdash;the transferral of land ownership or simply making something available in the short term. For example, the provision could be used by the Secretary of State to prevent firefighters from having access to fire service buildings during a strike. It could be used to direct that appliances be made available to military firefighters or&mdash;perhaps this is not beyond the realms of possibility&mdash;private contractors undertaking a firefighting role in the absence of the regular firefighters.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/4">It is very important that we understand precisely how the Minister envisages that the powers will be used. If he envisages that they will be used in different ways, the Committee must be clear about that. The three options, as I see them, are as follows. The powers may be used to implement approved integrated risk management plans. They may be used to implement change where a fire authority&mdash;let us take Avon at random&mdash;fails to propose a proper integrated risk management plan that the Secretary of State can endorse. Finally, they could be wholly related to contingency planning in the event of a strike.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/5">If the Minister is going to tell us that the powers are to be used for the implementation of integrated risk management plans that have been subject to the proper procedure, the concerns addressed by amendments Nos. 10 and 11 will be dealt with, as the plans will have involved proper consultation. However, if he can at least envisage using the powers because of the failure to produce a plan, it will be perfectly logical to suggest that there should be a consultation process that parallels the consultation that would have taken place if a plan had been prepared and proposed.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/6">My concern remains that the Government will face a major task and a genuine problem in convincing the public that changes that appear to be cuts, as they reduce the number of appliances, fire stations or firefighters, are risk-driven rather than cost-driven. Given the statements that have already been made and repeated today that any pay settlement has to be funded out of savings made through modernisation, I suggest to the Minister that it is very important that any rationalisation of assets imposed by ministerial order must be seen to have been subjected to the proper and rigorous process that is proposed with regard to the preparation of the integrated risk management plan. I have described at least one scenario involving long-term permanent change that could not happen without the introduction of a consultative procedure somewhat akin to those proposed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>. The imposition of such changes without the consultation process envisaged in the circular would only increase the risk of public scepticism.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/7">I should be grateful if the Minister would address specifically each of the three possible uses of the powers in relation to property and assets and explain whether those are uses that he intends and, in each case, how he intends to use them.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/8">Part of the confusion in my mind arises from something that the Deputy Prime Minister said on Second Reading, namely:</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/9" class="indent">&quot;As for whether the use of the facilities themselves will be necessary,&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/10">this is, believe it or not, a direct quote&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/11" class="indent">&quot;I hope that if a difficult stage is reached during arbitration and fear is generated, fire stations will be available. On occasion even some fire authorities have made it clear that in such circumstances they would not be available. I had the rather quaint idea that the fire stations belonged to the public, although in one or two cases I have felt doubtful about whether that is so.</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/12" class="indent">That was a flippant remark, but I think that hon. Members will know what I mean.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-05-08.861"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 May 2003; Vol. 404, c. 861</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".84.0/13">I have to confess that I have not the faintest idea what he meant. If the Minister can clarify the Government's position, as outlined in that statement by the Deputy Prime Minister, he will be doing the House a favour, and he is a better man than I am.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.85.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" speakername="David Drew" colnum="85"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-23.htm#30603-23_spnew3">
	<p pid=".85.0/1">I rise to make a narrow point, on which I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to allay my fears, concerning the possible disposal of assets. That always raises alarm in rural areas. Under the previous Conservative Government, we regularly had to run campaigns&mdash;we were a campaigning party&mdash;against proposed closures of rural retained stations. I am unclear as to how that would play in relation to the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".85.0/2">I am even more mystified in that I was persuaded to support the changes to section 19 to the Local Government Bill on the basis that the Government were introducing sensible changes to the labyrinthine mechanism by which any changes in the disposal of assets&mdash;changing the location of stations and so on&mdash;should, instead of being left in the hands of the Secretary of State or his nominee, be decided locally. As a great believer in decentralisation, I thought that that was a good move. Such decisions should be made locally and the people who make them should be accountable locally. That was the right way to go about it. Yet the Bill seems to say something different and almost contradictory&mdash;that if and when a problem arose as regards the way in which pay and conditions were introduced nationally, the Secretary of State or his nominee could decide that it would be sensible, whether in terms of finances or the notion of integrated risk management, to close or move a particular station. We all know the type of reaction that that would cause locally. People in Painswick in my constituency have already run too many campaigns to save stations, and they certainly do not want to have to do so under a Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid=".85.0/3">Will the Minister confirm where these powers might be introduced, whether the Bill contradicts the Local Government Bill, and whether we will find that the White Paper clarifies the position? We need to know that local people will have a say in how a fire authority's management are able to exercise their powers, so that there is no confusion and we do not end up in a real mess over who is able to take the decision and where the blame lies.</p>

	<p pid=".86.0/1">I do not feel able to support the amendments, but they give us the opportunity to ask the Minister a series of questions.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/2">My reading of the Bill was that the point of use and disposal is that in the event of industrial action the Secretary of State could make facilities available to the military or others. That should not be embarked on lightly, even in a dispute, but presumably we are reaching the stage where the Minister thinks that it may be necessary to have that power, or at least to have it in reserve. However, the word &quot;disposal&quot; has more than one meaning, so will he clarify exactly what it means in this context? The explanatory notes do not help to make that any clearer. They say:</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Examples of purposes for which this power might be useful are to provide joint control rooms&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/4">Would that be during a dispute or permanently? We are not given an answer to that. In Shropshire, all of us, including the FBU, want a joint control room&mdash;only the Government are standing in our way.</p>
	<p pid=".86.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> suggested that the Bill may give the Secretary of State the power suddenly to announce that he is closing half the rural retained fire stations in Ludlow. I hope that the Bill does not give the Secretary of State such a power, which I would resist at all costs. I do not believe that that is what the Minister is trying to achieve, and I hope that he will reassure us that the Bill is about the events and circumstances of an ongoing dispute and securing public safety during only the time of that dispute.</p>

	<p pid=".87.0/1">In any legal sense, the word &quot;disposal&quot; has to mean &quot;to get rid of&quot;. The Bill refers to &quot;use or disposal&quot;, not &quot;use and disposal&quot;. That leads me to believe that it means the transfer of property, which, in this context, may mean the sell-off of rural stations, as the hon. Member for Stroud suggested. The clause must be read in conjunction with the repeal of section 19, which makes it all the more urgent and important. I have no hesitation whatever in supporting the amendments tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> and others.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/2">It is only right that there should be an understanding that rural stations are extremely important to communities. I shall give a brief example of that concern. About four months ago, I met the north Wales fire chief. I live in a very rural constituency where we rely heavily on the good men and women of the retained brigades, who do an excellent job. During our meeting, which took place during the dispute and was to do with pay settlements and a whole gamut of issues, I asked him about the future of rural fire stations. He said, &quot;They're all right; they're quite secure.&quot; However, a few minutes later we talked about the following scenario. A small village has a retained brigade running the local fire station. Some 12 or 14 miles down the road, there is a full-time station. The chief fire officer told me that his concern was that several of the people who worked in the small retained station were not employed in their day jobs within five miles of the station. What I find amusing is that that station has been run in that way for the past 50 years without any incident whatsoever, giving an excellent service and being held in high regard.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/3">That concern, however, reflects the way in which fire officers&mdash;particularly the more ambitious ones&mdash;are now thinking. It is, I am afraid, in line with the Government's thinking that we are going to see lots of the smaller stations close, and I believe honestly and sincerely that the Bill is here to ensure that that will be effected with the minimum of difficulty.</p>
	<p pid=".87.0/4">With regard to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> was saying earlier, closing a fire station is almost as bad for a community as closing a village school. People feel that it is their facility; it is run by and for local people, and the people who run it do a thankless job. I would like to see an increase in recruitment in the retained sector to secure the future. I am quite worried about this, having spoken to senior fire officers. It might well be that the senior fire officers in north Wales are thinking along these lines because they believe that there will be a shortfall in the funding for the pay settlement, and that when that funding is applied to the retained sector, the wage bill will, by definition, shoot up. They would therefore end up having to get rid of considerable numbers in the retained sector.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase>, the Deputy Prime Minister gave an absolute assurance that no retained firefighters would lose their jobs as a result of any settlement?</p>

	<p pid=".88.0/1">But if the money is not there to pay the retained firefighters, what is the obvious conclusion? The Government will not say that it was their fault; it will be the fault of the fire authority, of course, for not using the money wisely. The fire authority would then be forced to make cuts in due course. I hope that I am wrong, and if the Minister gets up in a few minutes' time to tell me that that is the case, I shall be pleased to hear it. That would cheer me up no end, along with my constituents and several other people in north Wales. I say that, having made those few sincerely held remarks.</p>
	<p pid=".88.0/2">The amendments are very useful, and we have had a useful debate on them. Reference was made earlier to the Deputy Prime Minister saying that fire stations were public property. Yes, they are public property, and they are very close to the hearts of people in rural communities. They provide a vital service, and the retained sector is extremely important in rural areas such as north Wales. I would like to see amendment No. 11 embellished by a reference to the need for consultation with Members of the National Assembly for Wales as well.</p>

	<p pid=".88.2/2">This has been a useful debate. I hope that the Minister will explain why the word &quot;disposal&quot; appears after the word &quot;use&quot;. I hope that he will also explain the distinction between the word &quot;disposal&quot; in clause 2(a) and the reference in clause 2(b) to the use by a fire authority of another fire authority's property or facilities. This tends to confirm what I am saying about the word &quot;disposal&quot;. Will he tell the House in no uncertain terms that it is not meant to denote a disposal of an interest in land, because that is what I and many other hon. Members are concerned about?</p>

	<p pid=".88.3/1">Sadly for Opposition Members and, indeed, for my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, the Government cannot accept these amendments. Some remove the Secretary of State's power to give directions to fire authorities about the use of property. Others would mean that directions could be made about the use of facilities but not about disposal. I will come some of the points raised on those issues in a moment. Two of the amendments would mean that the Secretary of State would be required to consult Members of Parliament and local authorities before making an order, and to lay before Parliament a report on those consultations.</p>
	<p pid=".88.3/2">Strike action undoubtedly poses a threat to public safety, so in the event of further strikes occurring, the Government need sufficient room for manoeuvre to direct fire authorities on how they should use their property and assets in a co-ordinated and concerted fashion, to the safest effect and to support any emergency fire cover provided by the armed forces. The Government also need the powers in the event that the modernisation of the fire service is obstructed, especially in the absence of any negotiated agreement, so that assets and property can be utilised in a sensible manner. There has been much misunderstanding&mdash;perhaps scaremongering in some quarters&mdash;and uninformed speculation about the use to which the powers may be put. Our preference is not to have to use them at all, either in response to a strike or as part of the modernisation process. Partnership is clearly the better way forward, but, given the history of the last 12 months in particular, we must safeguard and reserve the right to act.</p>
	<p pid=".88.3/3">Furthermore, any directions that the Secretary of State makes will be made to protect and enhance public safety. We do not have an agenda to do anything that would be contrary to that objective&mdash;far from it. Anything that we do will be driven by our motivation to protect citizens and enhance public safety. The provisions are certainly not part of some wider wild asset-stripping fire station closure plan being held secretly in a drawer somewhere in the Department, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" name="Matthew Green">the Member for Hayes and Harlington and the hon.

Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase>, as well as by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy, particularly in respect of whether the word referred to the selling of assets, or whether it simply meant the transfer of a piece of equipment from one fire authority to another in certain circumstances. We have a deliberately wide definition of the term because in these circumstances we need a piece of legislation that can cope with a wide variety of eventualities. I would not, therefore, wish to be too prescriptive or to rule out one particular component or another.</p>

	<p pid=".89.2/1">The Minister must be honest about this. &quot;Disposal&quot; in this context includes the transfer by sale of land, and it has to. He, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Local Government and the Regions have all said that the pay settlement on offer will have to be paid for by savings through modernisation. That means reducing the number of fire appliances, fire stations and firefighters. What else could yield the savings to pay for an above-inflation pay settlement?</p>

	<p pid=".89.3/1">There are all sorts of ways, highlighted in the Bain inquiry, of making savings in the fire service that involve neither selling off or reducing the facilities available for the protection of public safety nor creating redundancies. There are ways of making savings through good prudent management, as in any organisation. I believe that that is at the heart of the offer made by the employers and of the agreement that they seek to achieve in ensuring a rational distribution of resources based on risk. Where there are particular problems, they will be tackled, rather than having a one-size-fits-all approach to the allocation of assets and personnel.</p>

	<p pid=".90.0/1">I am sorry to keep pressing the Minister on this, and I do not want to be awkward. Clause 1(2)(b) makes provision for</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/2" class="indent">&quot;the use by a fire authority of property or facilities belonging to another fire authority&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".90.0/3">That is all well and good, and understood. Clause 1(2)(c) refers to payments being made accordingly. Those eventualities are covered in those two subsections. I return, however, to clause 1(2)(a) and ask the Minister whether he would please define in simple terms what is meant by the term &quot;disposal&quot;, if it is different from the definition that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> just gave.</p>

	<p pid=".90.1/1">I shall give the hon. Gentleman an example. Some fire authorities, particularly the more enlightened, have recognised that they can create efficiency by perhaps sharing a control room facility, whereby two authorities come together to establish a joint control room. While two existed previously, an office may have been disposed of to allow the creation of a single joint control room, which may be more capable and have better technology to deal with calls more rapidly. That will have involved, at some level, the disposal of an asset, but not necessarily to the disadvantage of residents in either fire authority area.</p>
	<p pid=".90.1/2">To answer the hon. Gentleman's point directly, of course &quot;disposal&quot; can mean either the sale of an asset or the transfer of an asset from one fire authority to another, but it does not necessarily mean in any way degrading the protection of public safety.</p>

	<p pid=".90.2/1">I am not alleging that for one moment, but the Minister has just confirmed the awful scenario to which I referred: the village station closing down and the town station looking after its own interest. The best example that the Government have given so far has confirmed my worst fears.</p>

	<p pid=".90.3/1">I am loth to use the phrase, &quot;Read my lips&quot;, but I repeat that we would use directions only to protect or enhance public safety. We do not intend to use directions for asset stripping, some sort of privatisation or a mass fire station closure programme. We want to ensure that the proper modernisation of the fire service&mdash;protecting public safety even more than it is already protected&mdash;can continue and can be implemented.</p>
	<p pid=".90.3/2">I hear what the hon. Gentleman said about rural fire stations and retained firefighters&mdash;it was a perfectly legitimate point for him or any Member with concerns about their constituency to raise. In many ways, the modernisation of the fire service involves enhancing protection, perhaps more for residential areas, because increasingly we are recognising the fact that the priority of saving lives has to come first.</p>
	<p pid=".90.3/3">People in many residential areas perhaps feel that they are too distant from fixed appliances or provision and that they could have an enhanced facility. Those discussions need to go on in fire authorities as they consider their risk management plans and implement them to improve public safety by focusing resources and reducing those risks that are perhaps too high at present.</p>
	<p pid=".90.3/4">The Bill's explanatory notes set out the circumstances in which the powers may be used&mdash;for example</p>
	<p pid=".90.3/5" class="indent">&quot;to provide joint control rooms, to direct that equipment be placed at the service of third parties, or to direct that that equipment be distributed on a risk assessment basis.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".90.3/6">We are all encouraged by the fact that there has not been a strike since early February, but we must be prepared for all eventualities.</p>
	<p pid=".90.3/7">Should a strike occur, it is vital that those providing emergency cover have an automatic right of access to fire authority assets, including, for example, fire stations, appliances and aerial platforms should they be needed. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge raised that point when he referred to the remarks of the Deputy Prime Minister. Those are assets that the public have paid for so that lives and property can be protected. They may be needed strategically in the event of a strike.</p>

	<p pid=".91.0/1">Some authorities are considerably further down the modernisation route than others. Indeed, when a member of the Bain inquiry came to Shropshire, he said that the county has the most modernised fire brigade. That means that less saving is available to the authority to pay for the wage settlements through modernisation. The Government said that they would take that into account when they divide up the additional money, but since they are recovering that money at a later stage&mdash;it is, in effect, a tide-over loan&mdash;my concern is that these rules may be used to fund the pay settlement in Shropshire, which is already modernised, through the sale of assets.</p>

	<p pid=".91.1/1">All fire authorities have scope to improve and modernise. The hon. Gentleman says that his fire authority has modernised in a number of areas, but perhaps it could still engage in joint control room activity and so forth. There are a number of ways for all authorities to contribute.</p>
	<p pid=".91.1/2">The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge specifically asked whether the orders could be used to implement integrated risk management plans. Given that integrated risk management is part of the agreement on offer from the employers and which the FBU executive is recommending to its members, it is true that should that agreement not come to fruition and not be implemented, it would be possible to use orders to make such improvements and to implement a risk management approach.</p>
	<p pid=".91.1/3">The hon. Gentleman's specific point was about whether there would be consultation on the use of such orders. Indeed, the provisions on facilities and property allow for consultation on their use&mdash;appropriate consultation with those directly affected and those representing people who would be affected. In many ways, that is the right approach to take.</p>

	<p pid=".91.2/1">I drew the distinction between the use of those powers to implement an already agreed and approved integrated risk management plan in respect of which the consultation exercise would have been undertaken, and the use of powers to enforce modernisation&mdash;where for one reason or another, a satisfactory integrated risk management plan may not have been adopted. In that case, can the Minister confirm that the consultation procedure under subsection (4) mirrors that required by the circular on integrated risk management plans?

	<p pid=".92.0/1">The Bill will allow the Secretary of State to undertake a consultation exercise as he thinks fit because different circumstances can require different consultations. Should there be short notice of strike action, it would be inappropriate to engage in a protracted paper-based consultation. In the circumstances envisaged by the hon. Gentleman&mdash;an IRMP approach needs to be pursued locally, but there is obstruction for one reason or another&mdash;the Secretary of State would have greater scope to engage in more in-depth consultation. In the normal course of events, I envisage a consultation such as that which is normally undertaken when an IRMP is drawn up to be considered by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid=".92.0/2">Amendments Nos. 11 and 12 would require a certain form of consultation and a report to Parliament. In some circumstances, they could mean that the Secretary of State would be unable to take prompt or immediate action to secure access to the required fire authority assets to give those providing the emergency cover the tools that they would need in the event of a strike. The amendments are unnecessary because the Bill already requires the Secretary of State to consult representatives of those likely to be affected by his proposals. There is ample provision to ensure that there will be appropriate consultation before an order is made. As I have said on property and facilities, there must be consultation with those directly affected and those who represent such people. Orders on conditions of service have to go before the negotiating body for at least 21 days for its comment, as my right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and the Regions said earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".92.0/3">We must follow the principle that the consultation is appropriate, reasonable and proportionate to the circumstances. Let us not forget that the Secretary of State is required to act reasonably at all times. That responsibility is firmly accepted, but we must be prepared for and anticipate circumstances in which we may need to act swiftly if there is, in particular, an imminent threat to public safety.</p>
	<p pid=".92.0/4">I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington that, as I have said, it is highly probable that in the normal course of events the Secretary of State would wish to consult local Members of Parliament and local authorities&mdash;and, indeed, the local community. I do not think that members of that community should be excluded from a prescriptive list. Including specific lists of consultees may risk the omission of others with a genuine interest.</p>
	<p pid=".92.0/5">The Committee should resist the proposal for a report of consultations in Parliament to be laid before the making of an order. That could constitute an administrative obstacle that might inhibit swift action to protect public safety. If swift access to fire authority assets is needed owing to a risk to public safety, the preparation of a parliamentary report on a consultation exercise will not be a desirable prerequisite.

We have been reassured, for instance, that the disposal power is not linked to any mass programme of sales&mdash;that it will be used in extremis, when there is no agreement at local level following adequate consultation. In normal circumstances, devolved powers will remain at local level. We have also been reassured about the overall consultation, and about the examination of an overall report to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".93.0/3">The Government have moved to some extent, but I think that a message should be sent to Ministers about concerns that have been expressed by Members on both sides about the potential impact on communities if this develops into a large-scale disposal programme. The powers in the Bill are not suited to that. The discussion that we have had so far about the development of risk management has involved enhanced resources, and increased provision rather than cuts.</p>

	<p pid=".93.3/1">Amendment No. 1 deals with the third issue raised by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/847" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> on Second Reading. It is designed to give the Deputy Prime Minister the power, but not the obligation, to enforce his orders by introducing, through the disciplinary code, a strike ban, and if necessary to regulate membership of trade unions by fire brigade members. This may seem a slightly tortuous way of presenting the proposal, but the options were limited by the scope and architecture of the Bill, and I can assure the Committee, having taken advice, that this was the only way in which to test the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/2">I was about to say that I was delighted to see that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1052" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd)</phrase> had returned, but he has now left again. I am sure he will return. He asked whether we proposed the creation of criminal offences. He will note from the phrasing of the amendment that it specifically does not create such an offence; nor does it raise the spectre of sequestration of assets, as some suggested during earlier discussions. It does allow the creation of a disciplinary offence, similar to those created by the Police Acts&mdash;failure to obey a lawful order being a disciplinary offence in a police force. If this Secretary of State chose or needed to use the power, this would provide a mechanism for the imposition of a ban on industrial action when that was necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/3">I understand that the Home Secretary has proposed that prison officers should recover their legal right to strike, but should then enter into a negotiated no-strike agreement. The amendment would allow a similar type of strike ban in relation to fire brigades, but it would not be negotiated. Nothing in the Bill would be negotiated; it would all be imposed by the Secretary of State. The Deputy Prime Minister might call it an arbitrated strike ban, imposed by himself.</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/4">On Second Reading and subsequently, Members on both sides of the House have recognised the strength of the case that the Bill's fatal weakness as a means of imposing a settlement and ensuring that it works is its lack of teeth. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/840" name="Edward Davey">The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase>, who unfortunately cannot be with us today, acknowledged that as a defect in his proposals on Second Reading. More surprisingly, perhaps, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>&mdash;who is present&mdash;raised the question on Second Reading.</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/5">The hon. Gentleman put to the Deputy Prime Minister a scenario in which he had imposed a settlement and some or all fire brigade members simply refused to accept it, and went on strike. He asked what the Deputy Prime Minister would do at that point. The Deputy Prime Minister, I am afraid, replied</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/6" class="indent">&quot;That is the difficult question that we have to answer in this matter, and I give the best of my judgment... at the end of the day this is a free country where people make free decisions on whether they want to give their labour&mdash;that is why I am against the anti-strike legislation. But we all must make judgments, which is why I am giving the House my best judgment of how we can find agreement. The dispute affects this country's public safety, in respect of which all of us in the House have responsibilities.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-05-08.857"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 May 2003; Vol. 404, c. 857</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/7">In other words, he did not have a clue, and he did not answer the hon. Gentleman's question.</p>
	<p pid=".93.3/8">I am going to guess that the hon. Member for Islington, North will not support my proposal for the Secretary of State to introduce a no-strike provision. None the less, he has identified the fatal flaw in the Bill, although he will no doubt approach the solution from a rather different angle.</p>

	<p pid=".94.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to draw attention to that aspect. If he opposes the Bill for the same reasons as me, and if his solution is a no-strike law relating to firefighters, what will he do&mdash;or what will a putative Tory Government do&mdash;when the firefighters strike? Will he recruit them all to the Army, as President Reagan did when the air traffic controllers went on strike? Or will he send soldiers to the firefighters' homes to drag them out, place them in fire tenders, and say &quot;Go and put out fires&quot;? Or will he do nothing, apart from negotiating&mdash;which is really the only way in which to solve industrial problems?</p>

	<p pid=".95.0/1">The amendment would give the Deputy Prime Minister power to make regulations relating to disciplinary offences. It cannot be very specific, but we envisage the Secretary of State's being able, in appropriate circumstances, to make failure to obey a lawful order a disciplinary offence, just as it is in our police forces. That, in practice, would give the Secretary of State a weapon&mdash;albeit, perhaps, imperfect&mdash;in addition to those that the Bill would give him in its present incarnation, namely none at all.</p>
	<p pid=".95.0/2">I accept that this may not be a perfect solution, but we have deliberately eschewed criminal sanctions against firefighters who go on strike, and the sequestration of assets.</p>
	<p pid=".95.0/3">We do not believe that that is the appropriate way to proceed in the current circumstances. However, I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are talking about a Bill that is time-limited to two years; it is a short-term emergency provision. The Minister has made it absolutely clear that in terms of time, he expects it to dovetail with permanent legislation arising from his White Paper. I understand from what has been said before that whether or not the Government support no-strike provisions, the White Paper will explore that area and the possible relevance of a no-strike power.</p>

	<p pid=".95.1/1">Will the hon. Gentleman clarify two points? His amendment No. 1 refers to</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/2" class="indent">&quot;the power to make provision about conditions of service relating to&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".95.1/4" class="indent">membership of trade unions by fire brigade members&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".95.1/5">Does that mean that this provision could enable the Secretary of State to say that firefighters are not eligible for trade union membership? On the amendment and disciplinary offences, if the Secretary of State introduces disciplinary measures against an individual trade unionist for not abiding by an instruction and that trade unionist's colleagues come out on strike, what happens then?</p>

	<p pid=".95.2/1">To answer the second question first, those that did so, if the Secretary of State had so regulated, would be in breach of the disciplinary code, just as police officers who went out on strike action would be in breach of the police disciplinary code. We can ask the question: ultimately, what do we do with those who do not obey the regulations? They would be in breach of their contract and of the disciplinary code, and the fire authority would have an additional weapon at its disposal. On the hon. Gentleman's first question, the answer is clearly yes: the Secretary of State could use that power to prevent membership of a trade union by members of a fire brigade, in the same way that powers exist to prevent membership of a trade union by members of a police force.</p>

	<p pid=".96.5/1">The hon.

	<p pid=".96.6/1">We are dealing with a very specific case. We are dealing not with a theoretical problem but with an actual problem. The dispute has been running for a year, strikes have occurred and Ministers and the Deputy Prime Minister have confirmed that further strikes will put public safety and lives at risk. We do not face a similar situation in relation to any other services&mdash;there is no issue to be addressed. They ain't broke, so we don't need to fix them, but the fire service presents a real problem that needs to be addressed today. This is not intended to be the slippery slope. The fire service is right in the front line, and we are addressing the problem that we face today.</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/2">When the Deputy Prime Minister introduced this Bill, he said:</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/3" class="indent">&quot;Legislation is therefore necessary in the public interest and to protect . . . safety.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/4">But safety is protected by requiring the fire service to be there when it is needed, and the Bill as it stands gives the Secretary of State absolutely no power to ensure that that is so. The Deputy Prime Minister continued:</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/5" class="indent">&quot;My main point about anti-strike legislation . . . is that it would take many months for it to go through the House and be achieved.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/6">That is hardly a principled objection to anti-strike legislation, and it is also palpably not true. If the Government accepted this amendment tonight, they could include in the Bill provisions that would give it teeth and ensure that any settlement that the Deputy Prime Minister imposed could be effectively implemented.</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/7">Indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister spelled out the risks on Second Reading. He listed the reduction in troop numbers available, and he told the House that only 250 green goddesses and 9,000 troops would be available in a future dispute to cover the entire United Kingdom 24 hours a day, seven days a week. He concluded:</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/8" class="indent">&quot;If the FBU calls for further strikes, lives will be endangered and property put at risk.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-05-08.856"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 May 2003; Vol. 404, c. 856-59</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/9">In those circumstances, when the Government themselves have identified that further strikes will endanger life and put property at risk, surely the duty of a responsible Government is to ensure that strikes do not occur. Of course, a strike ban unilaterally imposed by the Secretary of State represents an erosion of rights&mdash;I would be the first to acknowledge that&mdash;but so does the rest of this Bill, through the imposition of pay settlements and terms and conditions of work. That is why we have argued&mdash;successfully&mdash;for a time limit on this measure. But with no power to impose a strike ban, the entire Bill becomes an unenforceable nonsense.</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/10">Back-Bench Labour Members know very well that although a settlement that the Secretary of State purported to impose against the will of the body of fire brigade employees might stick in Shropshire and Surrey, it stands not a chance of sticking in Essex, Merseyside and Clydeside. The Secretary of State needs to have a way of making the powers that he has under this Bill stick. We believe that in the longer term, just as firefighters are entitled to fair pay that reflects the indispensable and much enhanced role that they play in our society, so the public are entitled to be free of the threat to their safety, and the military are entitled to be free of the intolerable burden that fire strikes impose on them.</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/11">We expect that the White Paper that the Government are promising to publish will consider the mechanisms for setting pay and conditions for the fire service independently. The point was made earlier that if people's rights to take industrial action are restricted, a fair and independent mechanism for setting pay must be in place. I acknowledge that that is not available under the Bill, because the Secretary of State will set pay unilaterally. In the longer term, when consideration of the Bill comes to an end and we are left with permanent legislation arising from the White Paper, two key principles must go hand in hand: the unique contribution of firefighters must be recognised, likewise the unacceptability of using public safety as a pawn in industrial disputes. Strikes therefore cannot be permitted as part of such a dispute.</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/12">For now, the focus is on the Bill. If it is to work as an effective, short-term, time-limited measure that will resolve the current dispute, relieve the unacceptable impact on our military preparedness and ensure public safety, it must include a power to make anti-strike provisions: otherwise, it will not succeed. It does not mean that the Deputy Prime Minister has to use the power, but it must be available to him. A settlement imposed by the Deputy Prime Minister will simply be ignored if it does not have any teeth.</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/13">The Government have consistently refused to tell us how they will deal with such a situation where a settlement is imposed and ignored, but have made it clear that they will not provide and finance military cover to fire authorities that face industrial action. The Minister for Local Government and the Regions said on Second Reading:</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/14" class="indent">&quot;The public has every right to a fully functioning fire service. We are therefore seeking the powers in the Bill so that we can draw a line under the dispute&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-05-08.918"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 May 2003; Vol. 404, c. 918</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/15">The first sentence is right, but the second sentence is simply a non-sequitur. Drawing a line under the dispute will not, without no-strike powers, ensure that the public secure a fully functioning fire service. The Minister has failed to deal with the question of enforcing a settlement, which, to be blunt, is likely to inflame the mood in the more militant areas. He acknowledged that further strike action would inevitably create a greater risk to public safety.</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/16">I noticed that the Minister carefully avoided&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> That must be the Deputy Prime Minister on the phone now, telling the Minister what to say. The Minister carefully avoided endorsing the Deputy Prime Minister's position against no-strike provisions and promised that the White Paper would set out the Government's intentions in that respect. However, the Minister also referred to the Attorney-General's continuing involvement in the process. The Attorney-General already has powers, but Ministers have insisted throughout the dispute that he cannot be prevailed upon to use them.</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/17">If I were a conspiracy theorist&mdash;other Members in the Chamber are more likely candidates&mdash;I might just wonder whether the collective judgment of Ministers is that dramatically reducing the number of troops and the number of appliances available for future disputes, and drawing attention&mdash;as both the Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have done&mdash;to the increased risks that a strike would entail, are a means of forcing the Attorney-General to apply for an injunction because of the commensurate risks to public safety. The Government could then secure the no-strike position without having to go through the internal Labour party conflict that supporting such a provision in the Bill might produce. If that is their game, surely it is better to be up-front about it and build the power into the Bill as part of a package to impose a settlement and make it stick. A responsible Government with the safety of the public at the forefront of their mind should take the opportunity to make such a power available and ensure that the Bill is workable.</p>
	<p pid=".96.6/18">We can support the Bill only if it is a time-limited, effective measure that will genuinely bring the dispute to a conclusion and enforce a settlement that the Secretary of State imposes. If the Government will not assume powers to enable them to enforce such an imposed settlement, the Bill will have been a waste of Parliament's time. It will not achieve the Government's stated objectives. I urge the Minister to put the needs of public safety ahead of considerations about internal Labour party or labour movement politics and accept amendment No. 1. At the very least, the Government should give a commitment to produce something similar to that amendment, so that the Bill has real teeth and to ensure that the powers assumed by the Secretary of State can be deployed as part of a negotiating process and made to work to bring the dispute to an end and restore public safety to its former level.</p>

However, the Pinochet of Runnymede and Weybridge has excited me in respect of his vision for the future of industrial relations in this country.

	<p pid=".99.2/1">And then what would happen? What would the next sanction be? It must be a free ticket to Anfield. Once we have legislation that bans human basic human rights, it must be taken to the ultimate conclusion&mdash;as with the Shrewsbury pickets&mdash;of locking people up. Amendment No. 1 is farcical. I always thought that the organisation Conservative Trade Unionists was a contradiction in terms.</p>
	<p pid=".99.2/2">I just hope that trade unionists have witnessed this debate. The 9 million members of the TUC will now know that if they go on strike under a future Conservative Government, if ever elected, that Government could define their industry as an essential service. The members would then not only lose their right to a negotiated settlement, but their right to strike and, eventually, to trade union membership.</p>
	<p pid=".99.2/3">What is an essential service? Is it the ambulance service? We had an ambulance service dispute a short time ago. Is it local government? We had a social services dispute last year. Is it transport? Some American states are seeking to ban strike action in the shipping industry and control who may work in the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".99.2/4">We have had a revelation tonight of what a Conservative Government would mean for trade unions. I sometimes have a few problems with new Labour, but this debate has reassured me about why it is important to maintain Labour in power. It is clear that fundamental human rights would disappear if a Conservative Government were ever elected again.</p>
	<p pid=".99.2/5">Amendment No. 14 seeks to delete from the definition of conditions of service the words</p>
	<p pid=".99.2/6" class="indent">&quot;hours of duty or leave&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".99.2/7">The present dispute concerns pay and allowances, so I can understand why the Government wish to take a power to impose a settlement on pay and allowances, although I do not agree with that. However, I do not understand why the Government wish to impose conditions for hours of duty or leave. I thought that that issue was to be a subject for local negotiation. It is best left to negotiation at the local level, as the Minister said this evening about the introduction of new shift patterns. Local negotiations can ensure that shift patterns are family-friendly at the specific level of individual fire stations. Why is it thought right to give the Secretary of State the power to impose conditions for hours of duty or leave at the local level? Why do the Government want to extend the power beyond pay and allowances, which is what the dispute is about?</p>

	<p pid=".100.0/1">I thought that the Conservatives had so far lived up to their latest more cuddly incarnation and their attempts to be the middle-of-the-road party. The way in which they dealt with the first few groups of amendments could certainly have fooled people into thinking that. However, on amendment No.1, the ugly face of Conservatism has re-emerged. People are right to be concerned about what will happen if parties to the dispute refuse to accept the settlement imposed under the Bill. If the Conservative amendment had stopped at disciplinary offences, we could have understood their logic&mdash;although we would not have supported it. However, the Conservatives have gone one step further. They want to include membership of trade unions. This is GCHQ all over again.</p>

	<p pid=".100.1/1">Does not the hon. Gentleman accept that the amendment is based on the current practice with police regulations? Members of police forces are not allowed to belong to a police force trade union&mdash;although, bizarrely, they can retain membership of a union that is irrelevant to their police service. Officers cannot belong to a police trade union, and it is a disciplinary offence to fail to obey a lawful order. I put it to the hon. Gentleman that what our constituents care about is the preservation of public safety and security. It is much to their credit that fire brigades members play as important a role as the police in protecting us against the threats that we face every day in our society.</p>

	<p pid=".100.2/1">Ambulance workers do the same, as do workers in NHS accident and emergency departments and, to some extent, the people who work in our power stations. The logic of the amendment is that if&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;there were to be another Conservative Government, strikes would be banned every time there was industrial action in any sector that could be said to affect public safety. Moreover, the workers in those sectors would be banned from belonging to trade unions. The amendment is more than draconian&mdash;</p>

None of us wants to get to the stage that the hon. Gentleman has described, but the problem with the amendment is that it sends a message to fire brigade members that a future Conservative Government would impose a pay settlement and sack anyone who did not like it. Then there would be no fire service, and we would have to start all over again. We would have to recruit brand-new people to the service, and the Army would have to cover the entire country during that period.</p>

	<p pid=".101.4/1">I am following the hon. Gentleman's speech with interest. Will he confirm that Shropshire would not be a strike-free zone? I hope that it would not. However, is not the logic of the argument for the amendment that members of a union would be dismissed from their place of work and only allowed back if they signed some sort of loyalty oath, to the effect that they would not take part in industrial action or join a trade union? That is what has happened in other countries with oppressive Governments who operate on principles that are totally anti-trade union&mdash;principles that the modern Conservative party seems to want to adopt.</p>

	<p pid=".101.5/1">The hon. Gentleman may know more about other countries' arrangements. He might be disappointed to learn that FBU members in Shropshire continued to go on strike only because they felt that they owed it to fellow union members in other parts of the country. They wanted to accept the settlements, and that has been the feeling in Shropshire for some time. I therefore do not think that there exists the strength of feeling that the hon.

	<p pid=".102.4/1">Thank you for calling me, Sir Alan. I shall be brief.</p>
	<p pid=".102.4/2">The Bill has at least one benefit; it has drawn out what the industrial relations policy of the Opposition actually is. They may have been in listening mode for the past year, but I do not know which trade unions they have been listening to; the ones that I meet and consult would be horrified at the proposals in the amendment. Although we are referring to a particular dispute in a specific service, the danger is that such ideas might become more generally applicable. As the Opposition are in listening mode, I hope that they will listen to some trade unionists rather than act as they have done so far.</p>

	<p pid=".102.5/1">I listen generally to my constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".102.5/2">What the hon. Gentleman said of the amendment is equally applicable to the Bill. Is he really alarmed that the Government are about to embark on a path where they could use similar legislation, with powers for the Secretary of State to impose settlements across all essential services such as transport and utilities? Of course he is not. This is a specific dispute; it is a specific problem in a unique emergency service. It is disingenuous of Labour Members to try to tell us what our policy is when we have made it clear that this is a special circumstance and the policy would apply only to the fire service.</p>

	<p pid=".103.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman; he has almost taken the words out of my mouth. I was about to say that, much as I welcome the fact that we have managed to tease out the thoughts of the official Opposition, the proposals draw out even more clearly the reason why some of us are bitterly opposed to the measure. It would be a slippery slope&mdash;this is a classic case. The Bill would allow any Government, although not of a hue that I would ever support, to use this dispute as a precedent. They could say that as these circumstances had been dealt with in that way, they could do the same thing in the next case and in the one after that. The ratchet would keep being tightened.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/2">There is another notion with which I am genuinely trying to struggle: when a decision had been arrived at democratically by members of a trade union through a free ballot and been acted on through some form of industrial action, although not necessarily strike action, sanctions would be taken against individuals. In all the often ill-thought-out industrial relations legislation that has been passed in this place, the notion has always been that the collective, not the individual, is attacked.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/3">The individual's human rights&mdash;and dare I say that labour rights are a form of human rights?&mdash;are sacrosanct. However, the Opposition's proposals mean that sanctions against a strike or whatever action is taken involve attacking individuals and their rights.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/4">We all know that it is easy to talk about taking disciplinary action, which all sounds meek and mild. However, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" name="Matthew Green">the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green)</phrase> pointed out, disciplinary action can involve sacking people. That is not a million miles from what the official Opposition appear to want. It involves attacking a trade union by taking action against individuals, and that is a totally reprehensible change in our culture of dealing with the way in which people&mdash;whether it is the Government, the employer or the work force as represented by their trade union taking the lead&mdash;behave in industrial disputes. It is a deplorable line to tread with hobnailed boots.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/5">I have a final observation. If anyone thinks that there is a close parallel between the fire service and the police, they should think again. There are great differences between them. However, I always smile when people talk about the Police Federation as though it is not a trade union. Whenever a Government have acted directly against the views of the Police Federation, I doubt that they have ever managed to get changes introduced. In the past pay and conditions debacle, the Police Federation clearly came out against the settlement and, lo and behold, the Government completely rethought their policy. In a sense, one could say that that is good industrial relations. The collective worked and individuals did not need to be put into a position in which they were disciplined. However, if one ever took disciplinary action against a policeman or woman because they were carrying out the democratically arrived at will of the Police Federation, the results would be very interesting.</p>
	<p pid=".103.0/6">Anyone who naively thinks that the Opposition proposal is a good one does not know much about industrial relations. I urge not just the official Opposition but the Government to think again about the route that they are taking, because it is fraught with problems.</p>

	<p pid=".104.0/1">I do not know whether the amendment was tabled to unite Labour Members, but at a time when we are somewhat divided about the Government's Bill, it has done precisely that.</p>
	<p pid=".104.0/2">To say the least, I have a number of reservations about the way in which the current dispute has been conducted by the union, and I have made that clear. However, I shall not go into that point now. I am very much opposed to the Conservatives' amendment. They say that the nature of the work undertaken by firefighters means that, like the police, they should not be allowed to take strike action. The Opposition are using the police as an example to be followed by the firefighters. However, if a Conservative Government were to take such action, I can imagine that those involved in other essential or emergency work would be told that the police and the firefighters are banned from taking strike action, so why should the same rule not apply to other groups of workers? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> shakes his head, but I am concerned about the escalation of the argument.</p>
	<p pid=".104.0/3">We know why the police are not permitted to take strike action, but my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> was right to point out the effectiveness of the trade union&mdash;the Police Federation&mdash;that represents the police.</p>
	<p pid=".104.0/4">In a democracy, the fact that the police cannot take industrial action, for reasons that most of us understand, should not be an excuse to deny other groups of workers the right to take action if they so wish. Obviously, I would rather that firefighters did not take strike action, but I accept that they have the right to do so if a majority vote is secured in a ballot.</p>
	<p pid=".104.0/5">I was in the House on <phrase class="date" code="1984-01-25">25 January 1984</phrase> when the then Government announced a ban on GCHQ employees taking any form of strike action. My hon. Friends and I protested and introduced ten-minute Bills about that year after year, especially on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-25">25 January</phrase>. The Government elected in 1997 reversed that ban and we all agree that they were right to do so, although I do not know what a Tory Government would do in the future. I am convinced that if we live in a democracy, which we do, the right of employees to take industrial action should not be taken away, certainly not in peacetime.</p>
	<p pid=".104.0/6">I conclude by asking a question. Does the amendment represent official Conservative party policy? Will the Conservative party give a clear commitment at the next general election that if it is elected, firefighters will not be able to take strike action? If the party adopts such a policy, it should be made absolutely clear when the electorate makes up its mind. The issue is important and everyone in a democracy should be aware of it. I look forward to hearing what the Conservative party says when the election comes.</p>

	<p pid=".104.1/1">We have had an illuminating debate that has shown clearly the division among the parties in the House. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> and his party will deeply regret the unattractive face of anti-trade union and authoritarian Conservatism that lies behind the amendment.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/2">The hon. Gentleman said that Conservative Members had three main proposals. The first was a sunset clause, which we agreed to. The second proposal was a provision for secret ballots. We said that there was a case for secret ballots but that the mechanism proposed was neither workable nor appropriate, although we did not disagree with him in principle. However, the hon. Gentleman's third proposal is an anti-trade union provision with which we profoundly disagree.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/3">It is essential to adopt a measured approach to solve what has been one of this country's most difficult industrial disputes in recent years, which is what the Government are trying to do. We do not pretend that we are taking an easy route or that it is not fraught with difficulties. Our response is measured and serious, and balances proper concern for public safety, which remains our overriding priority, with respect for people's rights to organise in trade unions and advance their interests in a democratic society. Our proposals are designed to help to secure a solution, whereas the Conservative party's proposals seem to be designed to create a more bitter and extensive industrial conflict and to provoke a serious breakdown in relations with the trade union movement in this country. I cannot believe that the Conservative party, on reflection, will want to continue to advocate the policies that we heard tonight. I also hope that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge will realise on reflection that his conspiracy theory about the Government and the Attorney-General is deeply unworthy and of no substance whatsoever. I hope that he will agree, on reflection, that the comment should be withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/4">The central issue is the right to strike. I remind the House that there is no statutory right to strike in the United Kingdom. On the one hand, there is no practical way to prevent people from withdrawing their labour or to force them to work but, on the other, people who do not work normally will usually be in breach of contract. The de facto right to strike is given by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. It provides statutory immunity for striking workers and their trade unions so that they are protected from legal action on breaches of contract, provided that the industrial action is in response to a trade dispute and subject to proper balloting and notification procedures. In addition, the ability to strike is an important part of the freedom to associate under article 11 of the European convention on human rights. That is also germane to the debate although the Conservative party appears to have little or no regard for such conventions.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/5">In the Government's view, employees' ability to take lawful strike action should be withdrawn only in exceptional circumstances. We have no plans do so at present in relation to firefighters. We have made it clear that the issue will be covered in the White Paper. Indeed, it was raised by the Bain review, which suggested that it be considered further. We will do that, but as the Deputy Prime Minister made clear on Second Reading our judgment is not in favour of removing that right from firefighters. I accept that it is a matter of judgment whether firefighters, like the police, perform a role that possibly justifies interfering with the basic right of any working person to withdraw their labour. Our judgment remains that they do not.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/6">The fire service does, of course, have similarities with the police service, but there are also significant differences in the light of which we believe that anti-strike legislation would not be appropriate. There is a fundamental difference in the role of the police and fire services. The police, as enforcers of national law, must be independent and must act on behalf of us all. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated in the course of the past year that the armed forces have been able to provide effective alternative fire cover to a high standard. In normal circumstances, there is no such alternative to the police service.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/7">In addition, the House will remember that before this last year there had been more than 25 years without a national strike in the fire service. There had been local disagreements and local industrial action, but nothing that led to proposals of this nature being introduced by any party on either side of the House. We should not make the mistake of confusing the current situation for the norm. We must certainly not allow the dispute to continue and we need a strategy for the future that will minimise the chances of it happening again. I have already described how the Bill and our forthcoming White Paper will do that in their different but complementary ways. Achieving a fire service for the future will depend on committed and motivated staff at all levels. Reducing the rights of staff is, in my view, neither helpful nor likely to achieve a productive outcome.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/8">In all events, I do not think that the kind of powers that would be conferred by amendment No. 1 would be in any way appropriate. The hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge spent a great deal of time during our consideration of the Local Government Bill criticising the Government for giving too many powers to the Secretary of State. Yet he is proposing not only that the Secretary of State should have power to legislate about fundamental things such as trade union membership, but that he should also be able to change the disciplinary code to make strike action an offence solely by order rather than by primary legislation on which the House decides. I cannot understand the logic behind those proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/9">Amendment No. 14, tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, is designed to restrict the Secretary of State's power so that he could not fix or modify the hours of duty and leave of fire brigade members. The intended effect of that would be twofold. First, the Secretary of State would not be able to address firefighters' conditions of service as a whole. He would not, for example, be able to make changes to hours of duty or leave arrangements that might be welcomed by firefighters. There would inevitably be less scope to produce a package that could address the range of issues to which firefighters attach importance.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/10">Secondly, the amendment might make it more difficult to make progress with the modernisation of the service. A key question is how to match hours of work to the peaks of demand and risk. That will almost certainly require some change from the current patterns of work, which have remained pretty much the same for 25 years or more. That does not mean, as some have suggested, wholesale changes to shift patterns and working conditions. Our best judgment is that new flexible arrangements could be introduced under which a majority of firefighters would remain on their current shift patterns if they wanted to.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/11">There are likely to be other options, however, including different shift patterns and working hours, some of which will involve more family-friendly hours, which could be more attractive to some serving firefighters and potential new recruits. The precise changes needed will have to be considered locally and will emerge from the risk management plans on which fire authorities are working and on which they will consult. If we are driven to a position in which we have no option but to use the powers, we will need to be able to make the right changes that work with fire authorities' agreed plans.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/12">I hope that my hon. Friend recognises that there could be some downsides to his proposal and I have explained why I do not support the purpose of the amendment. Having said that, perhaps I should also tell him that I do not believe that it would have the effect that he wants to produce.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/13">The definition in clause 2(2) is not exhaustive: the phrase &quot;conditions of service&quot; includes the matters listed, but is not limited to them. If the matters listed were amended to remove any mention of hours of duty or leave, the phrase &quot;conditions of service&quot; would still have its natural meaning, and the so-called grey book, which contains firefighters' terms of service, makes it clear that that meaning includes hours of duty and leave. My hon. Friend's amendment would therefore not have the effect that he desires, and I ask him not to press it.</p>
	<p pid=".104.1/14">I hope that the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge will agree to withdraw his, frankly, unworthy and undesirable amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.107.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="107"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-30.htm#30603-30_spnew0">
	<p pid=".107.0/1">It is my turn now to accuse the Minister of synthetic anger. We have heard from Labour Members the most ridiculous extrapolations from a very specific provision relating to a very specific Bill. The Bill deals with the fire service. The Minister is himself taking powers to impose a settlement; we are trying to ensure that such a settlement can work and to make the Bill a piece of legislation that in the two-year interim period in which it will be in force will deliver the end to the current dispute and to strikes that the Minister says he wants.</p>
	<p pid=".107.0/2">It is interesting that the Minister has not ruled out an anti-strike provision. He has said that the White Paper will give consideration to it in the context of the new fire service legislation&mdash;the permanent Act. We believe that in any such situation, there must be an independent and fair mechanism for setting pay. The Minister says that it is a matter of judgment and that his judgment is that it would not be helpful. I respect that, but I am glad that he at least acknowledges that the matter is one that should be aired, that it will be in the White Paper, and that the House will have an opportunity to consider it again.</p>
	<p pid=".107.0/3">Our judgment is different. When the Government have already admitted that further strikes would endanger life and property but they are going to do nothing about it; when the Government are introducing legislation that gives the Secretary of State a power to impose a settlement but absolutely no power to make that settlement stick; when tens of thousands of troops are potentially to be tied down&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".107.0/4" class="italic">It being five and a half hours after the commencement of proceedings on the programme motion, The Chairman pursuant to Order [<phrase class="date" code="2003-05-08">8 May</phrase>] and Resolution [this day], put forthwith the Question already proposed from the Chair.</p>

	<p pid=".112.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid=".112.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">Today, we have had the opportunity to debate in detail the issues arising from the powers that we are seeking in the Bill. Like the events of the past year, these debates have illustrated how difficult it is to strike the right balance between the competing interests and points of view of the staff of fire brigades who want a fair level of pay for the difficult and dangerous job they do; the employers who have to manage fire brigades so they provide a good service to the public within budget; the public, who are entitled to expect protection from fires and other accidents; and the armed forces and the police, who have been diverted from their usual duties during the current dispute, often at significant personal and professional cost. But in the end, that balance must be struck. In the public interest, we cannot allow the dispute about pay in the fire service to continue indefinitely. A resolution must be found one way or another, and that is a responsibility that we as a Government must accept.</p>
	<p pid=".112.2/3">The Bill will provide us with the powers to draw a line under the current pay dispute and begin to set a new direction for the fire service. If the House agrees, it will enable the Secretary of State, in England and Wales only, to make orders to do two things. Under clause 1(1)(a), he will be able to set or modify the pay and conditions of fire brigade members. Under clause 1(1)(b), he will be able to give specific or general directions to fire authorities about the use or disposal of property or facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".112.2/4">The powers in the Bill extend to Northern Ireland, where they will be exercised by the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. For the time being, that means that they will be exercised under the direction of the Secretary of State, but as and when devolution is restored they will revert to Executive Ministers.</p>
	<p pid=".112.2/5">As a result of amendments made today, the powers in the Bill will have a limited life and will lapse two years after Royal Assent. Any orders already made will remain in force unless specifically revoked.</p>
	<p pid=".112.2/6">My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister said on Second Reading that he hoped he would not need to use the Bill. He believed that it was still possible to reach a negotiated settlement and that the time required for the Bill to become law would provide a further opportunity for that settlement to be reached. Hon. Members will be aware that, not long after he made that speech, the employers made a further offer to the FBU. So far as pay is concerned, the offer remains as before: 16 per cent. over two and a half years. The employers said that they could not increase that amount, which is generous in any case, but they have been able to take another look at the modernisation elements of the offer. Modernisation is still the bedrock of the deal, but the employers have clarified what they propose. That gives firefighters more assurances about some of the matters that concern them, especially changes to their duty systems and shift patterns. I believe that the employers have responded to much of the misunderstanding and misinformation that has surrounded the dispute. Firefighters can see that what is on offer is fair. It does mean change, but it does not mean reductions in safety or arbitrary changes to shifts for the sake of it. The FBU is taking soundings about the offer and will decide whether to accept it at a further recall conference on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".112.2/7">There are therefore grounds for hope that a negotiated deal is within reach, but our optimism about that prospect should be tempered by prudence. We have thought that agreement was near on previous occasions. I cannot help wondering what role the introduction of the Bill may have played in persuading the two parties to try once again to reach agreement. I am sorry to say, however, that even if the two sides are able to reach broad agreement we cannot be certain that that will be an end to it. The terms of the employers' offer mean that there would still have to be detailed negotiations over the next few months. It is therefore important that we enact the powers in the Bill so that we can intervene if any such negotiations break down. We therefore intend, with the agreement of the House, to press ahead with further consideration of the Bill in another place.</p>
	<p pid=".112.2/8">Today, we have considered a wide range of issues, from the right to strike, to rationalising fire stations, to the role of secret ballots. Those are all issues that it is right for us to debate. I urge hon. Members, however, to bear in mind that the Bill is only a temporary measure. Although we should still get it right, what may be right, reasonable and feasible as a short-term, stop-gap measure may not be what we would want for the longer term.</p>

	<p pid=".113.1/1">I am happy to say that I was not alive when income tax was introduced, but in my recollection William Pitt did not introduce a sunset clause. We have accepted a sunset clause, so my hon. Friend's concerns should not prove too serious.</p>

	<p pid=".113.2/1">Does the Minister accept that it would be wrong to use a temporary Bill of this nature to regionalise fire services and to take control away from local authorities or, indeed, to take control rooms away from local authorities such as my own?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.114.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1182" speakername="Nick Raynsford" colnum="114"  time="021:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-31.htm#30603-31_spnew4">
	<p pid=".114.0/1">We make no such proposal in the Bill. It is a temporary measure that is focused on two issues. First, it gives the Secretary of State the power, if necessary, in the absence of an agreed negotiated settlement to the dispute, to impose a settlement in those circumstances. As we have said, we do not want to do that. We hope that there will be a negotiated settlement, and there are good grounds for believing that there may be, but the Bill acts as a stop-gap in case that is not possible. Secondly, the Bill gives the Secretary of State the power to direct fire authorities on the use and disposal of assets and facilities, for the obvious reason that that enables us to protect the public interest in the event of further strike action where it is necessary to ensure that appropriate appliances are available. Those are the purposes of the Bill and it does not have the wider effects that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1291" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> suggests.</p>
	<p pid=".114.0/2">What might be right in the short term might not be what we would want for the longer term. We have to deal now with the very serious situation provoked by the failure to reach a settlement for more than a year. The Bill is directed at that; it does not attempt to deal with the need for a new long-term framework for the fire service. That means that we have to work within the current structure, accepting that it is flawed. For the future, however, we have the chance to set a new direction for the fire service through the forthcoming White Paper. That is where we will set out our thinking on the role of the service, on how it should be organised, and on getting the right relationship between central Government, the fire authorities and the fire service. We need to provide clearer leadership, and we will start with the publication of the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".114.0/3">Implementing our policies will require legislation, which we will seek at the earliest opportunity, so that we can put the fire service on a new footing that recognises properly the wide range of activities that it is already carrying out&mdash;a far wider range of services than those defined in the Fire Services Act 1947, which still provides the statutory basis for the service. Over the next few months, therefore, we expect to have a debate about what we say in the White Paper. After that, the House will have a full opportunity to consider in detail the necessary legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".114.0/4">That legislation will be the right vehicle for finding longer-term solutions to the problems that the service faces: solutions that are not overshadowed by a long drawn out industrial dispute, but that focus instead on the needs of our society in the early 21st century and on the challenges that we face in responding to those needs. Those challenges will require measures to reduce the number of fires and the number of deaths and injuries caused by fire, to improve community safety and the effectiveness of the fire service in preventing as well as responding to fires and other emergencies, and&mdash;last, but by no means least&mdash;to provide a rewarding and properly rewarded career for the men and women in our fire service who undertake the difficult and dangerous tasks on which we all depend. I commend the Bill to the House. 9.31 pm</p>

	<p pid=".115.0/1">The background to the Bill is the long dispute in the fire service, for which the Fire Brigades Union and the Government must share some responsibility. Notwithstanding the history of this matter, I believe that all hon. Members&mdash;whatever opinions they have expressed this evening&mdash;hope that there will be a settlement on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-12">12 June</phrase>. The Government have decided to press ahead with the Bill anyway, perhaps as a form of insurance, or perhaps as part of their negotiating tactics&mdash;something that the Minister effectively alluded to earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".115.0/2">The Conservatives look forward to the White Paper and to having an opportunity to discuss in a more leisurely way the long-term future of the fire service to ensure that it delivers the service that the people of this country need while providing the career structure and fair pay and conditions that firefighters delivering an incredibly important service to the community expect and deserve.</p>

	<p pid=".115.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the services provided by the fire service go beyond attending fires? Will he bear it in mind that, when there are serious accidents, the fire service is often called upon to relieve the suffering that occurs? I have in mind a recent serious incident in my constituency, in which a young man died as a result of a motor cycle accident. The road was covered with blood, yet there was no arrangement in place to ensure that it was hosed down. The blood was emerging through the sand covering the scene of the accident. Let us therefore take account of the wider involvement of members of the fire brigade.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.115.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="115"  time="021:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-32.htm#30603-32_spnew2">
	<p pid=".115.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is right; it is not called the fire and rescue service for nothing. As a Northern Ireland Member, he will know of the role that fire brigades play in protecting us against the effects of terrorism, which, sadly, we on the mainland also increasingly have to consider.</p>
	<p pid=".115.2/2">We have supported wholeheartedly the strategic objective of the Government and the employers to link pay to the reform of working practice, even if we have not always agreed with the Government's tactics. We have indicated to the Government our willingness to give a fair wind to a piece of emergency legislation designed to impose a settlement, ensure public safety, lift the burden from the military and pave the way for a longer-term and fairer arrangement that will ensure fair pay and conditions for firefighters while recognising the public's need for certainty in the protection that they expect from one of the key front-line emergency rescue services on which our safety and security increasingly depend.</p>
	<p pid=".115.2/3">Conservative Members made it clear at the outset on Second Reading that we required three changes to enable us to endorse the Bill as an effective, if draconian, emergency measure: first, it needed to be time-limited; secondly, there needed to be provision for proper canvassing of the views of all fire brigade employees before the Secretary of State's emergency powers were used; and, thirdly, there needed to be a power to invoke a no-strike provision to give the Bill teeth. The Bill introduced on Second Reading did not meet those criteria.</p>
	<p pid=".115.2/4">I am delighted that the Government have recognised the need for the Bill to be time-limited so that it is clearly seen as a response to the specific situation in which we find ourselves, but I am surprised by the resistance of the Minister for Local Government and the Regions to the idea of a ballot. I thought that he and the Deputy Prime Minister had indicated that they feel strongly that sense would have prevailed long ago if only all members could have been balloted and that a ballot is an essential step that should be taken. The public would find it difficult to accept the Secretary of State imposing a settlement because of a failure to reach agreement on a negotiated settlement when nobody had consulted, through a secret postal ballot, all the people being asked to accept that negotiated settlement about whether they were in favour of it. I am disappointed that the Government did not accept such a provision.</p>
	<p pid=".115.2/5">Of course, I am not surprised that the Government did not accept the proposal for a no-strike provision, although I am disappointed. I emphasise the fact that the no-strike provision had a specific target, just as the other powers have a specific target. The powers would have been permissive to the Secretary of State&mdash;they would not have required him to do anything. The Bill has a limited, two-year life, so Labour Members who got terribly excited about what a future Conservative Secretary of State might do with those powers need not have done so.</p>

	<p pid=".116.1/2">The Bill has a limited life in which to deal with the emergency period when we simply do not have the military resources to cope with a strike, and the Deputy Prime Minister himself has acknowledged that any such strike would place lives in danger. What the arrangements for the future should be is an open question. The Minister says that the White Paper is still coming soon, as it was when we last debated these matters a month ago. We recognise that, if there are any restrictions on the rights of fire brigade members to take industrial action, they will have to be compensated for in such circumstances by an independent and fair mechanism to determine pay.</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/3">Despite all the trumped up and fantastically exaggerated scenarios advanced by Labour Members and despite all the synthetic anger about what was imagined to be the thin end of a very large wedge driven into industrial relations, no one answered the key question: what is the point of this emergency Bill and the powers that the Secretary of State is taking if he has no sanction with which to enforce them? How can he ensure public safety when he has acknowledged that strikes will put lives at risk, but has taken no power to prevent them?</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/4">The Bill was a far from perfect vehicle, but it was a vehicle, as the opportunity existed to grasp the nettle, to put public safety first and turn it into an effective, short-term emergency measure that would restore public safety, relieve pressure on the military and settle the pay dispute. We could also have considered, in a less pressurised atmosphere, the future role of and arrangements for delivery of a modern fire and rescue service following the publication of the White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/5">The Government have accepted that the Bill should be time-limited, which is a great step forward, but it would be inappropriate to go down the route of imposed settlements&mdash;perhaps less generous than those previously on the table&mdash;without properly testing rank-and-file opinion through a secret ballot. It is pointless to introduce the powers that the Government are taking without also taking powers to enforce a settlement made under them.</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/6">Sadly, the Government have not been able to bring themselves to follow the inexorable logic of their own Bill, and match the power that they are giving themselves to impose a settlement with a power to enforce such a settlement and protect public safety and military preparedness by imposing, if necessary, a strike ban during the two-year life of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/7">Perhaps, given his background and history, it was optimistic of us to expect the Deputy Prime Minister to be able to break out of the mould; but that is what is required to make the Bill the effective emergency measure that we were prepared to support&mdash;a Bill that would do what the people would expect the Deputy Prime Minister to do, and put public safety, and the concerns that he himself has expressed in regard to public safety in the event of a further strike, ahead of any other consideration. I strongly believe that that is the primary concern of our constituents, and that they will see protection of public safety as the principal purpose for which they sent us here.</p>
	<p pid=".116.1/8">The Deputy Prime Minister has not grasped the nettle. We wish him well in achieving a settlement of the dispute, but he has failed the test that we set as a condition of our support for the additional powers. Therefore&mdash;I say this with some regret&mdash;we cannot support the Bill.</p>

	<p pid=".117.0/1">We have had a long, continuing debate during the current dispute, and we all hope that we are nearing the end of that dispute: we hope for a settlement next week.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/2">I suspect that the Bill may be used to try to threaten the union&mdash;that it will be used if there is no dispute. I do not think that firefighters can be threatened: I think that they will stand firm no matter what, and that they will only allow this dispute to be resolved if they feel that the resolution is just. If the Bill does not constitute a threat, it is intended for practical implementation; and I do not think that it stands up to the test of scrutiny in that context.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/3">Let me make a point that has already been made about the logic of the Bill. What will the Government do if, after they have sought to impose a settlement, the trade unionists still refuse to accept it? They will be drawn down the path represented by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">the hon. Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase>&mdash;that of banning strikes and banning trade union membership.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/4">I hope that there will be a settlement next week; but I also hope that the Bill, with its sunset clause, will not be needed for implementation purposes. I hope that we will allow the individual negotiations that will be necessary after next week's hoped-for resolution&mdash;negotiations on hours of work, shift patterns and the provision of local services&mdash;to take place locally, in the atmosphere that once prevailed in the fire service. There used to be local negotiation, and co-operation between union and employers.</p>
	<p pid=".117.0/5">In that event the Bill will not be required; but we must send a message to our own Government that we should never present such legislation again, we should never again try to undermine trade union rights, and&mdash;more important, we should never again get into a mess of this kind. The dispute could have been settled last July. We had a second opportunity to resolve it in November, and we failed to take it. Let us hope that we do not fail next week and that the Bill and its implementation will never be necessary again.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.118.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" speakername="Matthew Green" colnum="118"  time="021:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-33.htm#30603-33_spnew0">
	<p pid=".118.0/1">Until the introduction of the Bill, we supported the Government's strategy throughout the strike. We have now departed from that line, because we feel&mdash;it is a matter of judgment&mdash;that this is not the right way in which to resolve the dispute. Indeed, as has been said, the Bill's very existence may harden opposition to such resolution in some instances. As I have said, it is a matter of judgment; there is no hard-and-fast rule, and we realise that there is an element of guesswork in the assessment of the Bill's likely impact on the feelings of FBU members.</p>
	<p pid=".118.0/2">We hope to see the White Paper soon, although I fear that the word &quot;soon&quot; should be replaced by the word &quot;ma&ntilde;ana&quot;, because it is always being promised. It is always threatening to appear. I do not quite go to bed expecting to wake up and discover that it has been published, but we have been given the impression that it is about to appear. We would welcome its early publication because there are issues that need to be addressed, not the least of which is pensions. The financing of pensions is one of the biggest issues that the fire service faces, and we want a resolution to it.</p>
	<p pid=".118.0/3">We wanted amendments to three specific areas, the first of which was the sunset clause. We are glad that the Government accepted some movement in that regard. We would have preferred that the Bill fall sooner than after two years, but such a time limit is acceptable.</p>
	<p pid=".118.0/4">On the substantive issues of a secret ballot of members and the introduction by the Government of new pay proposals through independent arbitration, we felt that such measures would give the employers and the Fire Brigades Union the confidence that this was a way forward&mdash;a way not of creating greater difficulties, but of resolving the dispute. Unfortunately, the Government saw fit to reject both of those measures; had they accepted them, we might have shifted our position and supported the Bill. One glimmer of hope is the Government's resistance to the Conservatives' idea of banning membership of trade unions. The Conservatives will come to regret suggesting banning the membership of those who carry on a dispute for a long time.</p>
	<p pid=".118.0/5">Overall, the Bill sets a very dangerous precedent. A particular concern is the use that will be made of it not this time, but in future years by future Governments. It will be alluded to time and again. There will be those who will say, &quot;We had to do it then, so we must do it now,&quot; and such legislation will be applied to different disputes and different unions. I am afraid that it could be used repeatedly, and all because a Labour Government have seen fit to introduce this Bill. Our judgment remains that this Bill will not help to resolve the dispute. We accept the strategy that modernisation and pay must go hand in hand, but we believe that that can be delivered through other means. The way in which the Bill has been framed will not help to end the dispute, and we will continue to oppose it tonight.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.119.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="119"  time="021:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-33.htm#30603-33_spnew1">
	<p pid=".119.0/1">This is a very sad day for the Labour party and for this House. We are passing this legislation apparently as part of industrial negotiations, but in reality it threatens to take away a fundamental tenet of the British labour movement scene: the right freely to negotiate wages and conditions. The Government are not prepared to negotiate wages and conditions; instead, they are threatening to remove that power and impose a settlement. That has caused anger among ordinary firefighters&mdash;members of the Fire Brigades Union&mdash;and as a result, their attitude towards this House and this Government is serious. The House would do well to recall many of the comments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> during these debates, and to thank him for all the work that he has put into using this House to scrutinise Government legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".119.0/2">Like other hon. Members, I have met and talked to many firefighters in my constituency. They entered into a dispute knowing full well that the Government were reluctant, shall we say, to concede their wage demands. But they felt that as an emergency service&mdash;a service that everyone in this House relies on and is happy to praise when an emergency is sorted out in their constituencies&mdash;theirs had a good case and a good deal of public support, which it certainly does. Now, they are being told of the possibility of an imposed settlement, or that under that threat they will agree to some new proposal&mdash;all of which is to be paid for, apparently, by the sale of buildings and job losses. For us to have reached this situation is a very sad day indeed.</p>
	<p pid=".119.0/3">When the question is raised of what will be done next&mdash;I raised it in previous debates with the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;there is an obvious answer. If the Government seek to impose a settlement and the firefighters continue their strike action, something else will have to be done.</p>
	<p pid=".119.0/4">The logic is clear: the procedure is in line with Conservative proposals to take deeper and greater control of industrial problems that should be sorted out through collective bargaining. I hope that the Bill will not be passed, but I suspect that it will. It will certainly not gain my support. I am pleased only about the sunset clause, but it is a pity that it is such a long time away.</p>
	<p pid=".119.0/5">The House should represent ordinary people. The Labour party and the Labour Government should represent ordinary trade unionists, who have supported us throughout their lives. Such people are looking for support from our party and our Government. As I said, today is a truly sad occasion. I hope that a similar Bill will not be applied to other services. I have organised in the public sector and I know the pressures on ambulance drivers and people who work in accident and emergency departments. Such people love their job, but they feel a sense of moral blackmail all the time. We should treat emergency workers properly and with respect. We should recognise their rights under the International Labour Organisation and other human rights conventions and not pass legislation such as the Bill. We should respect the right of independent trade unions freely to negotiate and to reach a free and independent settlement.</p>

	<p pid=".120.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/819" name="Jeremy Corbyn">The hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> has expressed his opposition to the Bill. I agree with him, but I must say that my process of reasoning is not exactly the same. He knows that we agree quite often, which must distress us both. We agreed on Iraq, for example, but that is by the way, as we are dealing with the Fire Services Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".120.0/2">I do not believe that the Bill should secure a Third Reading and I am glad that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> has made that clear on behalf of the official Opposition. I disagree with the Bill for several reasons. First, it has not been properly debated. I greatly objected to the programme motion: I spoke and voted against it. Its effect was to shut out many amendments&mdash;and, indeed, speeches&mdash;which we otherwise could have debated. Many amendments have not been discussed, far less voted on, because of the programme motion. The other place will have to debate an imperfectly considered Bill, which is itself a reason for opposing Third Reading.</p>
	<p pid=".120.0/3">There are other more substantive reasons for opposing the Bill. We have to start by recognising that, notwithstanding its sunset clause, the Bill is draconian. It gives to the Secretary of State&mdash;the Deputy Prime Minister&mdash;a unilateral power to vary conditions of service. I made that point in debating the first group of amendments. It also empowers the Secretary of State to order the disposal of property and to impose financial imposts on third parties. The powers conferred on the Deputy Prime Minister are substantial, and the only check on them is the negative procedure. Again, we debated that point in respect of the first group of amendments. I do not believe that the negative procedure is a proper or sufficient check on the Secretary of State's powers&mdash;a good reason in itself for not supporting the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".120.0/4">I must ask why the Bill was ever introduced. The reason is that the Fire Brigades Union embarked on industrial action. If that union had not embarked on industrial action, we would never have had the Bill. The House should bear in mind the fact that a power is already on the statute book to allow the Attorney-General to go to the courts and obtain an injunction. If the Attorney-General had done his duty, he would have made an application to the High Court for an injunction and there would then have been no requirement to interfere with the contractual rights of the Fire Brigades Union. The Attorney-General would have done his stuff.</p>
	<p pid=".120.0/5">I believe that it is lamentable that the Attorney-General is not a Member of this House. If he were, we, the elected representatives, could have asked him why he was not going to exercise his discretion under statute.</p>
	<p pid=".120.0/6">Because he is a member of the other place, and not subject to proper scrutiny or debate, he is not subject to such inquiries. It is another example of the contempt that this Government&mdash;whom I detest&mdash;have for democracy. If they had any respect for democracy, they would have the senior adviser on legal matters to the Government in this House, but they choose not to do so. The Bill has been introduced solely because the Attorney-General would not do his duty, as prescribed by statute, and go to court. Had he done so, we would not have had the Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".120.0/7">The Bill allows the FBU to continue going on strike. The Bill provides no penalties for going on strike, but any hon. Member will recognise that those members of the FBU who go on strike are putting at risk the lives and property of their fellow citizens. What possible moral right is there to do that in a civilised society? It is profoundly wrong. If people do not understand that, the House should take the power in the Bill to say that it is wrong. I gave the House the opportunity, in new clauses 1, 2 and 3, to say that industrial action should not be permitted.</p>
	<p pid=".120.0/8">I never criticise the Chair, as you know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but those new clauses were not selected&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".121.3/1">What is in the Bill is a draconian power, given to the Deputy Prime Minister, to vary contracts of employment unilaterally, to dispose of property and to impose charges on third parties that are not properly constrained by democratic control. That is what is in the Bill, and it is a scandal. Furthermore, the result of the programme motion is that the House has not been able fully, adequately or properly to discuss, far less vote on, the contents of the Bill. We will send to the other place a Bill that may be otiose, but that gives to the Minister or his boss draconian powers. All of us know that those powers are not properly constrained. That is a disgrace, and that is what is in the Bill.</p>

	<p pid=".121.4/1">I cannot agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman, even though the conclusions we reach are similar. As various hon. Members have said, especially Labour Members, the Bill is not only the wrong Bill, but it comes at the most inopportune time. I cannot think of a worse occasion to introduce a Bill that could be construed as anti-union than on the eve of an important ballot, an important meeting, and an important moment in a dispute that everybody wants to see settled.</p>
	<p pid=".121.4/2">The great sadness felt by many Labour Members is that, although a settlement will be achieved, it will arouse resentment among firefighters. I have spoken to many firefighters, both before the dispute began and during it. They have told me about their hopes for the discussions that took place when the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1138" name="Mike O'Brien">the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, was the Home Office Minister with responsibility for the fire service. They wanted to move to a modernised service based on risk-based management. Those hopes have been ripped asunder by the dispute, and this Bill will only make matters worse.</p>
	<p pid=".121.4/3">That saddens me greatly. No Government&mdash;certainly no Labour Government&mdash;should intervene in an industrial dispute when there are far better ways to achieve a settlement. I do not like the term &quot;modernise&quot; very much, but we could make the service better and more efficient, and ensure that it could do the things that all hon. Members want.</p>
	<p pid=".121.4/4">However, the most important matter has been alluded to many times by Opposition Front-Bench Members, in connection with an amendment tabled in Committee. We have at least had the opportunity to see the Opposition's approach to these matters. That is one good thing to come out of the debate, but those of us who oppose the Bill feel that the Government have taken a risk by introducing it at this time. It does not take a stretch of the imagination to see that the Bill could be followed by a raft of anti-union legislation. That much has been made only too clear by Labour Members this evening.</p>
	<p pid=".121.4/5">We have managed to get a sunset clause inserted into the Bill. That is our only victory this evening, but it could be a pyrrhic victory. It affects only this Bill, at this time. If there is another public-sector dispute in the future, some other Government could introduce legislation that is timeless, rather than time limited. Such legislation would be designed to bring in anti-union controls that go against the nature of a state that believes in both human rights and labour rights.</p>
	<p pid=".121.4/6">That is why some Labour Members are dismayed by the Bill. We will vote accordingly this evening.</p>

	<p pid=".122.0/1">This short and insidious Bill introduces unwarranted interference in legitimate negotiating rights. I questioned the Minister earlier about the use of the word &quot;disposal&quot;, and his response confirms my view that the Bill will be a vehicle for wholesale cuts, especially in the smaller rural services.</p>
	<p pid=".122.0/2">I am very unhappy with the Bill, and I shall be very pleased to vote against it, as will my colleagues and many other hon. Members. The Bill is an insidious attempt to skew the process of negotiation. It is a gross interference with workers' rights. It is incredible that a Labour Government of any hue&mdash;new, old, or in any shape or form&mdash;should have introduced the Bill. I am utterly unconvinced by the Minister's explanation of the use of the word &quot;disposal&quot;. I am sure that there will be wholesale cuts in rural fire services.

	<p pid=".123.0/1">I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words in this debate. Because of the guillotine, or the programme motion, to use the modern name, we were unable to discuss the provisions relating to Northern Ireland, so I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the fire service in Northern Ireland. Through the years of terrorism, its members have suffered, and some have given their lives, serving the community. As a result of the lawlessness that still prevails in certain areas, firefighters, like other public servants, are attacked as they serve the community.</p>
	<p pid=".123.0/2">Reference has been made to sunset clauses. As someone who used to watch those old westerns where the hero rode off into the sunset, I wonder who will be riding off as the hero in this case. The fire brigades will still be around when we are gone.</p>

	<p pid=".128.2/1">I welcome the chance to have this Adjournment debate, which I requested because too many people are dying as a result of accidents on the A36 near Wellow. There is a touch of poignancy to the debate. The Minister is probably aware that a dreadful accident occurred on that stretch of road this very day. The multiple car incident appears to have caused at least one death, possibly two, and a number of serious injuries. I am sure that he will join me in expressing our condolences to the victims and their friends and families.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/2">The picture is bleak. The latest figures that I have show that, from June 1997 to May 2002, 71 personal injury accidents occurred along the length of the A36 from New road to Fighting Cocks farm. At the junction with Whinwhistle road alone there were 21 personal injury accidents in that five-year period. The EuroRAP survey confirmed that that stretch of road has a higher than average accident rate. That is damning enough, but by examining recent history it is clear that the road has a long and chequered past with a long accident record, yet sadly little appears to have been done about it. It might help the Minister if I outline some of that history.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/3">Most of my knowledge of the route is relatively recent, but a search of the web revealed a meeting of the road and development sub-committee of Hampshire county council on <phrase class="date" code="1988-12-12">12 December 1988</phrase>. The introduction of the report of that meeting referred to</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/4" class="indent">&quot;increasing anxiety being generated regarding road safety on Trunk Road A36 through West Wellow and Plaitford. Recent tragic fatalities of a schoolgirl and County Council road worker have intensified local concern.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/5">The same report stated that there had been 31 injury accidents in the preceding three years, of which four were fatal, nine involved serious injuries and 18 slight injuries. If we do a simple comparison with the latest five-year figures, it would appear that there has been an increase in the accident rate. The 1988 report provided further detail and suggested accident remedial works at two junctions&mdash;the junction with Whinwhistle road, where eight accidents had been identified, and the junction with Maury's lane. I shall return to the problems at Whinwhistle road. Although I do not have complete details, I am led to believe that today's fatal accident was near the Whinwhistle road junction.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/6">The report also highlighted problems with driver behaviour, HGVs, overtaking accidents, and the speed limit. Thankfully, some progress has been made to reduce the speed limit, but sadly not enough. In addition, the report mentioned the possibility of a Wellow bypass. There was a recommendation to</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/7" class="indent">&quot;immediately put in hand the procedures leading to the earliest implementation of a bypass for West Wellow&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/8">I do not want my case today to be sidetracked by the re-emergence of that issue, but I will put the question of a bypass into context later.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/9">I became more closely involved in the thorny issue of the A36 when a group of residents contacted me to discuss problems with the road surface, which were having an adverse affect on their quality of life and the structure of their homes, as well as problems with crossing the road and the possibility of providing a safe crossing. The road was resurfaced last year and there has been some improvement in the surface, but all the other issues remain. The more familiar I became with the stretch of road, the more I realised that something had to be done. It might help the Minister if I set the scene.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/10">The A36 is a wide single-carriageway trunk road. The village of Wellow is clustered along one side of the road; on the other side is scattered development backing on to the New Forest. A certain amount of development has taken place over the years, which has contributed to increased usage of the junctions placed at intervals along the A36. That, coupled with the year-on-year increase in car usage, makes it easy to see why the accident rate has increased over the years. A roundabout has been installed at one of the junctions, the speed limit has recently been reduced from 50 mph to 40 mph, and signage has been improved, but little else has been done. The problems with the road are exacerbated by its slightly undulating nature. Toward the Plaitford end of the village, large vehicles head into Wellow over the brow of the hill and have to slam on the brakes when they suddenly spot cars emerging from a pub car park or other side road. Put simply, it is a recipe for disaster.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/11">Let me concentrate for a moment on the problems in the vicinity of Whinwhistle road. That the problems were identified as long ago as 1988 is bad enough, but I recently learned the true extent of the procrastination on the issue. In November 1994, the Whinwhistle road feasibility study was carried out by Hampshire county council; that was rapidly followed by the 1994 Whinwhistle road supplementary report by Hampshire county council; and the May 1995 Whinwhistle road second supplementary report by Hampshire county council. All went quiet for a while, until in July 2001 we had the Whinwhistle road junction improvement study carried out by Atkins on behalf of the Highways Agency. The icing on the cake is a second study by Atkins: the A36 Plaitford to West Wellow speed and safety study, January 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/12">After nine years, five reports, and thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money&mdash;how many, I shudder to guess&mdash;there has been no action. That is not good enough, and the reason I asked for this debate is to urge the Minister to use whatever means he has at his disposal to ensure that something happens, and that it happens sooner rather than later.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/13">There is a small bureaucratic matter that needs to be dealt with first. When I first started to pursue the matter in October 2001, the county surveyor at Hampshire county council told me that he was in negotiation with the Highways Agency about the de-trunking of the road. He hoped that that would happen some time in 2002. I was led to believe that that would be a good thing, because it would be possible to identify a package of de-trunking improvements that could be achieved prior to the road being handed over to the county council.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/14">By December, the position had changed. In a letter dated December 2001, the county surveyor stated:</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/15" class="indent">&quot;there is now a little delay in the de-trunking process, largely on account of disagreements with authorities to the west, particularly I think Bath and North East Somerset.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/16" class="indent">As far as we are concerned we have resolved most of the maintenance issues but there are still outstanding matters concerning the safety schemes and speed, particularly in the vicinity of Whinwhistle junction.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/17">For the good news, he stated that</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/18" class="indent">&quot;There is a steering group&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/19">and that it had requested further reports, mainly on issues connected with Somerset, but impinging on some more strategic points, such as the potential effect of the approval of the Dibden bay planning application. He added:</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/20" class="indent">&quot;The latest advice from the Highways Agency is that they would not expect de-trunking to take place before April 2003.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/21">A letter from the Highways Agency confirmed that. It also informed me that Bath and North East Somerset council had requested a study commissioned by the Government office for the south-west before it would proceed with the de-trunking. The agency said that there was a possibility that the route could be divided into sections, and that that would be discussed at a later date. To the best of my knowledge, that never happened.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/22">I come to the part that I find difficult to comprehend. The future of this road in Hampshire and the safety of my constituents is governed by the Government office for the south-west, even though we are in the south-east. I would be grateful if the Minister explained why that is so. Given that all parties appeared keen to go ahead and de-trunk the A36 in my part of Hampshire, why were others allowed to throw a spanner in the works and delay the whole process?</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/23">In January 2002, I received a fax from an irate constituent, who pointed out that there had recently been three multiple car crashes in three weeks, one near School lane, one outside the Red Rover and one opposite Landford new road. In February 2002, I decided to ask a parliamentary question, to ascertain whether I could elicit more information. There was little more information available, but the answer confirmed that de-trunking negotiations were likely to be on hold until early 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/24">In early 2002, I held a site meeting with some local residents, representatives of the Highways Agency and officers of the county council. I suggested that we walk along a stretch of the A36. The suggestion was greeted with horror. The response was, &quot;No, you can't possibly do that.&quot; I should point out that there was a footpath and that we were not walking along the road itself. I was told that the road was far too dangerous to walk alongside it. There was some puzzlement when the residents burst out laughing at that stage. That was not on my behalf but because of the attitude of the officers. The residents felt that the reaction of the representatives of the Highways Agency and of the county council proved their point that the road was dangerous.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/25">After some negotiation and promises not to sue, conspicuity security jackets were produced and we walked along a stretch of the road. Even though traffic always slows when a number of strange looking people are seen wearing fluorescent yellow jackets, the problem of speeding heavy goods vehicles was all too evident.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/26">The residents were requesting a safe crossing point so that they could enjoy the pleasures of the New Forest. The little walk that we had could not have highlighted more the need for such a facility. However, a crossing in isolation in the wrong spot could be dangerous. Although I support the provision of a crossing, it must be part of a package of safety and traffic calming measures.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/27">A little later the road was closed for resurfacing. That aspect of the road was much improved, but I would like to refer to a fax that I received from the A36 Residents Association, which clearly highlights its frustration. The fax reads:</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/28" class="indent">&quot;The traffic goes even faster now and no new safety measures have been installed, on this road in a village in the New Forest which is known as death alley. After all the money spent on the rebuild we do not have speed camera warning signs, speed cameras or safety barriers. There are now warning signs by the Red Rover of HGVs bombing along over a blind brow of a hill, where car drivers are exiting the car park after legally consuming some alcohol.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/29" class="indent">There are now warnings or protection for people at the Shoe Inn&mdash;yes they can still come out of the pub door 18 inches from the road and get killed as happened last year. There is not one safe crossing for children going to school.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/30">There are many more points, but the fax goes on to claim that the improved road means that the traffic is travelling faster and the danger of a major incident is now greater. I am sure that the writer of that letter is not happy to have been proved correct.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/31">I was also deeply frustrated, as there seemed little that I could do until the de-trunking issue was sorted out and various studies were completed. In November, I received a letter to say that the report was being finalised but that it highlighted a speed problem at both ends of West Wellow. I am not quite sure how much the report cost, but in the words of John Cleese it does seem to be &quot;stating the bleeding obvious.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/32">I was also assured that Atkins was committed to improving road safety and was continuing to seek long-term solutions. I certainly hope that there is not long-term implementation.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/33">Sadly, despite the site meeting and despite numerous letters expressing interest, I have still not seen a copy of the report, despite a promise to let me do so. I understand that possibly it is still in draft form.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/34">So where do we go from here, and why have I involved the Minister? I am aware that there are some schemes in preparation, such as the extension of the 40 mph speed limit and a puffin crossing at Canada roundabout. Hampshire county council is keen to install speed cameras at Whinwhistle road junction. This is a welcome, if long overdue, move, and I hope that the Minister can assure me that the scheme can proceed without further delay.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/35">I am also aware that a scheme is being developed to provide a three-arm roundabout at Whinwhistle road. The observed accident rate at this junction is 7.4 recorded personal injury accidents a year, compared with the national average of 0.7. This scheme is due to take place in 2005&ndash;06, subject to the purchase of a suitable piece of land. I urge the Minister to use every means at his disposal to ensure that this happens sooner rather than later. Put simply, another two years is far too long.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/36">I ask the Minister to take a look at the area. Plans for a bypass were dropped in the mid-1990s, although for a number of years the idea had a great deal of support. But no one could agree on the most suitable route and the idea seemed to be quietly shelved. Unfortunately, the shelving of the scheme did not coincide with a review of the safety of the road. I am not calling for a resurrection of the bypass plan, but if the accident record on such a busy road continues to rise, we will have to think again.</p>
	<p pid=".128.2/37">In the short term, various steps need to be taken. As a matter of urgency, a decision must be made on the de-trunking. If we are still at the mercy of the Government office for the south-west, I urge the Minister to go ahead with a decision for that stretch of road now. There is no reason why Hampshire should be subject to the whims of another county and another Government region. If the decision is definitely to go ahead, negotiations must be a priority, and a package of safety measures should form part of a de-trunking agreement. Residents of Wellow and users of the A36 do not need yet another survey. They do not need further procrastination. They need the road to be made safer, and they need that to be done as soon as is humanly&mdash;nay, superhumanly&mdash;possible, if we are to avoid further fatalities such as we have suffered this very day.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2003-06-03.132.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" speakername="David Jamieson" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="132"  time="022:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030603/debtext/30603-36.htm#30603-36_spmin1">
	<p pid=".132.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/912" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> on securing the debate. I know that she has taken a special interest in road safety on the Wellow section of the A36 and has corresponded regularly with the Department and discussed at first hand a number of safety issues with the Highways Agency and Hampshire county council officials. I was deeply saddened to learn of the deaths and serious injuries on the A36 this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/2">Our thoughts tonight must be with the families who have lost their loved ones, and with those who are injured. My latest information is that two have been killed, two others have life-threatening injuries and there are others with other injuries. That makes the debate even more poignant, as the hon. Lady said, but I am truly sorry that we must conduct it against the backdrop of such an appalling tragedy as happened today.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/3">Although this country has a good road safety record compared with that of other countries, today's terrible tragedy shows that we cannot afford to be complacent. Such accidents make the Government all the more determined to improve our record. In the 10-year transport plan, we made a commitment to reduce deaths and serious injuries by 40 per cent. by 2010 compared with the average for 1994 to 1998, and there is also a 50 per cent. target for cutting child deaths and serious injuries. That is why we are putting the resources in place to improve safety. According to the latest information, we are well on the way to meeting those targets, but I am the first to accept that we have more to do and that there are still many roads on which the death rate is too high.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/4">I should explain the current status of the A36, as it sets the background for how the road is currently operated by the Highways Agency. In December 2000 the decision was taken to confirm the A36 Bath to Southampton trunk road as non-core. The Highways Agency is responsible for operating the road, maintaining it in good condition and carrying out any safety improvements to the route. Promotion of other improvements for reasons of environment, accessibility, economy and integration is the responsibility of local transport authorities. In the Wellow and Plaitford locality, Hampshire and Wiltshire county councils are the responsible authorities. Our aim is to transfer the responsibility for the road to the local transport authorities. If I have time, I shall say a little more about that later.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/5">I well understand the hon. Lady's concerns about safety on the A36 in her constituency. In the five-year period from June 1997 to May 2002 there have been 71 personal injury accidents. Three were fatal&mdash;that does not include today's appalling tragedy&mdash;nine were serious and 59 were slight. The accidents took place along the 4 km stretch of the A36 between New road in Plaitford and Fighting Cocks farm, to the south-west of West Wellow.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/6">Those figures are approximately 20 per cent. higher than the national average for roads of this type. I hope that what I say today will demonstrate that we have not been idle in assessing the problem and working up and implementing appropriate solutions.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/7">As the hon. Lady pointed out, there were plans for a bypass of West Wellow, but the proposal was withdrawn from the trunk road programme in 1994. Following that decision, a number of studies were commissioned along the route. They include a number of studies carried out by Hampshire county council, when it managed the road on behalf of the Highways Agency. The council looked at the 5.6 km length of the A36 between the Ower roundabout at the M27 and the Wiltshire-Hampshire border and, in particular, safety problems at the junction of the A36 and Whinwhistle road.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/8">In 1999, WS Atkins became the managing agent for the Highways Agency for the A36. WS Atkins has carried out studies in the locality, including the Whinwhistle road junction improvement study in July 2001. A range of improvement options were identified and appraised in that study and a roundabout was considered the best long-term solution for improving the junction. More recently, the A36 Plaitford to West Wellow speed and safety study was initiated, and it is now substantially complete, although comments from Hampshire county council are still awaited. The study recommendations include reduction of the speed limit from Wellow to New road in Plaitford and provision of a crossing at the Canada Common roundabout.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/9">Those studies have helped to inform the decisions on what works are required to tackle the problems identified. In the period between 2001 and 2003, the following works have been carried out in the Wellow area. In February 2002, the existing 40 mph speed limit area was extended by slightly less than 1.5 km to take in the junctions of School road and Whinwhistle road. Additional appropriate signing was erected and red surfacing was laid on the carriageway to emphasise the difficult nature of that section of the road. That work was carried out in recognition of the undulating nature of this section of the route and the resulting poor visibility, which, in combination with a number of private accesses and two junctions, contributed to the accident record. The majority of collisions at the Whinwhistle road junction were nose-to-tail shunt collisions, which suggests that speed on the A36 was a contributory factor. We have also moved the advance direction signs on the approaches to Whinwhistle road to give better warning of the junction ahead and a new direction sign has been erected opposite the junction.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/10">The Wellow village name signs have been re-erected on the approaches to the village. The signs reinforce the village ambiance to drivers approaching Wellow. A major maintenance scheme was undertaken in April 2002 to improve the road surface between Plaitford and the Canada Common roundabout. I am sure that the hon. Lady will remember those works, as the A36 was closed for about four weeks to allow them to be carried out. A new footway was also provided as part of the scheme between the Shoe inn and Purley way in Plaitford. The new footpath will improve safety for pedestrians in the area, especially for those who are leaving the pub in the evening, although I am sure that her constituents are totally sober when they do so.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/11">For 2003&ndash;04, we are planning to implement two schemes. The first will provide a puffin crossing at the eastern arm of the Canada Common roundabout to improve accessibility in that area of the village. The second will reduce the speed limit of 50 mph to 40 mph from Wellow through Plaitford to New road. The successful implementation of those schemes this year is subject to agreement with the police and local authorities, but I hope that there will be no unexpected delays. We shall also carry out a review of crossing points throughout Plaitford and West Wellow to identify locations where dropped kerbs and refuges can be provided to encourage safe movement through the villages. We also consider that those measures will help to change the character of the road to emphasise that people are crossing the road at those points and that drivers should therefore reduce their speeds.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/12">The Highways Agency is part of the Hampshire safety camera partnership and is working with its partners to provide two cameras at Whinwhistle road junction. We consider that cameras in that location will reduce speeds and therefore the numbers of nose-to-tail shunt collisions at the junction, which we believe are the main indicator of why the collisions are occurring. They mainly involve vehicles trying to turn right into Whinwhistle road and other vehicles approaching from behind or moving towards them too quickly.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/13">Other works planned for 2003 in the Wellow area include improvements to the bus stop at Whinwhistle road to provide raised kerbs, a new shelter and an extended footway. We will also add further 40 mph signs and surface treatment on the carriageway to further encourage drivers to reduce their speed.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/14">I have already referred to the Whinwhistle road junction improvement study of July 2001, which recommended a roundabout at Whinwhistle road. That will reduce traffic speeds and right-turn accidents and act as a gateway to the village from the south-east, thereby improving safety and accessibility in the area. We plan to carry out the scheme in the year 2005&ndash;06, but that is subject to the successful purchase of the land required and the availability of funding. Let me assure the hon. Lady that I am aware that the location is in a sensitive landscape area adjoining the New Forest, and that will be a major consideration in the design of the scheme. Today, however, in her mind and in the minds of her constituents, the main issue at that junction must be that of safety.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/15">As was mentioned earlier, in the longer term responsibility for the A36 will be transferred to the local transport authorities when the road is de-trunked. Therefore, safety on the A36 in the Plaitford and Wellow area will become matters for Hampshire and Wiltshire county councils. The decision to de-trunk the A36 was reaffirmed by the Secretary of State in December 2000. However, as the hon. Lady pointed out, the south-west regional assembly&mdash;the regional planning body for the south-west&mdash;continued to have outstanding concerns about aspects of de-trunking the road further north of this section of the A36. I undertake to look at those issues to determine whether the delays can be reduced. I take the hon. Lady's point when she asks why one region should be affected by the deliberations of another, although if the whole road is to be de-trunked I am sure that she appreciates that it has to be done as one. We shall consider whether any of the problems can be overcome to get the de-trunking moving.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/16">Following preliminary discussions with representatives from local transport authorities along the corridor, the Highways Agency and English Heritage, the Government office for the south-west commissioned a study entitled &quot;The Bristol/Bath to South Coast Study&quot; to supplement existing information derived from an earlier study. The study commenced in July 2002 and is likely to report in July 2003. Its overall aim is not to consider further whether the route should be de-trunked, but to recommend an appropriate strategy to manage the north-west to south-east axis transport corridor between Bristol and Bath and the south coast. In particular, it also aims to develop an integrated transport strategy to address the issues relating to through traffic in the corridor of the historic city of Bath. The findings of the study are to be reported to the south-west regional assembly to allow it to consider what changes it might wish to recommend to the south-west regional transport strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/17">I am grateful for the opportunity to explain our plans and to listen and respond to some of the concerns expressed by the hon. Lady about improving safety along the A36 in Wellow, both in the short and longer term. I hope that I have at least been able to demonstrate our commitment to safety on the road in general and in the Wellow area in particular. The terrible tragedy on this stretch of road this afternoon, in which people were killed and seriously injured, with all the misery that that causes, spurs us on in Government to redouble our efforts in progressing the improvements and thereby improving road safety in the area.</p>
