<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-07-21.1403.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence"  colnum="1403"  time="11:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050721/debtext/50721-06.htm#50721-06_spmin1">
	<p pid=".1403.2/1">Defence modernisation measures announced to Parliament and to Ministry of Defence staff today will improve the support given to our armed forces, release resources for the front line and for new capabilities, and make the best use of taxpayers' money. The future defence supply chain initiative will improve current service levels, enhance operational capability and put the armed forces in a better position to cope with &quot;surge&quot; logistics requirements, while also significantly reducing costs.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/2">The Ministry of Defence has selected an in-house option, which involved close consultation with the trade unions, to provide the best possible combination of effectiveness and cost in our defence supply chain. By updating processes, improving staff training, rationalising the distribution network and closing storage depots at Stafford by the end of 2007, Llangennech by mid-2008 and Longtown by mid-2009, we expect to make savings of over &pound;50 million a year by 2010 and over &pound;400 million during the next 10 years. The new organisation will require about 2,000 fewer civilian posts and about 50 fewer armed forces personnel. Those reductions will contribute to the wider MOD manpower reductions announced in the 2004 White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/3">A study of the future role of the defence munitions centre at Crombie in west Dunfermline has been completed, and the MOD has decided&mdash;subject to consultation with the national trade unions&mdash;to implement its recommendations. The study determined that the explosives storage capacity available at DMC Crombie was not required to meet the known and projected storage liability of its customers. In future, Crombie will concentrate on providing a loading-offloading function for Her Majesty's ships and royal fleet auxiliaries, together with berthing and other jetty operations.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/4">If the study's recommendations are implemented, there will be a reduction of 142 posts at DMC Crombie. It is expected that 67 posts will go in the first year, with the remaining 75 being phased out between 2006&ndash;07 and 2009&ndash;10. Implementation of the recommendations will have the potential to deliver savings of some &pound;18.1 million over 10 years. Subject to the conclusion of trade union consultation, the Army Base Repair Organisation's proposal to start phase 1 of a two-part rationalisation programme will also begin. Phase 1 addresses the immediate impact of the downturn in the ABRO defence revenue projections, but it will not diminish the range of capabilities that the organisation can currently deliver to the front line. As a result, ABRO will reduce its head count to approximately 2,150 posts by <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2006</phrase>, which includes the potential for up to 246 redundancies.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/5">The changes will realise annual manpower cost savings in the region of &pound;2.1 million in 2005&ndash;06, and &pound;8.3 million a year thereafter. As a direct consequence of an announcement made today by Rolls-Royce Defence Aerospace on the outcome of an open competition for future overhaul and component repair on RB199 engine modules, up to 50 jobs will also be lost at the Defence Aviation Repair Agency's engines business unit at Fleetlands in Gosport, Hampshire. The Ministry of Defence has agreed that DARA can now begin the formal 30-day consultation process with the trade unions.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/6">The 2003 defence White Paper recognised that the international situation is radically different from that of the cold war. As a consequence, the size and structure of our armed forces have been subject to a great many changes as our armed forces have adapted to meet the changed environment. The Ministry of Defence is also announcing two such changes today. The cold war radar station at RAF Saxa Vord on the Shetland island of Unst will be put on care and maintenance from April 2006, subject to consultation with the trade unions. That will mean that the station is effectively closed, but that the main operational part of the estate will continue to be maintained should it be required for future use. Further work will be undertaken to consider how much of the remainder of the station will be retained. Radar cover at the level required can be provided by other RAF radars augmented by those of the National Air Traffic Service. Placing the station on care and maintenance means that we can reinstate radar capability should the threat assessment change. Some 70 service personnel, 30 MOD civilians and 10 contractor staff will be affected by the proposal.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/7">I understand that that will be disappointing news for our staff, the island of Unst, which has a population of about 700, and the Shetland islands community. Naturally, I will be happy to work with the Scottish Executive, the local authority and hon. Members to consider any measures within the MOD remit that might help the local community adjust to the proposed change.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/8">As announced on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-21">21 July 2004</phrase>, ground based air defence will also be transferred to the Army, and the four RAF GBAD squadrons will be disbanded. I can now inform the House that 37 Squadron RAF Regiment based at RAF Wittering will disband by March 2006, that 16 Squadron, based at RAF Honington, will disband by March 2007 and that 15 Squadron and the RAF GBAD wing headquarters, which is also based at RAF Honington, and 26 Squadron based at RAF Waddington, will disband by March 2008. This phased programme will allow the Royal Regiment of Artillery to take over the pan-GBAD role. The RAF Regiment will now focus on its role protecting other elements of the armed forces particularly on deployment.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/9">As part of those changes, both 3 Squadron RAF Regiment, based at RAF Aldergrove&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Hon. Members should be patient, calm down and listen. As part of those changes, both 3 Squadron RAF Regiment, based at RAF Aldergrove and the Queen's Colour Squadron, based at RAF Uxbridge will be expanded by around 40 personnel each to enhance their operational capability to match that of the other four regular RAF Regiment field squadrons. That will improve the units' ability to deploy on operations and so enhance the operational flexibility of the RAF Regiment in its force protection role. Around 340 posts will be lost as a result of these changes, which form part of the 7,500 post reductions announced last July. I do not know where Opposition Members were when that was announced. I do not expect any redundancies additional to those announced in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-09">9 December 2004</phrase> to result from this announcement.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/10">As a consequence of the decision taken last July, the RAF has conducted an overall review of the structure and basing of the RAF Regiment. As a result of that work, 1 Squadron RAF Regiment will move from RAF St. Mawgan to RAF Honington by March 2007. In addition, 2625 (County of Cornwall) Squadron Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment, based alongside 1 Squadron at RAF St. Mawgan will be disbanded with effect from November 2006. That decision has been taken because Royal Auxiliary Air Force Regiment squadrons need to be based alongside regular units to maximise training opportunities and to give auxiliary personnel access to equipment held by the regular unit. With 1 Squadron's relocation, that would not be possible at St. Mawgan. Around 75 reservists will be affected. Members of 2625 Squadron will be offered the opportunity to continue their reservist activities with other parts of the armed forces reservist organisations or with an alternative RAF unit elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/11">We are doing everything possible to mitigate the impact on the people affected by these announcements. Our current plans envisage that the majority of reductions will be achieved through a combination of natural wastage and voluntary early release, but some compulsory redundancies may prove necessary. Staff and the trade unions are being kept fully informed of developments through meetings, briefings and formal consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/12">Finally&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Ah!&quot;] Hon. Members want the information, and they are getting it&mdash;why are they complaining? Finally, the Ministry of Defence is today announcing that the Royal Navy military afloat reach and sustainability&mdash;MARS&mdash;project has been granted approval to enter the assessment phase of the programme. That is good news for the Royal Navy and for the UK armed forces as a whole. MARS will be a cornerstone of our future worldwide operations, replacing many of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary's existing ships. It will support our new aircraft carriers and the rest of the fleet, as well as deployed amphibious, land and air forces close to the shore.</p>
	<p pid=".1403.2/13">Where any of these announcements impact on our people, we are doing everything possible to mitigate that impact. Our current plans envisage that the majority of civilian reductions will be achieved through a combination of natural wastage and voluntary early release but, as I said, some compulsory redundancies may prove necessary. There are no redundancies from armed forces staff, and the trade unions are being kept fully informed of developments through meetings, briefings and the formal consultation process.</p>

	<p pid=".1420.5/1">May I return to the forthcoming change whereby those with refugee status will no longer be given leave to remain in the country? I draw the Leader of the House's attention to early-day motion 569, which is in my name.</p>
	<p pid=".1420.5/2" class="italic">[That this House is concerned at the proposal in the Government's five year strategy for asylum and immigration to end the practice of granting indefinite leave to remain in the UK to people who are given refugee status and to replace this by up to five years' temporary leave to remain; believes that while this may not be legally incompatible with the provisions of the 1951 Geneva Convention, it is a retrograde step since it reverses the policy of granting indefinite leave introduced by the Government in 1998 without any evidence either that problems have arisen as a result of the current policy or that other countries which grant only temporary leave benefit as a result; is further concerned that the uncertain position this will put refugees in is totally inconsistent with other Government policies to assist the integration of refugees in the UK; further believes that this will inevitably lead to inhumane decisions when refugee families with children are threatened with removal after living in the UK for several years and establishing family life, leading in turn to further pressure on the immigration appeals system, and the caseload of honourable Members; and urges the Government to abandon this unnecessary change.]</p>
	<p pid=".1420.5/3">That significant policy change, which will affect a lot of people, was announced in a written statement on Tuesday but it will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-30">30 August</phrase>, so it will be impossible to discuss it in this House before it takes effect. Will the Leader of the House ensure that we discuss it as soon as we return from the recess? It is not satisfactory for such a change to be implemented in the middle of the recess.</p>

	<p pid=".1432.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I wish to take this opportunity to place on the record the warmest congratulations of&mdash;I hope&mdash;the whole House to Seb Coe, Keith Mills and the whole 2012 bid team, including Barbara Cassani, who chaired the bid for the first year, on the excellence of their campaign and the result of which we are all so very proud.</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/3">The decision made by the International Olympic Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July</phrase> can change this city and this country forever. It awarded London the greatest prize that sport can bestow. The moment that Jacques Rogge opened that envelope will be one that millions remember for the rest of their lives. An act that appeared to take an age took in fact only a few seconds. Then we heard the simplest of statements: that it was &quot;London&quot;, and that was sheer magic.</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/4">The very next day, however, that euphoria turned to agony. The events of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> will forever be linked to, and help to define the spirit of, the 2012 Olympics in London. Those two days showed the world, in different ways, the very best of London. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July</phrase>, in Singapore, the world saw&mdash;directly personified in the presence of those 30 young people, representing 20 nationalities, from Langdon school in Newham in the east end of London&mdash;the tolerance and diversity that is London. They also saw a statement of our ambition for the future, which is not just to host the greatest sporting event in the world for 17 days but to unlock the ambition of millions of young people up and down our country&mdash;a real legacy for both capital city and country. In London the next day, and ever since, the world has seen the resilience of Londoners again, linked to a determination that the grief, the mourning and the outrage of the terrorist attacks will not translate into division or hate and to continue as the city of tolerance that has so defined us to the rest of the world.</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/5">Why was it that we won in Singapore against&mdash;as many would say&mdash;all the odds? There is a simple answer to that question. The IOC was moved by the spirit so clearly articulated and represented in our bid and the presentation to its members. The IOC realised that for London the games were much more than 30 days of Olympic and Paralympic sporting excellence. For London, the games are a chance to transform one of the poorest and most deprived parts of our capital city; to inspire millions of children with dreams of sporting success; to launch a nationwide cultural festival; and to unlock sporting talent, both at home and abroad.</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/6">On the strength of our bid to host the Olympic games, we have also begun a programme of sustained support and investment in our young athletes, with the development of the talented athlete scholarship scheme&mdash;TASS&mdash;and 2012 scholarships. We will bestow on our most talented young people the financial support that they need to realise their potential and to fulfil their ambition.</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/7">We look back on a legacy of too much wasted sporting talent, especially in the children of families who are without the financial and other means to devote to nurturing the kind of talent that could become world class. There are too many children whose talent has never been developed, simply because their families could not afford the cost of their ambition. The talented athlete scholarship scheme and 2012 scholarships are direct and practical ways to address that problem. We celebrated the success of our gold medallists at the Athens Olympics, but we should remember that five of those medals were won by a combined margin of less than half a second. That is why, if we are serious about ensuring that talent and potential are realised, those two schemes are so important.</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/8">The results are already impressive. At the Amateur Athletics Association under-20s national indoor championships this year, TASS athletes won six gold medals, seven silver medals and six bronze medals. As one TASS athlete said:</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/9" class="indent">&quot;As a student I am continually worried about money. At least now it should be easier for me to train and compete without worrying about paying for it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1432.2/10">Two weeks have passed since we were awarded the games and we know that our focus now has to be on delivery. There is no time to waste. Much of the effort and a substantial share of the resources spent on bidding for the games were focused on preparing for delivery. I am delighted to announce today that the Government have already taken the first major step in the development of the best ever Olympic park in Stratford. I have today given the London Development Agency the go-ahead to start the massive construction and regeneration programme that will shape the Olympic park to be ready in seven years' time. The first step is the undergrounding of the power lines that currently blight the Olympic park and the lower Lea valley.</p>

	<p pid=".1451.0/1">Notwithstanding the appalling tragedy that befell London the day after that wonderful moment as Jacques Rogge fumbled with the envelope and announced that London had won <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" name="Lyn Brown">the Olympics, the hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase> is absolutely right that today we must use our discussion of this vital Bill as an opportunity to celebrate the success of London and of the whole country.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/2">I have had opportunities on other occasions to give my thanks to all those who have been involved in that wonderful success&mdash;Seb Coe, Keith Mills, Barbara Cassani, the Prime Minister, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport team, including the Secretary of State and the Minister for Sport and Tourism, and many others, including the large number of elite athletes and young athletes who joined us as part of the bid team in Singapore. They all deserve our praise for a fantastic achievement. A few days before the announcement of the result, the Prime Minister anticipated how he would react were we to be successful, saying:</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/3" class="indent">&quot;it's not often in this job that you punch the air, and do a little jig and embrace the person next to you&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/4">I can assure hon. Members that when the announcement was made in Singapore very many people were punching the air, doing jigs and embracing the people next to them, but we understand that it also happened in London and right across the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/5">We all know that winning the bid is not the finishing line but merely the starting gun that signals the hard work that is necessary to ensure that we deliver what we promised to deliver in 2012&mdash;the best ever Olympic and Paralympic games. This Bill is part of that process of getting on with the work that is necessary to achieve that. We all know how important it is to get on with it quickly, because there are huge prizes to be won. We know that from all the other countries that have benefited from having the Olympic games. Just one example suffices to illustrate it. Before the 1992 games, Barcelona was ranked as the 16th most popular destination for tourists; since then, it has been for many years consistently ranked in the top four. If other countries and cities can benefit, there are also huge prizes for London.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/6">Of those prizes, five crucial ones are on offer. First, above all, the delivery of the 2012 games will help to invigorate our sporting nation. It is worth reflecting that one influential International Olympic Committee member said, after London had been awarded the bid:</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Seb's presentation was not so much on London as on sport.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/8">It was, and rightly so. The underpinning philosophy that should guide the way in which we deliver the 2012 games is the way in which it can invigorate our sporting nation. That is a vital goal. This week, as our schools finish for the summer holidays, 70 per cent. of those leaving school will drop out of any sporting activity whatsoever&mdash;that is a staggering 390,000 children. We need to find ways of persuading them to continue being involved in sport, and the Olympics will help in that process. It is frightening to think that by 2020, on current trends, 70 per cent. of women will do no exercise other than walking. We are all aware of the problem of obesity, which has trebled among children in the past decade, and overall is costing this nation &pound;8.2 billion a year. I mention that figure to draw attention to it in comparison with the cost of the Olympics. Obesity is costing &pound;8.2 billion a year. The expenditure of some billions of pounds on the huge prize of the Olympics pales into insignificance by comparison. The games will inspire the nation to get active, and I welcome that.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/9">The Bill will also create a lasting legacy for our sporting infrastructure. Unlike some of the previous games, it is being planned so sensibly that there will not be enough &quot;white elephant&quot; sports facilities to start, as in the clich&eacute;, an &quot;albino zoo&quot;. That will not happen here because of how we have planned for it.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/10">Secondly, the games will enable the regeneration of three of the most deprived boroughs in the United Kingdom, and will bring broader economic benefits across the whole country. The games will be crucial in the lower Lea valley, which will blossom and benefit hugely, like so many other areas.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/11">Thirdly, the Bill will enable zero waste games, which will help set sustainability standards for the future. The IOC recognised that our games offer comprehensive and positive environmental legacies, which are prizes worth striving for. Fourthly, the activities leading up to the games will showcase our country's excellence in art and culture. Indeed, the bid already did so with schemes, such as the &quot;40 Artists, 40 Days&quot; project, in the countdown to <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July</phrase>. With Jude Kelly at the helm we have every reason to believe that the London 2012 games will also offer a world class cultural programme.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/12">Fifthly, another crucial prize, the games will unite the nation, sharing in the build-up to 2012 and in the excitement of the games themselves. Those are the huge prizes to be won, but several hurdles need to be overcome to ensure we attain them. It will not come as any surprise to the Minister or his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that from time to time, supportive as we are on the Liberal Democrat Benches of the games, we will be critical of some details. Earlier this month, David Moorcroft, chief executive of UK Athletics, said,</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/13" class="indent">&quot;This is one issue where politicians can truly unite and show the public that they can co-operate when they need to and challenge when they need to do so, but do it in a way that is for the greater public good.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/14">Any concerns or criticisms that we may have on some details will be discussed with the Government in the spirit of finding a way forward for the benefit of the games and the nation.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/15">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> said, we face some challenges. We must deliver the games on time, and we have got off to a flying start with our intention to get the Bill on the statute book as quickly as possible. We need to avoid all the delays that could arise from unclear lines of responsibility. In a recent debate in Westminster Hall some of us referred to the huge complexity of the current arrangements in sport. This Bill, together with other activities connected with planning for the games, adds a number of additional bodies to that sporting framework. It is crucial that each body knows what its responsibilities and lines of communication are and what it is accountable for. We must get that right to avoid problems of delay. I am not thinking just in terms of structure; I am thinking of areas, such as construction and transport, where we need to ensure perfect co-ordination.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/16">During the debate on Crossrail the right hon. Lady, like me, was concerned about some aspects of the Bill. We are concerned that current arrangements for Crossrail give the Office of the Rail Regulator power to give overall primacy to Crossrail above anything else. Conflicts may arise about some transport arrangements for the Olympic games, so I am delighted at the agreement that that issue will be looked at by the Crossrail Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/17">We also need to ensure that Crossrail and the Olympic games do not conflict over the need for people with relevant skills. I hope that the Minister will work closely with the Department for Education and Skills to ensure that we provide appropriate training now to ensure that we have people with the right skills to carry out the jobs, rather than us having to rely on workers from overseas.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/18">We must deliver on budget. That will be a challenge. Other countries have had difficulty maintaining their budget plans. We have robust budget plans for the games, but prices can change. Construction costs are increasing at three times the rate of inflation. We need to explore how further to protect Londoners from significant increases in their council tax, more than has already been announced, and how we can ensure that no additional raids are made on lottery funds.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/19">We must deliver a safe games. The IOC approved Britain's security arrangements and praised us for our role in helping to make the Athens games safe. Our plans are robust, but in the light of the recent terrorist attacks they must also be seen to be robust. There needs to be greater reference to security in the Bill. It is surprising that the Bill places no specific duty on the Olympic delivery authority to have regard to security in planning decisions. I hope to return to that issue.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/20">There is a need to balance the IOC requirements with the needs of UK residents. The Olympic movement is an immense force, overwhelmingly beneficial, but with the potential to be overbearing. While honouring the requirements of the IOC to restrict advertising, street trading and ticket resale, legislation needs to be light touch and flexible. We should not gold plate any IOC requirements in respect of those issues.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/21">We must ensure that throughout the next seven years and right up to the games we maintain the current, fantastically high level of support for the games. It is worth looking at reports in local newspapers the day after the announcement was made. <i>The</i> <i>Herald</i> in Glasgow, for example, said,</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/22" class="indent">&quot;Scotland can expect a huge tourist boom, as spectators extend their stays to take in the sights.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/23">A newspaper in Gwent, Wales said:</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/24" class="indent">&quot;Gwent can expect excellent knock-on effects from London's selection to host the 2012 Olympic Games.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/25">In Northern Ireland the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> stated:</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/26" class="indent">&quot;The Olympic Games in 2012 will trigger a huge sporting bonanza for Northern Ireland.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/27">From all the nations of the United Kingdom we have seen an immediate reaction of genuine excitement about winning the games and genuine belief that all parts of the United Kingdom will benefit. My local paper, the<i> Bath Chronicle</i> said:</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/28" class="indent">&quot;Cheers could be heard across the city&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/29">and in Birmingham the report was,</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/30" class="indent">&quot;This is great news, not just for London but for the whole country . . . This is a huge regeneration opportunity, which we will seize with both hands to ensure that all our communities benefit.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/31">That is what people expect and we must ensure that they are not disappointed. We must ensure that each part of the country is given the help and support that it needs to maximise its potential. As the Secretary of State said in response to an intervention, the nations and regions support group under Charles Allen has a crucial role to play. I know that it has been working long before we won the bid but it has already held meetings subsequently and I hope that the Minister will tell us a little more about the support that each part of the country can expect.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/32">I find the Bill's references to regional development agencies confusing. It appears to imply that RDAs can undertake work in their region in relation to the games if the Olympic delivery authority asks them to do that. One would have thought that they should be able simply to get on with work if they believe that it is appropriate for their region.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/33">We have already heard what the Bill does. It creates the Olympic delivery authority; gives that authority powers to provide a transport infrastructure, including sophisticated traffic management, low carbon vehicles, the Olympic javelin train from King's Cross to Stratford, with a travelling time of only seven minutes and so much more; empowers the Mayor of London to spend council tax revenues for use in the games, and fulfils various IOC requirements on touting, training and advertising and ensuring that the Olympic environment is clean and hassle free. The Bill will achieve great things but it also asks us to take a leap of faith.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/34">We took a leap of faith with the bid and we were proved right. However, we are being asked to take a leap of faith with the Bill. It does not mention many key issues such as immigration and tax arrangements for athletes, their entourage and supporters. It does not refer to the role that Her Majesty's Customs and Excise will have to play in dealing with the likely flood of counterfeit merchandise. It does not mention the huge challenges that we will face in 2012, when we shall have not only the games but digital switch-over in London. The media authorities have the huge task of ensuring clear spectrum for broadcasters who want to beam out each day's events in London.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/35">Even when the Bill refers to key issues such as the prize of setting new sustainability standards, it often does not go far enough. For example, I should like the ODA to be made to have regard to sustainable development in fulfilling its planning responsibilities. That could be done in clause 5.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/36">The Bill requires a leap of faith for another reason. During the passage of the Gambling Bill, I criticised the Government for including so many opportunities to give the Secretary of State secondary powers. One in every 10 clauses in the Gambling Bill gave the Secretary of State secondary powers. In the Bill that we are considering, one in every three clauses provides for a new power for the Secretary of State through secondary legislation. I hope that the Minister will assure us that, when the Committee considers the Bill, it will see as many of the regulations as possible in draft form.</p>
	<p pid=".1451.0/37">We will pick up on several other issues in Committee. I have already referred to the problem with Crossrail. Why, in outlining the mayoral powers, does the Bill contain no provisions to enable the Greater London assembly to scrutinise their exercise? Why do not restrictions on ticket touts include more onerous restrictions on newspapers and online market places such as eBay advertising illegally touted tickets? Is not it odd that, in relation to the role of the powers of the GLA, the Bill does not refer specifically to consulting the ODA or, as many others have said, local authorities?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-07-21.1468.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" speakername="Mark Hunter" colnum="1468"  time="15:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050721/debtext/50721-24.htm#50721-24_spnew2">
	<p pid=".1468.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to make my maiden speech to the House today. First, I add my congratulations to London on its successful bid to host both the Olympic and Paralympic games in 2012. I am sure that London's Olympic bidding team must have taken great encouragement and inspiration from Manchester's tremendous success in hosting the Commonwealth games back in 2002. Members from across the north-west region will surely agree that those games were not just a great sporting spectacle, but succeeded in bringing together communities, including my own, in a way that few other events can do. The residents of Cheadle made up a considerable proportion of the vast army of volunteers whose selfless contributions made the Manchester games such a success. The community spirit and enthusiasm shown three years ago by my constituents is typical of the local population, whom I am privileged to represent.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.0/2">It is also an immense privilege to succeed my friend and colleague, Patsy Calton, as Member of Parliament for Cheadle. Hon. Members will no doubt recall the courage and determination that my predecessor demonstrated only a matter of weeks ago in this very House. Having known Patsy for many years, I know that her qualities as a person and as a Member of Parliament were not defined only by the bravery and commitment that she displayed throughout her illness. She was an inspiration to and a great servant of the community in so many other ways. The drive and tenacity that she showed when assisting her constituents was matched only by her attention to detail and her sharp mind, which she employed in the House and in Committee. Her sheer work rate on behalf of the people of Cheadle will be celebrated for many years to come within the constituency and beyond. She came closer than most to bridging the gap between being a champion of the local community and a politician of national standing.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.0/3">Let me take a moment or two to explain a little more about the constituency of Cheadle. It is located on the southern tip of the Greater Manchester conurbation, and many local residents consider their area to be part of Cheshire, as the constituency historically was. Even the briefest tour of my constituency amply demonstrates why residents feel this way. The word &quot;leafy&quot;, used frequently to describe the constituency, simply does not begin to do justice to Cheadle. We are blessed with magnificent, award-winning parks and nature reserves, such as Bruntwood park and Gatley Carrs, and tree-lined streets throughout the local area. I would advise any hon. Member fortunate enough to be visiting the area that there are few better days out to be had than taking a trip to Bramhall hall, a magnificent 14th-century manor house and its surrounding park.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.0/4">A number of hon. Members have probably visited my constituency over the past few weeks, and I hope that they all enjoyed themselves as much as I did. However, I assume that Members of the party to my right are unlikely to be putting in an appearance again for some considerable time.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.0/5">It is not just the precious green belt and open space that make our area so special. We have a number of district centres, all with unique characters, which serve to provide a network of villages and community centres across the constituency. Cheadle village, Cheadle Hulme and Bramhall are all distinct local centres with a range of amenities but which also face constant challenges from out-of-town retailers and other pressures.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.0/6">Cheadle is considered a prosperous area and the statistics appear to bear that out. An initial assessment would show that local people, in general, are highly educated, highly skilled and relatively highly paid, particularly in a regional and sub-regional context&mdash;a typically affluent suburb, some might say. That broad-brush approach, however, does not tell the whole story. It does not, for example, take account of the large number of pensioner households in every part of the constituency. Nor does it take account of the pockets of deprivation that can be hidden from Government funding formulae. It also fails to recognise the needs and expectations of the community.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.0/7">The dire funding arrangements for local services are the topic of debate locally. As leader of the local council for the past three years, I can say that there is a certain grim predictability about the financial settlement for local government every year. It leaves the council that is responsible for so many vital local services in an unenviable position, as both a low grant and a high council tax authority. It means that a two-pensioner household in Heald Green can end up paying more council tax than, say, a Cabinet Minister is expected to pay in a different authority area, although our council spends less per head than any other Greater Manchester authority. Moreover, all the current evidence suggests that the situation is likely to be exacerbated by council tax revaluation.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.0/8">Currently, a pupil at King's Way school in Gatley in my constituency is funded at around &pound;1,000 per year less than a pupil at a school just over a mile away, in neighbouring Manchester. Local schools already achieve excellent results, but there is so much extra potential that could be released if we benefited from a fairer funding regime. All the signs suggest, however, that the inequality will only get worse unless something is done.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.0/9">The position is replicated across a range of local services. Indeed, not long ago my predecessor had to fight tooth and nail to retrieve &pound;1 million of funding for Stepping Hill hospital that was rightfully its money. As for crime and antisocial behaviour, we are all familiar with the raft of legislation that has emanated from the Chamber in recent years. The sad reality is that, during the same period, my constituency has seen the closure of one police station and the failure to establish a long-promised police post in Cheadle Hulme to replace it. There is no shortage of legislation, but there is a pressing need for more police officers to enforce the law. The principle of fairness underpinned the Liberal Democrat election campaign in May, and I intend to pursue it in respect of the funding of local services in Cheadle.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.0/10">I am sure I am not the only Member whose constituents need and deserve a vastly improved transport network. Fortunately, my constituency has a coherent strategy as part of the south-east Manchester multi-modal study. The strategy includes completion of the Manchester airport eastern link road, as well as construction of the Poynton bypass and the A6 Hazel Grove bypass. The current road network, involving the infamous &quot;road to nowhere&quot;&mdash;the airport link road&mdash;only serves to funnel traffic on to suburban roads in the Heald Green, Woodford and Bramhall areas, where the infrastructure is totally unsuited to coping with the volume.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.0/11">I am not the first Member for Cheadle to refer in a maiden speech to the importance of delivering the A55 relief road scheme, but I hope for the sake of my constituents, and indeed neighbouring constituents, that I am the last.</p>
	<p pid=".1468.0/12">While I intend all those serious issues and many more during the time for which local people allow me to serve in this role, I consider myself one of the most fortunate Members in the House in being given the opportunity to represent such an attractive, confident and cohesive community. It is therefore with sadness for the loss of my friend, but also with immense pride, that I have the privilege to serve the people of Cheadle. The constituency has seen some of the benefits that a major sporting event such as the Olympics can have for a community, in so many different ways. Other Members have said the same this afternoon. With careful planning, I hope that London can repeat that success in 2012 not only for the capital, but for our country as a whole.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-07-21.1473.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" speakername="Richard Ottaway" colnum="1473"  time="15:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050721/debtext/50721-25.htm#50721-25_spnew5">
	<p pid=".1473.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>, particularly as it is not a Friday, when he is not constrained by a time limit. I noticed the passion with which he spoke about the Health and Safety Executive, which we will hang on to with great interest.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase> on an excellent maiden speech. I did not go to Cheadle during the campaign, although I have to admit to spending a lot of time on the telephone, talking to his now constituents. He should not take it for granted that I will not call in future, but I congratulate him and look forward to hearing his contributions in the years to come.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.0/3">Like others, I congratulate the bid team on a fantastic triumph. Seb Coe and the others deserve every accolade. We should not forget the efforts of Barbara Cassani, who laid the foundations at the beginning of the bid. For Londoners it was a rollercoaster week with such euphoria on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July</phrase> and such depression on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>. It is up to the people of London to make a success of this. It is the greatest honour that the world can bestow on a city and we must make the best of it.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.0/4">London will reap tremendous benefits: the legacy, the development of the facilities and the inspiration to our young people. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" name="Lyn Brown">the hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase> that we must involve the boroughs as much as possible. I should be interested to hear from the Minister how parts of London with facilities to offer can put them forward. Will there be a sort of clearing house? In the Croydon and Bromley area there is Crystal Palace, which has already been mentioned and does not need a clearing house, and schools such as the Whitgift with tremendous national-class facilities, which it would love to make available. Guidance is needed on how that is best achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.0/5">Plans for London are undoubtedly ambitious. There will be a number of temporary facilities, such as Lords, Wimbledon and Horseguards Parade. There will be places around the country, such as Weymouth for rowing and sailing, in which I take a particular interest. The Lea valley site is extremely large. Canary wharf is only 85 acres; Lea valley will be 500 acres. It will need top-class management to fulfil its potential and to bring about the necessary restoration and regeneration of the east end. I do not want to make party political points, but lessons can be learned from the Jubilee line and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1819" name="Derek Wyatt">the dome. The hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt)</phrase> held out the dome as a triumph; others might not see it that way. The lessons of development and project management have to be learned from those projects.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.0/6">A lesson is to start building early. If we leave it to the last minute, as in Athens, there will be the inevitable scramble that we want to avoid. A key player will be the mayor of London. I am pleased that he is given substantial powers to cut through bureaucracy. With a major development, many organisations feel obliged to be consulted and want to have their finger in the pie. It will take a fairly ruthless so-and-so to cut through that and drive the project forward.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.0/7">The people of London still need clarity about finance. The Secretary of State said in her opening speech that the position was clear. It is clear if the games are on budget, but if the cost overruns, it is not clear who will pay and how the contributions will be found. If the Minister is not in a position to elaborate tonight, will he provide a steer in the coming months?</p>
	<p pid=".1473.0/8">I want to consider the affected businesses. I have taken a particular interest in one company, F. H. Brundle, whose sole proprietor is a constituent of mine. He has run a business in the relevant area for several years and owns a freehold site. However, he is obliged to relocate. He is a builder's merchant who picks up passing trade that comes from the east end of London into the development sites of the City and the west end. The London Development Agency is offering to relocate him five miles away in Beckton or 12 miles away in Rainham Marshes. Neither site has freehold available. My constituent has a freehold site and there is therefore no question of like-for-like compensation.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1395" name="Jacqui Lait">My hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait)</phrase> made the point in relation to clause 4 that the sums of money are equivalent to those that would be paid if the land were purchased compulsorily. If that is the cap, the businesses will lose money. They have to find a new site and build on it and relocate factories. Not all the staff will be able to move with them. There will be redundancy payments and relocation costs. Investment value will be lost because the businesses have freeholds but will end up with leaseholds. Business will be lost in the transition and because the firms are no longer on such a prominent site. My constituent estimates that he will lose several million pounds.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.0/10">I know that the Minister has an open mind and that he does not want such consequences. However, the Bill suggests that, with all the good will in the world, there will be losses. I hope that I have either read it wrongly or that the matter can be tackled in Committee. I hope that there will be scope for proper compensation for the businesses that are affected by the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.0/11">Before the bid was successful, the line was always that the matter was for the LDA to determine. The Minister knows that I asked about that on several occasions. The Secretary of State claimed that it was a matter for the LDA. However, the LDA says that it is constrained by statute and finance. We are going around in circles and only two people can cut through the problem&mdash;the Minister and the Secretary of State. I would be grateful if the Minister could tackle the matter as a priority because businesses will be seriously affected. There is a lack of suitable alternative sites nearby. The sites on offer from the LDA are not ready to plan for or start development. There is uncertainty about the available funding and compensation. Many businesses are already worried about the time frame for their location.</p>
	<p pid=".1473.0/12">The Olympic games will be a major project, subject to the scrutiny of the nation and the world. There are bound to be problems. There will be scandals, accusations of corruption and issues that we have not anticipated. It is incumbent on us all to keep our nerve when the going gets rough. We are not considering a political issue. All the parties want to get behind the games and make them a success. London has the ability to put on a great games, but we must deliver.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-07-21.1491.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="1491"  time="17:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050721/debtext/50721-30.htm#50721-30_spnew1">
	<p pid=".1491.0/1">It gives me great pleasure to add my congratulations to the bid team, particularly the Secretary of State and my hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and Tourism, who was a champion of the Olympics before it was popular to be one. Other Members have mentioned the Mayor of London. This shows what we can achieve when we work together.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/2">We all know where we were on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July</phrase> at 12.46 p.m. As I stood at Stratford station, I rejoiced at the news that the Olympics had come to London. It seems unreal to be debating the games actually being in London instead of the mere prospect.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>, at about 7.30 a.m., a bus left the Olympic zone at Hackney Wick. That number 30 bus with its indicator board clearly displaying the sign Hackney Wick was blown up on its return journey and 13 people died. As we have listened to this debate, a number 26 bus going along Hackney road in my constituency has suffered from an explosion. I hope and pray&mdash;all Members will join me in this&mdash;that the reports that there have been no casualties are correct.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/4">That reminds us of the contrast. London was bombed and may have been attacked again today because we are a world city. We won the Olympic bid because we are a city of the world and that world is reflected in London and throughout the UK. Hackney is a diverse borough, with all the countries competing in the Olympics represented in Hackney alone, let alone the rest of London and the UK. Since the bombings of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase>, Hackney's communities have joined forces to show what they can do when they work together, particularly the Muslim Jewish Forum, which has existed for some years in Hackney and brings together different faith groups to face challenges together. It has demonstrated tolerance, a commitment to London and the fact that what unites us is far greater than what divides us.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/5">I am delighted to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1684" name="Harry Cohen">my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)</phrase>. He was right to remind the House that the Olympics is not simply about Stratford, with respect to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" name="Lyn Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase>. Hackney Wick sees the largest amount of sporting activity in London every Sunday. Not many of my colleagues present, but perhaps some of their constituents, will have played Sunday league football on Hackney marshes. The games are often described as the Stratford Olympics, but it is important to remember that four boroughs will host the Olympic park. Hackney is proud to be one of them. Arenas will be built in Hackney, with the basketball centre as a lasting legacy. We will also see redevelopment of its important business centre&mdash;plans that local people have been frustrated to see, but have accepted, put on hold as we bid for the games. We will see important environmental improvements to those football pitches and elsewhere. We will see access to about 5,000 new homes, many of which will be affordable and welcome to my constituents. Critically, for Hackney as a whole, we will see the delivery of the East London line extensions, at last. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] I welcome that support.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/6">Very importantly, the Olympics catalyse further transport improvements still. We will see the north London line become a turn-up and go service, with eight trains an hour. Hackney will effectively get its tube thanks to the Olympics, which will connect Hackney better with London. I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> that we seek a further extension to Highbury and the Victoria line by 2012.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/7">Hon. Members on both sides have mentioned extra council tax. I do not take any council tax increase lightly, but it is a small price to pay for the many benefits that will come to London, particularly to my constituency. We will also see a sporting legacy. Yes, we must see the investment in elite sport that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State outlined in her opening speech, but we need to see physical activity for all. The health impacts will be enormous for east London and the UK. I look forward to seeing more detail from her and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills on how to ensure that sporting opportunity and physical activity penetrate deeper than just to the elite sportsmen and women whom we hope will bring back gold in 2012.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/8">Environmental concerns are at the forefront of many of my constituents' minds, particularly because part of Hackney marshes and Mabley green will become a car park for the duration of the games. That is not something that an hon. Member is likely to stand up and welcome, but the pitches, which I have walked around, are in poor condition and need investment, so I welcome the assurances of better facilities and improvement and replacement of metropolitan open land. Although we lose the facilities temporarily, it is a price worth paying if those improvements come. I put down a marker for my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State and the Minister that I shall be watching like a hawk to ensure that that happens.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/9">I also welcome the new linear park that will be created and the fact that the power lines in east London will be buried. A transformation will occur, with bridges over cleaned-up rivers and waterways and, bizarrely, a link with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1461" name="Charles Walker">the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr. Walker)</phrase>, as he and I will be at either end of the new Lea valley park as it stretches properly into Hackney at last.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/10">The Olympics will also bring important cultural benefits, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State outlined. Hackney benefits from being the borough with the highest density of artists and creative businesses in the country. Many hon. Members have mentioned the relocation of businesses in the area. We must preserve diversity in those relocations. Again, I echo the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North. Hackney is greater than the sum of its parts and the artists and creative businesses contribute enormously to that. It is important to work out a formula that ensures that they can remain and contribute on a continuing basis to the diversity and creative talent of Hackney, and that they are not squeezed out by yuppie or any other sort of development.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/11">I visited the Travellers on Waterden road, who are concerned because they still do not know where they will be relocated. They and I and others locally recognise that they have to move from their site in the Olympic park. I was reassured by a meeting with the London Development Agency yesterday, when it assured me that it is still working with Hackney council to work out a relocation package that will allow the Travellers to continue their lifestyle, as has been guaranteed.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/12">Hackney is fully signed up to the Olympics and it is important to highlight to hon. Members who perhaps do not know it&mdash;I want especially to reassure <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase>&mdash;that the Olympic boroughs propose to establish a co-ordination unit to work with the Olympic delivery authority and act as a key link with the Olympics organising committee. That is a sensible step, which builds on the collaborative work that has already gone on between the five boroughs.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/13">The co-ordination unit will focus on communications, the essential legacy issues, business support&mdash;to ensure that local businesses gain benefits&mdash;sorting out the regulatory functions and creating and helping to deliver the vision for culture and creativity that is part of the Olympics. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will support that rational and co-ordinated approach and, in doing so, help to reassure hon. Members who have raised anxieties about the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/14">Legacy is the main reason for my support and that of the people in Hackney for the Olympics. We welcome the physical sporting legacy. The basketball zone is certainly a better legacy than a car park. We look forward to international basketball champions training in Hackney for many years to come. I have mentioned the environmental legacy but we need to highlight it more, especially given that the Government, the Mayor and the Olympic delivery authority will naturally and rightly focus on delivering an Olympic park on time and on budget. We need to ensure that the environmental benefits are connected not only to the development of the Olympic park but to the future of the Lea valley and the Lea valley park.</p>
	<p pid=".1491.0/15">I am especially concerned about jobs, skills and business opportunities for local businesses and local people. Other hon. Members pointed out that, too often, they can go elsewhere, not to local businesses and people. When I spoke to the LDA's chief executive yesterday, I was reassured that he and his team are recruiting a special business unit to provide support for business skills. That is imperative to ensure that London benefits and is not leapfrogged as other businesses throughout Europe compete for the important work around the Olympic zone.</p>
