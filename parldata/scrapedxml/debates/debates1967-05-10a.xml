<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Before the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) catches your eye, may I raise a point of order with you? It arises out of the Sessional Order passed by this House directing the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis to keep the access to the House clear. This morning, I had to run one and a half miles to be in my place here because I was held up on the other side of Victoria Station.<br/>
The point on which I seek your help is whether you have any power or standing in the matter to see that the Sessional Order is enforced and, if not, if the House could be informed how far the Sessional Order applies; in other words whether it goes merely into Parliament square, or beyond where hon. Members may be delayed with still a half hour journey to the House.</p>

<p>I beg to move
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for the establishment of a register of the outside business interests of Members of Parliament.</q>
My purpose is to establish an official public register of the pecuniary interests and emoluments of Members of both

Houses. I think that it would be generally accepted that our public political life, especially in Parliament, is probably freer from corruption than in any other country in the world. But we tend to accept that all too smugly as a self-evident proposition, without requiring positive proof of it.<br/>
I do not accept that posture. I believe that our Parliament is relatively incorrupt, but I am afraid not wholly so. My views on this matter are fortified by the recently issued book, "The Business Background of M.P.s", by Mr. Andrew Roth. Mr. Roth quotes the specific instance of Commander Courtney, who was Member of Parliament for Harrow, East from 1959 to 1966. I need not go into the details of that case, but Mr. Roth refers to articles written by the Commander for the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i> in which he said, among other things:
<q>My election as Conservative M.P. for Harrow, East improved my business affairs &#x2026; On the one hand I had acquired an access to the Board of Trade and other Ministries which could and did prove valuable.</q>
Then Mr. Roth draws attention to an article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 12th February, 1967, concerning the business activities of another hon. Member. Again, I deliberately refrain from going into the details, partly because they are to be found in Mr. Roth's book and in the <i>Sunday Times</i> article to which it refers. I say merely that that hon. Member had not listed his activities in "Who's Who", nor declared his interest in certain companies to the House of Commons, nor volunteered the information to Mr. Roth for inclusion in his succession of books on M.P.s' business interests.<br/>
Certain hon. Members, including the one just mentioned, have been connected with recently crashed cut-price motor car insurance companies, including the notorious Savundra empire. Yet another hon. Member was intimately associated with the John Bloom companies which came crashing down some while ago and which are currently under investigation by the Board of Trade. Other hon. Members of both Houses had associated with what Mr. Roth describes as an "armchair farming" firm, Anglian Pig Breeders, which went into liquidation in December, 1965.<br/>
It may be that all the hon. Members concerned in these ventures were innocent


dupes used by companies engaged in rather dubious business practices which felt that the association of hon. Members' names with their activities might help to create an aura of respectability and honesty sufficiently convincing to gull the public.<br/>
I would be the last to deny the right of any Member of either House to have outside business interests. Most Members seem to be quite willing to disclose what those interests are, but this at the moment is entirely voluntary. One example quoted by Mr. Roth deserves to be put on record.<br/>
The House will recall that hon. Members got a substantial increase in their salaries in the autumn of 1964 as the result of a recommendation by an impartial outside body. In July, 1966, a certain hon. Member asked that all hon. Members' salaries should be cut by 10 per cent. in view of the economic situation. A month later, that same hon. Member acquired two directorships in American drug companies. I find the chronological juxtaposition of these two incidents portraying something which to my mind is deplorably squalid.<br/>
I recall a further incident&#x2014;that of the Burmah Oil Company. This was probably the most sordid example in recent ha story of how Parliament can be used and abused in the interests of big business. In the course of the debate on the issue, I listed the names of Members of another place, 38 in all, who were shareholders in the Burmah Oil Company and many of whom had not attended the Lords for years but who attended for that debate in order to vote something like &#x00A3;40 million of public money for their company.<br/>
It seems to me, therefore, that the need for a statutory register of business interests is overwhelming. <i>The Times,</i> in its editorial comment on the Bill last Monday, was wrong in assuming that there would be no public interest in the matter or that the information disclosed is
<q>&#x2026; ascertainable already within the Palace of Westminster &#x2026;</q>
It is not. Or at least, if it is, it is due to the activities of people like Mr. Roth. Some hon. Members are very cagey in divulging their interests. A much more profound and accurate comment was

made by Mr. David Wood, also of <i>The Times,</i> when he reviewed Mr. Roth's book on 17th April Mr. Wood wrote:
<q>The substantial point that arises from Roth's researches is that membership of the Commons, like membership of an Administration, does bring invitations to serve business interests in more ways than one. It is not just a question of the directorships that go in plenty to former Conservative Ministers: it is also a question of retainers as advisers and consultants that may come a politician's way, no matter which side of the House he sits.</q>
<i>The Times</i> was right in saying, however, that mere observation of the House's convention to declare one's interest when speaking in debate is not enough. That is so because, firstly, the interested Member may not choose to speak; secondly, he can exert greater influence behind the scenes than he can in public debate; and, thirdly, he does not have to declare an interest in asking Questions in the House.<br/>
When discussing this with a Privy Councillor, who is a Member of this House, I was told that some hon. Members have been known to have been paid by outside interests a fixed sum for asking Parliamentary Questions on their behalf, and this was confirmed in discussion with the correspondent of an eminently reputable newspaper, who made specific reference to a former Member for one of the Northern Ireland constituencies.<br/>
How would the Bill work? Each financial year, each hon. Member would be required to fill in a form giving details of directorships held, the names of the companies and a brief explanation of the nature of their business. Secondly, he would be compelled to declare any individual shareholdings in any company above the value, say, of &#x00A3;500. Thirdly, he would be compelled to declare the nature of other emoluments over an annual value of &#x00A3;500 paid by any outside body. This would include, for example, hon. Members sponsored by trade unions. I know that they are quite willing to put this on record. Everyone knows who they are and, generally speaking, what the unions do for them. These declarations would, of course, exclude casual fees like those for appearances on television.<br/>
The penalty for failure to disclose&#x2014;but I do not expect that any hon. Member


would be unwilling to disclose his interests&#x2014;would be decided by the Committee of Privileges on the merits of each case. I reject completely <i>The Times'</i> verdict that my suggestion
<q>&#x2026; would be corporately self-insulting.</q>
I also repudiate the suggestion that the Bill would contain an implication that hon. Members
<q>&#x2026; can no longer be trusted to behave with honour and discretion in a way that once they could.</q>
Hon. Members on both sides of this House support the principle of a statutory register. Nor do I accept the view that, because a particular legislative Measure gives one particular party a political advantage, it should not be introduced. I have never felt inhibited by considerations of that kind.</p>

<p>I rise to ask the House to refuse the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) leave to bring in this Bill. The House has a great affection for the hon. Gentleman and we are all very glad to see that he has recovered so admirably from his recent heart condition and is in such very robust form again. If he had had to do what I had to do to get here today, he would have dropped dead on the way. Who knows but that the same may not happen to me&#x0021;<br/>
In normal circumstances, the House would have been inclined, knowing the hon. Gentleman to have dismissed this Parliamentary exercise with the affectionate tolerance which it usually extends to him, but I feel that there is need to go a little further than that. I want first, bluntly and straightforwardly, to say to him that he owes it in all honour to say outside the House what he has said about Commander Courtney and what he has said&#x2014;although he was not quite so brave in mentioning them by name&#x2014; about my hon. Friend the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Sir W. Teeling), my hon. Friend the Member for Heston and Isleworth (Mr. Reader Harris) and his own right hon. Friend, the Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Willey), who was connected with the pig farming enterprise the hon. Gentleman mentioned.<br/>
My main objection, as the hon. Gentleman attempted to anticipate, is that it casts an aspersion upon the honour of

the House collectively. If there is any one quality which the House has demanded from its Members&#x2014;it is the quality which it has made a synonym for membership&#x2014;that is the quality that a Member has when he is entitled to be named by other Members in the term "honourable Gentleman".<br/>
The hon. Member for Fife, West has impugned the integrity of the House and the integrity of all hon. Members with business interests, whatever he may mean by that. But the hon. Gentleman has also impugned the integrity of hon. Members with any other kind of pecuniary interest, although, of course, "pecuniary interest" does not carry quite the same party political stigma as "business interest", since we on this side of the House are proud to say that it is our supporters and, to a large extent, we ourselves who have maintained the business supremacy of this nation.<br/>
The House is equally entitled to take a critical look at the hon. Member for Fife, West. In examining him, we see a perfectly pardonable old-fashioned romanticism which imagines that there is something sinister about business, about the free enterprise system, and some peculiarly uneconomic principle that guides boards of directors of public companies and makes them think, quite stupidly, that having an M.P. on the board gives them some special magic or assistance in conducting their affairs. I know of no company which would be so stupid, and if Members of Parliament are on boards of directors it is because their fellow directors consider that the business help they can give them fully justifies it and that they can justify it to the shareholders.<br/>
We should also examine what could be the possible means of "business and pecuniary interest" and consider the practical effect of registering such things. An interest or action is either definable or demonstrable and subject, therefore, to rules which may be drawn and drafted, or it is not demonstrable and definable in such a way. If it is not demonstrable and definable, then any rules made governing it are meaningless and, therefore, unenforceable.<br/>
In asking the House to reject this Motion, it is my submission that the concepts which the hon. Member has put to the House are not definable interests


with any manifest meaning in relation to hon. Members and their membership of this House; and to suggest that such things should be registered is not an attempt to enforce any beneficial rule that might be obvious but is an attempt to cast a malicious smear on the House in general, and in particular on hon. Members on this side of the House who believe in the enterprise system.<br/>
In so far as interests and actions in this House are definable and demonstrable, Erskine May is both clear and full on the subject. It would be a waste of the time of the House for me to rehearse what Erskine May says but I will put on record both references, which are contained&#x2014;in the Sixteenth (1957) Edition&#x2014;in pages 439 to 443 and also page 125 in respect of contempt which, if the hon. Member cares to examine it, he will find refers to an offence that he has committed himself, subject only to the protection that he has as a Member of this House&#x2014;because he has brought the House into dishonour and disrepute by what he has said.<br/>
In the few moments remaining I want to point out to the hon. Member that when he accuses an hon. Member of having been paid a sum of money for risking a Question in the House it is an offence. It is contempt of the House, and it is specifically mentioned and defined in Erskine May.<br/>
Therefore, having, as I felt obliged to dO, put upon the hon. Member in honour the obligation to name hon. Members outside and to name in the House those Members whom he was accusing of corruption in their capacity as hon. Members, I also put upon him in honour the obligation to name outside, and also in this House, the hon. Member whom he said has committed the Parliamentary offence as laid down in Erskine May.<br/>
I do not know what the hon. Gentleman has in view as the idealistic concept of membership of this House&#x2014; whether he means that we and those of our fellow countrymen who put ourselves at the service of our country in this House should be monks, totally divorced from the beginning unto the end&#x2014;or for how long&#x2014;from any relationship at all with the ordinary conduct of the

life of this nation, or whether we are only etiolated insects, turned out from underneath some academic stone, at a salary of up to &#x00A3;3,000 a year.<br/>
It is difficult to see what the hon. Member means. Are we to be born in a kind of Aldous Huxleyesque test tube as Members of Parliament, never allowed to be tainted with any contact with the life and business of those whose destiny is largely in our hands? I do not like the idea of this register. It has a nasty taint of the Gestapo&#x2014;to use a famous phrase. It is difficult to think how, once the hon. Member has this register, which everyone will have to fill in, he will be able to resist demands that hon. Members' telephone conversations should be tapped in order to be quite sure that they are not having anything on the side that they should not be having.<br/>
I want to make a somewhat disagreeable suggestion, in reply to the hon. Member. It is not only business interests which might corrupt hon. Members in their membership of the House; there are other interests. Part of the difficulty that we are in in relation to the <i>post mortem</i> on Suez is that it was impossible, in time of peace, with no 18B Regulation, for the House to go into secret session and for the Prime Minister to say things that he did not want to say with card-carrying members of the Communist Party sitting on this side of the House in those days.<br/>
I hope that the House will reject the Motion with the contempt that it deserves, and not connive at or abet the hon. Member in the aspersions that he has cast on this honourable House.</p>

<p>I have been brought up in the Methodist oath never to yield to temptation.<br/>
The draft Order applies to dependent territories and that is the interest of the Commonwealth Office in sponsoring it this morning. The provisions of the draft Order follow closely&#x2014;allowance being made for necessary adaptations&#x2014;the Carriage by Air Acts (Application of Provisions) Order, 1967 which was approved in February by this House. What is now proposed is to apply to the dependent territories the same provisions as have already been agreed should apply as part of the law of the United Kingdom.<br/>
Three Conventions are relevant to the draft Order&#x2014;the Warsaw Convention of 1929, the Warsaw Convention, as amended by the Hague Protocol of 1955&#x2014;or, in other words, the amended Convention, as I shall call it&#x2014;and the Guadalajara Convention. The Warsaw Convention of 1929 was ratified by the United Kingdom both on her own account and in respect of the then dependent territories.<br/>
The Carriage by Air Act, 1932 gave effect in the United Kingdom to this Convention, which limited the liability of the carrier to &#x00A3;3,000 per passenger in respect of international carriage, as defined in the Convention; the Carriage by Air (Non-international Carriage)

(United Kingdom) Order, 1952, and its Colonial counterpart, the Carriage by Air (Non-international Carriage) (Colonies, Protectorates and Trust Territories) Order, 1953, which were made under the provisions of that Act, apply the same limit of liability to domestic and other carriage not covered by the Convention. The former Order&#x2014;that is, the 1952 Order&#x2014;applies as part of the law of the United Kingdom and the 1953 Order as part of the law of those territories to which it applies.<br/>
The Hague Protocol of 1955 made a number of amendments to the Warsaw Convention and in particular raised the limit of liability to &#x00A3;6,000 per passenger in respect of international carriage. The United Kingdom has now notified the Government of Poland of its intention to ratify the Hague Protocol both on its own account and on behalf of the dependent territories mentioned in the draft Order. New legislation is therefore required not only for the United Kingdom but for these dependent territories.<br/>
The Guadalajara Convention, 1961, was given effect to in the United Kingdom by the Carriage by Air (Supplementary Provisions) Act, 1962. We are concerned with this Convention because the draft Order applies its provisions. It does little more than define the expression "carrier" used in both the unamended and the amended Warsaw Conventions. The Guadalajara Convention was ratified on behalf of the United Kingdom in 1964.<br/>
Section 1 of the Carriage by Air Act, 1961, gives effect in the United Kingdom to the Warsaw Convention as amended by the Hague Protocol of 1955, thereby enabling the Protocol to be ratified by the United Kingdom. An Order in Council has now been made, the Carriage by Air (Convention) Order, 1967, which certifies 1st June as the day on which the amended Convention will come into force for the United Kingdom. With effect from that date, the Carriage by Air Act, 1932, which gives effect to the Warsaw Convention of 1929, will be repealed. When this happens, the Carriage by Air (Non-international Carriage) (United Kingdom) Order 1952 will be revoked and replaced on 1st June by the Carriage by Air Acts (Application of Provisions) Order, 1967.<br/>
This latter Order applies the principles of the amended Convention, with


modifications, to carriage by air not governed by that Convention. It is also proposed to revoke the Carriage by Air Non-international Carriage) (Colonies, Protectorates and Trust Territories) Order, 1953, in so far as it applies as part of the law of the Territories to which the draft Order applies.<br/>
This draft Order, which it is proposed to make under Sections 9 and 10 of the 1961 Act and Section 5 of the Carriage by Air (Supplementary Provisions) Act, 1962, is to replace the Carriage by Air (Non-international Carriage) (Colonies, Protectorates and Trust Territories) Order, 1953. The Order follows as closely as possible&#x2014;making allowance for the necessary adaptations for the needs of dependent territories&#x2014;the Carriage by Air Acts (Application of Provisions) Order of 1967, which applies in the United Kingdom. The House has already approved that. The Order will now apply to the dependent territories mentioned, that is to say, those territories on behalf of which the United Kingdom has ratified the Hague Protocol of 1955.<br/>
The main provisions of the Order are, first, that it applies to domestic and other carriage not governed by either the unamended or the amended Warsaw Convention the principles of the amended Convention, including the Guadalajara Convention of 1961, with certain adaptations and modifications, among which are the omission of the requirements as to documentation and of the restrictions of courts in which actions may be brought.<br/>
Second, of more general interest is the raising of the carrier's limit of liability to &#x00A3;21,000 per passenger, which, under the 1953 Order was only &#x00A3;3,000. It also applies the principles of the amended Convention to the carriage of airmail, with similar adaptations and modifications.<br/>
Third, as a transitional provision, it applies those principles to the diminishing amount of carriage which will continue to be governed by the unamended Warsaw Convention with adaptations and modifications which conform to that Convention, to which the United Kingdom remains a party and which limits the carrier's liability to &#x00A3;3,000.<br/>
Fourth, it applies the Warsaw/Hague system to gratuitous carriage by the

Crown, carriage by the Crown for reward being already governed by that system.<br/>
Fifth, it gives the Governor of a dependent territory power to exempt in relation to that territory any class of carriage from the requirements of the Order; but this will be rarely used.<br/>
Sixth, it applies to the dependent territories mentioned in the Order so that the provisions of the Order become part of the law of those territories.<br/>
Finally, it confers on passengers and their dependants and on the shippers of cargo the reversal of the burden of proving the carrier's negligence, in exchange for which the carrier will enjoy a limit of liability. The carrier will not be liable if he proves that he took due care, but his liability will be limited, in the absence of wilful misconduct, unless he has contracted for a higher figure.<br/>
The Order will apply only to those territories listed in Schedule 5, that is, those on whose behalf the amended Convention has been ratified. In respect of the few territories for whom it would not now be appropriate for us to legislate, we have suggested to them that they may wish to consider bringing in their own legislation or, if they wish, having this Order applied to them. In the present state of their constitutional development, this can best be left to them. We have, of course, consulted all the territories, whether mentioned in Schedule 5 or not, about this proposal.<br/>
It is proposed that another Order in Council, the Carriage by Air (Overseas Territories) Order, 1967, will be made under Section 9 of the 1961 Act and will also come into operation on 1st June. It is not required by the terms of the 1961 Act to be laid before Parliament.<br/>
This Order is an international Carriage Order and its main purpose is to extend to the dependent territories mentioned therein the provisions of the amended Convention: the &#x00A3;6,000 limit of liability will apply. If, therefore, the Hague Protocol and the two Overseas Territories Orders come into effect on 1st June, there will be three classes of carriage governed by their provisions, of which notice can be taken in the courts of the listed territories.<br/>
First is carriage governed by the Warsaw Convention as amended by the


Hague Protocol, where the &#x00A3;6,000 limit of liability will apply&#x2014;for example, air journeys between Gibraltar and Paris, since both the United Kingdom and France will be parties to the Protocol. Second is the residual and diminishing amount of carriage still governed by the unamended Warsaw Convention, where the &#x00A3;3,000 limit will apply&#x2014;for example, air journeys from Hong Kong to Delhi, until India also ratifies the Protocol.<br/>
Third is the carriage governed by neither the amended nor the unamended Convention, where the &#x00A3;21,000 limit will apply&#x2014;for example, journeys between Suva and Nadi, both of which are in Fiji, between London and Gibraltar, since Gibraltar is assumed to be part of the United Kingdom, Bermuda-Bahamas nonstop, and Gibraltar-Istanbul, since Turkey is not yet a party to either the Protocol or the unamended Convention.<br/>
Carriage with the limit of &#x00A3;6,000 will be governed by the Carriage by Air (Overseas Territories) Order, 1967, and carriage with the limits of &#x00A3;3,000 and &#x00A3;21,000 by the draft Order. If the Order is approved, it will come into operation on the same date as that proposed for the coming into operation of the Carriage by Air Acts (Application of Provisions) Order, 1967, that is, on 1st June, 1967, the date of the coming into force of the Hague Protocol in respect of the United Kingdom.<br/>
I have given this straightforward and simple explanation to the House in the confident belief that the House will be pleased to approve the Order.</p>

<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. What is good enough for the other place is good enough for the hon. Gentleman. Apart from that, if the House was to understand what I had to say, I had to stick closely to the speech that had been prepared.</p>

<p>It is indeed, most gratifying to recognise this Socialist approbation and approval of what goes on in another place. I hope that it will be a sign that hon. Members opposite will not in future be quite so enthusiastic in their criticisms of that venerable institution.<br/>
Fortified by this pre-knowledge of what the hon. Gentleman was to say, I find my task on this very matter much easier than I thought it would have been. There is one paragraph to which I should particularly like to draw the attention of the House. I do not know, Mr. Speaker, whether it is in order for me to give the column number of the House of Lords OFFICIAL REPORT&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. The hon. Member may quote from a speech made in another place if it was made by a Minister expressing Government policy.</p>

<p>I will not quote it completely, but the paragraph begins, as it has just been repeated by the Minister:
<q>This Order will apply only to those territories mentioned in Schedule 5 to the draft Order; that is to say, the territories on whose behalf the amended Convention has been ratified.</q>
Then follows the sentence to Which I particularly wish to draw attention:
<q>In respect of the few territories for whom it would not now be appropriate for us to legislate we have suggested to them that they may wish to consider bringing in their own legislation or, if they wish, having this Order applied to them.</q>
I note from Schedule 5 that there are some very notable omissions from the list. One is Aden, and another is Rhodesia. It would seem to an uninformed Member of this House that in these territories particularly the risks, whether present or potential, of accidents or mishaps to aeroplanes approaching them might be higher than the risks to aeroplanes approaching other territories, such as the British Antarctic territory or the Central and Southern Line Islands&#x2014;which must be an outstandingly important part of the Commonwealth, and about which I should like further information from the hon. Gentleman because I confess to having not the slightest idea of where they are. The Minister will probably be on more familiar ground if he answers that question than he is, perhaps, on aviation matters.<br/>
May we be told why the territory of Aden, for which this House is responsible, and the territory of Rhodesia, for which, as we hear over and over again, <i>ad nauseam,</i> from the other side this House is also responsible, have not been included in Schedule 5? In particular, may we please know whether the last sentence of this paragraph, which was repeated by the hon. Gentleman, applies to Rhodesia. It states:
<q>We have, of course, consulted with all the territories, whether mentioned in Schedule 5 or not, about what is proposed."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>House of Lords,</i> 8th May, 1967; Vol. 282, c. 1189.]</q>
Have the Government consulted the Governor of Rhodesia about what is proposed in the Order? If not, we would like to know why: if so, we would like to know the Governor's reply on that point.<br/>
An entirely different point is that of carriage of mail by air between the united Kingdom and dependent territories. Reference is made in the Order to the consignor and consignee of goods curried by air. In most cases this is completely clear, but who is the consignor and who is the consignee of a letter carried by air mail? Is it the member of the public who writes the letter, or is it the member of the public at the other end who receives it? Or is it the Postmaster-General in each territory, or is it the Post Office, the Government Department, which consigns the letter? Who is the consignee who is entitled to claim under the Order if something goes wrong? Is it just an additional protection for a Government Department, or is the writer of the letter protected by this provision? If we could have answers to these questions, we would be much happier about eventually approving the Order.</p>

<p>The Minister of State told us that there had been a series of consultations with people in this country who are interested and involved in the Order. I want to refer to Section 3 in page 14, which deals with air waybills, and more particularly to those air waybills which describe cargoes of live animals. Hon. Members on both sides of the House have been appalled over the last years by the endless tragedies resulting from the consignment of live animals by air. The House is familiar with the ghastly circumstances

of the consignment of monkeys from Pakistan, most of which were found to be dead on arrival at London Airport. The House is also aware of reports in the Press some three weeks ago about a consignment of tortoises from North Africa, all of which died in transit.<br/>
Is the Minister of State satisfied that the description put in the air waybill before the cargo is loaded is sufficient for the crew to understand what they are transporting, how the animals should be handled and, if the flight goes wrong and is diverted, the procedure by which the animals are given a break, are fed and watered? I am not satisfied that in this Order we have gone far enough in making sure that countries involved in the carriage of animals by air provide sufficient safeguards in the descriptions laid down in Article 6&#x2014;which is covered by Section 3.<br/>
I know that the hon. Gentleman has taken endless trouble over the question of the transportation of horses by air and the international standards that must be observed. He was most courteous in consulting our main livestock export companies, when it was made perfectly clear that everyone thought that when horses are transported by air, not only must the air waybill be very descriptive but that, where necessary, certain additional precautions must be taken in the form of alterations to the design and layout of the aeroplane.<br/>
It is most important, for instance, that horses should never be transported in the dark; the aeroplanes should always have lights on. Equally, it is most important that a member of the crew must always have a humane killer, so that not only can the horses be dealt with speedily and safely if they get disturbed but, if necessary, can be put down during transportation.<br/>
All interested parties in this country welcome these provisions and we all feel that they will be put into practice, but I see nothing in Articles 5, 6, 7 or 8 that assures us that not only will the cargo be correctly described in the waybill but that, where the cargo demands alteration in the structure and layout of aeroplanes, alteration will be enforced.<br/>
The Minister of State is probably aware of the enormous export trade we now have in dogs. The export of dogs from this country far exceeds that of


all other livestock. I am advised by the Kennel Club that the bulk of dogs exported goes by air. With the precautions that are already being taken and the general experience of transporting these valuable cargoes to different parts of the world, it is now possible, employing the necessary packaging and proper boxing arrangements, successfully to transport dogs throughout the world.<br/>
Having done some of this exporting, what worries me is the fact that at no time, when filling in the waybill, need one say when the animal was last fed. Many dogs are exported to Japan, a trip of two or three days. It takes that time if they are not sent by express passenger service. Air waybills should include the times of feeding and, if possible, the types of feed on which certain animals thrive.<br/>
The Second Schedule of the Order is somewhat obscure. I am not a lawyer, but I understand that this Schedule applies to the unamended Convention, whereas the Order as a whole applies to the amended Convention. The Minister has been under pressure to get this Instrument through and I asure him that I do not wish to delay its progress. Nevertheless, I must complain at the slipshod drafting of the Order. Those involved in the transportation of goods by air cannot be expected to have the text and reference books which are available to hon. Members. I suggest that no Order has been as muddled in its drafting as this one. I hope that the Minister will not bring such an Order&#x2014;drafted in such an incomprehensible and difficult-to-understand way&#x2014;before the House again.<br/>
It is not clear what will happen in respect of the increase in fares which the airlines will have to charge as a result of our ratifying this Instrument. Insurance premiums will be going up considerably and this is bound to involve the airlines in a considerable increase in expenses. What consultations has the Minister had with the Prices and Incomes Board? Are the domestic airlines in Britain to be allowed to put up their fares immediately to meet the increase in the insurance cover? Can we have an undertaking that the increase in fares for which application has recently been

made takes into consideration the increased insurance premiums which the companies will have to pay?<br/>
In introducing the Order the Minister did not deal sufficiently with the problem of the insurance cover which people take out, literally out of a slot machine, at airports. One can put money in a machine which is linked to a time-scale and obtain additional insurance cover over and above that contained in the Order. What will happen if an exemption under Article 8 is invoked&#x2014;that is to say, if one is going on a flight where the basic &#x00A3;6,000 insurance liability of the company carrying one no longer applies?<br/>
I understand that in certain cases, by Ministerial licence, there may be an exemption from liability if a company fails to get one safely to one's destination. If one decided to take out an additional premium from a slot machine at an airport, one should be informed whether the Minister has invoked a special licence so that an exemption applies. In such a case the person going to the slot machine would need to take out an additional &#x00A3;6,000 insurance cover. Has the Minister had consultations about this? The matter was raised on Second Reading. This surely means that these insurance slot machines will have to be divided into two sections: one dealing with cases where the Convention has been ratified and is applied and the second where an exemption arises.<br/>
I trust that the Minister appreciates that this is a more complicated matter than it may at first appear. I trust that before disposing of the Order we will be given a satisfactory answer to my three questions&#x2014;about the air waybill, the insurance principle and the fact that many of my hon. Friends and I regard this Order as having been extremely incompetently drafted.</p>

<p>The House will have noted on the Order Paper the comment that
<q>The Instrument has not yet been considered by the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments.</q>
The Minister asked the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments to meet to consider this Order. The Committee fixed a meeting for this afternoon, but, thereafter, the hon Gentleman placed the


draft Order on the Order Paper for this morning. It is regrettable that this happened, for the Select Committee now cannot report to the House either to the effect that it has nothing to say about the Instrument or that it has some comment to make about it.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Kimball) raised one draft-rig difficulty in connection with Schedule 2. I wish to refer to a more constitutional point which arises under Article 6, in which power is given to the governor of overseas territories to apply the Order with certain conditions and limitations. As the House knows, a Minister or the Crown by Order is not permitted to sub-delegate legislation unless the parent Act allows. Here the Order is being made carrying out certain matters in connection with these Conventions and then a governor is given a sort of sub-delegated power to legislate.<br/>
That is contained in, and sanctioned by, Section 10 of the 1961 Act. My recollection of that provision may be wrong, but I trust that the Minister will confirm that what I say is correct, remembering that Article 6 states that
<q>The Governor of an Overseas Territory may &#x2026; by writing under his hand &#x2026;</q>
apply the Order. What form is this to take? How is this to be promulgated in the territory itself and how are we in this country to know whether any territory has been brought in by a governor under Article 6?<br/>
I am not sure how "writing under his hand" is to be published&#x2014;whether it is to be published officially in the territory concerned or published here. Will hon. Members be able to see it in the Library of the House or are we to be left in the dark?<br/>
One can see from the example given by the Minister that, when considering flights between one place and another, it does not only matter whether the flight started from this country because the various limits apply according to where the flight is routed. It is, therefore, important for us to know whether a governor has exercised his power to extend it to a particular territory "by writing under his hand".<br/>
If this Order can delegate the right to legislate in that way, can it delegate so far as it does in this Article to give the Governor the right to impose con-

ditions and limitations? It does not say that the Governor may apply this Order or not apply it, but that he may apply it with conditions and limitations, or rewrite the Order altogether. I should like an assurance that Article 6 is valid in accordance with the parent Statute.<br/>
Another point concerns the form of the Order. I am sure that the House was grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his explanation and his summary of the three different kinds of case or category of flight with which we are concerned. He gave them as three categories: one, the &#x00A3;6,000 limit; two, the &#x00A3;3,000 limit; and three, the &#x00A3;21,000 limit. He informed the House that the &#x00A3;6,000 limit comes under a separate Order altogether and the &#x00A3;3,000 and &#x00A3;21,000 limits come under the draft Order we are debating. There is a precedent for combining Orders of this sort even though they have different Parliamentary procedures.<br/>
It would have been possible for what I call the &#x00A3;6,000 limit rule to be included in this Order even though this Order has to come before the House in draft. There are precedents for combining in one Order a subject which requires Parliamentary procedure and a subject which does not require it. It is convenient in a case such as this to have the whole subject in one Order. It would have eased the hon. Gentleman's job very much in explaining it had it all been combined in one order. I think that the Ministry of Transport has done this on occasion in connection with powers the Minister has some of which have to come before the House and others of which do not.<br/>
I raise those two points: first, the powers which give the Crown the right to make an Order containing such a provision as is in Article 6, and, secondly, the form of the Order in which it might have been convenient to combine powers which do not need Parliamentary procedure and those which do.</p>

<p>I wish to thank the Minister for the musical way in which he read out to the House the careful explanation which he told us he had written for his noble Friend to deliver in the House of Lords on Monday. It would have been an advantage to the House as a whole if he had told us that we had this advance notice of


the speech he has made. Hon. Members will find it a useful innovation if they can study the verbatim text in advance, because not all Ministers are so articulate as the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
Having congratulated the hon. Gentleman on that, I welcome the aspects of this Order, and first its relative promptness. It has come forward much earlier in time than the similar Order made in 1953, which has been in force hitherto. Secondly, I welcome the improvements in some of the layout in the text of the Order. Here, I differ from my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Kimball). It would be churlish not to welcome this because when we were debating in February the provisions of the Carriage by Air Acts (Application of Provisions) Order, 1967, I suggested that some important improvements should be made. I am glad to see that much improvement has been made. but that leads me to ask why it could not have been made before.<br/>
Broadly, the Order we are considering has much less application and less importance than the Carriage by Air Acts (Application of Provisions) Order, 1967. It seems that we are now in an unfortunate situation in which the document which is more clear to those concerned with this subject is the document of lesser importance. I wonder whether there is a possibility of producing a revised version, perhaps a combined version, following the suggestion made by my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) so that we have the best available text on this subject and so far as possible have it within one set of covers. It would seem that one of the purposes we are here to serve is to make life easier for those who have to interpret the regulations which we pass into law and not to make them more complicated or difficult. I should be interested to know if the Minister has any comment to make on that.<br/>
I must confess that there are still some obscurities about the effect of this Order. The first concerns the question of the exemptions mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby and other hon. Members. When this matter was debated on the previous Order it was explained that, broadly, these exemptions would fall into two categories The first con-

cerned the activities of genuine flying and gliding clubs and the other concerned certain types of gratuitous carriage in Crown aircraft, particularly Transport Command carriage of the forces. Those two classifications have been explained to me in a letter I had from the Minister of State, Board of Trade.<br/>
I should like to know whether it is the intention that the exemptions which governors of overseas territories may apply will fall precisely into those categories or whether there will be extra discretion to exempt exceeding that existing in the United Kingdom and, if so, what that discretion is. This should be known. The discretion which is being granted to the governors should be understood before we pass this Measure into law.<br/>
There also must be some greater provision and stipulation concerning the publication of the exemptions which may be made. It is not yet satisfactorily resolved in this country whether a flying club is obliged to display a notice and, if so, in what form, saying that these provisions do not apply to a certain type of flight undertaken by that club. This should be known. This is just as true in dependent territories with which we are concerned this morning as it is in this country. There needs to be some precision on this of which so far there is no sign.<br/>
Another point I make was taken up by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Fortescue) concerning the carriage of airmail. He asked, as I did when we were debating this matter in February, for a definition of the consignor, who is mentioned in this Order, but who is not defined. I suggested that it was important that he should be defined because certain rights are involved and the prospect of much litigation depends on the absence of certainty in the definition of who the consignor is.<br/>
I received a letter from the Minister of State taking up this point, but he did not actually answer my question. He said:
<q>On the point you made about airmail the owner of the cargo (who is likely to be the poster or an addressee) is not, I am advised, necessarily precluded by the Convention from bringing an action against the carrier, but if he does so Article 24 as applied to airmail by the Order will restrict him to the conditions and limits of the Convention. The Post Office will be in a similar position.</q>


That does not tell me who the consignor or the consignee is and it is important that his should be established, because the possibility that there will be difficult litigation has been borne out by a case which has recently come before the courts. That was the case of Moukataff <i>v.</i> B.O.A.C. I understand that Mr. Moukataff was a Lebanese businessman who asked Barclay's Bank, in London, to send &#x00A3;20,000 in &#x00A3;5 notes to his agents in Kuwait by registered airmail uninsured. Unfortunately, the money was stolen at Heathrow by one of B.O.A.C.'s loaders who was subsequently tried and convicted of the offence.<br/>
Mr. Moukataff was entitled to &#x00A3;2 18s. per packet compensation from the G.P.O. and managed to recover a small part of the balance from the convicted thief. Then, in an action which I am told has no precedent in G.P.O. history, Mr. Moukataff sued B.O.A.C. for the un-recovered balance of over &#x00A3;17,000 and obtained judgment for the full amount, plus costs. In his judgment, tthe judge made it clear that, although the law was clear on the subject of the G.P.O. liability, there was no statutory provision dealing with the carrier's liability.<br/>
This is a case of carriage by air, and it is the sort of case which may happen again. It is clearly a case where it is rot adequate to say, "Let us see what the courts make of it", because, if we are to pass legislation and say, "We are not quite sure what we mean, but the courts will decide", we shall be abdicating one of our functions.<br/>
I reiterate to the Minister of State, and, through him, to the Board of Trade, that there is a strong and urgent case here for some precise definition of what the words "consignor" and "consignee" are intended to mean. If we do not have such a definition, there will be litigation. This, since it will derive from uncertainty in the terms of the Order, will mean that we are not discharging our proper function.<br/>
I turn now to the question of the territories covered by the Order. I can perhaps help my hon. Friend the Member for Garston a little, perhaps a little more than the Minister of State will be able to help him, because my researches do not reveal that the Central and Southern Line Islands are mentioned in

the 1966 edition of the C.R.O. Yearbook. However, I learn from another publication that these important islands, which fall within the scope of the Order, come into two categories. There are three Line Islands, I am told&#x2014;Fanning Island, Washington Island and Christmas Island&#x2014;which are part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and, therefore, covered under that heading in Schedule 5.<br/>
This leaves five islands which are administered direct by the High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. Two of those Islands&#x2014;Flint Island and Caroline Island&#x2014;were in 1951 leased to commercial interests in Tahiti. I know no more about them than that. Of the other three, Starbuck Island, which has an area of one square mile, is uninhabited. Vostock Island, whose area I do not know, is uninhabited. Maiden Island, which has an area of 35 square miles and which contains deposits of guano of doubtful value, is also uninhabited.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for this educational lecture. It is fascinating. Could he tell me, in furtherance of my education, whether any of these islands have airports or aerodromes?</p>

<p>My researches have not revealed that. Perhaps that question might be more fairly addressed to the Minister of State. I should be grateful for any information which he can provide.<br/>
On a slightly more important note, I ask the Minister of State to cover the question of Aden, because, apart from anything else, the security of flights into and out of Aden at this moment causes some anxiety. The situation with regard to Aden Airways itself appears to be obscure. It seems odd that we have a lacuna of sorts here. I should be grateful if the Minister could tell us a little more about it and if he would enumerate what he called in his speech "the few territories" which are omitted. It is very important that somewhere it should be placed on record which are the territories which fall outside the scope of the Order. I suppose they will be published in the other Order which the hon. Gentleman told us is to be made, but at least it is important that there should be a consolidated list somewhere so that the position is known.<br/>
This applies particularly to one territory which I note has also been left out&#x2014;that is, the condominiun of the New Hebrides. I am not quite sure whether there are constitutional developments in train in the New Hebrides which make this an inappropriate moment at which to bring them within the scope of the Order. There are certainly airports there, and, indeed, airlines flying into the New Hebrides from Fiji. Fiji Airways and the Union de Transports A&#x00E9;riens fly in. There are two internal airways having scheduled and charter services&#x2014;New Hebrides Airways and Hebridair. At present, I am advised, no one knows under what provisions carriage by air in that territory is governed, whether this be under French law or under British law and, if so, under what British law. This is an obscurity which should be cleared up.<br/>
I should like the Minister of State to comment briefly on the question of possible increases in fares. It is clear that, if the provisions of the Order increase the liability which airlines may have to accept, it is likely to lead to some increase in their insurance premiums. The precise effect of this may be difficult to calculate, but I hope that the Minister can give us some idea of the kind of increase he expects to occur.<br/>
Although this may not be the appropriate moment, I wonder if the Minister of State can say anything about flights into and out of Gibraltar. There is some public anxiety on this score. Gibraltar is covered by the Order. Parliament could perhaps be notified officially as to what the position of Her Majesty's Government now is with regard to services into and out of Gibraltar.<br/>
I endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough said about the question of animals and the inadequacy of the air way bill in this respect. I do not suppose that there is any way in which the Order could be amended to meet this inadequacy, because the conditions set down there are part of the Conventions. But there does seem to be a very strong case for improving the conditions under which animals are transported by air. There was a disturbing case reported in the Press only yesterday of some animals which had been shipped into this country from

Singapore and which arrived in a very distressed condition.<br/>
Ordinary inanimate cargo and the condition in which it arrives is, presumably, a matter between the consignor and the consignee, whoever they may be, and the carrier. However, the carriage of animals is of more general and public concern, because we simply cannot be content to treat them as lumps of inanimate matter whose ownership is vested in an individual and whose wellbeing is of no concern to anyone else.<br/>
We are, rightly, horrified and disgusted by some of the reports which we see. Perhaps there is nothing that can be done on this occasion, but I put it to the Government that there may be a need for a further convention in the realm of carriage by air which covers the conditions under which animals are to be carried.<br/>
It would be singularly appropriate if the initiative here were to come from this country, because we have a major trade in this respect. We are major importers of pets. We are, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough reminded us, a significant importer of various animals for other reasons. We are a nation of animal lovers. It would be a good and appropriate thing if some initiative towards the creation of a convention covering this aspect of carriage by air were to come from the United Kingdom.<br/>
The only other point I want to make concerns that raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby about the fact that the Order comes before us having not yet been before the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. If the process of going before the Select Committee is thought to be of any value, there may well be occasions on which it is impossible, for one reason or another, for the process to be completed before the Government have to bring an order before us.<br/>
I note that the Government have brought this Order before us on this Wednesday morning, the last morning sitting before the Order is to come into force on 1st June. Therefore, I suppose it was either a question of bringing it on this morning or of bringing it on tomorrow night. There may be good reasons in the Government's mind why they think it necessary to bring the Order


on this morning, but at least the hon. Gentleman might have said that he was sorry that it had not been before the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. I did not hear him say that he was sorry.</p>

<p>The Minister of State is himself falling into the temptation of getting heated. Perhaps I may be allowed to finish the complaint which I was putting.<br/>
My complaint is that the Minister of State, having been able to read the Order Paper just as well as my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby can read it, and having, presumably, noted thereon the statement that the Order has not yet been considered by the Select Committee, did not volunteer an apology. There is nothing to be ashamed of in having to apologise to the House, and it is much better to apologise before being called upon to do so.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has put himself in an unfortunate position. He is in charge of this business. He knows that the Order has not been before the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. It would have been better if he had said that he was sorry that it had not proved possible to have it considered by the Select Committee, and then, no doubt, no more would have been said about it. As it is, he will have to say that he is sorry after being pressed to do so.<br/>
Otherwise, I commend the Order. I hope that we shall have satisfaction on

the questions which my hon. Friends have raised about certain of its provisions and applications and that we shall have a full answer on the more important points which have been raised in debate.</p>

<p>I am not often annoyed in this Chamber, but I confess that the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Onslow) did annoy me. I have been here too long to take exception to anything that is said, but the hon. Gentleman was so ungracious and niggling, and that always annoys me. I have been in the House long enough to know that I should treat everyone with courtesy, and I have a strange habit of expecting the same myself.<br/>
Of course, I apologise to the House and to the hon. Gentleman that, owing to the time factor, we had to put this Order down for this morning and it has not been before the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments. I am a great believer in the authority of the House and its Committees being fully observed. It is always better if an Order comes before the House after having been before the Select Committee of which the hon.

<p>If we sat on Sundays, I should reconsider my postion; but I


rather like this place, and I hope that I shall not be driven to that point.<br/>
The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Kimball) is well known for his concern for the well being of animals. In the days when it was my privilege to serve at the Home Office, I had a great deal to do with the hon. Gentleman. Like hon. Members on both sides, I am an animal lover, and I hate cruelty to any living thing. I am not very fond of snakes, but I do not want cruelty to them, either. There may be need for a further Convention on the carriage of animals by air&#x2014;I do not know&#x2014;but, if such a convention were thought necessary, I am sure that both the hon. Member for Woking and his hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough would pursue the matter, and I certainly agree that it is our obligation as a country to do all we can to ensure the avoidance of suffering by any living thing. I would not oppose suggestions made to that end.<br/>
I have been asked some highly technical questions, and I shall do my best to answer them. I have had my "leg pulled" about a speech which I delivered to the House&#x2014;perhaps that is really what offended me; no one likes being caught out&#x2014;but I shall do my best now to answer the questions which have been put, and I shall draw to the attention of my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade the points which have been raised this morning.<br/>
The House has approved this Order in its application to the United Kingdom. All that we are doing now is asking that it shall apply to the dependent territories. That is why I was, innocently, put into this position, which is not an easy one, as a member of the Administration.<br/>
I have been asked about Gibraltar. My hon. Friend the other Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs returns today from Gibraltar, and I have no doubt that she will take an early opportunity to convey to the House the results of her observations.<br/>
I was asked why Aden is omitted. The hon. Member for Woking is quite right to say that this is a sensitive point at the moment. Consultations with the Federation of South Arabia have not been completed, but it is always possible to add further names, if necessary, to Schedule

5, and I am sure that there will be no reluctance to add the name of Aden if it is thought necessary and agreed.<br/>
Next, I was asked which dependent territories are not included in Schedule 5. First, there are the Associated States in the Caribbean, namely, Antigua, St. Kitts, Dominica, St. Lucia and Grenada. St. Vincent also is excluded. It was expected that St. Vincent would be an Associated State by 1st June. However, the new date is likely to be shortly after that. Swaziland is excepted; it has recently become a Protected State with full internal self-government. Next, there are the Protected States of Tonga and Brunei, for which we have never, I believe, legislated on this question.<br/>
Southern Rhodesia is excepted. It has its own legislation on this subject, and before I.D.I. we did not include Southern Rhodesia in our civil aviation Orders. We believe that the same thing as I said about Aden can apply there. If necessary, any name can be added at another time to Schedule 5. It is not, however, our intention to alter this legislation.</p>

<p>Can the hon.

Can he also confirm that it will be possible for a territory to be transferred from the appropriate Schedule of that Order to Schedule 5 of the present Order and that in appropriate cases this will be done?</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman be very kind and answer my question about communication with the Governor of Rhodesia on this matter? The hon.

<p>No. There has not been consultation with the Governor on this question, because hitherto we did not legislate on it for Rhodesia. It is considered that that must be a place which will have to wait&#x2014;I hope not too long&#x2014; until we have settled the question in Rhodesia.</p>

<p>Would it be fair, therefore, to say that the remark, made both in the other place and in the House of Commons, that we have consulted all the territories, whether mentioned in Schedule 5 or not, about what is proposed is not strictly accurate?</p>

<p>I do not want to argue with the hon. Member. Rhodesia is a very special field. The Governor is us; he is our voice. If we consulted him, we would be consulting ourselves. I am quite sure that the House will appreciate that the Governor represents this country. This is an Order which limits liability. In that sense, therefore, it is not directly concerned with the carriage of horses or tortoises. Its purpose is to limit the liability.<br/>
I was asked about the Governor making exceptions. The Governor will not be allowed to make exceptions in carriage other than carriage within his own territory. The order will not apply to carriage between his territory and elsewhere. If there is an exemption, the liability is unlimited, but the airline can then itself by contract arrange with the passenger the amount of the limit.<br/>
In reply to the hon. Member for Gainsborough, the Order does not apply to personal insurance slot machines. When I travel by air I nearly always use, or used to use, that kind of slot machine. I always felt that I was safe because I was covered for &#x00A3;20,000 and I was sure that I would never bring that money to my family. That is not covered by the Order.<br/>
The hon. Member for Woking was very kind to give his detailed answer about the

Islands. He helped to complete my education, too. As far as I am aware, in the Central Islands there neither is nor has been an airport; but one never knows. They may have one sometime. We would not want to bother the House&#x2014;I certainly hope that nobody will bother me&#x2014;to introduce an order of this sort again.<br/>
The hon. Member for Woking, who is very ingenious, raised the question of the New Hebrides. We have never legislated for the condominium of the New Hebrides and we cannot do so. I assure the hon. Member, however, that we will look into this question. I will look into all the questions which have been raised.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman was very kind to thank us for the improvements which have been made in the form of the Order. Whether it is necessary to have a combined version of all these Orders is not a matter for me but is an interesting question for whoever is responsible. I will see that the hon. Gentleman's views are brought to the notice of the responsible authority.<br/>
I was asked who was the consignee. On this, again, I shall have to write to the hon. Member, and it should be interesting correspondence. I promise him, however, that I will look into it. The question of prices and incomes and increased fares would have to be dealt with if it arose. It certainly has nothing to do with the passing of the Order this morning.<br/>
We have had a very good debate, much better than I expected when I was preparing myself, as my noble Friend prepared himself in another place. I earnestly hope that the House will now agree to pass the Order.</p>

<p>Clause 36 is the Clause which repeals certain Statutes and makes certain saving. Subsection (1) states that
<q>the enactments mentioned in Schedule 3 to this Act are hereby repealed".</q>
Schedule 3 sets out three Statutes and part of a fourth. In the table of comparisons, at least eight Statutory Instruments are mentioned as being subjects from which Clauses of the Bill have been derived: that is to say, existing law which has been consolidated in the Bill.<br/>
In previous Consolidation Bills, the repeal Schedule has mentioned Statutory Instruments which have been consolidated and which were repealed by the Consolidation Measure. The problem is even more puzzling when one considers subsection (2), which is the savings subsection, and which says:
<q>Nothing in this repeal shall effect any instrument made or any other thing whatsoever done under any enactment repealed by this Act &#x2026;".</q>
The Statutory Instruments in the Table of Comparison were made under Statutes repealed by this Act. They seem to be saved under subsection (2). Although we are told that they are consolidated elsewhere in the Bill, they do not appear as repealed in the Schedule of repeals, but seem to be kept alive by subsection (2). I should like an explanation of this point.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) has said, the Schedule refers to certain Orders, as distinct from Statutes, and they are not repealed. But they are Transfer of Functions Orders, which, in so far as we are

repeating the appropriate legislation, are spent. There is a number of these Orders under this Bill and under the Bill which we shall consider in a moment, which provide not merely for the transfer of functions but also for certain consequential matters.<br/>
They provide for the transfer from one Ministry to another of rights and liabilities and also for a reference to documents, which matters would not be covered by the Bill. If we repealed part of these Instruments, the rest of the Instruments would be extremely difficult to construe. Therefore, these Instruments have not been repealed but left in effect. As the hon. Gentleman said, they are saved by Clause 36(2). This is why the Bill has been arranged in this way. I hope that that explanation is sufficient.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that explanation, but it seems not to cover one of the Statutory Instruments, that from which paragraph (3) of Schedule 2 is derived, the British South American Airways Corporation (Dissolution) Order, 1952.

<p>Much the same point arises on this Bill as we discussed on the previous Consolidation Measure, but in a different way. Clause 15 is the repeal and savings Clause. Subsection (3) repeals three Statutes, and there is no Schedule of repeals. Three Statutory Instruments are mentioned in the Table of Comparison as subjects from which certain Clauses have been derived. Perhaps the Solicitor-General will explain why those are not repealed.<br/>
I raised on Second Reading the question of the wording of the savings Clause and whether this effected the evidently intended savings, that is, keeping alive previous Instruments, particularly Statutory Instruments. Subsection (4) begins with the words:
<q>Any approval, consent or direction &#x2026;</q>
The House will recollect that, on the last Bill we were discussing, the words "any Instrument" were used. I am puzzled by the different wording in this Measure. It may mean exactly the same thing and perhaps the Solicitor-General is satisfied. But we have got used to the word "Instrument" as referring to Statutory Instruments which have been made under previous Measures, consolidated in a Consolidation Bill, and kept alive by the use of that phrase The phrase
<q>Any approval, consent or direction</q>
does not seem to include Statutory Instruments And why is it necessary to have the breathing space provided by subsection (8) of
<q>&#x2026; one month beginning with the day on which it is passed"?</q></p>

<p>The explanation for the form of the Bill and for the reference to certain Orders on the table in the Schedule is the same as I gave when we were discussing the last Measure, and perhaps I need not repeat that explanation.<br/>
The hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) referred to subsection (4). Here, we are not merely dealing with Statutory Instruments. Because of the nature of the subject matter under the earlier Acts, approval, consents or directions may have been given and, therefore, it is necessary to save that in this Measure. The hon. Gentleman quoted the first few words of the subsection, but it states:
<q>Any approval, consent or direction given, any appointment made or any other thing done under or by virtue of any provision of the said Acts shall be deemed &#x2026;</q>
I advise the House that the words "any other thing done" cover Statutory Instruments, with the result that Statutory Instruments are saved by this subsection.<br/>
The hon. Member for Crosby then referred to subsection (8), which states:
<q>This Act shall come into force at the expiration of the period of one month beginning with the day on which it is passed".</q>
It would, of course, be possible to provide that the Bill should come into force on the day it becomes an Act, upon receiving the Royal Assent. It is, however, a matter of administrative convenience when dealing with Measures of this sort to have a certain breathing space so that those who must administer the Measure can familiarise themselves with it in its new form. It is a good thing for them to have it on their desks so that everybody concerned may know the new Statute under which they must operate before it comes into force.<br/>
That is why this is quite a common tradition in consolidation Measures, and I therefore invite the House to accept it.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for that explanation It is with some defer-

ence and respect that I question his interpretation of subsection (4). If he is hoping to include Statutory Instruments in the words "any other thing done" following the words
<q>Any approval, consent or direction given &#x2026;</q>
I think that he is stretching the <i>ejusdem generis</i> rule rather beyond its usual interpretation. I cannot be satisfied with that explanation and I hope that more definite words will be used in future in consolidation Measures.</p>

<p>I hope that the Solicitor-General can give me two assurances. Clause 6 is concerned with temporary borrowing powers. Could I have an assurance that the figure of &#x00A3;250,000 mentioned therein is exactly the same as that mentioned in the original Act and that the right hon. and learned Gentleman has not thought it necessary to raise the figure to meet modern requirements?<br/>
Clause 11 deals with certain powers in regard to projects sponsored by Government Departments and, in that provision, the Post Office is particularly excluded. Was the Post Office particularly excluded in the original Act?</p>

<p>I did not know that these points would be raised. Had I realised it I would have been able to provide a fuller reply.<br/>
If the hon. Member for Crosby will look at the Report of the Joint Committee he will see that the Committee reported that this Measure was pure consolidation, which means that the law is precisely what it was. It is only the form of the law, and not its substance, which is being changed.</p>

<p>I wish to protest at the form of the consolidation in Clause 1. It is a most difficult form of consolidation when one is referred to an Act and the Schedule to an Act which is being repealed in the very Schedule to this Consolidation Bill.<br/>
This means that anyone who reads this Bill is required to refer to a repealed Act, and that will not be found in print. It will not be printed in future editions of any current Statutes to which one refers. When an Act is repealed, Her Majesty's Stationery Office does not continue to print it. It will, therefore, be extremely difficult for anyone to find out what is meant by the Clause.<br/>
I cannot understand why it is necessary to make the consolidation in this form, that one should refer to Schedule 9 of the Industrial Injuries Act, 1946, and then, when turning to the Schedule of this Consolidation Bill, find that that Schedule is repealed. I hope that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will explain this in greater detail to the House and tell us why this has been necessary.</p>

<p>The Bill has been fully considered by the Joint Committee, on which all parties in this House are represented. That Committee contains practitioners in both branches of the legal profession. Those practitioners considered this Consolidation Measure and were perfectly satisfied with this form of the Clause. It would. therefore, be an impossible exercise for us in this House to do the Committee's work over again for it.<br/>
I respectfully inform the hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Graham Page) that I cannot see that the Clause raises any difficulty at all. In 1946 we brought

workmen's compensation to an end after many years. It had been a fruitful source of litigation. I suppose that no statutes have been litigated more than the workmen's compensation Acts. They were brought to an end and the system of industrial injuries was put in their place.<br/>
It was necessary to save the rights under the workmen's compensation Acts of those who had been injured and whose claims had been adjudicated before 1946. There was, therefore, included a saving Clause, which was Section 89 of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act, 1946. This Clause has a similar purpose. It simply saves the rights of those who are still entitled to benefit under the Workmen's Compensation Acts.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that these repealed Acts will no longer be printed by the Stationery Office. Of course, they will not, but I cannot imagine that that will cause any difficulty to anyone who has to interpret the Statute. The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that in my chambers and in his office and throughout the legal profession there are sets of statutes which are available to all of us and which go back for a very long time. They are available to hon. Members in the Library.</p>

<p>What then is the purpose of consolidation? Surely the purpose of a Consolidation Measure is to include in one document the law on a subject as it then stands. Here we are told that Schedule 9 of the 1946 Act will continue to apply to certain cases. Surely a better form of consolidation would have been to repeat that Schedule in this Consolidation Bill instead of leaving it to be found somewhere else. This is not consolidation; this is legislation by reference and it only makes Consolidation Bills that much less valuable to those who have to work with him.<br/>
As the hon. and learned Gentleman said, of course he and I probably have the old Statutes on dusty shelves in our offices, but that is not the purpose for which we are consolidating these Acts. When our clients come to see us, they should not have to ask us to get on the step-ladder and reach down from the


tenth shelf a Statute which contains Schedule 9 because the Consolidation Measure says that there is a Schedule 9 of the 1946 Act which still applies to the client's case. We ought to be able to refer to the Consolidation Measure and find the law as it stands on that day and as we have consolidated it. not needing to look further for the law. It would have been better to set out Schedule 9 in the Bill and to say that it applied to such and such cases.</p>

<p>Subsection (3), the last subsection in the Bill, says:
<q>This Act shall come into force on such day as the Minister may by order made by statutory instrument appoint.</q>
I appreciate that this provision was probably necessary when the Bill was first drafted, because the Bill includes certain matters which will be law under a Bill which has now passed through all its stages in both Houses and which is now awaiting Royal Assent. At that stage, one could not tell at what time this Consolidation Bill would reach this House and pass through all its stages here, and it was therefore proper to reserve the date on which it should come into operation.<br/>
But that hardly seems necessary now, and I would have thought that the Solicitor-General could have seen that this provision was removed. I dislike this type of subsection, because a Statutory Instrument appointing a time is not subject to any Parliamentary procedure and does not even have to be laid before the House. It is made by a Minister, and only those who are very observant of the various Stationery Office publications will notice that the Statute has been brought into force. I would have thought that we could have done without this subsection now.</p>

<p>I explained when we were dealing with the last Bill that it is sometimes convenient to have a period of grace between a Bill receiving the Royal Assent and its actual coming into force. It sometimes happens that a particular period is specified. With the last Bill, it was a month after the Royal Assent had been given before the Act began to operate. There are many precedents for a provision of this kind to say that the Act shall come into force on an appointed day. When dealing with matters of a good deal of complexity, it is convenient to have this degree of elasticity about the date when the Act comes into force.</p>

<p>Hon. Members will see that in the last item in the first column of the Schedule there is a blank. We have now reached the last stage of the Bill's passage through this House at which any Amendment can be made. Who is to fill in the blank? The blank appears against the Short Title of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) (Amendment) Act, 1967, and the reference is "1967 c." and then there is a blank.<br/>
This may be a very small matter, but it means that something will be printed in a Bill after it has received the Royal Assent which was not printed in the Bill when it passed through all its stages in the two Houses. We are left in the difficulty that we shall be asked to give a Third Reading to a Bill which contains a blank. Who is to fill the hole in the Government's bucket?</p>

<p>This is a very important matter. The Solicitor-General ought to take the Bill away and wait until he is able to fill in the blank. I understand that the Government have the happy knowledge that they have plenty of time on morning sittings and it is therefore very wrong that they should present to the House a Bill which is not finished, which is not fully written out, when they could easily withdraw it and fill in the blank later in this Session of Parliament.<br/>
We are being asked to agree to a Schedule which contains a table of derivations which is not even complete and the Solicitor-General ought not to ask for a Third Reading of the Bill until he has been able to fill that table. I hope that he will explain this position at length. This is exactly like being presented with a blank cheque and told, "We will finish the calculation if you just sign" The numbers, figures, dates and descriptions of the 1967 Act have not been filled in. I am reluctant to see a Bill go through incomplete like this.<br/>
I am delighted that the right hon. Lady the Minister of State for the Home Department is present, for she can tell the hon. and learned Gentleman that the Government have plenty of time in morning sittings. The hon. and learned Gentleman should withdraw the Bill and not ask for a Third Reading. My hon. Friends would not object if he did so and if he returned when he was able to fill in the whole table of derivations.</p>

<p>The explanation is quite simple. The hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr. Kimball) will see, if he looks again at the Schedule, that the reference where there is a blank is to the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) (Amendment) Act, 1967. That is a Measure which has passed through its various stages, but not yet received the Royal Assent. It is impossible to fill in the chapter number until the Royal Assent has been obtained. No one knows as yet what the number will be. That is the reason for the blank.<br/>
I would suggest that there is no room for an error here. It is merely a matter of filling in the number, and I find it difficult to believe that anyone will put in the wrong number.<br/>
It does not require any action by either House, because it is an addition which can be made as a printing correction. There is power to make printing corrections before Bills receive the Royal Assent. Such corrections are made by the Clerk of the Parliaments in the other place, and that is what will be done on this occasion.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-05-10a.1457.1" hansard_membership_id="7490" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32711" speakername="Mr. Graham Page" colnum="1457" time="">
<p>This cannot possibly be a printing correction. It has been left blank deliberately, and a

deliberate blank cannot be called a printing error which may be corrected by the Clerk of the Parliaments. It may seem to be a very small matter, but we know too well in this House that precedents are set by very small matters, and it may be that on some future occasion an important blank will be left. In this case, it is of some importance, and it cannot be passed over by calling it a matter for a printing correction. This cannot come within the Standing Orders allowing the Clerk of the Parliaments to make that correction.<br/>
May I ask when the Royal Assent is expected to the Bill? I can promise the hon. and learned Gentleman that, if he withholds the completion of this Committee stage and the Third Reading of the Bill until the Royal Assent has been given, we shall give it to him on the nod.<br/>
It is a very small matter of this sort which sets a precedent, and, on a future occasion, we may be told that, as this was allowed to go through as a printing correction, we must let something else go through in the same way. I protest strongly. I offer the hon. and learned Gentleman the opportunity that if, for example, there is any intention to have the Royal Assent to any Statutes today, the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) (Amendment) Act, 1967, can be included, and we shall give him the Third Reading on the nod. However, I am not inclined to allow a Bill of this kind to go forward with a blank in it.</p>

<p>The right of an individual to contact his Member of Parliament is generally a recognised and accepted part of our democratic procedure. Very often, during the efforts made to deal with a constituent's grievance, a situation is revealed which causes wider concern, and the value of an hon. Member's personal contact with constituents cannot be over-stated.<br/>
A few weeks ago, at short notice and under great pressure from the Lord Mayor of Norwich, I had to deal with the case of a young constituent of mine, a girl aged 17, who on a first offence had been convicted by magistrates and remanded in custody for a period of approximately three weeks pending reports and a decision on her future. The court was held in northern Norfolk. The place for remanding her in custody was Holloway Prison, London, well over 100 miles from her home.<br/>
I do not wish to name the girl. There has been quite enough publicity given to her case already, and I am pleased to inform the House that there has been a very happy result for her. I look forward to her developing as a good and useful citizen and, for reasons which the House will understand and appreciate, I shall not reveal her identity.<br/>
My concern is to deal with what, in my view, is the serious situation revealed in a letter to me from the noble Lord, Lord Stonham, dated 18th April, the final paragraph of which says:
<q>It appears that courts in London, East Anglia and the south-east of England have no female remand centre facilities, and the only place where a girl aged 17 or over can be placed is, therefore, Holloway. I understand that she is too old to go to a remand home where the age limit is 17 years.</q>
Up to that point, I had tended to be critical of the magistrates in the case, but that statement by the noble Lord altered the picture somewhat. On 27th April last, I tabled a Question to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, and his written reply said:

<q>The remand centre at Holloway for girls aged 17 but under 21 is now being brought into use. It is in the remodelled hospital, and is entirely separate from the rest of the prison. Adult women on remand at Holloway Prison are kept separately from convicted prisoners.</q>
He went on:
<q>I am considering whether more satisfactory arrangements can be made for remand accommodation for women and girls in the south-east, but I have to bear in mind the very heavy increase in the male prison population."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 27th April, 1967; Vol. 722, c. <i>322.</i>]</q>
Although young women on remand are kept separate from convicted prisoners and even the accommodation is an improvement on what used to be the case, the prison stigma remains. Furthermore, at this critical time, these children&#x2014; because that is what they are&#x2014;need parents or relatives readily available. Long-distance travel imposes a considerable burden on them, and not only a financial one, and parents are not always to blame in these cases.<br/>
If this is a remand centre, I pose these questions. Why give a prison number? Why has it a prison address, with "H.M. Prison, Holloway" on letter headings? Why lock up girls in their cells at 5 p.m. until next morning, and on Sundays at 4 p.m. until Monday morning? Then again, what about the dress&#x2014;thick seamed stockings, black flat-toed lace-up shoes, red cardigan, green-spotted blouse, and grey skirt&#x2014;in other words, a prison uniform?<br/>
I have considered this situation carefully and, to my mind, it all adds up to a prison sentence in advance and cannot be justified. Very few of these young girls basically are complete and absolute potential criminals. I speak as a father. In a young girl aged between 17 and 21, emotional upsets often lead to stupid actions needing great care, understanding and sympathy in handling the individual.<br/>
In my view, the situation revealed gives rise to serious concern. Shock treatment may help in a few cases but in many others serious and permanent harm can be caused. Many magistrates in East Anglia are concerned. The hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. J. E. B. Hill) is unable to take part in the debate and tenders his apologies because he shares my serious concern and gives


me full support in any efforts I may make.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman is under pressure from an important body of women in his constituency, including quite a number of magistrates, who have expresed their serious concern and I will quote from a local newspaper on the matter:
<q>Several members, including some whose personal experience as magistrates has given them an insight into the problem, took part in discussion.</q>
<q>It was emphasised that it was quite wrong that young people brought before a court and remanded for some special psychiatric or medical report should be taken to prisons pending their next appearance before the magistrates.</q>
The hon. Member for Norfolk, South will, indeed, be bringing pressure to bear in other ways.<br/>
It may be argued fairly and properly that the accommodation in Holloway is separate, but the fact remains&#x2014;and this is the serious factor which worries me and many others&#x2014;that the only remand centre for the whole of East Anglia, the whole of the south-east of England, which are both very large areas, and for London, for girls aged 17 and under 21, is Her Majesty's Prison at Holloway. That fact cannot be denied.<br/>
I appreciate the problems of the Home Office and all those who would like to see something done to achieve a better situation. I know how difficult it is for authorities when they want to set up a small remand home in an area. Immediately the local population rises up in protest. But we must face that situation. Some years ago, I had to face it when the Salvation Army wanted to put up a home in a so-called respectable neighbourhood in the area in which I lived. We had to fight but the home was set up and is now part of the local scene and is doing magnificent work.<br/>
I do not want to delay the House. I feel that I have a very strong and worrying case. I appreciate all the problems that face the Home Office in dealing with this serious situation. But perhaps, if there is some degree of publicity of this issue, the people who should look at the situation are in many cases the magistrates themselves who take decisions which place the Home Office in this situation. As I have said, I appreciate the problems but, even allow-

ing for all this, I cannot help but say and bluntly declare that the position is disturbing, worrying and shocking.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Wallace) for raising this subject because it gives me an opportunity that it is not possible to have during ordinary Question and Answer to say what we have been doing about this problem during the last year or two. I can well understand his anxieties about the matter. It has always worried me that young girls have had to be remanded in prison.<br/>
I make it clear that today we are discussing remand centres. Sometimes there is confusion in the minds of some people between remand centres and remand homes. Remand homes are for children under the age of 17 and are the responsibility of the local authorities. My hon. Friend will know that, only a few months ago, I was able to open in Norfolk a very good remand home provided by Norfolk and the surrounding counties for boys and girls under 17.<br/>
One aspect which my hon. Friend has not mentioned is probably more worrying than any of these which he did mention. This is that, on occasions, magistrates declare that a boy or girl under the age of 17 whom they are remanding is too "unruly or depraved"&#x2014;to use the words of the Act&#x2014;to be sent to a remand home and must be sent to a remand centre or, if one is not available, to a prison. This has caused me a great many headaches during my time at the Home Office.<br/>
We are today discussing remand centres, which were envisaged by the Criminal Justice Act, 1948. These centres were to be placed where boys and girls between the ages of 17 and 21 could be remanded in custody in order to avoid being remanded in prison. Unfortunately, progress in the 1950s was very slow. Not one remand centre was opened in the 1950s. Indeed, I often raised this matter, when I was in opposition, with the then Government and in 1961, during the passage of the Criminal Justice Act, 1961, I was instrumental in leading for the Opposition and defeating the then Government in Committee because of the lack of remand centres.


The first remand centre&#x2014;one for boys&#x2014; was not opened until 1961, which was 13 years after the 1948 Act setting them up. So my hon. Friend will appreciate the difficulty which has faced us because of the slowness in getting these centres started between 1948 and 1961.<br/>
All those that are now in operation for girls were opened in 1965. Those that are fully in operation at the moment are at Brockhill, near Birmingham, Low Newton, in County Durham, Puckle-church, near Bristol and Risley, near Warrington. Some of these also have separate accomodation for boys on the same site and some for women. Each block for the girls in the age group 17 to 21 is separate. Thus, by 1965, the whole of the country was covered except for the far South-West and the southeast of England, including London and Norfolk. For the far South-West, temporary accommodation at Exeter is available until there are additional places at Pucklechurch, which we are providing at the moment.<br/>
That leaves the area of south-east England, London and Norfolk. This area has given us a great deal of concern. It was announced some time ago that Hollo-way was to cease to be a women's prison and that the site was to be cleared and redeveloped as a remand centre to serve the whole of the South-East. Unfortunately, there has been delay with this project due to the increase in prison population over the last few years. But 18 months ago, when it was clear that we could not dispense entirely with Hollo-way in the immediate future, I investigated the possibilities of an interim arrangement.<br/>
I felt that we could not wait until Holloway was completely rebuilt in the way I have described. I looked around for some place where we could have an interim remand centre until the time when Holloway could be properly developed. We decided that what we could do quicker and in the best possible way was to take the old hospital at Holloway. This has now been shut off from the main building and redesigned as a remand centre. It is only partly in use as yet but will be fully in use in about eight weeks' time, when the decorations are complete. We took the opportunity presented to build a com-

plete new hospital for the prison and this has a separate entrance from the remand centre.<br/>
This new hospital is a great improvement on the previous one. The staff is assisted by visiting psychotherapists and specialists, including specialists in gynaecology and venereology, and is supported by nearby hospitals. I recently visited the remand centre and the hospital to see how it was going on and was very pleased with what had been done. I hope that my hon. Friend, who has been critical this morning, will visit the remand centre when it is fully in operation. I invite other hon. Members to visit it, because I am sure that they will be pleased with the accommodation provided.<br/>
This centre will be called the South-East Remand Centre. I know that many people, like my hon. Friend. feel that the word "Holloway" conjures up terrible things, but I hope that when he goes to the remand centre he will also visit Holloway to see some of the good work that is being done there, even in the old building. One wing is run on a group counselling basis, and there is a domestic training wing where full-time domestic training is given to those sentenced for neglecting children and others likely to benefit from it. That is by the way. This remand centre, as an interim measure, will be functioning within eight weeks, and I hope that my hon. Friend will take the opportunity to visit it.<br/>
My hon. Friend also raised the question of the distance that has to be travelled when someone from Norfolk was remanded in London. I recognise that girls may be some distance from home, but this is inevitable not only in Norfolk but in the rest of the country. The total number of girls aged between 17 and 21 remanded in custody at any one time is very small. On 30th April only 117 girls were so remanded in the whole of England and Wales. This is rather a high figure, because usually the numbers of such girls on remand are below 100. Even with five centres my hon. Friend will see that the numbers are very small. It would be quite impracticable to have more and to run units for very small numbers. Even where there is a remand centre for boys on the same site there are completely different establishments, which require staffing in different ways.<br/>
Norfolk is not alone in this matter. I represent a constituency in Yorkshire, and my hon. Friend will see from the siting of the remand centres to which I have already referred that there is not a remand centre in Yorkshire, and that girls have to travel either to Warrington, in Lancashire, or to Durham. With such small numbers involved, it is a choice between a few remand centres where the girls can be properly looked after, or travelling rather longer distances.<br/>
Most girls remanded in custody are remanded for medical and psychiatric reports so that the necessary staff must be available in or near the remand centre. They share medical specialists with other establishments, but there must also be resident staff for observation purposes.<br/>
When the Criminal Justice Bill, now before Parliament, becomes law, it is most likely that the numbers remanded in custody will be even fewer. At present about half of the 35,000 people &#x2014;adults and younger people&#x2014;annually remanded in custody do not, on conviction, receive custodial sentences. Some of them&#x2014;over 2,000 in 1965&#x2014;are not even convicted. This a matter which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary thought ought to be tackled in some way in the Criminal Justice Bill. In that Bill, which has now gone to another place, restrictions are therefore placed on the powers of magistrates to remand in custody. This means that the figure of about 100 girls aged between 17 and 21 who are remanded in custody at any one time could be fewer than this in future, when the Criminal Justice Bill is in operation.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that it would be unrealistic and impracticable to provide more than five remand centres for girls. As I have said, not only in Norfolk but in many other areas of the country girls have to travel some distance.<br/>
My hon. Friend raised the question of girls and boys being given numbers. It is necessary for proper documentation and statistical records that each person received in custody should be allotted a number. After all, there might be several Mary Smiths in custody at any one time. I can assure my hon. Friend that these persons are not called by their numbers; they are usually addressed by

their Christian names in girls' establishments of this kind. It is essential, however, in order to avoid mistakes, that numbers should be used.<br/>
The atmosphere in a girls' remand centre is not one of rigid disciplinary control on an impersonal basis. Girls remanded in custody are allowed as much time in association at work, in classes or at recreation, as circumstances or staff allow.<br/>
My hon. Friend said that girls were locked up This is not general, but a good deal depends on the individuals themselves perhaps I can have a word with my hon Friend on that matter later.<br/>
As for clothing, an unconvicted person in custody can wear his own clothing if it is suitable, tidy and clean. He can also have clothing sent in from outside by his relatives and friends. Only if his clothing is considered not suitable and when no clothing is sent in from outside for him is he provided with prison clothing, and then it is of a different colour from that worn by convicted prisoners.<br/>
I can assure my hon. Friend that we appreciate the problem. I hope that he will recognise that during the last few years we have made some strides, after a great deal of neglect. I hope that he and any other of my hon. Friends, or hon. Members opposite&#x2014;if there are any present&#x0021;&#x2014;will take the opportunity to visit the new remand centre when it is ready in a few weeks' time. I am sure that he will recognise that we have done everything possible to provide a very good building with adequate decoration, and that we have all the medical and psychiatric facilities available. I could not promise him, however, that we could have a lot of little units all over the country. This would be a completely unsatisfactory and impracticable arrangement.<br/>
It is a choice between travelling a short distance and having facilities available. We have taken this question very seriously. I have spent a great deal of time on it myself, because it is something in respect of which I expressed criticism when nothing whatever was done in the 1950s, after the passing of the 1948 Act. I hope that my hon. Friend will agree that we are doing everything we can and


will recognise that we take the problem very seriously.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. Friend not of the opinion that in the circumstances that apply especially in the area about which I am concerned, magistrates should at least be a little more careful in dealing with the sort of people about whom I have expressed concern?

<p>That is a very difficult question. As my hon. Friend knows, my right hon. Friend has no power to direct magistrates how to carry out their duties.

<p>No, Sir.

Those schemes have not yet been accepted for grant, but the work in the programme that has been approved will keep the county council busy for the next two years.

<p>I think that there will be; pressure at the graduate teacher level, but I would not agree that that is where the main pressure will be when the age is raised in 1970. It is rather more likely to be in practical and aesthetic subjects. But these figures, as the hon.

<p>The hon. Gentleman makes a very serious allegation when he talks of "indiscriminate dumping". There are procedures for dealing with this, if it were proved. I will certainly bring what he says to the attention of my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade. We are not unconcerned about the state of industry in north-east Scotland. The fact that in the North-East, in the area of Aberdeen and round about, the unemployment figure is less than the national average&#x2014;it is about 2&#x00B7;3 per cent. &#x2014;gives an indication that unemployment is less serious there than elsewhere.</p>

<p>None, Sir. Detailed arrangements for the conduct of the examination are a matter for the Scottish Certificate of Education Examination Board.

<p>Several <i>ad hoc</i> surveys of earnings in some of the new towns in Scotland have been carried out. I do not know what the comparison is with other parts, but I suspect that in the new towns there are, generally, higher incomes than in the older communities. I should add that the increases will not be made before the end of the period of restraint. In Livingston, in my hon. Friend's constituency, there will be no increase till May, 1968, and, in particular, we have been most anxious to ensure that arrangements for graduation of rent will protect lower-paid tenants.</p>

How is it possible to examine the rents in new towns in isolation from the problems of overspill, the problems of rent structures of all local authorities, and the rents now being charged under the Rent Acts in Glasgow and some other cities? Will he arrange for the Housing Advisory Committee to look into the whole problem of rents?</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend is actively concerned about the level of rents in Scotland. He has been in discussion with the Scottish Special Housing Association, as its recent announcement shows, with the new towns, and also with various local authorities which, from time to time, have asked for advice about the prices and incomes policy. The fact remains that we have heavy deficits not only in the new towns but elsewhere, and these have to be faced.</p>

<p>The House will not need to be told that I feel special pride in being privileged to make this speech on this day. We are about to set out on a course which, if it succeeds, will shape the affairs of our country and the lives of our people for generations to come. This is a responsibility which nobody can shoulder lightly. And I understand the mood which leads some of my right hon. and hon. Friends and some hon. Members on the other side of the House to counsel extreme caution.<br/>
The issues involved are of the greatest importance. What happens over any one of them could affect profoundly the lives and pockets not only of each one of us, but of our children and our grandchildren. For that reason the Government have done their utmost to assess the economic consequences before making this decision.<br/>
For this reason the debate so far has concentrated largely on these details. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has described both the care we have


take in the decision-making process and the balance of advantage and disadvantage as the Government see it. Subsequently in the debate there have been detailed analyses of the main problems with which we are faced in joining the Community. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs has talked about Commonwealth trade, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has dwelt on the problems for our balance of payments and the consequences for capital movements, my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has spoken of the agricultural problems.<br/>
In their speeches hon. Members in all parts of the House have taken up various points of detail and asked questions on them. My right hon. Friend the First Secretary of State will be replying in his winding-up speech tonight, but in opening this last day of this great debate I would like to stand back, as it were, and explain to the House how I see the broad issues which this decision involves us in.<br/>
Inevitably we have talked a good deal about the economic problems that would arise from going in, because these seem &#x2014;I underline the word "seem"&#x2014;to be quantifiable. But in all of these it is extremely important not to let the big issues get lost in a mass of technical, detail, and I submit to the House that this must be the keynote of our discussions this day.<br/>
The Community is not called the European Economic Community for nothing. Those who founded it&#x2014;Schumann, Monnet, Spaak; and happily one of those is physically with us today&#x2014;quite deliberately called it this, and quite deliberately directed its early efforts to economic considerations. But this was because they correctly saw that this was the way of attacking the political issues of a very divided Western Europe, not to speak of a very divided Europe. In making the decision today that Britain should join the European Economic Community, we an; also recognising that this is not only a question of a balance of economic advantage and disadvantage, but, above all, a step providing a greater political purpose for our Continent.<br/>
Many of the founders of the Community had, as their own personal driving force, the view of a federal

Europe. This idea has not progressed, and we are not ourselves asked to endorse it. The idea of political unity in Europe does not, I repeat, mean endorsing a federalist view of Europe.<br/>
Ever since the war, the European argument, if I may call it that, has always been near the centre of our political life. There has been in this country&#x2014;we have all felt it&#x2014;a steady and growing awareness that our future is closely linked with that of our neighbours on the continent of Europe.<br/>
To a great extent, of course, this has come about because of a sense of our changed position in the world. The development of the world means that there is no longer a place for imperial Powers. But we, a European country, still have a crucial and influential role to play in the world. And how we are to play it is really what we are considering today.<br/>
The opportunity we can now seize is to play our part in reasserting Europe's role in the world and with Europe, to reassert our own r&#x00F4;1e. After the cataclysm of the last war, it was inevitable that there had to be a period of recovery, of building up. Today Europe, if she wishes, is in a position to make herself strong enough to play her full part again.<br/>
Our first concern politically must be with the security of this country. Historically our security was centred on Western Europe. Today, if we join the Community, the rivalries within Western Europe which led to two world wars would finally be silenced. A seal will be put upon the reconciliation of deeply felt antagonisms by including as partners in a single entity the principal Western European combatants of those two wars.<br/>
But we have all in Europe realised since the last war that the security of our Continent is bound up with the security of a wider area; and needs the involvement of other countries and a wider North Atlantic Alliance. It has always been our view that Europe should be in a position to make its views on defence heard as effectively as possible within the Alliance. The way of doing this is something which we shall have to consider with all our European partners when the time comes. But I am bound to say, with reference to the remarks


of the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition yesterday, in particular his references to a European nuclear force, and, incidentally, the consequences for this of a non-proliferation treaty, that they were in my view dangerous, unwise and&#x2014;if he meant what he seemed to be saying&#x2014;not very well informed.<br/>
Within the world, and within Europe, there is another division, the one which separates East from West. There is already a flexibility in East/West relations. Attitudes are changing. And the building of unity in the West brings with it opportunities for healing the East/ West division which we must use to the full. The process has already started. In trade and commerce, culture, and in our diplomatic links at the highest level, we are coming closer together.<br/>
Of course, these first steps in improving relations between the two halves of our continent have only been made possible by the balance of power between the United States and the Soviet Union, and by the growing realisation in both those countries that mutual co-operation and understanding is not only possible but essential. But there is an inter-action here of cause and effect; for an increasing <i>d&#x00E9;tente</i> between East and West Europe will bring more confidence in its turn to the United States and the Soviet Union in their dealings with each other.<br/>
Together with the Western Alliance as a whole, it is our object to resolve the divisions of Europe in a just and equitable way and, on that basis, to enable Western Europe to live in harmony to our mutual benefit with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. And I am convinced that if Britain is a member of a united European Economic Community, the prospects of success of this whole movement towards <i>d&#x00E9;tente</i> will be immeasurably greater.<br/>
I believe that the same is true if the problems of the developing world are to be met. We in Europe carry responsibility&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>As my right hon. Friend is the spokesman for foreign affairs and, therefore, to some extent of defence, will he not enlarge before the conclusion of this debate on what was said by the Leader of the Opposition? Is there any way in which

the Government would agree, as the price of entry, to a joint nuclear command within E.E.C.? Surely we should have a statement from the Government about this.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-05-10a.1508.0" hansard_membership_id="1762" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29500" speakername="Mr. Brown" colnum="1508" time="">
<p>I have said what I felt at this moment needed to be said about what the Leader of the Opposition said. I have many other things to say, if my hon. Friend will allow me to continue.<br/>
As I was saying, the same is true if the problems of the developing world are to be met. We in Europe have a responsibility to seek to improve the lot of men and women elsewhere in countries that are far behind our own in terms of economic development.<br/>
The countries of Western Europe are already doing much, and it ought to be recorded that the Six's own record in this is admirable. In 1965&#x2014;the latest year for which complete figures are available&#x2014;the total flow of their official aid to the developing countries, expressed in terms of capital outgoings, both bilateral and by means of the Community's Development Fund, was worth approximately &#x00A3;520 million. I am leaving entirely out of account private investment and credit and dealing only with official aid. Here, therefore&#x2014;I say this because of what is sometimes said&#x2014;there already exists a positive and outward looking approach to this formidable problem of bridging the gap between the haves and the have-nots.<br/>
We can be proud, too, of our own record. Again taking 1965 figures, Britain's official aid to the developing world amounted to some &#x00A3;180 million, rather over one-third of the Community's aid. But none of us can sit back and say that we have done enough. Yet, the hard fact is that the magnitude of the task is being intensified all the time by the rapidly rising level of world population. The problem can only be met by the co-ordination efforts of countries working in this field. And our own ability to go on providing this vital aid and to increase this level depends on our economic health.<br/>
So there are two compelling reasons for recognising that the best way for European countries to help solve this particular problem lies in the co-ordination and pooling of our efforts. The result might then be not just a sum of what


we are each doing, but ultimately very much more than that.<br/>
It may be asked, as, indeed, it has been, whether the political objectives which I have set out cannot be achieved in other ways than by using the framework which is provided by the E.E.C. Certainly a number of ways have been tried already, and there are various organisations in Europe as evidence of this. But none of them is enough. We all recognise that. It is clear, I believe, to most of us now that the best solution lies in the European Economic Community&#x2014;the Community as it has developed after these ten formative years and enlarged to embrace as many other European countries as can and wish to join. By creating a customs and economic union among its members, the E.E.C. binds them firmly together at the roots: and at the same time it provides a framework for effective political cooperation which, we can be sure, will become more and more powerful as the individual members of the Community grow closer together.<br/>
To us in Britain this approach surely is particularly attractive. It is pragmatic. It does not set out to try to do everything at once&#x2014;like laying down the forms and details of political co-operation in advance. It does not involve us in federalist experiments which most of us feel do not arise in the foreseeable future.<br/>
But we have already made clear to our prospective partners in the Community that we would wish to be associated with any discussions on political unity at the earliest possible moment so that we can make our contribution to that straight away instead of waiting until the formal negotiations for joining are complete. We will certainly play our part fully in the political institutions that emerge from such discussions.<br/>
We have always recognised and have repeatedly said that joining the E.E.C. was not the only course open to us. As I said in our debate last year, for example, we could, among other things, look to some as yet unformulated Atlantic grouping, or we could "go it alone". These are possibilities, and of course, should we not succeed in our present endeavours, one or the other or a combination of them would have to follow. In my opinion, however, neither carries

with it the benefits that would flow from joining the Community.<br/>
Let us look at them a little more closely. "Going it alone" sounds very well. It has a good British ring to it: and, at first sight, it appears to have much to commend it. We could, it is said, retain our E.F.T.A. partnership and our Commonwealth trade; and we would not have to face any of the changes or balance of payments problems which joining the Community might entail.<br/>
I submit, however, that the reality would be very different. E.F.T.A. has been a great success. But its members have always had in mind that it was only one step along the road to the larger European market which all its members want. That aim is stated explicitly in the Stockholm Convention which set it up. If we turned our backs on the E.E.C. now, other members would not follow suit just to oblige us. Already Austria is negotiating association with the Community, and others, particularly Denmark, have made it clear that they want to join the E. E.C. as soon as possible. And so, too, has the Irish Republic.<br/>
That is the direction of the present movement. We are certainly big enough to move the other way, but we must not expect that all our E.F.T.A. partners would necessarily want to do the same.<br/>
In the case of the Commonwealth our trade in that grouping is, of course, highly important to us. Whatever happens we shall, of course, make every effort to preserve it, both in our interests and in the interests of other Commonwealth countries. But here also there are changes taking place. We cannot alone meet the needs of the Commonwealth. That is the reason why for some time the patterns of trade have been changing. Since 1958, when the Community was founded, our exports to Community countries have doubled in value, from nearly &#x00A3;500 million to rather more than &#x00A3;1,000 million, and they now account for 20 per cent. of our total world exports, and this despite the tariff barrier. Similarly, our exports to E.F.T.A. have doubled in the same period, from &#x00A3;360 million to &#x00A3;760 million. Our sales to E.E.C. and E.F.T.A. countries together have gone up from 25 per cent. of our exports in 1958 to 34 per cent in 1966.<br/>
In contrast our exports to Commonwealth countries&#x2014;here I am leaving out South Africa and the Irish Republic, who are still part of the Commonwealth preference area&#x2014;remain almost static in monetary terms, &#x00A3;1,257 million in 1958; &#x00A3;1,328 million in 1966&#x2013;7; as a percentage of all our exports they went down from 37 per cent to 25 per cent.<br/>
Therefore, we can certainly give ourselves no comfortable assurance that were we to abandon our approach to the Community, the pattern of trade would then start changing in the other direction. We might in those circumstances even find ourselves with the worst of both worlds, our trade with the Commonwealth decreasing and the opportunities in Europe reduced. The other countries of the Commonwealth, no less than ourselves, are already adapting to this changing pattern. Australia looks more and more to her markets in the East, to Japan and to America. Canada's trade has also become progressively more bound up with the United States. In Africa, Commonwealth countries are turning to the E.E.C. Nigeria has already reached an association agreement with the Community, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania are in the process of negotiating one. And in the field of aid, it is worth remembering, India, the largest member of the Commonwealth, now receives more aid from Germany than she does from us.</p>

<p>Consultation with the Commonwealth, as, of course, with our E.F.T.A. partners, has been continuous and full all the way through.<br/>
The world does not stand still. If we try to go it alone, we cannot count on our traditional trade just going on along its present lines.<br/>
But that is not all. I have left to the last what I believe many of us believe is one of the most compelling arguments against going it alone, the question of technological development. We are an industrial country living by our brains and selling what we invent and what we make. But brains, "know-how" and technological skills are not enough. It is a scale and specialisation that we need

if the prizes in this field are not increasingly to go to the United States and the Soviet Union. Both these countries have a large domestic market to which their technologically-based industries have immediate access. This in turn allows for a high-gearing of industrial development.<br/>
If we really are to tackle the technological gap between Europe and the United States, we have got to get together with other European countries and pool our technological knowledge and inventiveness. We are co-operating technologically to some extent with other European countries at the moment. We are doing this with Concord, in E.L.D.O. and in other projects. That I know, but if technological co-operation is to be really effective I believe that we must pool this knowledge and create new technological projects on a joint basis within one market, when we have a great contribution to make in this field.<br/>
And I should at this point like to mention something about another contribution, seldom mentioned but important, that Britain can make if we join the Community. We have in this country a particularly strong, responsible and democratic trade union organisation. One of the advantages that would flow from our membership of the Community is the intensified co-operation of the trade unions of the Six and our own trade unions. Some of those who fear the consequences of our membership can take reassurance from this fact, and from the fact that in the Community it will be our purpose to seek to ensure that trade unions have an important role to play both within the Community and in its institutions.<br/>
As I said earlier, there is a second alternative, that of what is called the Atlantic grouping but sometimes referred to as the North Atlantic Free Trade Area. This, too, the Government have considered. Leaving aside, if I may, the very pertinent question of whether our prospective partners in this kind of grouping want such an arrangement, let me say this.<br/>
We should, were it to come about, in any circumstances be a small country in a group which inevitably would be dominated by its one super-power member. Our ability to influence, not only world affairs but the very organisation of our own economy, would in these


circumstances compare unfavourably with what we might expect to be the case were we in an enlarged European Community.<br/>
Then there is the further possibility, sometimes mentioned, that of association status with the Community under Article 238 of the Treaty. It has been argued that in this way we might avoid some of the difficulties which face us if we apply for full membership under Article 237.<br/>
I do not accept this at all. In the first place, such a solution would be very half-hearted and defeatist. We should be forgoing a large number of political benefits which a united Europe would bring. But even more important, such a solution would mean that we would be joining a group in the development and organisation of which we should have no influence. We would be passengers on the train; but the driving would be done by someone else, and we should not even be able to decide where we wanted to go. We have never accepted an arrangement of that nature for this country, and I am pretty sure we would not want to do so now.<br/>
On this subject I would like to make two further points. We expect to get in: we would never have gone this far or got this far if we did not. I have just made it clear that in my view the alternatives to membership are second best. But at the same time, let me repeat, if we do not get in the world would not stand still. An alternative would have to be found, with all the widening of divisions that this would mean, and all who have to deal with this issue here and elsewhere now should, I suggest, take that into account.<br/>
Second, if we are in or if we are out, as my right hon. Friend said and as the Chancellor of the Exchequer yesterday said, our own success in life from here on must depend on our own endeavours. For all these considerations, the Government therefore have taken their decision. We feel sure of the way we ought now to proceed. Therefore, we call today upon this House to approve our decision so that we may apply straight away to join the Communities. We shall make our application short, clear, positive and to the point. In the application there will be no "ifs" and "buts", no conditions

or stipulations. We shall apply to join. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I anticipated that, if I may say so to my hon. Friends. What I have written out here is that some Members of the House may be concerned about what I have just said. It turned out to be an understatement. I think, therefore, it may help my hon. Friends if I ask them to recall Article 237 of the Treaty. It reads:
<q>Any European State may apply to become a member of the Community. It shall address its application to the Council which, after obtaining the opinion of the Commission, shall give a unanimous decision thereon.</q>
<q>The conditions of admission and the adjustments to this Treaty necessitated by it shall be the subject of an agreement between the Member States and the applicant State. Such agreement shall be submitted for ratification by all the contracting States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.</q>
What I think is too often forgotten is that this clearly means that although the application should be unconditional, entry will be on the terms established during negotiations leading up to an agreement.<br/>
In deciding on this particular approach we have had very much in mind the terms of the previous applications which was submitted in 1961. But I think it is generally recognised on all sides that we laid ourselves open to criticism&#x2014;and indeed were so criticised later on&#x2014;for not being sufficiently wholehearted about our application.<br/>
It is always a good thing to read the record&#x2014;for both sides of the House. The negotiation, in the terms of the Resolution of the House at that time provided for an application to initiate negotiations to see if satisfactory arrangements could be made. Our own probe, which we have already conducted and concluded, was directed to the same purpose. Now we intend to put in a clear, clean, and uncluttered application.<br/>
We have given much thought to the actual timing of our application. The strong arguments were against delay. Once we had reached our decision&#x2014;once this House reached its decision&#x2014;we wanted it to be clearly recognised for what it was. We want to join, so let us apply without any further prevarication. This was one argument.<br/>
Another was the need to put an end to the uncertainties of our position Of


course, uncertainties of another kind remain and will be there until the negotiations are successfully concluded. But our friends in the Community now know where we stand.<br/>
Delay would hold disadvantages for all of us. Both we and the existing members of the Community, for the reasons which I have just given, need to press on with the creation of a strong European technology; delay will only put us at still greater disadvantage with United States competition. But the advance in the technological field, which has now become a real possibility for Europe, requires commercial and economic decisions which inevitably depend on general confidence, both here and in the Community, that our application will succeed.<br/>
But the harmful significances of inaction or delay do not rest only within Europe. In those wider issues about which I have talked, removing tension between East and West, and tackling the problems of the developing world, time is against us. Every consideration points to the need to begin negotiations soon, to keep the process short, and to focus on the few major issues. We simply cannot afford to hang about.<br/>
For our part, we have done all that we can to meet these requirements. We expect that our application will be accepted and that the negotiations will be begun before the summer holidays. I expect to be able to make formal contact, clear the ground and agree on procedures so that, at the very least, we can get down to business in earnest and without any further delay when work resumes in the autumn.</p>

Friend the Prime Minister stated&#x2014;and I do not propose to repeat&#x2014;the four major issues which emerged as we went round Europe. There are many others which we shall find during our negotiations and which we must settle before we can commend an actual joining to the House There are others which we

could leave over until afterwards. It is impossible to lay those down. What my right hon. Friend meant&#x2014;and I am sure that those who went through some of the agonies before will recognise this&#x2014;was that we should not get cluttered up and bogged down in a mass of technical detail which, even if we reached agreement, is of no value if the application does not go forward anyway. Those are matters on which we shall be reporting to the House in due course, and we shall ourselves bear them in mind in our negotiations.<br/>
Great decisions such as those which we are being asked to make today involve a sense of history: they are more than a commercial calculation, and require both boldness and an instinct for political realities. In the last analysis, our decision to negotiate our entry into the European Communities is basically a political one; and, for the reasons I have given, I believe that it is the right decision. As my right hon. Friend said, it is a decision which will determine the future of Britain, and may well determine the future of Europe and even the peace of the world, for decades to come.<br/>
Membership of the Community will neither diminish us nor the Community. It will provide a wider field for our talents and a greater force for the common policies which we shall evolve together. Together the countries of Western Europe can play a part far greater than the sum of their individual efforts, and thus exert a beneficial influence on all the great issues of our time.<br/>
We aim to join the European Economic Community without delay. We make this application on the basis of mutual advantage. We hope to gain from membership, but we are equally aware and conscious of what we can contribute to the other members. The opportunity is with us all to combine to build a Europe worthy of her peoples. I pray that this opportunity will not be missed.</p>

<p>We have just listened to a typical speech from the right hon. Gentleman in which he said a lot of things with which many of us on this side of the House would agree. We recognise his genuine approach to this matter and his sense of history in the speech which he has made today.<br/>
However, we have had two consecutive speeches from that Dispatch Box&#x2014;the one to which we have just listened and the speech in winding up last night&#x2014; directed to the same Motion. They were made by members of the same Cabinet, pledged to the same objective, but utterly different in attitude, in atmosphere and, I fear, also in aim.<br/>
I gather from his speech today that the Foreign Secretary is anxious to find ways of getting in. He made that very clear. He said that we expect to get in and that our application will be short, clear, positive and to the point. The impression which was left on me last night by the Minister of Agriculture was that he was desperately seeking reasons to stay out. That was the impression which he left on the House&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>If the right hon. Gentleman were Minister, would he not seek adequately to safeguard the interests of British farmers and consumers? That is all that I suggested, and I gave an objective survey, which is in my White Paper.</p>

<p>If the right hon. Gentleman had waited a moment, he would have had an effective reply to that without having to intervene, because I shall he dealing with those specific issues and with his White Paper.<br/>
The impression which I had and which many of my right hon. and hon. Friends had was as I have just said. Indeed, hon. Members on his own side who are not keen to get in said afterwards what a good speech he had made. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman enjoyed the commentary from those hon. Gentlemen who do not feel the same way as he does. The impression was quite clear, and I thought that it was deplorable.<br/>
The question arises, then, whether these two members of the Cabinet can continue together on the same course, and the question arises for the Prime Minister, too. If he means what he said to the House on Monday in his long speech, can he afford to make his approach with what I can only describe as a dead weight in one of the key positions in the discussions?<br/>
That is the way I see it. It is not that the Minister of Agriculture talked of the high prices of certain key foods He did,

and he was right to do so. Many of us have referred to them already on a number of occasions. What gave us concern was his completely negative approach right across the board and so different from the approach which we have just heard. I want to deal with some of his arguments in some detail.<br/>
I would have liked and am sorely tempted to follow some of the interesting comments made by the Foreign Secretary, but if I were to do that I would weary the House too long because I must deal with some of the very big question marks left by the Minister of Agriculture last night. So it is no discourtesy to the Foreign Secretary that I do not propose to follow him closely today.<br/>
I want to make my attitude clear. Coming, as I do, from an agricultural background&#x2014;and a horticultural background&#x2014;and thus from the background of an industry most closely affected by the proposal to enter the E.E.C., I have long since embraced the cause of British membership of the Community.<br/>
I have not done so on agricultural grounds, or on the question of food supplies. I have done so on political grounds and the wider economic grounds to which the Foreign Secretary referred. Those are the grounds which first convinced me. Certainly, there may be an adequate future for Britain outside the Community, as the right hon. Gentleman said, but it certainly would be a better future inside the Community, and this is the overriding factor.<br/>
The Foreign Secretary referred to our grandchildren. Clearly, he was thinking in the long term, and rightly so. I agree that our grandchildren would sleep much more soundly in their beds if we were able to help create a larger European community&#x2014;and I believe that they would have better beds to sleep in as well when the economic advantages showed themselves.<br/>
I believe that the advantages of our going in are real, but if they are to be achieved then we have also got to accept the common agricultural policy and the higher food prices that this entails. This is a necessary corollary, and it is some advance on the road to reality that the Government now agree that this is so, for it is not so long since they were claiming that the common agricultural policy


could be amended to meet the requirements of this country to a very much larger degree than they now pretend.<br/>
Last November, the Prime Minister himself was still maintaining that some wide changes could be made. I will go further back, as some hon. Members have already done, in considering the Prime Minister's views about the common agricultural policy. In 1962, he said that it was an "autarkic monstrosity". But he is willing to accept it now for the wider benefits which will flow in other aspects of our life. We have long recognised what the right hon. Gentleman now acknowledges, that we have to accept the common agricultural policy. But we also recognise what the Government apparently do not yet recognise&#x2014;that if we are not able to go in, then we shall have to adopt new measures of agricultural support.<br/>
I say this by reason of the effect of the common agricultural policy on a country like ours, situated on the borders of the Community. At the last election we put forward our proposals to that effect, and I do not propose to go into them now. But I remind the Minister of Agriculture that at the time he was quoting very freely what he assessed as the total cost of the Tory policy on food supplies. He quoted it at &#x00A3;400 million. Nowadays, in relation to the higher costs, he talks largely in percentage terms and not in terms of the &#x00A3;550 million to &#x00A3;800 million, according to whichever figure one takes. I notice that difference of approach, as have others.<br/>
Because we recognise that it is necessary to come to terms with the common agricultural policy, we have for some time been pressing the Government to give us their clear assessment of what this would mean. We were given a few figures last November. The Prime Minister gave, in his first announcement, the broad effects as he saw them. We have had little since then until the last few days. But the new Select Committee on Agriculture did force some further estimates from the Minister of Agriculture a week or two ago and now we have the White Paper to which the Minister referred and which I want to analyse in some detail in one or two aspects. I apologise for this but, in view of the Minister's speech last night, I must put on record our feeling in the

Opposition on some of the points he made.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend has referred to the speech of the Minister of Agriculture on three occasions.

<p>No. I must get on.<br/>
The Minister of Agriculture was extremely defensive last night. I got the impression, both from the White Paper and his speech, that he is ill-informed at present about what is happening in Brussels. Maybe he did not want to know or did not want to get involved in discussion of certain of the matters.<br/>
Our delegation in Brussels is a good one, but it is very small. The Select Committee on Agriculture has been probing the staffing of the delegation, as the right hon. Gentleman knows. In fact, it has pointed out that our Ambassador in Brussels has been asking for further agricultural help ever since last October, and only yesterday one of my hon. Friends was told that the question is still under review. This is six months later. Yet there is need to keep in the closest contact with Brussels and to know precisely how the common agricultural policy is developing the whole time.<br/>
It does not seem good enough that the Government are not making the attempt to keep in this close contact, which is so essential in regard to knowing just how the new aspects of the policy are developing. This, I believe, is the key to some of the attitudes which the Minister of Agriculture has taken up in this regard. Last night, I interrupted his speech to


ask about developments in regard to an Annual Price Review, because he was paying considerable attention to this. I asked him to tell us more about how the Community is developing its own arrangements. He gave no effective reply. Yet there is an important story to tell. Why did he not tell it to the House? Does he know it or not?<br/>
The developments have been rapid ever the last few months. Although they have not the formalised arrangements that we have, they have agreed that they shall fix their prices annually, all at the same time, that this shall be done on the basis of reports by the Commission and that there shall be a two months' period during which producers' organisations can make representations. The decisions will then be taken by the Council of Ministers. Why did he not tell us this? I: would have helped materially to get a view in relation to how far they are going in following the system to which our farmers attach so much importance.<br/>
I find the White Paper an extremely disappointing document. Originally, I was a little puzzled about its authorship. But I think that this was made clear by the Minister himself last night. On at least three occasions he said that it was his White Paper. Usually, White Papers are produced on behalf of the Government, but he emphasised that it was his own. To be fair, he said that he and the Secretary of State for Scotland had produced it He said:
<q>There may be arguments about my White Paper, but we have tried honestly and objectively to present the facts &#x2026; We have tried to present objectively the facts as we see them &#x2026; I hope that my White Paper has been carefully read and studied by all hon. Members &#x2026; There will be those who accuse me of being negative in my approach &#x2026; "&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th May, 1967; Vol. 746 c. 1403&#x2013;4.]</q>
The right hon. Gentleman was clearly on the defensive about the White Paper, and I am not surprised when I look at its contents.<br/>
First, I do not dissent from the general conclusion which the right hon. Gentleman reaches in paragraph 73 of the White Paper&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>]&#x2014;I shall have some other comments to make&#x2014;that the aggregate net income of the industry could be expected to be about the same level as if we were outside the Community at present. There is no reason why that

agricultural net income should not be expanded by expanding production in this country.<br/>
I listened in vain last night for some talk of an expansion of home production from the Minister. On Monday the Prime Minister talked about this both in the House and on television, but the Minister of Agriculture did not. Perhaps he has forgotten that he still pays lip-service to the target in the National Plan for an increase in agricultural production of &#x00A3;200 million by 1970. Yet last night, in relation to the possibilities here, we never had a word as to what could be done about stepping up production.<br/>
In the earlier part of the White Paper, there is a very strange distinction in that whereas paragraph 13 refers to that part of Article 92 of the Treaty of Rome which talks of State aids which distort or threaten to distort competition and points out that this is a very restricting factor, there is nowhere in that paragraph a reference to the other provisions of Article 92, which are very important. The interesting thing is that while the White Paper is so selective in its reference to part of Article 92 the Minister quoted the other part in his speech yesterday. That seemed to be a very odd way of handling the matter. It added to the confusion.<br/>
This is a very important point to our farmers, because on it hinges a great deal of what we can continue to do through what are generally known as the production grants for our farmers. The main support for our farmers comes, on the one hand, from deficiency payments, and, on the other, from production grants. Production grants must be generally within the rules of Article 92 if they are to continue once we have got in.<br/>
A number of them will no doubt be able to continue and I hope that the Government will concentrate on this aspect in their negotiation as an important matter affecting many of our producers in areas which need more help than others. I hope that we shall have a clear assurance that this will be done, and that the full effect of Article 92&#x2014;both the part quoted in the White Paper and the part referred to by the Minister&#x2014;will be borne in mind in this regard, because a large sum of money is involved. It is clear that while we should be able to


continue some we ought also to be seeking back from the Guarantee and Guidance Fund of the Community such sums as we can reasonably claim to help in regard to production grants, too.<br/>
It is also important to remember that the guidance section of the Fund is being limited to a ceiling of about &#x00A3;100 milion. Therefore, as a country, we will not be able to get a large slice out of it. It would be wrong to seek to quantify a figure, but if the sum has to be separated out between a number of countries there is an obvious limit. Therefore, we must look to being able to continue a considerable number of our existing production grants if farmers in more difficult areas are to continue to farm effectively and get a better return.<br/>
Problems will arise in connection with creating a system whereby hill cattle subsidies can come within the terms of Article 92. Another very important subsidy for these difficult areas is the hill sheep subsidy. In this case there is no common agricultural arrangement. Therefore, the provision that those commodities which are not covered need not necessarily come under the effect of Article 93&#x2014;whereby controls are imposed&#x2014;ought to make it possible to retain the present position in respect of sheep farming, if need be. I see no reference in the White Paper to this subject.</p>

<p>Is not the answer that the price of mutton will rise so much that sheep farmers will need no assistance? The producers of sheep, beef and wheat will make a fortune, and the other producers will go bankrupt.</p>

<p>That may apply in the case of lowland sheep, but some hill farmers will have problems. If need be, it will be possible to provide assistance for them. I accept wholly the hon. and learned Member's point about lowland sheep farmers, but many hill farmers would express a very different view if he spoke to them on the subject.<br/>
There are many other paragraphs in the White Paper that I could pick up, but I want to concentrate on paragraph 26, which states the position in respect of cereal prices. Anyone who has studied this problem knows that the big diffi

culty will be the sharp rise in cereal prices which, while very pleasant to the arable farmer, will put up the cost of feeding-stuffs heavily for many livestock producers.<br/>
Paragraph 26 seems to give an entirely wrong assessment as to what the prices should be. I ask the Minister to have the whole matter looked at again, because these figures cannot be effectively substantiated in relation to the farm gate price. In paragraph 26 the White Paper refers to the comparable E.E.C. producer price, which I take to mean the farm gate price. If it is the producer price it could only be the equivalent of the farm gate price in this country.<br/>
The paragraph gives a price of &#x00A3;35 10s. a ton for wheat and &#x00A3;30 10s. a ton for barley. I have arrived at estimates substantially lower than those, but I have also seen other estimates. I do not seek to justify my own figures; I call the attention of the Minister to what appeared in a publication issued by one of our large industrial concerns&#x2014;I.C.I. It has taken the target and intervention prices and applied them to different areas. It shows that in the zone where the lowest prices are affected it would bring the farm gate price down to &#x00A3;31 15s. for wheat and &#x00A3;27 4s. for barley&#x2014;very much lower prices than the Minister has given.<br/>
Other estimates which I have obtained from Brussels, although not so low as the I.C.I. figures are lower than the Minister's. If his figures are wrong it invalidates the whole of his argument about the livestock position.</p>

<p>My figures are not wrong. In an article in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> on 2nd May the right hon. Gentleman repeated the argument that he is now using. He then gave an incorrect intervention price in Duisburg. He has taken no account of the seasonal price scale. He has been wrong in print and he is wrong now.</p>

<p>I have checked these figures from the Community&#x2014;about &#x00A3;33 for wheat and between &#x00A3;28 and &#x00A3;29 for barley. The Minister has to substantiate them. He has not got the true farm gate price and it is the farm gate price that


matters, and not just the intervention price, because the intervention price is the wholesale price.</p>

<p>It is no good the Minister's waving this away. On this whole question he has a wrong basis, and this affects the estimates that he makes in the succeeding paragraph, about profit on livestock, in which he tries to paint a much blacker picture than need be painted, relying on figures which I have told him are not acceptable. I demand that he looks at this again and justifies his figures as those paid to the farmer at the farm gate, which is quite different to a general intervention price at wholesale level. This invalidates most of the rest of I he estimates in his White Paper; I believe that the picture for livestock will not be as black as he tried to paint it.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman referred also last night to milk and appeared to be predicting grave difficulties, though he qualified this to some extent later. But he made no mention of the changing pattern of production, for instance, in regard to summer milk supplies. He must know, as anyone in the business does, that if stimulus were given to greater summer production, this would be much more profitable than the price level which he spoke about. He concentrated on the winter milk, which is clearly the unprofitable aspect, and did not mention the summer prices which would be given. His general assessment was unnecessarily pessimistic, as were all his remarks in this regard.<br/>
The Minister spent a long time on the White Paper and I feel obliged to do the same. He gave the figures which we have heard many times of a&#x00BD;&#x00BD; per cent. increase in the price of food, but why has he not estimated this so as to give the housewife a clearer picture of what she would have to pay? He gave some food prices which would go up sharply, but did not give a clear estimate, arising from the White Paper's global figure, of what this means as a weekly addition to the cost of food for the average housewife. This is what matters to her.<br/>
Working on the basis of the figures which the Government have produced

and checking them against a number of other estimates which produce roughly the same total, over an average of five years, it may be shown that the increase in cost of food to the housewife will be about 5s. a head per week. If it were five years, this would mean an increase of 1s. a week each year for five years on the weekly household food bill. This is far more realistic than the Minister's odd figures last night, when he talked of those which would be sharply affected, like butter and meat. If his own figure of 10&#x2013;14 per cent. in the White Paper is correct, this is what it means for the housewife and this is what she should be told in order to get the fair picture.<br/>
This, then, is the position in regard to food supplies generally. Of course, there would be money available from reduction of deficiency payments which could be used to help those receiving grants from the social services and there should be some available from the Government to help the housewife who does not get social security payments. This would mean that it would reduce her cost of goods in other ways while the cost of food was going up. It is a pity that the Minister did not give a more balanced picture. This stems from his antipathy to the whole question.<br/>
A final important aspect is the balance of payments. It is true that 90 per cent. of the levies must be paid over to the Fund and, as we shall be importing more food than any other country, we shall be paying more, but the levies equate at present only to about half the total payment into the Guarantee and Guidance Fund. If we pay a large percentage of the levy, surely we could contrive that our percentage of payments on the direct payments are very low. We should thus be able to balance off the harsh impact of our having to pay an unfair share because we are high importers.<br/>
This is not a matter of the greatest difficulty. Of course, we must consider with the gravest concern any addition to the balance of payments, but if the Minister's own proposals for increased agricultural production, which has been talked about but which has not been achieved&#x2014; an increase, he claimed, of &#x00A3;200 million-worth of food by 1970; I cannot see how that will be done now, but it is certainly


possible&#x2014;it will mean a further substantial saving on the balance of payments which should be offset against these payments for food.<br/>
The saving would be not merely on the levy but on the total cost of food, if it is produced at home. There may be some offsets, but the bulk should be saved. This seems to be the sensible way of tackling this and it is regrettable that there has been stagnation in agricultural production recently.<br/>
I agree with what the Minister said about fishing, that we must get agreement about fishery limits and access to fishing grounds. There should be no difficulty, because the problems are mutual. No decisions have yet been taken and we can start here at least with a clean slate. I hope that this will be dealt with adequately.<br/>
Horticulture's special problems have always been recognised. Not only do our horticultural producers rely on tariff protection for most commodities, as opposed to the normal agricultural support system &#x2014;there are quotas for one or two, like apples and pears, but in the main it is tariffs&#x2014;but their main competitors are in the existing countries of the Community. At the end of the transitional stage, therefore, our producers will be exposed to unrestricted imports from their main competitors. This problem may be common to many industries which will accept this new challenge, but there is a special factor for horticulture which puts it in a category of its own.<br/>
The climatic advantage of a considerable part of the Common Market enables them to produce horticultural crops earlier and much more cheaply than we can. Horticulture covers a wide range of production, not all of which will suffer. For instance, many green vegetable crops grown in the open here are unlikely to suffer heavy increased competition. They are mainly bulky and of relatively low value, which would make their transport from the Mediterranean an expensive addition to production costs.<br/>
Some types of our greenhouse production could compete on level terms, if&#x2014; it is a big "if"&#x2014;substantially more money were invested in capital improvements to take advantage of the latest knowledge gained from research. There

will, however, be a large number of horticultural producers who will have to compete in impossible conditions. It may be possible to help, through negotiating longer transitional arrangements for certain specified crops, and there is also, in addition, already a Horticultural Improvements Scheme, through which a good deal more Government assistance could be channelled to help our horticulturists meet this new competition.<br/>
Whatever is done, it is likely that a substantial number of growers, many operating on small units, will be unable to face competition with products from the shores of the Mediterranean. The Government must face this special responsibility. These people cannot compete on level terms and must not be sacrificed in the wider national interest. The Government's responsibility should be met wherever necessary by appropriate compensation for those who have to give up which should clearly be paid for defined types of production, and as a lump sum, either to enable the individual to sell out and take up some other form of livelihood, or, if he wished, to adapt his holding to some other production where he could compete.<br/>
The sum allocated might help to put him on his feet again, but the Government should accept this special responsibility and discuss with the industry's leaders how such help could be given so as to be fair both to the grower and to the taxpayer. The horticulture industry deserves this special recognition.</p>

<p>Before the right hon. Gentleman leaves the question of farming, he will recall that last night he challenged the Minister and asked him what length of time he thought would be needed for the transitional period. My right hon. Friend replied, in effect, "As long as possible". What length of time does the right hon. Gentleman consider should occupy the transitional period? Earlier he mentioned five years. Does he consider that to be about right?</p>

<p>&#x2014;and they have claimed that it would be an embarrassment to say how long. I would not wish to embarrass them any more than they wish to embarrass themselves. Thus, while I gave an estimate of the time that I thought would be required in regard to food price increases&#x2014;and I suggest that that might be a reasonable figure&#x2014;I would not like to tie the Minister's hand. If he can get longer than that, all the better. I thought that the time I gave was a reasonable period, considering food price increases in this country.</p>

<p>I regret having taken so long to detail this point, but in view of what the Minister said last night and in view of the White Paper which he published, I thought it essential to make these various points clear straight away. The right hon. Gentleman's speech last night did a great deal of harm and unnecessarily disturbed people on the production side, as well as consumers. He must accept responsibility for that. Why did he do it? Others will, no doubt, be contemplating that question. I am not going into the inter-scene problems on the benches opposite, except to say that it seemed a strange way for a Minister to behave on an important matter like this. I prefer to approach it in the manner in which the Foreign Secretary approached it.<br/>
My assessment is that if we go into the E.E.C.&#x2014;apart from the transitional points involved&#x2014;we should work towards solving these problems, but also towards a Price Review system which, in any case, is well on the way to achievement. I hope, too, that our growers will make closer links with C.O.P.A., the organisation in Brussels which draws together different producer organisations of the Community, and we should start to work out the practical problems from the growers' point of view. I look upon these as essential preliminary matters.<br/>
There are a variety of other matters, some of which I have mentioned. I have indicated the way in which the balance of payments problem should be tackled. As for the cost of food to the consumer, I have given my analysis, and I stand by it. Indeed, I suggest that it is more realistic than that of the Minister. As to the problems that arise in addition to these problems, there are many detailed matters, many of which can be taken up through the negotiations in the way in which the Foreign Secretary described. I hope that the negotiations will not be too long drawn out. Nobody welcomes the sharp increase that could take place in certain food prices, but if there is a reasonable transitional period, I believe that this can be dealt with.<br/>
If the benefits, if we go in, are substantial&#x2014;as many, including the Foreign Secretary, have claimed&#x2014;I would say that there is nothing on the agricultural side and nothing on the food side that need prevent our entry; that is, given those factors to which I have referred. The hardships on consumers can be mitigated and the problems concerning our balance of payments can be eased by higher production at home; and for the farmers, there will be opportunities as well as problems.<br/>
The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food concluded his speech last night by saying:
<q>I hope that what I have said will be sufficient to convince the House that we have overlooked none of these problems."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th May, 1967; Vol. 746, c. 1414.]</q>
If we are to seek to go into the Community, I suggest that we need look not only at the problems but at the opportunities as well. This necessity was so notably lacking in the Minister's speech last night. I prefer, while looking at the problems, to look at the opportunities as well. I believe that this is the feeling not only of the majority of Ministers in the Government but of the majority of hon. Members in the House and of the majority of people in the country.<br/>
I hope that the Motion will be supported to the full. I do not often choose to go into the Lobby with the Government. I do so tonight gladly.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Godber)


will hardly expect me to follow him into the complexities of the agricultural policy. I have sometimes regarded myself as an expert on many topics and have ventilated my views in the House. I recall one occasion when, from the Opposition Front Bench, I made a remarkable speech on white fish, which has some bearing on the topic which the right hon. Gentleman has been discussing.<br/>
I gather from the right hon. Gentleman's observations that he does not trust the present Government. Why he is going into the Lobby with them tonight, I cannot say. I have some doubts about the Government myself, but as regards their general overall policy, I am one of their most loyal and devoted supporters.<br/>
I note also that the right hon. Gentleman has thrown the farming community overboard. It is not very long since the Opposition threw the Commonwealth overboard. The Tory cargo has been slowly and gradually jettisoned; and now there is hardly anything left&#x2014;that is, except to support the Labour Government.<br/>
Before the right hon. Member for Grantham addressed the House we had a remarkable spate of oratory. There were many eloquent, cogent and logical speeches made by hon. Members on both sides of the House. Many speeches for which many of my hon. Friends were responsible contained reservations about Government policy in this matter. In my view&#x2014;and it is only my opinion, for what it is worth&#x2014;they had the best of the argument. After all, they had no reservations. All the reservations were on the side of those who support the Government. There was much more certainty on the side of those who object to the Government's line of country. I, of course, recognise that they must be grateful to several Ministers who addressed the House, none more so than my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. We recognise that when he addressed us last night he was performing a most difficult and embarrassing operation, but he did it with remarkable courage.<br/>
It has sometimes been suggested by the newspapers, even the newspaper which I understand is exclusive to the top people&#x2014;I shall not give it a gratuitous advertisement&#x2014;and demands have

been made&#x2014;strident demands, blatant demands, firm demands, strenuous demands, that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture should resign. I beg him to do nothing of the sort.<br/>
On the other hand, if some right hon. Gentlemen, almost the hierarchy of the Labour Government, were to resign, I could bear it with my customary fortitude. If time permitted, I should like to occupy the time of hon. and right hon. Members by running over&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]&#x2014;I am not speaking physically but intellectually, and in an assembly now cluttered up with intellectuals it is surely permissible to run over in that sense.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, in that remarkable speech last night, made it clear beyond a peradven-ture that problems of the most intricate, grave and profound character have to be considered, and eventually negotiated, before we decide to associate ourselves with the countries of the Six. Better to have this frankness than concealment&#x2014; the House is entitled to frankness, and so is the country. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs spoke. I have the highest regard and respect for my right hon. Friend. He and I had the fortune to co-operate when I happened to be Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party. It was, I assure the House, a most harmonious co-operation. I should have preferred it to have continued, but occasionally one is the victim of circumstances over which one has no control whatever. But that is another story, to be unfolded perhaps, in my next volume of autobiography, or, who can tell, perhaps by my biographer some day when I have shuffled off this mortal coil.<br/>
But my right hon. Friend made one observation to which I must take exception. He said that there was no incompatibility between associating with the Si.x and our devotion to the Commonwealth and the continuation of the Commonwealth. I am bound to say that, whatever may be the view of Her Majesty's Government, that is not the view of some members of the Six. It is doubtful whether it is the view of General de Gaulle. It is certainly not the view of M. Pompidou, the present French Prime Minister. And I have before me the


opinion expressed by M. Pisani, who was at one time the French agricultural Minster. He has been a Minister in the Gaulist Government, but recently resigned. He said:
<q>Britain could not enter the Common Market without abandoning the Common-Wealth if she respected the Treaty of Rome.</q>
It may be easy to dismiss that as a casual observation, but these are the people with whom the Government have to treat. I therefore beg my right hon. Friend to pay a little more attention to what is being said on the other side&#x2014;on the Continent.<br/>
Then there is my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I listened to him yesterday with almost rapt attention. I was absorbed in his glowing account of the remarkable economic and financial improvement that is taking place in our affairs. We are paying off our external debts. Day by day we are hurrying to pay off the debts. It might all have been said in the recent Budget, but it was left over for this occasion. Had it something to do with our application for membership of the Common Market? Was it the prelude, the overture, the paving of the way? "Look at our financial position. Look at our strength. Why keep us out?"<br/>
But when my right hon. Friend spoke about paying off the external debt I could not help reflecting at the time, and have asked myself since: why not pay off some of the internal debt? For example, if there is so much money floating about, what about paying off the post-war credits? Or why not pay some of the back pay to which a large number of workpeople are entitled as a result of negotiation? I dismiss the Chancellor of the Exchequer for a moment&#x2014;or, perhaps, for the whole of this proceeding&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, not for good. We have to put up with him, whether we like it or not.<br/>
Having made those few observations, I should like to remind the House of the criticism to which some of us have been subjected. We have been called all sorts of names. I have been accustomed to that for many years, and have survived, but some of the things that have been

said about some of my hon. Friends and, in particular, about myself, deserve a reply.<br/>
We have been described as "Little Englanders", as anti-Europeans, as being obtuse, obdurate, obstinate, perverse&#x2014; and, worst of all, as ancient Britons. I am proud to be a Briton&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]&#x2014;and I mean what I say. As for being ancient, it is not my fault. It just happened.<br/>
I have received since the beginning of the discussion&#x2014;it began a few weeks ago&#x2014;more than 1,000 letters, all individual letters. I have almost thought of asking the Postmaster-General to allow me to buy a sub-post office. This has become something of a burden. I have received many letters from people in the country who describe themselves as "Ancient Britons". Some of them have suggested that we might form a club. I do not want to frighten hon. Members, but some have suggested that we might form an Ancient Britons Party&#x2014;remember, there are more than 6 million of them, all ancient Britons&#x2014;a formidable, powerful organisation that we might create. In a period of time when there is disquiet about the decline of Parliamentary democracy and the decline of Parliament itself and when many people say that neither this Government nor the previous Government, neither the Labour Party nor the Tory Party are capable of dealing with our problems, there is an opportunity. I might even become president of this Ancient Britons Party.<br/>
I do not want to frighten hon. Members too much, but I received one letter to which I direct attention. Perhaps I had better read it. Someone wrote to me:
<q>You may be an ancient Briton &#x2026;</q>
I say this to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer). I did not make this point. This is the letter sent to me, I assure him. I do not wish him any harm, but this is what the writer said:
<q>You may be an ancient Briton, but a heifer usually finishes up as an old cow.</q>
In deference to my hon. Friend I shall not read the rest, but I am bound to say to him that, ancient though I am, I am no expert in medical diagnosis and I


wish him no harm. He will be very fortunate if he becomes an ancient Briton.<br/>
It is about time I addressed myself to the subject of the debate. In doing so I am bound to make some reference to the probing activities of my two right hon. Friends, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary. I have sometimes wondered whether in the course of the probing activities they actually discovered what the French objections were to our membership of the Common Market. I have also wondered whether it was not perhaps a trifle humiliating to go appealing to the French in the way that has been done. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister wrote an article in the <i>Sunday Express</i> in 1963&#x2014;the <i>Sunday Express</i>, a Beaverbrook newspaper; hon. Members know what they are.</p>

<p>The article said:
<q>Next month Mr. Harold Macmillan goes to Rome, His purpose: to beg the Italian Government to do its best to help Britain into the Common Market. It is a humiliating trip for a British Prime Minister, and one that hardly bodes well for the strength of our position if we actually join the Six&#x2026; Mr. Macmillan is making another attempt to buy support for his Common Market bid, which is not only humiliating but profoundly perilous.</q>
Then there is this extract from HANSARD:
<q>the impression created, not least by the Prime Minister &#x2026;</q>
That was Harold Macmillan&#x2014;
<q>this is a serious aspect of it&#x2014;was of a Government falling over itself to get into Europe at almost any price."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 8th November, 1962; Vol. 666, c. 1273.]</q>
That is what I am afraid of, to get into Europe at almost any price. I am not going to follow the line taken by other hon. Members and to retail the process of conversion for which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is responsible. I understand the evolutionary process. There was a time when my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister might almost have been described in this context as a reluctant debutante, an opponent, a definite, vigorous, active opponent of entry into the Common Market. Now my right hon. Friend appears as a supporter with reservations and doubts.<br/>
I had better leave the narrative of what has happened in the past and the statements which have been made in the past. They are a bit embarrassing. But there is one which I think ought to be read. It is a statement made in Montreal in 1964. I shall not give the whole of it but a part referring to the conditions stipulated by the Labour Party. Apart from erosion here and there, it still exists, as indeed the Prime Minister himself and the Foreign Secretary have admitted, and that should be emphasised. The Prime Minister said:
<q>Those conditions were then, and are now, the only conditions on which we were, &#x2026;.</q>
Please note this&#x2014;
<q>or 'at any future time will be, prepared to consider entry into the European Economic Community.</q>
"Or at any future time", that is now, next week and during the negotiations. Definite assurances, stipulated conditions, firm, pragmatic&#x2014;we can use many adjectives about this, but that is clearly understood.<br/>
I come to what I regard as the crux of this problem. I should like in that context to refer to the remarkable speech made by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. When the right hon. Gentleman was engaged in his negotiations a few years ago and I frequently questioned him and argued against him, as he well knows I always admitted his integrity. There is no question about that. He believed in what he was doing. Perhaps I should say this. It is something of a disgression but I think it ought to be said. I respect the sincerity of every hon. Member who takes part in this discussion. I understand it. Difference of opinion does not mean that one has no respect for the opinions of others. I recognise that.<br/>
I recall the situation in which Ramsay Macdonald found himself in 1931. Frequently I have been asked what I thought of his quality at the time and how he felt about it. My reply has always been that he believed that he was doing the right thing. I disputed it with him at the time. I told him to remain Leader of the Opposition. He was furious with me. I had been intimate with him for a long time. He believed he was right. I believe that is the case with the Prime Minister, but in the case of the Foreign Secretary he believes when he wishes to believe.<br/>
Surely hon. Members who listened to his speech today must agree with that. He made no new contribution to the debate. It was a repetition of what is familiar to every hon. Member who has followed these discussions, but of course the Foreign Secretary has integrity. There is no question about that. I do not doubt that for a moment. He is a dedicated European and always has been. He is desperately anxious to get in. He is flushed with feverish anxiety to get in. The problem is: how far will he go in negotiations in order to get in?<br/>
That is why I propose, as I have intimated, to refer to the speech made yesterday by the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition. Before doing so, I want to refer to a statement made by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in answer to myself, when I asked him some weeks ago whether he regarded entry into the Common Market as the road to political unity. He disputed that with me. I have his reply here. My right hon. Friend said that there is nothing in the Treaty of Rome which compels us to accept political unity; there is no political objective in our minds. He has changed his mind since. If that is disputed, I can read his answer.<br/>
I can understand that over a period of time, after reflection, meditation and consideration, and after trying to understand the problem, one changes one's view. But this is the kind of thing which, it might be said, is like the man on the flying trapeze. This is an acrobatic feat which we never expected to happen. Only a few weeks ago my right hon. Friend said that there was no question of political unity. Now it is the objective; and I have always believed that it was.<br/>
During the discussions which took place a few years ago I never objected to some kind of economic understanding&#x2014;a reduction in tariffs, commercial arrangements, technological improvement, anything of the sort. We have to live with other people. Multilateral trade, bilateral arrangements&#x2014;of course; we all understand that. But political unity of the type which some of those represented in the Six have in mind I have always strongly objected to.<br/>
I have before me a copy of "The Round Table" issued in January of this year, so it is comparatively recent, on this subject of political unity, which con-

tains a statement made by one of the founders of the Economic Community, M. Spaak. I will read what he says. It ought to be understood, because it is of the utmost importance in trying to ensure a correct appreciation of what the objective is and what we are up against. M. Spaak says this:
<q>At this point, a very important question has to be raised. If Great Britain is one day to join the Treaty of Rome, is she ready to accept all the political implications? Is she prepared to pursue step by step the stages which would lead to a united political Europe? In 1963, Mr. Heath was categorically affirmative on this point".</q></p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-05-10a.1538.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Hon. Members" colnum="1538" time="">

<p>That is perfectly true. M. Spaak continues:
<q>and his statement greatly facilitated the negotiations. What is the position now? I must confess that it does not appear clear to me; and yet it is essential that all misunderstandings and uncertainties should be dispelled. If Great Britain wanted to limit her adhesion to the economic clauses of the Treaty of Rome while rejecting its political objective, we would be placed in an extremely difficult situation.</q>
I hope that my hon. Friends who are prepared to accept some economic understanding with the countries of the Six, but who strongly object to a political objective such as M. Spaak refers to, and who do not want a European Parliament, a supranational government and the subordination of Westminster which would be bound to happen eventually, will take note of what has been said. This is the view I have always held. It is nothing new.<br/>
What is the implication of it all? It arose yesterday in the course of the debate when the Leader of the Opposition made a statement which I shall now read. There was a bit of an altercation between the two Front Benches over this. The Leader of the Opposition said that he thought that my two right hon. Friends were a bit shocked at what was said. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said:
<q>We have said that we will support the Government in their application. Having gone through these negotiations myself, I do not wish to see our present negotiators subjected to the sort of things that we were subjected to. I know what is means."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th May, 1967; Vol. 746, c. 1302.]</q>
I should like to ask the Leader of the Opposition: what was the obstacle in 1963? What was General de Gaulle


objecting to? Was it some economic adjustment? Was it some matter of agricultural policy? Could it possibly have been something like this&#x2014;I have it here&#x2014;the Nassau Agreement? Could it have been? When I sought to intervene in the right hon. Gentleman's speech yesterday, he refused to yield. I am ready to yield. This is very important. We are entitled to know, and the country is entitled to know, whether at the end of the day there will be a deal with General de Gaulle on the subject of the abandonment or the renegotiation of the Nassau Agreement and whether General de Gaulle is going to be top dog so far as military affairs on the Continent of Europe are concerned. We want to know. What is the obstacle?<br/>
I will ask a question of my right hon. Friends who have to negotiate this question. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said quite honestly this afternoon that we have friends in Europe&#x2014; Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg and Italy. He left out France. Who is the obstacle? Is it General de Gaulle? What is to be the nature of the negotiations with General de Gaulle? What are they to be about? The Commonwealth? My right hon. Friends are prepared to make adjustments there. They have said so. The agricultural policy? They are prepared to make adjustments. The lesser issues which have been referred to? All these can be the subject of adjustments.<br/>
Then what is it that would placate General de Gaulle? Is it in the sphere of defence? For, if it is, we ought to know before the negotiations take place.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister will say that these are matters of a confidential character and when we ask questions in the course of the next few months about the negotiations we shall get the same answer. That is the kind of answer which the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition used to give to me very often when I asked questions. We shall be told, "These matters are confidential", until there is a <i>fait accompli</i>. We must try to prevent a <i>fait accompli</i> of that kind that ties us up not merely body and soul, hand and foot, in the economic sphere, but which ties us up to some military arrangement about which we are entitled to know and to which we are entitled, if

we so decide, to object. We ought to have answers on that. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman who is to wind up tonight will give us some indication of it.<br/>
In any event, does the Nassau Agreement still remain? The Polaris submarine part&#x2014;does it still remain? The Atlantic force&#x2014;does it still remain? Where do we stand in the matter of defence? Is the subject of defence to be one of the topics that are to be negotiated? If so, we are entitled to know. I leave it there, although much more could be said.<br/>
I do not often commit anything to writing, except when I do so for the Press, and provided the fees are substantial. There is nothing wrong in that. I just follow the lead of many others. In any case, one has to earn a living. Besides, one must look ahead; one has to consider one's future. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] There is much more in that observation than may appear at first sight, because, if we should eventually be absorbed in a European Parliament&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>My objection to going in is that I do not know all the facts. I do not know what is to be negotiated.<br/>
I shall not be in the negotiations, and neither will my hon. Friend. I want to know. We are entitled to know. Even the Opposition, who will be going into the Lobby with the Government tonight, are entitled to know, and I am surprised that they have not asked more questions about it&#x2014;but perhaps that would embarrass the Leader of the Opposition. We must avoid that at all costs, because we might put him in such an embarrassing situation that, at the end of the day, he might decide not to go into the Lobby with the Government.<br/>
I was dealing with a personal matter just now when I was interrupted, and I shall now come back to it. I have to consider my future and I should like to know whether, if we go in, our pensions will be safeguarded.</p>

<p>In Commonwealth securities? I am more apprehensive than ever. I must go on writing for the newspapers.<br/>
I have ventured to put a final few words in writing. I hope that hon. Members will forgive me for this, but I do not want my views to be misrepresented, and this may happen when one speaks off the cuff. I wanted to put it on record. It will not take long.<br/>
I take note of the assurances by the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, the Commonwealth Secretary and the Minister of Agriculture. As regards the Prime Minister, there is a possibility, perhaps remote, that he will endeavour to extract the most favourable conditions

during the negotiations. But in the case of the Foreign Secretary, who, as I have already remarked, is and always has been a dedicated European and has sincere convictions, I regret&#x2014;I mean what I say&#x2014;being unable to accept his assurances.<br/>
The principal obstacle, as we know, is General de Gaulle. The Foreign Secretary will do his utmost to persuade the Prime Minister in an effort to placate the General and to ensure British entry into the Common Market, and he may even be ready to sweep all the conditions under the carpet. That is my view.<br/>
I suspect that the reservations which have been stated by Ministers are intended for internal consumption in order to placate members of the party. It will be another story when negotiations begin. All the familiar arguments, the slogans, the assertions, the assumptions and the speculations, are being trotted out, but precious little evidence which would justify Britain's association with the Common Market. The people of this country are far from unanimous. Will that be denied? The Gallup Polls are a deception, loaded with loaded questions.<br/>
No Government have ever been entrusted with a mandate from the electors. In the Labour election manifesto in 1964 only a brief reference was made to this subject. It was then regarded as a "dead duck", and at the last election there was hardly a whisper. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Yes, just a whisper. It is doubtful if any candidate referred to the subject or was asked a question. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."]</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman give way for a moment? I know that he always wishes to be fair.

<p>Thank you very much.<br/>
It is notorious that those engaged in finance and a section of our industrial concerns&#x2014;this aspect of the matter was dealt with yesterday by the hon. Member for Peterborough (Sir Harmar Nicholls) in a remarkable and cogent speech&#x2014;all concerned with special and, for the most part, selfish interest&#x2014;and, of course, Mr. Cecil King of the <i>Daily Mirror</i> are unanimous. But they do not represent this country. They represent only themselves.<br/>
Despite all the extravagant propaganda and the comparative silence of the Press&#x2014;and that is putting it mildly&#x2014;the

Labour Party is sharply divided. There is also a minority in the Tory Party and beyond doubt there is division not only in the Cabinet, but among junior members of the Government. I fully understand and respect the enforced silence of many of my colleagues. I take no objection and I merely state a fact.<br/>
If the public ignores these facts and fails to make the strongest protests before negotiations begin, we shall be faced by decisions in which the public has had no voice. In the short run we shall, as is admitted by Government spokesmen, suffer rising prices, the effect of severe competition, perhaps increased unemployment, and all on the assumption that in the years ahead, some say five&#x2014;that was what the Leader of the Liberal Party said yesterday&#x2014;some say ten&#x2014;that is what the hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Sir J. Rodgers) said yesterday&#x2014;some say even longer, benefits may accrue.<br/>
Long before then the Commonwealth will be disrupted, will probably vanish as the magnificent moral force it is. We shall be tied hand and foot, body and soul, to a bureaucracy in Brussels, or Paris, or even Bonn, shackled by regulations about which we have had no say and unable to raise issues in the Parliament at Westminster vital to our domestic, legal, financial and foreign interests. I must place on record that this represents my firm conviction.<br/>
After all the pros and cons have been argued in this debate, I remain a convinced and unrepentant opponent of the Government's policy. I am a supporter of the Government's general policy, but here we must part company. I shall not take advantage of the new liberalisation of the Parliamentary party and abstain. Those who abstain from voting do not support the Government. The only difference between the abstainers and those who, like myself, will vote deliberately against the Government is just this&#x2014;and I state it firmly: I have strong convictions; so have those who abstain; I have the courage of my convictions. That is the difference.<br/>
I shall seek no favours whatever the consequences. Hon. Members&#x2014;and I say this most sincerely and earnestly&#x2014;will, I am sure, vote honestly in accord with their convictions. I respect them. I shall not be false to my convictions.</p>

<p>I have promised to be brief and it would not be in accordance with the custom of the House for me to comment on the "resignation" speech of the right hon. Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell), made from the appropriate seat. Perhaps we ought to apologise to him if it was not heard in silence. I think everyone will agree that that was because it was one of the most entertaining and happiest resignation speeches ever heard in the House, delivered with that inimitable manner which all of us admire, even though we might disagree with the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
I propose to address myself to the single issue of the legal aspect of entry, a matter about which a number of hon. Members on both sides of the House would like to hear more from the Government before the debate ends. To save lime, I say at once that I entirely agree with what my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Huntingdonshire (Sir D. Renton) said yesterday, which in effect was that he accepted the view, put forward by the Lord Chancellor in another place, that the legal considerations certainly did not justify rejection of the proposal to apply for membership.<br/>
It should be made plain, however, that a number of arguments have been put forward against entry which are quite unfounded and misleading. They merely darken counsel, because they detract attention from the issues which really matter. I want as shortly as I can to point out what these misleading arguments are and, secondly, briefly to mention two or three issues on which the House is entitled to definite assurances.<br/>
As for the bad points; many hon. Members have read with interest, and in many cases with surprise, an article in their favourite breakfast newspaper the other day with the striking headline:
<q>If you're not guilty&#x2014;prove it.</q>
That article contained a number of assertions as to what would be the effect of going into the Common Market, and I ought to briefly mention them. The suggestion in the headline was definitely that the ordinary rules of criminal procedure and evidence would have to be altered if we went into the Common Market. That is nonsense. As the Lord Chan-

cellor explained in another place and as the Prime Minister explained here, the criminal law of this country and the essentials of the whole law of this country are not touched in any way by the Treaty of Rome.<br/>
Then I read this:
<q>Even the nation's food will change &#x2026; Your jam, for example, may have to taste like French 'confiture'",</q>
I thought that it was Beachcomber's article which I was reading, but apparently it was to be serious, because it went on to say that anyone who broke the Community's rules dealing, for instance, with restrictive practices in Community trade would be liable to have his premises searched and his books investigated by foreign inspectors, who would be entitled to drag him off to a Continental court to be punished without the intervention of any British court. Again, to put it mildly, that is just not the case. As the Prime Minister pointed out, an infraction of laws of that kind would be dealt with as a breach of our law by British courts and enforced by British authorities. Any inspection would take place under the direction of the court.<br/>
The writer even went on to suggest that in the Community "one smooth, bland, anonymous system of uniformed law" would have to be introduced, apparently overnight, and he drew attention in particular to Article 100.</p>

<p>I mentioned Beachcomber and thought that that was sufficient identification for this purpose.<br/>
I was saying that the writer quoted Article 100. As sometimes happens in these articles he did not quote it completely. I will read the article, leaving out part of it, as was done in the newspaper. It says:
<q>The Council shall &#x2026; issue directives for the approximation of such legislative and administrative provisions of Member States as directly affect the establishment or operation of the Common Market.</q>
The newspaper article left out the words "by a unanimous decision", so it will be seen that we have a complete and absolute power to prevent that being done. Any lawyer who has read the Treaty would know that this is what Dr. Johnson called "sad" nonsense. It is sad, because there


are millions of people who read this and believe it. I have already had letters from people quoting it and asking me, as I am a lawyer, why I am supporting something which will turn the law of the land upside down. It is not true. I will not quote my reply to the letters, but I hope that I replied in a way which will be generally approved.<br/>
That newspaper article is about 80 per cent. bunk. This ought to be said. If anyone thinks that I am being gratuitously offensive about this, I would point out that the article begins by saying:
<q>If our 109 lawyer Members of Parliament honour the country above party there is one special issue they must raise </q>
I am therefore speaking out, and I believe that we all will.</p>

<p>I do not recall having read the newspaper article to which my right hon. and learned Friend refers, but to deal with Article 100, on the approximation of laws, there are directives already issued on a unanimous vote by the Community, obviously without the necessity of our consent. Those are directly binding on this country and in that we have no say.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-05-10a.1547.1" hansard_membership_id="5782" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32612" speakername="Sir L. Heald" colnum="1547" time="">
<p>My right hon. and learned Friend has anticipated my next point. There are three matters on which I ask for further reassurance and elucidation. The first has to do with new regulations. We ought to have much more explanation about the safeguards which will exist. There is plenty of provision for discussion and consultation with bodies such as trade unions and employers and other organisations. There is discussion before the Commission, and eventually the Minister can take part in the discussion. No doubt we shall be able to have a discussion here before the Minister goes to the meeting at which the regulation will be introduced. I would like to know if further steps are to be taken, such as laying the Order before the House? That would not be a very revolutionary thing to do, because, as we know from experience, if the Government were in favour of it, they would be able to get it through quite easily.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) is quite right in saying that there are already existing regulations that could be very awkward for us. May

we have an assurance that there will be negotiations providing, for example, for the possibility of an amendment? Amendment is possible, or it might be dealt with in that way, in some cases by transitional provisions. In some cases there are protocols. Can we have an assurance that that will be done?<br/>
There is another very important aspect of this. Already there is in force&#x2014;whether it is a directive, I do not know&#x2014;something unanimously agreed, which provides that all the members will adopt the added value taxation system in 1970. The Prime Minister made some remarks about this. I heard them at the time, and I have read them again, but with the greatest respect I think that they mean absolutely nothing at all, except that this is something to be considered. Are we to accept this? How will we function in a Community in which every one else except us has an added value taxation system? Do the Government accept that it is a good system? If they think that it is a bad one, what will they do about it?<br/>
It has been suggested that lawyers in this House are not taking an interest in this matter. This is not so. I believe that they are taking a great interest. I have the honour to be the chairman of a committee of Conservative lawyers which is considering these matters at present. The views that I have expressed are, in principle, the views held by the committee. I am sure that the same thing applies to hon. and learned and hon. Gentlemen opposite. We are all prepared to help in this matter. If one believes, as I do, that we ought to make every effort to get into the Community on a proper basis, then we ought to be prepared to assist in a practical and constructive way, not to find ingenious or imaginative reasons in order to say that, given a certain hypothetical reason, we should not go in. We should try to find some workable and reasonable way to deal with the legal problems which undoubtedly exist.</p>

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Chertsey (Sir L. Heald) has rightly pointed out some of the problems about the law and the orders. I, too, would like to know more about the procedure to be followed in this House. Until


he brought evidence on the point, I had not believed that Beachcomber had taken over the whole of that newspaper, but it must be so. As to the added value tax, I recently asked the Chancellor a Question which I should like to follow up by asking for further information.<br/>
I have heard most of the debate in the last two days, and all of today's debate, and to me the most powerful argument against going into the Lobby in support of the Government's Motion is the danger of us becoming part of a land-locked arganisation&#x2014;land-locked in Brussels or Strasbourg. In other words, land-locked in an organisation in which we would be counting our motor cars and washing machines and trying to keep up with the Joneses, the Duponts and the Schmidts. That is an important argument, and if I did not believe that there was an answer to it, I would certainly not be supporting the Government's Motion tonight.<br/>
However, there is an answer to this. When we go into the Community the Council of Europe will continue. If we play our full part we will not be inward-looking. The Community deals almost entirely with economic matters&#x2014;trade, industry, agriculture, finance and so on&#x2014; but the Council of Europe concentrates on political, cultural, legal and social matters. This will continue, even if the Community is made bigger. The two organisations are complementary.<br/>
We can see this if we compare the agenda of the European Parliament with that of the Assembly of the Council of Europe. The task of the European Parliament is to implement the Treaty of Rome, and the Council of Europe Assembly discusses a far wider range of problems. When Britain is a member of the Community we, like France, Germany and Italy, will have 36 members in that expanded European Parliament. We will also still have our 18 Members in the Assembly of the Council of Europe and have our Foreign Secretary on the Committee of Ministers.<br/>
If we seek a wider Europe and refuse to become land-locked in Brussels and Strasbourg, the Council of Europe is the key because of the Statute of the Council of Europe. For example, the Statute allows the Assembly to discuss topical questions&#x2014;that is, anything except military matters. During the last session ten days ago we discussed the <i>coup d'&#x00E9;tat</i> in

Greece and the "Torrey Canyon". Furthermore, the Statute is flexible enough for us to allow a member State to choose the activities in which it participates and makes it possible for non-member States to take part in particular activities. For example, the Soviet Union at this moment is taking part in technical discussions on patents.<br/>
We in this country are, by our history, accustomed to looking outwards across the Continent and across the sea. When we are in the Community we can ensure that the Council of Europe plays its part in establishing better relations with Eastern Europe, and the place to begin is in technical co-operation. The Council of Europe's intergovernmental programme of work provides an ideal framework for 'technical co-operation in matters like public health.<br/>
If the Community is enlarged and this country, Ireland, Denmark and Norway, join, there will still be many Council of Europe countries left outside, such as Cyprus, Greece, Iceland, Malta and Turkey, as well as the neutral countries&#x2014; Austria, Sweden and Switzerland. The Committee of Ministers and the Assembly of the Council of Europe will remain as the places in which these countries can have their say on European problems. As in the past, the Council of Europe will be the link between those countries which are in the Community and those countries which are outside it.<br/>
The Council of Europe looks not only across Europe but across the seas to the developing countries. In the Council of Europe we have welcomed speakers from all over the world. In the last year, we have had with us U Thant and speakers from Asia and Africa and North and South America. Our policy is to continue this practice. If I had my way, we would also have Ministers from Eastern Europe.<br/>
At the last meeting of the Assembly of the Council of Europe ten days ago, a resolution was adopted unanimously by the Political Committee. In one of the paragraphs it expresses the belief
<q>that the expansion of the European Communities by the inclusion of the United Kingdom and other countries is essential for the strengthening of Europe both politically and economically.</q>
That resolution was endorsed by the Assembly.<br/>
Yet another reason why the Assembly, which, after all, is made up of Members of Parliament from 18 European countries, wants this country to be in the Community is our tradition of concern for developing countries.</p>

<p>No. I was in the Chair at the time, and a few, but a very few, hands were raised against it. It was accepted unanimously in the Political Committee, which contained representatives of, for example, the majority party in France.<br/>
Our friends in the Assembly feel that another former colonial Power is of value in the Community to strengthen those who wish to press that the rich industrial countries should do more for the developing countries of Asia and Africa. It may sound strange to refer to the respect in which the former colonial Powers are held, but the fact is that, however one reads the figures, taking the gross national product, Belgium, Britain, France and the Netherlands come out as the countries contributing most help to the developing countries. I am not speculating on the reasons for that. I am merely stating the fact which came out in the debate ten days ago in which some hon. Members took part or heard.<br/>
We have in this country a particular obligation to the developing Commonwealth. Certainly I should not have left the House a few years ago and gone to Africa if I had not believed that this was of tremendous importance. But we must beware of the dangers of paternalism and of appearing to be patronising. I speak from first-hand knowledge only of the new African countries which feel themselves ready to run their own affairs.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary referred to Nigeria, which has become an associate member of the Common Market, and to the fact that Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania and perhaps Ghana will possibly negotiate to become associate members. These new countries want to look after themselves. They believe first, that if we were in a larger market our economy would be strengthened, and, secondly, that inside the

Community&#x2014;this is another way of stating the point which I have just made&#x2014; we shall remind the others with little or no colonial experience of the rich nations' duty to the poorer nations.</p>

<p>I, too, have been a member of the Council of Europe for about three years. Our friends on the Continent even outside the Market, with whom we have excellent relations, have not made anything like the sacrifices which this country has made on behalf of the developing countries. This country is taking 35 per cent. of the textile products of the developing countries, whereas the Continental countries are taking no more than 4 per cent. I have protested about this at Strasbourg and the Council of Europe until I am blue in the face, but they pass "holier than thou" resolutions and do nothing about it. Therefore, I am not very impressed by that argument in support of our going into the Common Market.</p>

<p>I hope my hon. Friend will accept my point that we have such a good record that, if they want us in, it is a measure of their belief in our sincerity and initiative. That is what has happened, not only in Strasbourg but in the European Left. My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) referred to that a few days ago. The recent European Left resolution said that it was convinced that the entry of the United Kingdom into the E.E.C. will make a most valuable contribution in every field. This was passed after discussion at the conference of the Socialist Parties of Western Europe.<br/>
I have recently returned to the Council of Europe after a long gap. When I first went there 16 years ago, I believed, like most members of the British delegation, that a European nation of 50 million people had an important part to play in the modern world. All the other countries with populations the size of ours, 50 million&#x2014;Germany, France and Italy&#x2014;which sent delegations had been defeated and over-run and had lost faith in the nation State. But we had not. We had won; we had not been defeated.<br/>
However, during the last 16 years it has become obvious to many of us that there is not a very great future today for a country of 50 million people in a world dominated by huge countries like the United States, the U.S.S.R., and, very


soon, China. Therefore, like most hon. Members&#x2014;as, I am sure, the Division will show&#x2014;I look to Europe knowing that we have much to offer our fellow Europeans.<br/>
One of the problems&#x2014;and let us be frank&#x2014;is that in the same way as I said that we had not been defeated, General de Gaulle was never defeated and he is&#x2014; [<i>Interruption</i>]&#x2014;this is uncanny, being so often interrupted by Black Rod.</p>

<p>I am very glad indeed that I had the chance of hearing that Royal Assent had been given to the Royal Assent Act, because I have had the uncanny fortune of being on my feet and making a speech several times recently when we have been summoned to hear the Royal Assent given. The odds against this happening to one Member so often must be fantastic. However, it cannot happen again.<br/>
I will try to come back to the point I was making. The point I was making &#x2014;I think it was; it is very difficult to be interrupted in midstream&#x2014;was that in 1951 when I first went to the Council of Europe, like most of the members of our delegation, I did not believe that the day of the sovereign nation State of 50 million people was over. I thought such a country had a large role in the world, and today, 16 years later, we find that after all a great change has taken place. Many of the countries of that size in Europe were defeated and overrun during the war. We were not. We were on the victorious side, whereas the other big countries were defeated. I believe that is one of the reasons&#x2014;as it is also one of the problems&#x2014;why we appeared to be more nationalistic, and less willing to surrender our sovereignty than other countries. I believe that one of the problems today is that though France was defeated during the war General de Gaulle was not defeated, and General de Gaulle still feels, as we felt in 1951, that the r&#x00F4;le of the 50 million nation State is relevant in the world. This is one of the problems we have to face.<br/>
We have talked in this debate about going into Europe or not going into Europe, and that disguises the fact that we are already deeply involved in Europe. Let me give two examples. I have been talking a good deal of the Council of Europe and I will take two illustrations from it. First, this country has accepted more of the Council of Europe's international agreements and conventions than any of the 18 countries except three, the Netherlands, Norway and Denmark. We are deeply in Europe. Secondly, more than 170 members of this House and of the other place have served at Strasbourg. We are deeply in Europe and we are European.<br/>
I see here hon. Friends of mine and hon. Members opposite who have been on the delegation to Strasbourg, and I am sure that they have had the same experience as I have felt in looking at that semicircle of 150 members of the Assembly drawn from 18 countries of Europe and sitting there, not by nation or by party, but in alphabetical order of their surnames. It is impossible to tell what their nationalities were&#x2014; except, possibly, 5 per cent., one could say, came from one part of Europe and possibly 5 per cent. from another. We are sitting among our fellow Europeans.<br/>
I see this Motion we are going to vote on tonight as a step, the next step, in getting further involved in Europe.<br/>
My earliest memory is of a German bomb falling on London in the First World War. I see the last two wars as European civil wars, and they have convinced me of the stupidity of the European nation State.</p>

<p>Civil wars, yes. Wars of one part of Europe against another: yes, I mean civil wars in Europe.<br/>
When I returned to the House from Africa a few years ago, what distressed me was to find that some of the great nations of Europe had become reinfected with nationalism. What an appalling example that was to set the new countries, African countries particularly, where we have been preaching to them not to go back to tribalism.<br/>
In Europe we are fortunate in having a long and a rich civilisation; we are

blessed materially and spiritually; we have great advantages and we have great opportunities. One of these opportunities is to set an example to these new countries in international co-operation and of living together in peace. In years to come, when we are all gone, perhaps only two or three of us remembered, this day, I am convinced, will be seen as not only a great day in the history of Britain, but also as a great day in the history of Europe, and perhaps also as a great day in the history of the world.</p>

<p>I hope that the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Kettering (Sir G. de Freitas) will forgive me if I do not follow him in his very interesting speech, because I think that there must be something like 80 Members whose names are still on the list of those who wish to speak in the debate, and, therefore, to let others in, I want to be as brief as possible.<br/>
I wonder how many hon. and right hon. Members in this House have had the experience&#x2014;I am sure some of them have&#x2014;of going to church and reflecting that those not already strong in the Christian faith, after listening to the sermon, ran a very considerable danger of emerging from the church with no faith at all. I am moved to that reflection by speeches I have been listening to during the three days of this debate, particularly the speeches from the Front Bench on the Government side.<br/>
With the sole exception of the speech which we heard today from the Foreign Secretary, in the course of which he made it clear that he is a dedicated European, the major speeches, excellent and detailed though they were, seemed in logic to be more against entry than for it. The Minister of Agriculture's speech last night has been referred to already both by my right hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Godber) and by the right hon. Member for Easington (Mr. Shin-well). That was a first-class example of what I mean.<br/>
In the few moments left last night, I was moved to intervene to suggest to the Minister that we should see him going into the Lobby against the Motion. In the interval between the beginning of my speech and its continuation now, I have had time for more mature reflection,


and I am sure that my reaction last night was born instinctively from the sombre picture which the Minister painted about the effect of entry on our agriculture and horticulture, to which he made a passing reference, and on the cost of living and our balance of payments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-05-10a.1557.0" hansard_membership_id="9984" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/24017" speakername="Mr. John Wells" colnum="1557" time="">
<p>Far from making any reference to horticulture, the Minister skated over it, dismissing it in a sentence and neglecting it entirely, as he has done throughout.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-05-10a.1557.1" hansard_membership_id="5381" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30110" speakername="Mr. Hall" colnum="1557" time="">
<p>Perhaps I did not express myself very well. I said that the Minister made a passing reference to horticulture, and I think that that is a fair way of putting it.<br/>
His sombre picture created in me the reaction that, after all this, surely he would be voting against the Motion. However, on mature reflection, I am sure that his feet will lead him into the Lobby on the Government side tonight, although I should not like to say where his spirit will be.<br/>
It has been said, and I have no doubt that it will be said many more times before we vote, that the House is about to take one of the most fateful decisions that it has taken for centuries. I have heard it said that this is the most fateful event since 1066. However, it must be remembered that, on that occasion, Harold was killed and the French won. I hope that we do not see history repeating itself, although we must be aware that the French hostility to which the right hon. Member for Kettering has referred might kill both the application and the political reputation of the Prime Minister.<br/>
I do not quite agree that the decision which we are expected to take tonight is the most important one that we shall have to take for many years. There is a long road to travel between the time that we make application to enter and the time that we actually enter, and much may happen in the intervening period to influence our final decision about entry. It is that final decision which may prove to be the most important in the history of our country. When, if ever, the House is required to take that final decision&#x2014;I hope that I am right in assuming that the House will be able to take a final decision and that the vote tonight is not irrevocable&#x2014;I trust that it will not be

found necessary to whip us through the Lobbies in support of the Government's policy.<br/>
We all know what a three-line Whip is, and we know that, when any hon. Member has strong conscientious objections to a policy, it is understood that he ignores the three-line Whip, as I am certain that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen on both sides of the House will ignore it tonight. However, that is not understood outside the House to anything like the same degree, and it would be much more impressive if the Government's decision tonight was backed by a free vote and not a pressed one. Putting a three-line Whip on in these circumstances, particularly on this side of the House, debases its value.<br/>
In view of the Whip which exists on both sides, it is clear that nothing said in the debate will change the Government's decision to apply. I must make it clear that I welcome the conversion of the Prime Minister, as others have before me. It is said that there is more joy in Brussels over one sinner that repenteth than over many other people, and I am glad that the Prime Minister has been converted in such a remarkable way.<br/>
Despite some reservations which I shall express later, I am particularly impressed that the Prime Minister, in a speech lasting an hour and 25 minutes, should have deployed the most telling arguments against entry, only to come down at the end in favour of going in. That is a triumph of faith, hope and, on our side, charity. It is a remarkable feat, and he must be congratulated on having apparently inspired all his colleagues in the Government with that same faith.<br/>
It is said that the possible advantages of entering are not quantifiable. That is a word which has been used quite a lot during the debate, and I promise that that is the first and last time that I shall use it. The arguments for the long-term benefits are based upon imponderables, but that it the stuff of which faith is made, and it is on faith that the Government have decided to make application. It is faith triumphing over fact. It has made it possible for honour to be satised, and that is why no member of the Government has found it necessary to resign. Whatever doubts I may have about the reasoning behind the policy, I am impressed by this act of faith.<br/>
I was particularly impressed by the way in which members of the Government accepted the figure of &#x00A3;100 million which the Prime Minister plucked out of the air as being the annual cost to the country of entering the Community. In a fairly long passage considering the possible cost implications but without prior arithmetic, that figure emerged suddenly as, at the same time, did the figure of a 3 per cent. growth rate with which it was associated. If ever there was an act of faith, it was to say that we shall have an annual growth rate of 3 per cent, from which the cost of entering can be met. Apparently that is accepted by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite, despite the reasoned arguments in <i>The Times</i> which gave estimated figures of something between &#x00A3;500 and &#x00A3;800 million as the possible cost of entry. In passing, one might have thought that the article could have been written by the President of the Board of Trade before his conversion, but we know that it was not, although it was very much along his line of thought.<br/>
During the debate, neither the Prime Minister nor the Chancellor of the Exchequer challenged the figures in <i>The Times,</i> except to say that they did not accept them. In my present state of half faith, I am almost prepared to accept that attitude of mind.<br/>
I was impressed, too, by the way in which the House has been hypnotised into sitting through a debate of two and a half days without any real attempt to get down to a discussion of the lesser issues which can best be dealt with after entry. There has been only a passing reference to those issues, and that was in answer to an intervention by my right hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton). The topic was passed off on the grounds that we must not allow our application to be cluttered up by detail. That is probably quite right, but the House ought at least to know what are some of the lesser issues which it is thought that we shall have to negotiate when we get in. I am the last person to say that we should attempt to impose conditions when making application, but at least we in this House should have the information which we want.<br/>
Despite all this impressive evidence of faith, which must put men of little faith

To shame, I confess that I am uneasy about two matters. One is the timing of the application. The other is the feeling that the nation as a whole does not really understand the implications of entry.<br/>
I have not been one of those urging the Prime Minister to maintain the momentum of negotiation. I have always believed that the economy must be strong before we apply. I do not share the view that it is strong. I doubt whether he shares it. I fancy that he hopes that entry will achieve for Britain what, as the right hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. James Griffiths) said, Governments have failed to achieve&#x2014;economic growth and viability.<br/>
I think that it is still thought, as it was thought when we were in office that if we fail to find the solution to revitalising the economy and getting the rate of growth that we want, perhaps entry into the Common Market will do for us what we have failed to do for ourselves. I think that there is something of this thought' behind the Prime Minister's conversion to a European attitude.<br/>
If the timing is wrong, as I believe it is, we run into certain dangers. First, we are negotiating from weakness. Secondly, there is the greater danger of refusal, if only because it might be argued that going into Europe with a weakened economy might damage the Community itself and that our economic ills might be infectious. Thirdly, we run the danger of encouraging at home a "marking time, waiting for the Community" mentality&#x2014;in other words, waiting for entry to solve some of the problems of industry.<br/>
We also run the danger that, if the application is accepted and our economy is not strong, as I believe that it is not, industry will not be properly poised to take the shock of entry. Finally&#x2014;although perhaps a minor point&#x2014;we run the risk of prejudicing the success of the Kennedy Round negotiations in Geneva, because it may be argued, as indeed the Canadians are arguing, that the Community countries, seeing the possibility of E.F.T.A. countries coming in with them and creating a much larger market, may drag their feet and oppose a general reduction in tariffs. All these are dangers if we do not get the timing of the application right.<br/>
I have always made my position clear. I believe that the economic advantages of going in are marginal, if they exist at all. I have sometimes wondered whether they might not carry with them some dangers of which we are not fully aware. For example, we shall be geographically on the perimeter of the Common Market area and there may be a tendency for the large organisations of this country to shift their centre of operations more into the centre of the Community. It may also be that new investment, especially from elsewhere, like the United States, will be tempted into the geographical centre. I do not know, but these are possible dangers.<br/>
I have never been impressed by the economic advantages. What has always attracted me are the political considerations. I can see a strong case politically in the long run for entering Europe and that is why I have always, until recently at any rate, tended to favour entry and have supported the moves made to get this country involved in Europe.<br/>
That is why I listened with great interest to the Foreign Secretary's speech. I thought that it was attractively delivered but it was disappointing because the right hon. Gentleman gave up a good deal of time to discussing economic and technological considerations which had already been covered by previous speakers and he did not concentrate sufficiently on the real political considerations. What was probably more important than what he said was what he did not say, particularly about defence. I am certain that many hon. Members on both sides of the House would have wanted to probe further what lay behind the assertions concerning European defence. Nevertheless, it was an attractive speech and because I myself am attracted to the political considerations of entering Europe it did something to quieten some of my doubts about the wisdom of entry.<br/>
Having said that, I still think that we and the country must weigh very carefully the cost of entry, and there should be no doubt in anyone's mind, here or outside, what that cost is likely to be. It is wrong for the Government to say that they have a mandate for this. Whatever may have been in the Tory manifesto&#x2014;and we went into this fully&#x2014;in the

Labour manifesto, to my recollection, there was only a very short paragraph about the subject and if any voters voted for the Labour Party on the strength of that paragraph they are now being faced with entry under conditions never envisaged by that paragraph.<br/>
But I doubt very much whether many voters were influenced one way or another by the question of the Common Market at the election. I doubt whether it was a live election issue. Except under special circumstances, the electors do not vote on such matters but on matters of domestic detail, which they understand. There was really no mandate for any party to go into the Market on whatever terms.<br/>
Between now and the point when our application may be accepted, I suggest that it is the duty of the Government and all of us to ensure that the people are fully and frankly informed of the implications of entry and that, in the meantime&#x2014;and this is a warning to myself more, perhaps, than to anyone else&#x2014;we must avoid turning this into an emotional issue, which it is tending to become.<br/>
People are tending to take up attitudes on both sides and dig themselves in. On either side, this is a bad thing. What we should do is judge the issue on its merits as the facts emerge during the negotiations between now and the time when we may enter. Our overriding concern must be the well-being of the country, of the Commonwealth and of E.F.T.A. for whom we have a moral responsibility. Our final decision when it has to be made should be made in the full knowledge and understanding of all the facts and implications of those facts and with the support of an informed general public.<br/>
We do not now have that full knowledge and full understanding of the implications. We must wait for them to emerge and, when the time comes, I hope that we shall be able to vote freely with a full knowledge of the issues that lie before us and knowing what we are doing.</p>

<p>I agree with the suggestion of the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. John Hall) that this is an occasion when the House might well have had a free vote. It is


important, and the hon. Gentleman mentioned some of the reasons, that on this occasion we should have had a free expression of opinion. As he said, the issue did not appear generally during the election. It may have been raised in some parts of the country but in my fight in Govan the Common Market was not mentioned by me nor was it raised with me by any elector, and in such a situation the House should be permitted to exercise its discretion.<br/>
We are faced with a very simple fact&#x2014;the question of what we should do in relation to the Common Market. Either we decide to reject it or we decide to enter or to agree to enter. My mind on that issue is perfectly clear. I am in favour of entering the Common Market. We are living in a world which is changing quickly over very wide areas.<br/>
For nearly 200 years we have been part of a growing Commonwealth. That Commonwealth has paid us, over a substantial period, a tribute amounting to almost &#x00A3;200 million every year. With that &#x00A3;200 million there came the &#x00A3;40 million of earnings from our coal exports. In the Chancellor's hands at the beginning of every financial year there was this huge sum of money. This has now more or less disappeared. The Chancellor is being forced to adopt many devices to try to overcome that deficiency. That change has taken place, and with it there has gone a change in the composition of the Commonwealth and in trading relationships between ourselves and the Commonwealth.<br/>
I want briefly to look a little more closely at the changes which have been taking place in that relationship. The figures which I propose to use are the result of the researches of our own excellent Library Research Department. We have been hearing a good deal in the Press&#x2014;some reports have not been quite fair&#x2014;about the change in our import and export figures in relation to Australia. I propose to consider Australia, Canada and New Zealand, because they have figured most largely in the debate. Many of our colonies are looking more for aid than trade with us on a basis that would be remunerative.<br/>
Imports by Australia from us in 1966 show an arresting fall as compared with the 1950 figure. In 1950 the figure was

39&#x00B7;7 per cent., and last year it had declined to 25&#x00B7;8 per cent. That does not mean that the value of those imports have declined; indeed, they have risen from &#x00A3;209 million in 1950 to &#x00A3;758 million last year. But in 1966 we were not earning the same proportion of this expanding trade as we were in 1950.<br/>
While imports by Australia fell proportionately, the Japanese figure rose from &#x00A3;7 million in 1950 to &#x00A3;280 million last year. This is a significant indication of what is happening on the import side.</p>

<p>I cannot answer such a question. I am merely quoting the figures presented to me.<br/>
I now want to consider the export figures. Our exports to Australia have declined from 38&#x00B7; per cent. to 17&#x00B7;6 per cent. while those of Japan have risen from 3&#x00B7; 9 per cent. to 17&#x00B7;8 per cent. Although the figures are not so arresting, the same tendency is taking place in our trading relationships with New Zealand. Our imports from New Zealand have declined from 60&#x00B7;1 per cent. of total trade in 1950 to 38 per cent. last year, and our exports to New Zealand from 66&#x00B7;4 per cent. in 1950 to 44&#x00B7;7 per cent. last year.<br/>
In Canada, trade with the United States has been expanding rapidly while ours has been increasing only feebly. The import figure rose from &#x00A3;404 million to &#x00A3;645 million, whereas the United States figure increased from &#x00A3;2,152 million to &#x00A3;7,000 million. Our exports rose from &#x00A3;469 million to &#x00A3;1,131 million, and United States exports from &#x00A3;2,000 million to &#x00A3;6,000 million. These figures represent a trend which is bound to give us serious thought.<br/>
With the decline in the group to which we have now been attached for so long the natural impulse is to look around for another group. The world in which we live today is composed largely of groups &#x2014;the Chinese group, the Russian group and the American group. Most hon. Members would agree that whatever sympathy we have with groups in the Far East, to join them would not be a tenable proposition. Many of us would


resent falling more closely into the hands of the American group. Consequently, the European group is the natural group for us, economically and politically.<br/>
We are entering a group whose status, economically and politically, is close to ours. We have already signified that closeness by accepting the idea of a tunnel between this country and Europe. If this development takes place the natural question that any Member representing a division in a small country like Scotland will ask is: how will this affect the country to which I belong and the division which I represent? Every Scots Member knows that unemployment in Scotland, while we are still outside the Community, has been rising and has reached 83,000, which it has rarely reached before. This is serious. An important industry in my constituency is faced with the threat of closure. There is maldistribution of population. Two distinct parts of the country, the Highlands and the Lowlands, lack people and 4 million are concentrated in the middle belt, which is an unhealthy distribution.<br/>
It will not recover its health until the Highlands and Lowlands are treated more equitably in terms of industry and population. Everyone wants a new attitude towards the Highlands. Direct Government intervention is proposed by introducing industry to that part of Scotland. We ask whether the present tendency will be accelerated or retarded by our entry to the Common Market. That is why I want an assurance from the Government Front Bench that accession will not result in continued underdistribution of employment and industry in the Highlands and Lowlands.<br/>
We have heard today of a possible understanding with the French about a new approach to aviation development and that an airbus is now being considered, and also that an agreement is possible between the two Defence Ministries over the swing-wing aircraft. I should not like to think that these decisions are not based only on defence or technological considerations; but are partly political, to help our application. If they become accepted policy, with technological expansions between Britain and the Common Market, I hope that they will go forward on their merits and not as political aids to our entry.<br/>
Many others wish to speak. So, having stated the position in regard to my country's industry and development, and the case for the development of aviation, I am glad that both sides have listened agreeably to the first Scotsman called in the debate.</p>

<p>When our application for entry to the Common Market goes in tomorrow, as I believe it will, signed by the Prime Minister, I hope he realises that, thereafter, events will be out of his control. He has cleverly stage-managed his party to the point of applying, but he will write the script no longer from that point.<br/>
The answer we get depends on what people on the Continent are thinking and saying. They will be looking after the interests of the E.E.C. first, and of their own countries and Britain second. Control will pass from Westminster, and that will be the pattern for the future. If the Government are set on joining, we must be clear that heavy concessions will be necessary and that the more keen the Government are, the greater they will be. It is clear that the five Gaitskell conditions are already no longer valid&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]&#x2014;it is quite clear. The London Declaration of 1961, regarding our E.F.T.A. partners, has been thrown overboard.<br/>
The Prime Minister's statement on 2nd May was full of vague phrases and let-outs and did not give me confidence. We were told of lesser issues which could be decided after we had joined. This is laughable. Who would join first and try to negotiate when outnumbered? I want to know what the lesser issues are. We were promised a great debate and information. I have tried by Questions to get information, but nothing happens. The debate has not got off the ground, but is one of the Prime Minister's non-starters. If the case is so good, why can we not have information and a free vote?<br/>
I am opposed to our entry of the E.E.C. on many grounds, but mainly on two. The first is economic. It is admitted that the cost of living per family of four will rise by 25s. per week. It may well be more&#x2014;the butchers think so. What has not been calculated is the effect on wage and salary claims and


consequently on the price of goods and on exports. Surely Government Departments could make calculations. If not, surely it is unwise to go forward.<br/>
There will be many effects on pensioners and those near the pension level, who will have to be helped. What will be the price of that? Do the people in the country realise the extent to which they will be hit? I am glad to say that my constituents in South Edinburgh know.<br/>
I am also deeply worried about Scotland. Perhaps a Treasury Minister will tell the House what are the views of the Scotch Whisky Association about our entry. I know them, but I should like to hear them expressed from the Government Front Bench. Our steel industry is bound to suffer because of the increased cost of fuel in Scotland; and our coal industry, with the competition from the Community, which allows in American coal, will suffer equally.<br/>
It is clear that if we enter the E.E.C. there will be a loss of sovereignty. Considering the terms of the Treaty of Rome, this will undoubtedly occur. Commonwealth preferences will have to go. I never thought that I would live to see the day when it was advocated that these preferences should be abandoned, least of all by the Conservative Party.<br/>
Any trading arrangements which we wish to make, whether with countries of the East or others, will be subject to the agreement and approval of Brussels. Because of voting arrangements, if we join the E.E.C. Britain may have to take action which is against our best interests, and we certainly will not be free agents. A lot of internal affairs will be interfered with, like the social services, transport and the movement of labour and capital. Even our legal system will have to be altered by this House because of decisions made in Brussels. Is that what hon. Members and the country really want? I say "No", and for that reason I shall be in the "No" Lobby tonight.<br/>
It has been put about that it may be a good thing for us to join the E.E.C. because it will enable us to get out of the stagnation which at present exists. I believe that we can solve our own problems in our own country, and I suggest

that the stagnation which exists is due to the faulty tax policies and lack of incentives of the present Government.<br/>
In all these matters I am guided by two principles; first, that I will not support policies which cause Her Majesty's subjects overseas and in the Commonwealth to be treated worse economically than foreigners, and, secondly, that I will not see a lessening of the sovereignty of Britain or of Parliament. Nor was I elected for this purpose. For the future, I prefer to turn to the great British nations overseas and to America rather than to Europe.</p>

<p>I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) will forgive me if I do not follow them into the Scottish countryside. Although my constituency contains the highlands of Sydenham and the foggy lowlands of Dulwich Village, their problems are very different from those of Scotland.<br/>
If the present Government lives in history, it will be because they have eschewed short-term expedients, have declined to accept transitory and ephemeral popularity and, instead, have kept their eye firmly fixed on the distant goal. To me, that is part of the ethic of the Socialism in which I believe.<br/>
Some of my hon. Friends have spoken about their Socialism. My hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) has come to a conclusion different from mine because he believes that what he regards as Socialist measures will not be possible if we enter the E.E.C. I disagree with his facts, but I accept the sincerity of his views. I would not be so arrogant as to believe that my brand of Socialism is the only one, even if it happens to be the best one.<br/>
On this question of the distant goal, we have the enthusiastic support of countless European Socialists inside and outside the E.E.C. who want us to join the Community. Countless people inside and outside the E.E.C. who are not Socialists also support us. They want us in because they believe, I suggest rightly, that our entry will give the Community a new dimension and that it will become a much broader and more outward-looking Community than it is today. They, too, believe


that some of the criticisms which my hon. Friends have made of the Community as it exists today will be capable of being cured in the future&#x2014;even more so if, as I hope, together with us there go in other countries such as the Scandinavian nations, with their tradition of democracy like ours, to strengthen and broaden the democratic idea enshrined in the Community.<br/>
Many hon. Members have dilated largely on the price that will have to be paid. It is right and proper that this should be considered. The Leader of the Opposition remarked on the price and he included in it something which I could not include; the idea of some sort of defence agreement. I could not help wondering, when I heard him speak about the negotiations on the last occasion and congratulating the Government on having taken up those negotiations where they left off, what part defence played in the negotiations on the last occasion; or whether the subject came in only at the last minute when the then Conservative Government signed the Nassau Agreement.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot) spoke, as he was entitled to do, at length about the price we would have to pay. When considering the price, it is no use looking merely at that price without considering what one is buying. If one is buying a house, one must consider whether it is a mansion or a cottage, in addition to what it contains. It was only towards the end of my hon. Friend's speech that he came even to mention one or more of the matters for which we are likely to pay the price&#x2014;when he spoke about economic independence, a subject to which I shall return.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale seemed to suggest that the figures we had been given by the Prime Minister and all the calculations that had been made by the Government painted an optimistic and rosy picture. He may be right, and he is entitled to his view. However, in my submission, the true picture was made brilliantly clear by the speech of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food last night. When the Cabinet, in those days in Whitehall and at Chequers, was examining the figures and all the pros and cons, there was certainly no lack of people with acute minds

and without a great enthusiasm for entering the Community to make sure that the figures that ultimately emerged were not too rosy and optimistic.<br/>
We heard my right hon. Friend repeat the very figures that the Prime Minister had given. Can one really say, in the light of that, that it is likely that those figures present too rosy a picture? Is it likely that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture would have accepted those figures, and would have supported the Government, as he has supported the Government, in this application for admission to the Community&#x2014;because he accepts Cabinet responsibility just as all his colleagues in the Cabinet have accepted that responsibility in supporting the application&#x2014;if those figures had been unduly rosy and unduly optimistic?<br/>
Then we had my right hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell). He made, if I may respectfully say so, a most attractive and persuasive speech Indeed, if I can make half as persuasive a speech when I am twice his age it will be a miracle. But it is, perhaps, a little too much to hope that with persuasiveness one will also have consistency. I noticed that one half of my right hon. Friend's speech was devoted to telling us that the man whom we shall have to placate will be General de Gaulle. He asked, "What are we to offer him to placate him? The others do not matter&#x2014;they are all on our side. It is the General who is the obstacle&#x2014;what are we to offer him?" He spent the other half of his speech saying that if we go in we shall have to become part of a supranational community&#x2014;the very thing of which General de Gaulle is the sole opponent in the Common Market as it exists now&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>As I say, these are the question of price that one has to consider. I do not dispute that one has to consider them, and it is right and fair that we should know what the price will


be as far as we can estimate it. But it is not the price that is the only consideration. Another consideration is what we are to pay for. This emerged from the speech of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, but it is something to which very few hon. Members in this debate have given great attention.<br/>
It seems to me that there are two vital questions with which the enlargement of the Community is designed to deal. First, there is the question of economic independence mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale. We can see today the creeping control of trans-Atlantic capital spreading its tentacles not only over our industry but over the industry of the Community as well. There is nothing that can be done to stop it as long as we do not have a market within Europe which can compete with the market of the United States of America. I am not anti-American&#x2014;that is the last thing of which I would be accused on this side of the House&#x2014;but my pro-Americanism does not extend to the belief that it is right and proper that American capital should gradually take control of this country's industries. I can see the possibility of the great European market wresting that control from American capital and enabling us within Europe itself to make use of the great technological gifts that we in this country have&#x2014;because we have often led the world and are still leading the world in technology&#x2014;in a way which will make it unnecessary and impossible for this process of creeping control from across the Atlantic to continue.<br/>
Secondly, there is the great political problem of a divided Europe, and here I want to ask my hon. Friends who are opposed to the idea of a widening of the European Community the following questions. Will they agree with me that Germany will never accept a permanently divided Germany? Will they agree with me that the Soviet Union will never accept a united Germany except in the context of a united Europe? If they agree with me on both of those matters, how can we ever solve the European problem&#x2014;of which the German problem is the root and the key, and the possible source of future conflict&#x2014;unless we can achieve a united Europe? And how can we achieve a united Europe without this country being part of it?<br/>
I agree that even if we go into the Community, even if the Scandinavians go into the Community, we may still not solve this problem, but I am quite certain that we can never solve the problem unless we go into it. We shall never solve it unless the Community is expanded and, having expanded, eventually stretches out towards the Eastern European countries at present behind the Iron Curtain, as my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) has said so forcibly.<br/>
If this is right, one is entitled to ask what the alternatives are to British and Scandinavian entry into the Community. How else are these two problems to be solved? How are we to get our economic independence? My hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale said, "Let us expand our trade with E.F.T.A., let us strengthen our ties with E.F.T.A. and increase our trade with the Commonwealth." Hon. Members opposite have said, "Let us have an Atlantic Free Trade Area," but I did not notice my hon. Friend make that suggestion. Indeed, the whole idea of British economic independence of America is hardly likely to be facilitated by that step.<br/>
But, as my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has said, the whole purpose of the creation of E.F.T.A. was as a step towards the enlargement of the European Economic Community. It is the countries of E.F.T.A. which are pushing us in today. If we do not go in, many of them probably will: they will certainly go in if we do. They want us in. To believe that we can conceivably use E.F.T.A. as an alternative to the larger market of the Community is nothing more than a pipe-dream.<br/>
We talk of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth countries, one after another, are seeking association with the Community. Again, the idea that we could use the Commonwealth as an alternative in order to provide the larger market we need is nothing but a pipe-dream.<br/>
I therefore conceive of no other real alternative method of securing those two great objectives. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister that if we do not get into the Common Market it will not be the end of the world. There are alternative courses, but they are very much a second best and certainly


Will not achieve the ends I want to see achieved.<br/>
When we come to the way in which e should apply to be made part of the Community, this I must say. My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Alfred Morris) on the first day of this debate spent a little to me criticising what he called the "unconditionalists" and sought, as I thought, to tar with the brush of unconditionalism some of my hon. Friends who have strong and very passionate views on the subject. I do not know any unconditionalists on this side of the House. I do not know whether there are any opposite or not. I am not concerned about them, but I am concerned about this side of the House. But, having said that, I am bound 1o say that the European Community exists on a basis of trust. Every partnership which is successful exists on that basis.<br/>
It is no use our applying to go in or hoping to go in unless we also have the trust which will enable us to play our part as partners in the Community. I want us to make an application in the way suggested by my right hon. Friend when he spoke this afternoon. I want us to negotiate after that application has been made, but I hope that in those negotiations before we actually enter the Community we shall be satisfied with those assurances which one partner would expect from other partners on a basis of trust and that we shall not demand the amount of detailed linkages and tyings up which one would demand if one were contracting with someone at arm's length.<br/>
If our future partners in the Community give us an assurance that they recognise our need for transitional arrangements, that they recognise the need of our Commonwealth for a proper way of solving their problems, and if they explain this in sufficiently explicit terms, it would be utterly wrong, indeed it would be unproductive, for us to try to tie them down in advance of our entry to the small change and minuti&#x00E6; of the details. I hope that when my right hon. Friend goes into these negotiations he will go into them in that way. And if we do go into the Community, we must likewise go in on a basis of trust. It will

be useless for us to go to Brussels and seek to make our way into the Community if we do it any way that suggests that those making the application are less than sincere in their belief that to do so is to the great historic advantage not only of this country but of Europe as a whole.</p>

<p>In his interesting and sincere speech, the hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. S. C. Silkin) made reference to two very powerful speeches we have heard in this debate. One was by the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot) and the other by the right hon. Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell). The hon. and learned Member will recall that both his hon. Friend and his right hon. Friend made certain references to converts and conversion. I am quite satisfied that what I shall say&#x2014;and I am sorry about this&#x2014;will certainly not convert the hon. and learned Member, nor I am sure will it convert the Prime Minister or the Foreign Secretary, or even the Leader of my party.<br/>
On Monday evening my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Down, South (Captain Orr) reminded us, when he had the privilege of catching your eye, Mr. Speaker, rather late in the evening, that even after that short period of debate practically everything had been said for and against going into the Common Market and he asked what more was there to say? After two and a half or almost three days debate I find myself in that position also. So what I propose to do is to put on record the reasons why I cannot support the Government in the Lobby tonight and that if a Division is called I shall certainly go into the Lobby with my hon. and right hon. Friends who have tabled the Amendment.<br/>
Although I signed the Amendment I am not against, and never have been against, political and economic co-operation with Europe. On the contrary, one recognises the possible values both of political and economic co-operation. What I have always been against, and still am against&#x2014;nothing I have heard in this debate has convinced me otherwise&#x2014;is that this country should become a signatory of the Treaty of Rome. I propose to explain briefly why I still maintain that position.<br/>
Yesterday afternoon my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition reminded us of the history of the development of the movement towards co-operation within Europe. He reminded us that my right hon. Friend the Member for Barnet (Mr. Maudling), in the early' fifties when he was President of the Board of Trade, made great efforts to form a system of economic co-operation in Europe, a system which was designed to embrace not only the countries which we now refer to as the Six but also those countries we call E.F.T.A., the members of the Commonwealth and any other nations which would agree to join a free trade area. I supported that proposal with enthusiasm and wholeheartedly. It was a matter of regret to me, as it was to many, that that system so strongly advocated by my right hon. Friend did not prevail.<br/>
So we arrived at the two systems, the Economic Community resulting from the Treaty of Rome and the system which we call E.F.T.A. When my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition was trying to negotiate in 1962&#x2013;63 to get this country into the Economic Community I am sure, whatever our views, we all agreed that he displayed tremendous patience and tenacity in his efforts. At that time I had been out of business and industry for some years. Having forsaken commercial life to earn what I thought would be a reasonable living in the law, I got out of touch a little with the commercial aspects of the country. I naturally tried to get as much information as possible about the economic benefits which might accrue to this country if we became members of the Community.<br/>
I discussed the possibilities. It is obvious that with an enlarged market we would undoubtedly expect economic benefits in the way of trade and so on. I wanted to get more information about what industry thought of the magnitude of the benefits which would accrue to this country. So I discussed this with many good friends in industry whom I had known for years, some in charge of large organisations and some in charge of organisations which were not so large. At that time, in 1962&#x2013;63, the overwhelming opinion of those with whom I discussed the issue was that without

doubt the benefits would be very substantial.<br/>
Not unnaturally, I have discussed this question again with these people since the question of our joining the E.E.C. has become a burning issues during the last few months. I find that these same people are now not nearly so certain about the great economic benefits as they were some years ago. The best I have been able to get from them is the expression, "We think on balance that our trade and industry will benefit".</p>

<p>I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke). That is not the view which has been expressed to me by quite important industrialists. I am glad that my hon. Friend interrupted me, because we all know that he has very great interests in the motor manufacturing industry. My hon. Friend has reminded me that I must mention a report issued recently by the Motor Manufacturers Association. I have not read the whole report, but a fairly full account of it was given in the business section of <i>The Times</i> recently. The report shows that our motor manufacturers expect that, if we enter the Community, there will during the first few years be an annual loss of &#x00A3;17 million sterling. I cannot argue about that. I take that figure.</p>

<p>I am not in touch. For that information I refer my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Webster) to my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham.<br/>
A very interesting article appeared in the February, 1967, issue of the journal, <i>Export</i>. It is known that this is the journal of the Institute of Exports. This article makes quite remarkable reading. It casts grave doubts on the economic benefits which may accure to this country from our joining the E.E.C.<br/>
There are many other aspects of the problem, major and lesser. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan


(Mr. Rankin) is not in his place. I listened to his speech with great interest. I know that he is keenly interested in our shipbuilding industry, particularly the Scottish sector of it. Only the other day the House agreed to a Measure designed to give substantial assistance to our shipbuilding industry. Article 92(3,<i>c</i>) of the Treaty makes a very important reference to the European shipbuilding industry. I want the Government Front Bench to answer an admittedly slightly hypothetical but nevertheless important question. There is talk of lesser issues; but if we were to get into the Community by the end of this year, or even in the early spring of 1968, what would happen to the scheme of helping our shipbuilding industry as a result of the operation of Article 92(3,<i>c</i>)?<br/>
As to agriculture, it is now an admittted fact that the cost of many items of food will rise steeply. In reply to a supplementary question on his statement last week, the Prime Minister said that he was not going to bother about the lower type of groceries. The Prime Minister knows, as we all do, that some of the lower types of groceries are very important to millions of housewives.</p>

<p>I am much obliged. It is attractive to want to believe that, if we accepted the agricultural system of the Community, it would mean the abolition of subsidies under our own system and that the money saved thereby&#x2014;about &#x00A3;250 million&#x2014;would be used to bring down taxation. We all recognise that this would be impossible, because if a saving was achieved in that way, the money saved would, of necessity, have to be spent on shielding pensioners and other sections of the Community from the effects of the steep rise in the cost of many foodstuffs of which the Government have rightly, openly and honestly warned us.<br/>
Again on agriculture, there is the difficult question of the balance of payments. The Prime Minister said on Monday, first, that what would be involved on agriculture would be about &#x00A3;175&#x2013;250; million on our balance of payments but went on to mention the figure of &#x00A3;100 million. I tried to interrupt the Prime Minister, but his was a long speech and he. did not give way. I wanted to ascertain whether the &#x00A3;100 million was in

addition to the, say, &#x00A3;200 million, making a minimum of &#x00A3;300 million on our balance of payments.<br/>
With the best will in the world, I cannot see how we shall get over the difficult problem of the balance of payments, which has been a thorn in the flesh of our economy for years, by entering the Community and adopting a system which may well increase these difficulties to the extent of at least &#x00A3;200&#x2013;&#x00A3;300 million. I have always believed that one of the surest ways of overcoming this difficulty is by an increase in production and an increase in the volume of sales of the goods we produce. After all, we may manufacture all we want to manufacture, but, if we cannot sell the goods in the world markets, what is the use?<br/>
Why is production today so stagnant? In my view, one of the main reasons is the heavy burden of taxation on both individuals and companies. Until we get this burden down, encouraging men and women in industry to earn and to keep more of their earnings, and encouraging businesses by lower taxation to make good profits, we shall never, or not for a very long time, master this difficult problem.<br/>
Now, the legal system. In spite of what was said by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Chertsey (Sir L. Heald), I am sure that certain changes in our law will have to be made if we go into the Community. But I shall not dwell on that question because my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith), who is a recognised expert on this branch of the matter, hopes to catch your eye, Mr. Speaker, and I shall leave that aspect of the matter to be dealt with by him.<br/>
What about the political aspects of entry? As I see it, there are two issues here, one very broad and one much narrower. It has often been argued&#x2014;the point was repeated by my right hon. Friend the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Sir Alec Douglas-Home) on Monday afternoon&#x2014;that if we had been in the Community, or if there had been an E.E.C. years ago, we might have avoided the appalling catastrophies of two world wars. This may well be so. I concede the possibility. But, equally, it could be said that if, prior to 1914, this country had developed&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>.] I


shall not stop. I seldom speak in debates in the House now, with so much work upstairs to do, and I wish to take full advantage of the opportunity now.<br/>
I was dealing with the argument that, if we had had the Community earlier, we might have avoided two world wars. Of course we might. But one might as well say that, if the work of our nuclear physicists in the years before 1914 had been carried on to the development of nuclear weapons, this might have prevented two world wars. With respect, I do not think much of that argument.<br/>
My real opposition to entering the E.E.C.&#x2014;let me be frank about it&#x2014;is that I am not prepared to accept a system under which a group of Ministers and civil servants sitting in Brussels will make laws which we, if we are members, must accept without question in Westminster. That is not an encroachment on our sovereignty which I am prepared to accept. It is argued that, whenever we sign a treaty, we give up a certain amount of sovereignty. This is true, but, under most of the treaties which we have entered into&#x2014;N.A.T.O. is an example&#x2014;we can give up the treaty on giving one year's notice. But it appears from Article 240 that the Treaty of Rome is one to which we should be bound, if not in perpetuity, at least for a very long time. Whatever may be said, once we are members, we shall have to accept the decisions come to by the Commission and by the Ministers. This is not a position which I could accept.<br/>
I find certain aspects of the present approach to the Community rather astonishing. First, what is the position of &#x00B7;E.F.T.A. countries? I have always understood that it was a firm condition for this country's entry into the Community that we should do so only if the member countries of E.F.T.A., if they wished, went in at the same time as we did. What is the position now? The communiqu&#x00E9; issued after the recent E.F.T.A. conference is difficult to understand, and I should like to be told what is to happen. My hon. Friend the Member for Louth (Sir C. Osborne) asked yesterday what the position regarding E.F.T.A. would be between now and the ultimate time if we ever go into the Community.<br/>
Finally, like my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe (Mr. John Hall), I am surprised that the Prime Minister, with all his experience and shrewdness, should choose this moment to try to get into the Common Market. He told us on Monday that his view is that our position is strong. I do not believe it. Again, I refer to the leading article in the business section of <i>The Times</i> on Monday, which cast grave doubts on our position in relation to sterling balances and other aspects, even at this time. It is the essence of prudence to try to negotiate from strength, not from weakness. I am very surprised that the Prime Minister has chosen this moment to try to enter the Community.<br/>
Finally, I am certain&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]</p>

<p>For unavoidable reasons, I suppose, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary cannot be with us at this moment, but I should have preferred that at least one senior member of the Cabinet, perhaps the one who is to reply to the debate or the one who opened it today, would be here to listen to the discussion. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I urge the Treasury Bench to make the feeling which has just been shown known in the usual way to my right hon. Friends in the Cabinet so that several, or at least one, may be present with us in the very near future. It is an affront to the House in a debate of this importance, when every Member has to accept his own responsibility, that members of the Cabinet are absent most of the time.<br/>
In his opening speech today, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary was concerned particularly with economic matters and disappointed many right hon. and hon. Members by not saying more about foreign affairs and defence. There has been a marked reluctance on the part


of the Foreign Secretary to give the House a detailed outline of how the matter looks from the point of view of the Foreign Office and of the Ministry of Defence. However, as my right hon. Friend spent so much time on economic matters, I shall follow him, beginning with a review of some of the points which he made.<br/>
At one stage, after he had been interrupted from the back benches, my right hon. Friend read parts of the Treaty of Rome to the House. That was a courteous thing to do; it is always good to be reminded of the homework one has already done, and we were grateful for it. Then, having read a passage from the Treaty of Rome, my right hon. Friend, with a triumphant air, turning to his own back benches, expressed his conclusion that he would do all the serious negotiating after our application had been accepted. What does the reality of that assurance look like?<br/>
I should like to quote from a statement made two days ago by Dr. Kiesinger, Chancellor of West Germany. It was only because I did not want to interrupt my right hon. Friend too often that I did not rise to put this statement on the record while he was speaking. I regret all the more that he is not now here to deal with this matter.<br/>
The Chancellor of the West German Government was quoted in <i>The Guardian</i> of Tuesday, 9th May, as follows:
<q>The West German Chancellor, Dr. Kiesinger, said here tonight that Britain's entry to the Common Market would only be possible if she adhered not only to the text of the Rome Treaty but also to everything that had been created so far or was still planned.</q>
What are the negotiations to be about after we are inside the Common Market if that is the view of one of the principals who is to face us once we are inside?<br/>
I take this opportunity to make one thing clear. Although I agreed with many of the things which he said during his brilliant speech, I profoundly disagreed with my right hon. Friend the Member for Easington on one issue. He seemed to concentrate on France and General de Gaulle as the only possible difficult negotiating partner, or difficult nation, once our application had been accepted, or before. I pray in aid the view of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister.<br/>
In the first debate which we had in the House after the negotiations con-

ducted by the Leader of the Opposition had broken down and when the then Conservative Government were giving an outline of the negotiations which made it appear as though the President of France had been the only serious obstacle, my right hon. Friend the Member for Huyton (Mr. Harold Wilson), who is now Prime Minister, speaking on behalf of the Labour Party, said that we did not accept this mythology about the breakdown of the negotiations which the Conservative Government had created in making France the only responsible party. I agreed with my right hon. Friend. The statement by the Chancellor of West Germany two days ago is evidence that it is true today as it was then that there are several of our negotiating partners who do not believe that serious negotiations are possible. This is the crux of the debate.</p>

<p>Dr. Kiesinger, as well as President de Gaulle. It may be argued that the others among the Six are important and I never want to be discourteous to anybody, but surely the point of view of the Chancellor of West Germany and the French Government between them represents a powerful section of the Six.<br/>
Moreover, it has always been the honest opinion, which I respect, of Lord Gladwyn, for instance, or the right hon. Gentleman who until recently led the Liberal Party and who has now been replaced, to the regret of many people of whom I am one, and whom I have always admired and whose straightforwardness I have always admired, that there is no serious negotiation in which to engage and that what Britain has to do is to accept the situation as it is.<br/>
What alarms me and some of my right hon. and hon. Friends is that we are now being told in very uncertain language that there is to be some negotiation before entry but that many of the serious negotiations will take place after entry. The view which I have just quoted and which was prominently expressed at the time is, to quote Dr. Kiesinger, that we must accept not only the Treaty of Rome, but everything created so far or planned.<br/>
That is why I am not prepared tonight to sign the blank cheque which is contained in the Motion. Tonight is the occasion when those who hold my view


are under a serious obligation to make our views clear. If we sign the blank cheque, we shall have no reserve position in future on which to fall back when, as I fear, in the course of the negotiations the Government agree with Lord Gladwyn and the others and say that if we want to go in, we have to accept everything as it is.<br/>
I turn to what I hoped would be the main business of the speech of my right hon. Friend&#x2014;foreign affairs and defence. In the same speech Dr. Kiesinger had something else interesting to say. I quote:
<q>He said that not only were economic problems at stake but that the final aim of a common foreign policy within the E.E.C.</q>
We have heard very little about this. There has been a good deal of discussion from the back benches, but there has been no real information about a common foreign policy from those members of the Cabinet who have spoken so far.<br/>
What was meant by Dr. Kiesinger's statement on foreign policy? I remember being present at several Press conferences in Bonn when for three short periods I represented one of our weekly journals there. The Press conferences were taken by Dr. Adenauer, the late Chancellor. He always made it clear, both at the Press conferences and privately later, that he was not the least interested in Britain's entry into the Common Market unless we were binding ourselves to a common foreign policy to which we would then be obliged strictly to adhere. I am glad to have the approval of hon. Members on both sides of the House for that statement.<br/>
In our debates in this House when Dr. Adenauer was in office I used to say that I did not believe that this was merely the personal attitude of one man. I was convinced that future Governments in Bonn would take the same view. Dr. Kiesinger's statement of only two days ago is proof conclusive that that is so.</p>

<p>I shall deal with it in half a second in the scheme of my remarks, and I think that my hon. Friend will be satisfied that I have dealt with it.<br/>
This demand for a joint foreign policy to which Britain would strictly adhere means that all the problems which are now dividing the Eastern and Western countries and in which we now have a view which is active upon international affairs would be subject to joint decisions by a committee of Foreign Ministers.<br/>
It does not matter whether at present a given French Government disagrees with a given German Government about particular immediate issues. What matters is that, as the Prime Minister has said, economic matters may be important, but what is now determining him to ask for entry are the political matters. It means that these will become the dominant theme of the Community after Britain is inside, and it will mean a radical difference which the House must appreciate before it signs the blank cheque.<br/>
I turn to the problem of defence, because foreign and defence policy are obviously closely linked. I beg my right hon. Friends to take note of this point. We must have some answer from the First Secretary who, although he is now preoccupied with economic affairs, is no stranger to foreign affairs, and we must have an answer before the debate is concluded.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition made the most important statement of the debate so far when he spoke yesterday. There has been a marked reluctance by members of the Government who have spoken so far to give a detailed reply to it.<br/>
It would be downright irresponsible, and I am choosing my words carefully, if the Government were not to answer these questions and then ask the House of Commons for permission to apply for entry into the Common Market. The important question that the Leader of the Opposition raised was contained in two statements. First of all, he said, on his own initiative&#x2014;before the Prime Minister asked him to go a little further on the theme&#x2014;that defence would be a major issue in the negotiations.<br/>
It is no use my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister saying on Monday from


the Front Bench that he was convinced that the issue of defence, and particularly nuclear defence, must be left where it is now. This afternoon I invited my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary to say a little more about this. I asked him whether during the negotiations the Government would be prepared as the price of entry to agree to a joint nuclear Western command within E.E.C. I received no answer from my right hon. Friend. I say that the House is entitled to an explicit answer to this question before we vote tonight.<br/>
Secondly, also on this matter of defence, on the invitation, perhaps through the provocation, of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition went a little further. I was glad that the Prime Minister did provoke the Leader of the Opposition to go a little further on this matter. He then said that he believed, this was his formulation, that the proper solution which we should accept, presumably during the negotiations, would be that the nuclear forces of France and the United Kingdom should be joined together and held in trust for the Six.<br/>
This was a very puzzling formulation, at any rate to me. I have heard of sums of money being held in trust for orphans; I have heard of capital being held in trust for an association of poor scholars, but I have never yet heard the formulation that a vast arsenal of nuclear weapons should be held in trust for someone else. The Government ought to have pressed&#x2014;I hope that they will do so tonight&#x2014;the Leader of the Opposition to say a little more about this. This was a very important statement of new policy, made for the first time in this House by the Leader of the alternative Government. There is a serious obligation on the Leader of the Opposition to come clean and tell the House what this new policy is.</p>

<p>Why does the hon. Member find it so difficult to understand my right hon. Friend? Does not the Soviet Union hold nuclear weapons in trust for the Warsaw Pact?</p>

<p>I have great respect for the hon. Member and for his independence of spirit, but as I am modest enough never to claim to interpret the policy of my leader, I think that he will

be well advised not to try to interpret the policy of his leader. We must ask the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Bexley (Mr. Heath) to explain his policy which he has arrived at with the advice of the Shadow Cabinet. The hon. Gentleman is not a Member of the Shadow Cabinet. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the same subject when giving the Godkin lectures in the United States the other day. That is not the House of Commons. [HON. MEMBERS: "It is in HANSARD."] It is no good the right hon. Gentleman producing documents there. This is the place where he has to explain himself.<br/>
There is great danger in this, and that is why I attach importance to this statement. There is great danger in such a new policy. It is the kind of policy which will now be quoted in the negotiations, and it will be said that the Opposition are committed to this policy and the Government will have to have an attitude towards it. As my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) says, all that we have so far had has been a very limited reaction. When I invited my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary to say more about this he refused. What we need is a far more categorical explanation of the Government's attitude, because this also involves the aspirations of another Member of the Six.<br/>
It involves the aspirations of very powerful Members of the Cabinet of the Government of Bonn. Here I link this particular problem of a Western nuclear command force with the non-proliferation treaty. There was another startling statement which the Leader of the Opposition made yesterday afternoon to which again an answer has to be forthcoming from the Treasury Bench. The right hon. Gentleman looked at my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, and at my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, and asked: was it not clear, and did my right hon. Friends deny, that the non-proliferation treaty had been so designed that it left the way open for a Western European E.E.C. nuclear command?<br/>
That was startling news to me and to most of my right hon. and hon. Friends. I had never heard it before. Here is this most important treaty, on which so many


Members of our Government have laboured; here is a treaty to which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Chalfont and my right hon. Friend the First Secretary who is now on the Treasury Bench, have made profound contributions over a matter of two years. The United States Government have also worked hard on it, together with Mr. Kosygin and Mr. Gromyko.<br/>
I have always thought, in my uninstructed way, that this was a treaty designed to prevent the spreading of nuclear weapons. Now we are told, on the authority of the Leader of the Opposition, that this is not so, and that the treaty has been redesigned and so arranged as to leave room for a new and additional nuclear command within E.E.C. This is something which the Prime Minister has always denied, except yesterday afternoon. [<i>Interruption</i>.] If an hon. Member wishes to intervene, I will gladly give way.</p>

<p>Without quoting any lectures given outside this country, may I quote what was said in HANSARD:
<q>I have said, in relation to nuclear defence, that, with the French <i>force de frappe</i> and the British deterrent, it should be possible for these two aspects of nuclear weapons to be held in trust for Europe. This, in my belief, would not end non-proliferation in any way. In fact, I understand that the non-proliferation has been designed to enable a United Europe to have its own nuclear force."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th May, 1967; Vol. 746, c. 1299.]</q></p>

<p>That is what I said. I do not want to be unkind, but the hon. Gentleman is wasting the time of the House. That is precisely what I said. They are the same words. My instinct not to give way was right in the first place.<br/>
To return to the subject, which is a very important one, we now hear for the first time, on the authority of the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition, that this treaty is designed to leave room for a Western European additional nuclear command. This is very startling and dangerous news, because if there is anything designed to wreck any hope of agreement on the non-proliferation treaty this is it.<br/>
My last point concerns the attitude of my hon. and right hon. Friends tonight. I would seriously suggest to very many of them who have worked very hard for

many years to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons that they must think very carefully and very long before approving the Motion. They may well be supporting a policy of taking the first step to allow not only the creation of a new nuclear command but the introduction later on of the Federal Republic of Germany as an active participant in this new nuclear command.<br/>
It is the declared policy of some of the most powerful members of the West German Cabinet to have a more active part for the Federal Republic in the control and possible use of nuclear weapons. They do not want a national nuclear establishment in West Germany. That would be a false accusation. They know that they cannot have that, but what Herr Strauss is aiming at is the active participation of the Federal Republic in a nuclear command in E.E.C.<br/>
What Herr Strauss has always aimed at is now becoming a practical possibility through political negotiation. Can anyone envisage that after we join E.E.C and agree to Dr. Kiesinger's proposal for a Committee of Foreign Ministers making foreign policy for all of us, and when we have a joint nuclear command only between France and Britain, Germany after four or five years, through Herr Strauss and other Members of the West German Cabinet, will not point out that they are making a major contribution to the Community and are an equal partner? They will ask how long are the others to discriminate against them, to deny them an equal share in the control of nuclear arms?<br/>
These are the real issues facing the House tonight. It is a matter of great regret that we have not had a great deal of detailed information from the Government on these important matters.<br/>
My right hon. Friends must understand that I am not speaking in personal bitterness. Practically everyone on the Government Front Bench has been a personal friend for many years. I do not believe that any bitterness should be introduced into our ranks over this matter. But I must ask them to realise that when hon. Members on this side of the House follow their own decision, having looked at all the serious factors involved, they are under an obligation to accept and respect our attitude as we respect the attitude of other hon. Members.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Penistone (Mr. Mendelson) will forgive me if I do not follow him into the labyrinth of European possibilities and imponderables. The great majority of hon. Members who have spoken have referred to imponderables, doubts and difficulties. I wish to speak briefly on one narrow specific point&#x2014;what our Prime Minister would condemn as the "minor groceries". Yet this is an aspect of our agricultural policy which affects perhaps the most prosperous section of agriculture, namely, horticulture.<br/>
The value of horticultural production in this country every year is about &#x00A3;185 million. Yet the Minister of Agriculture, in his most incompetent and cavalier speech last night, brushed horticulture aside in one short phrase. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, in his very able speech, gave the Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt when he said that he thought that the right hon. Gentleman had said something about horticulture. But I believe that the Prime Minister, in his long-winded speech, did not even mention the topic.<br/>
It may be surprising to hon. Members that this topic should appear to us in Kent to be so important. Our farmers and growers are some of the most skilful in the country. They are blending the ancient skills and traditions of our land with the new technology. Our glasshouse industry has gone from strength to str2ngth in recent years. That industry and the top fruit industry will be gravely threatened if we enter Europe. The one sop of the Minister of Agriculture to the consumer was to say that tomatoes and apples might be a bit cheaper. That might be very nice for the housewife, who faces price rises for beef, butter, cereals, and so on, but it is a very hard outlook for the grower. [<i>Interruption.</i>] It is all very well for the hon. Member to snigger, but perhaps there are no growers in Lewisham.<br/>
Horticulturists are a successful and vital part of agricultural production. If they are to be helped by the Government, the first requiremnt is that the key to progress which is found within the Common Market countries, namely, co-operation and modern marketing techniques, should be fostered. The Prime Minister,

in his cut-back measures of 20th July last, saw fit to relegate the Covent Garden replacement scheme to the same bracket as municipal baths and other local government extravagances.<br/>
Horticulturists want an early assurance that the Government, whatever the outcome of these negotiations, will help horticulture to stand on its own feet. The general agriculturist will benefit considerably if we enter the Common Market. The hon. Member for Norfolk, North (Mr. Hazell) made a highly emotional speech with very little content of reality. The truth is that the great bulk of agriculturists will do very well if we enter the Common Market. Indeed, certain sections of horticulture&#x2014;for instance, the field vegetable section&#x2014;will prosper. But the two narrower sections, particularly the top fruit section, clearly will suffer.<br/>
I therefore ask the Government for a categorical assurance that they will take early steps within the framework of what we can do in this country to improve the co-operative methods and the marketing system and to assist growers to modernise; and the steps which are already being taken in European countries towards grading should be extended in this country. If these measures should fail, and if the Government should be unwilling to meet their direct obligation to help our industry to stand on its feet, I hope that they will take heed of the very wise words of my right hon. Friend the Member for Grantham (Mr. Godber) this afternoon.<br/>
The essential ultimate requirement is a proper golden handshake for the handful of growers who undoubtedly will be hit. If hon. Members who represent industrial constituencies see great benefits accruing to our industrial concerns, the least that they can do is to ensure that the Government give a proper golden handshake to our growers. I repeat the phrase "golden handshake", because we do not want the rusty iron handshake which has been offered certain hill farmers in the extremely indifferent Agriculture Bill which received the Royal Assent today.</p>

<p>I agree with certain of the hon. Gentleman's points about the need for provisions enabling home horticulture to adjust itself, but would not he agree that a great deal


has been done by the Labour Government to improve conditions in horticulture? Speaking as a Member who represents part of the Lea Valley, I should have thought that that was self-evident, and it is only right that the hon. Gentleman should pay tribute to what the Government have done already.</p>

<p>Naturally I respect the hon. Gentleman's constituency viewpoint, but I must remind him of the time before he became a Member of the House, when the Horticulture Improvement Scheme was launched by my noble Friend Lord Blakenham, who was then Minister of Agriculture, and followed through by Mr. Christopher Soames. The present Minister of Agriculture has only tinkered and fiddled with the schemes brought forward by Conservative Administrations. We have had no new Measure. The one considerable benefit which the Labour Government have conferred on horticulturists is to include fork-lift trucks in the schedules of items which qualify for assistance. I do not deny the usefulness of that, but let us stick to the point.<br/>
The massive investment in equipment lying behind our hard fruit industry&#x2014;in cold stores, and so on&#x2014;amounts to a very large sum. This investment is scattered throughout the fruit-growing areas. The constituency of the hon. Member for Epping (Mr. Newens) has much fixed equipment in it. He will be aware of the traditional pattern of the glasshouse industry, centred round a great city, which is going out generation by generation as the glass becomes derelict. This has always been the pattern.<br/>
Far from assisting British horticulture, the Labour Government through the Act of the Patronage Secretary's father&#x2014;the Town and Country Planning Act brought in by the noble Lord, Lord Silkin&#x2014;put the first nail in the coffin of the progress of the glasshouse industry. The second nail was the revived Town and Country Planning Act, and the last one is the Land Commission Act which will make this natural process even harder.<br/>
Let us, however, stick to the main issue. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] It is all very well for hon. Members opposite to say "Hear, hear". I have been keeping plainly to the "minor

groceries", unlike other hon. Members who have searched their consciences and given their biographies. The Labour Government have nothing whatever to boast about in their conduct with the horticulture industry. I hope that we may have a considerable change of heart in the next few hours and that we may have some sort of reassuring statement from the Government Front Bench.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends will not be surprised if I say that I welcome the firm decision, undoubtedly supported by the whole Cabinet, that Britain should become a member of the European Economic Community.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell) in a typical speech, said that those who opposed entering did so without reservation and that those who supported our entering did it with reservation. That is not very surprising. Great changes are always much more easy to oppose than to accept. To accept a great change involves full consideration of what it involves, while to oppose it could be completely negative.<br/>
I agree with my right hon. Friend, however, in one thing, which has been said by almost every hon. Member who has spoken: that the issues in this case are basically political. In my first speech in the House in favour of our entry, which was in July, 1960, I recognised that the Community was a combination for political purposes. Whatever the subject of the speeches which have been made during this debate, there is no doubt that behind them, whether they be for or against, stood political conviction and therefore, of course, a fair degree of emotion. That is understandable and justified. Nevertheless, I believe that there are great economic advantages for us in the future, especially the advantages, to which frequent reference has been made, of modern technology and industrial scale to which, I think, I was almost the first hon. Member in the House to refer many years ago. There are, however, I admit, very great short-term difficulties. I have never believed, nor do I believe, that any supporter of our entry believed that entry was in any way a solution for our current economic problems.<br/>
There are some economists&#x2014;or perhaps I should say econometricians&#x2014;who seem to me to take an unnecessarily gloomy view. There was, for example, what I can only describe as the arrogant article in <i>The Times Business News</i> on Monday, 1st May. I say "arrogant" because, from my experience, no one can forecast economic developments four or five years ahead with any degree of accuracy. That, we can assume, is the sort of minimum transitional period.<br/>
The writer of the article assumed the most unfavourable factors and he also assumed that the Government would take no steps to correct them. The argument was built up by a relentless use of statistics in a sort of house-that-Jack-built manner; for instance, the effect of food price changes on wages and costs and their relation to the elasticity of demand at the end of the transitional period. On that I can only say that, apart from the speculative nature of most of the figures, the whole argument would fall to the ground if to compensate for the higher costs&#x2014; which are equivalent, after all, to an upward revaluation of the &#x00A3;&#x2014;an equivalent degree of devaluation were to take place.<br/>
The writer of the article, with a strange emotionalism in one presuming scientific objectivity, asked whether the Government would
<q>march with glad hearts into a cold-blooded devaluation".</q>
No doubt they would not. There are, however, alternative methods&#x2014;for instance, a step-by-step devaluation by small annual amounts parallel to the transitional period. I realise the difficulties of this. It might involve, for instance, rather higher rates of interest than would otherwise be necessary. I suggest, however, that these alternatives are worth considering.<br/>
The other main argument of the writer, quite unsupported by any real evidence, was that the use of the London capital market would lead to a great outflow of capital. My right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer have dealt with this matter at length, but I see no reason why, if the problem of the outflow of portfolio investment to third countries via Europe can be dealt with, the expertise of the London

capital market should not on balance be to our advantage.<br/>
On the economic problems created by our entering the Community, I am by no means complacent, but I am not complacent about our economic situation in any event. Neither am I pessimistic, however.<br/>
No one can doubt&#x2014;it is difficult to avoid clich&#x00E9;s in this matter&#x2014;that we face the greatest political decision which the country has faced for at least the last 300 years.<br/>
I believe&#x2014;and here I shall be considerably controversial&#x2014;that the imperial era which was a very short part of that period, on balance, has been a handicap to our national development. I doubt whether we have received from it any economic advantage for nearly a century. It has inhibited us from facing necessary economic change, and we now find it extremely expensive to liquidate.<br/>
The ideas which were prevalent at the beginning of the century, and which still find their echoes among right hon. and hon. Members, the older ones especially, on the benches opposite, for a strong imperial connection have been shown to be dreams which reached their fulfilment, I regret to say, in that mausoleum of imperialism, New Delhi.<br/>
The Ottawa Agreements, which followed the Balfour Declaration after the Imperial Conference of 1926, were based on an outmoded conception that we, the industrial country, could exchange our industrial products for the commodities of the former Colonial Territories, and the, at that time, independent members of the Commonwealth. I say in passing that some hon. Members have greatly exaggerated the effects of the loss of preferences taking into account the whole of our export trade.<br/>
In recent years, many had hoped that an alternative would be found in a growing, free collaboration between the increasing number of independent Commonwealth States. Alas, however, that dream also is fading because of our obvious inability to provide for their defence and, as it now appears, even the capital for their industry, their eagerness to build up their own industries behind strong tariff barriers in competition with our own and, even more so, their willingness to take military and political


decisions even against our interests or the interests of each other. The Commonwealth ties are, I believe, loosening fast.<br/>
To those who refer with justifiable emotion to our kith and kin, I would only point out that there are more of our kith and kin outside the Commonwealth than there are inside it&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.]&#x2014; in the United States of America, for example. On the other hand, in the Commonwealth our kith and kin are now a very small minority. On the other hand, our history shows that we are most affected by what happens in Europe, where all our major wars have started. In recent years the combination of nationalism and technology has combined to make those wars ever more horrifying.<br/>
Professor E. H. Carr, in a brilliant little book written just at the end of the war and entitled, "Nationalism and After", pointed out that the economic impetus to the growing nationalism of European States was to some extent controlled in the nineteenth century by the illusion that economic and political systems were separate&#x2014;that was in the age of <i>laissez faire</i>, and also, of course, of great poverty. He also pointed out the fact that the world economy was at that time managed from one centre, the City of London.<br/>
When the great majority of the populations of the European countries began to acquire, as they did in the last century and more and more during this, political influence, and to demand higher living standards, their Governments were forced to pay more attention to their national economies, and this led to economic nationalism which soon developed into political nationalism. The breakdown of these national economies between the wars led to the rise of the demagogues and the horrors of the 'thirties and 'forties.<br/>
These facts, I believe, were recognised by the founders of the Community, and they saw that the only way to get rid of the dangers of nationalism in Europe was to develop an expanding economy not restricted by national boundaries. I also believe that the stability of Western Europe must inevitably contribute to the stability of all Europe as a whole.<br/>
Mind you, the idea of a federation of European States is not new in our party.<br/>
In 1927 Ernest Bevin succeeded in getting a resolution passed by the Trades Union Congress in favour of the creation of a united states of Europe, and in 1945, when he was Foreign Secretary, he said that he did not regret that, in the regional discussions which were then taking place, the idea was being revived.<br/>
Unfortunately, with few exceptions we were so overcome by the scale of our own problems, and perhaps with our own virtues in solving them, that we threw away the chance of the leadership of Europe at that time, and in spite of the speeches of Winston Churchill and of the right hon. Member for Streatham (Mr. Sandys) at Strasbourg, the party opposite when it came to power was inhibited, no doubt by its imperial past, for many years in taking the step. We on our side feared the economic instability of a Europe organised on capitalist lines. We had, I am afraid, little confidence in the effectiveness of our Socialist colleagues or any understanding of the degree to which the Government of any political party, under the influence of Socialist ideas and thinking and Keynsian ideas and thinking, would run their economies with the idea of maintaining full employment and certainly the success with which they have done so&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] They succeeded in doing it, and will continue to succeed in doing it, to an outstanding extent compared with any previous era.<br/>
Now most of us on both sides, probably, are more modest&#x2014;certainly those with experience&#x2014;in our claims for the unique virtues of our own economic policies, and there is no doubt that the gap which existed between the policies of the E.E.C. countries and ourselves appears much less than it did. Moreover, it cannot be denied that most of them&#x2014;all of them&#x2014;have as many of the symbols of Social Democracy as we have ourselves.</p>

<p>I do not know whether we claim we have all we would desire in the way of the policies of social democracy, but I believe that those countries have as much of social policies as we have, of economic development and full employment, and are like us in their general attitudes.

social democracy, we can say there is much difference between us.</p>

<p>Well, that is my view. It is no good examining dogma. What we want to examine are conditions of life of the people, because that is what Socialism stands for. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I would tell my hon. Friend that the standard of living in West Germany is higher than in this country at the present time. I agree they have a degree of unemployment roughly comparable with our own, but I believe also that it will be found that they will be able to cure it faster because they have very much greater reserves than we have at the present time.<br/>
To conclude, I hope that we are not too late. I hope also that now we have a chance to make up for what&#x2014;with hindsight I admit&#x2014;now seem to me the wasted years. In recent times our people seem to have lost their sense of direction, and that is why I am convinced the majority&#x2014;the younger, perhaps&#x2014;but the majority certainly&#x2014;will welcome the opportunity of the challenge to help build up a peaceful, progressive, and generous Europe.</p>

<p>I count myself lucky at this late hour in the debate to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I have sat in the Chamber through the three days of debate, and I realise that there are other hon. Members who wish to speak after me, so I shall endeavour to express my gratitude by being as brief as I can.<br/>
If I may take up where the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Albu) left off, I share with him the view that there is a future for this country in union with Europe and that the European ideal is the greatest one that has come out of the post-war world. I speak as a convinced European, as one who, from the end of the war, believed that, if we were to have a continuous peace and developing prosperity in Europe, we should have a united Europe.<br/>
I do not pretend to pierce the veil of the future or to be able to say whether we shall have a <i>Europe des patries</i> or a federal Europe. What I hope we shall be doing in the request which will be

presented to the Commission in Brussels tomorrow is taking the first step to uniting our destinies with those of Europe, by which I mean not only those countries which now constitute the European Economic Community, but all those which, in the course of time, will unite their destinies with theirs and with ours.<br/>
One cannot have listened to the whole debate without being impressed by the sincerity which has obviously motivated speakers on both sides of the House and on both sides of the Motion&#x2014;for and against. I was happy to listen to the hon. and learned Member for Dulwich (Mr. S. C. Silkin) a few minutes ago. Despite political differences which are as old as our acquaintance, we have a friendship which dates back 30 years. I found myself in almost complete agreement with him. I did not share his views or those of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) about a Socialist Europe. He spoke of that dream. I should have described it as a nightmare. What I look forward to is a united Europe.<br/>
I shall not go over the economic reasons why I believe that we should unite our destinies with Europe. That has been done by numerous hon. Members in the course of the debate. Suffice to say that it seems to me that, in a modern world, one needs a great market to develop the great industries which must compete in that world in terms of research, in complexity and in world markets. To build up those great industries, one must have the resources of such a great community as exists in the United States and in Russia and as I believe we shall have in Europe when we are united in the European Economic Community.<br/>
As for the political reasons why I believe that we should go in, first, we have for centuries endeavoured to preserve a balance of power in Europe against those who have sought to unite Europe by conquest. In the present case, Europe is not being united by conquest but by agreement. If we find ourselves outside it and willingly remain outside, inevitably we shall remain isolated off the coast of Europe.<br/>
I agree that there are other possibilities. There is the possibility of an Atlantic Community. However, if we go into


Europe, we go in as one amongst equals and as one of the great States of Europe. If we go into an Atlantic Community, can it be as anything other than the 51st State of the United States of America?<br/>
I do not speak as an anti-American, because I have the greatest respect for the United States. I approve of what the Americans are doing in South-East Asia to preserve that area from Communism&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I know that that will not meet with approval on the benches opposite below the Gangway. I make the point to show that I am not speaking as an anti-American, but as a European.<br/>
The point was well made&#x2014;and I am glad to see him here&#x2014;by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Llanelly (Mr. James Griffiths) that we shall go in with our heads held high. We have much to contribute in Europe, and the Seven, or the Seven-plus, will not be the same as the Six because it will be enriched by what we shall take in. We have our political maturity and experience of democracy, our technological and industrial greatness, our financial strength, expertise and achievement. We take all of this into the Europe of tomorrow if we go into it.<br/>
This is the complete answer to those who are afraid of what has been called the bureaucracy of Brussels, the High Commission. It is said that laws will be made for us without our having a voice in them. That is nonsense. Sometimes I think that the bureaucrats of Brussels, along with the gnomes of Zurich and the bankers of the City form the demonology of some hon. Members below the Gangway opposite. We should go in and take part in what is being done. We shall have a member on the Council and a representative on the Commission. We shall be represented in the Assembly and we shall have our judge on the court. What those institutions do for Europe they will do with our participation.<br/>
I was surprised to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne (Sir B. Craddock) taking this view about the bureaucracy of Brussels and was equally surprised to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Clark Hutchison) subscribe to the view that our laws would be overturned, that we would

no longer have our common law of England. It simply is not true. The laws made by the European Community will be laws on restrictive practices and commercial matters and other matters of that kind. They will not affect our criminal law, our common law, our law of civil liberties or our law of inheritance. Those things will remain our birthright.<br/>
This point was so well made by the Lord Chancellor in another place earlier this week, and by my right hon. and learned Friends the Members for Huntingdonshire (Sir D. Renton) and Chertsey (Sir L. Heald) in this debate that I am surprised to hear such doctrines still being propagated. The Lord Chancellor quoted some observations made by Lord Dilhorne in another place when speaking about the Common Market on 2nd August, 1962, in col. 420 of the OFFICIAL REPORT. I shall not quote it, but it was true then and remains true today.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. So that I might not create the impression that I am making comments when seated, I rise to point out that it is not in order&#x2014; is it?&#x2014;for an hon. Member to quote here proceedings in another place.</p>

<p>I was about to say that it was said in another place that the changes in the law resulting from accession to the Community would not affect the ordinary man or woman in this country, who simply would not realise the changes resulting in the laws dealing with commerce and restrictive practices.<br/>
Another issue is that of sovereignty. It is said that this Parliament would no longer be sovereign. That is not true either. One abdicates a degree of sovereignty every time one makes a treaty. It is a function of sovereignty to abdicate sovereignty. It is a result of freedom to make contracts and contracts limit the freedom of the individual. We limit our sovereignty when we subscribe to U.N.O., G.A.T.T., N.A.T.O. and S.E.A.T.O. We shall limit our sovereignty in subscribing to the Treaty of Rome, and I believe that we shall be


right in so doing. But we do not thereby abdicate all our sovereignty.<br/>
I have made my speech as briefly and as fast as I can. Finally, I want to repeat the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford (Mr. St. John-Stevas) in his speech the night before last. Let us be positive in our approach to Europe. I believe that what, more than anything else, has made difficulties for us has been a doubt in the minds of our European friends&#x2014;and I really mean that; we have many friends in the countries of the Economic Community&#x2014; whether we were really in earnest and were really Europeans. Let us, therefore, be positive in our approach to Europe and, above all&#x2014;I plead with the House&#x2014; let us be positive in our approach to France. I have always believed that in a strong Franco-British friendship, understanding, alliance and unity lies the key to the future peace and prosperity of Europe.<br/>
I am convinced, as I believe many others are, that one of our difficulties in the past has been that France has been regarded as an obstacle to be overcome rather than an ally and friend to be persuaded and won over. It is as friends to be won over that we should approach them now&#x2014;as we should approach the other countries of the European Economic Community.<br/>
With that in mind I want to say something about the speech made by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition yesterday. The French have a nuclear arm of their own. There is no question of proliferation in their developing it. They have it already, and nothing that anyone says or does will prevent their developing it. Should not we, therefore, at least consider the question of pooling our resources with theirs&#x2014;not only our civil nuclear resources but our military nuclear resources?<br/>
One hon. Member opposite this evening asked, "What does it mean to hold in trust?" I would have thought that that had a quite justifiably and understandably clear meaning. Nobody in this House would wish to see the Germans developing a nuclear deterrent of their own. It would be intolerable for our relations with Russia if such a thing were to happen. Why not, therefore, develop-

our nuclear capacity along with the French, as trustees for the whole European Community of which I hope and trust we are shortly to become members?</p>

In a few days', the President of France will hold his usual Press conference and will be able to crow that he has taught the insular race on this island a lesson. He told us a few years ago to go back and to reapply when we were ready to accept both the spirit and the letter of the Treaty of Rome. We have come back and have admitted that our policies towards the E.E.C. and in Europe since the end of the war have been wrong.

I should like to tell the House and Europe that the people of Great Britain are not anti-European and that this application is sincere and very important. When millions of people in Europe feel in their hearts that they want Britain to come in, I should like to confirm to them that their instinct is right and that there cannot be a united Europe without Great Britain.<br/>
I should like to tell the House a personal story. It is well known that I, unlike the majority of hon. Members, did not have the good fortune to be born in these islands. Unlike most hon. Members, I made some effort to get here and, furthermore, I made a choice. I had the opportunity in 1940, after the collapse of France, of emigrating to the United States, but, instead, I chose to emigrate to the United Kingdom. What made me do that?<br/>
First, the fact that Great Britain stood alone. Although I was born in a country which was dismembered by Hitler because of the errors committed by the party opposite at Munich&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Rubbish."]&#x2014;I nevertheless joined in the defence of these islands. I landed here with a rifle in my hands&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;I did not come here as a refugee.<br/>
I chose to live here, not only because Britain stood alone against Hitler, but because the people were prepared to sacrifice their everything and stood behind Winston Churchill in 1940, because this is a country which stands for fair play and in which political parties may have their differences but nevertheless talk to each other. There are no fisticuffs in this Chamber. There is, by and large, no corruption in British politics. We have considerable experience in world affairs and a considerable contribution to make in science, education and finance. In many

of the things Great Britain does, we tend to act pragmatically; for example, we often take the side of the underdog.<br/>
For all these reasons Europeans rightly feel that we have a contribution to make to uniting Europe. That is why I want the people of Europe to know that the speech which represents Great Britain is that made by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary this afternoon and not the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member for Easington. I urge hon. Members who wish to undermine these negotiations and who would like to see them fail to say what alternative they offer the youth of Britain. Our Empire has gone and the Commonwealth is disintegrating fast. What are we to offer in their place?<br/>
An opportunity to play a vital role in uniting this great Continent of Europe is a goal and challenge which we need as a nation. Just to argue about the price of tomatoes or to say that we want to know about nuclear defence treaties&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "We do."]&#x2014;is not enough. In any event, the Treaty of Rome contains no provision for discussions to be held on nuclear matters. What is the use of pressing the Prime Minister on this issue? He is bound to have months of being pressed by my hon. Friends in a troublesome and muddlesome way and, on this defence issue, he will have to tell them that it is not a subject which is being discussed. It cannot be discussed because provision for such discussion is not contained in the Treaty of Rome.<br/>
Now that Great Britain is genuinely prepared to take this decisive step to join the Community, what excites Europe is the fact that this decision has been taken by a Labour Government who represent the British workers&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>]&#x2014;and who most certainly represent the organised workers in the trade union movement in these islands. That makes this decision really mean something.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Albu) reminded the House, when hon. Gentlemen opposite were in Opposition on the last occasion they did nothing about this. Great Britain was invited to play a full part at the meeting at Messina; that was where the Treaty of Rome was written. At that time hon. Gentlemen opposite were in office, but they would not even send an


observer. They withdrew. I am glad to have them in the Lobby voting with the Government on this issue. It is a national issue and any hon. Member who is prepared to shilly shally or dilly dally on little matters&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>]&#x2014;will have to answer for that action in years to come.</p>

<p>Europe is on the verge of being united. An example of the failure of Great Britain's policies towards Europe is the fact that we are having to make a second application. We are having to accept a Treaty which we could have helped to frame. But we did not allow ourselves in because we believed, foolishly, that we still had the resources to play the great Power game. We have learned that we have not.<br/>
Our chronic balance of payments position, our lack of economic growth, the way the United States has let us down&#x2014; for instance, at Suez&#x2014;has merely convinced this country and this Government that if Britain is to have any chance at all of playing a role in world affairs, and if we are to give our people something really to look forward to, it can be done only jointly with our friends and allies in Europe.<br/>
Britain's entry into the European Economic Community should bring to an end once and for all the bloody rivalry amongst the European nation States that has caused blood letting in two succeeding generations and has led to the economic and political decline of this Continent. I would remind the House that many people in Europe believe, and I share the belief, that had Britain got involved in Europe earlier we would undoubtedly have prevented the last war, and might even have prevented the First World War.<br/>
Of the continental Powers, only France, under de Gaulle, has regained her vitality and confidence. Italy is too weak; Germany too unsure and guilt ridden. Britain's entry into the Common Market should usher in a new era of growth, stability and security for the nearly 200 million people of this great and ancient Continent of Europe. Let us resolve to take part in this noble venture with a will, and the determination to make a real contribution to freeing this Continent to manage its own affairs, to contribute to our own prosperity, to help raise the standard of living of the less well off people, and to play a leading r&#x00F4;le in the preservation of peace in the world.</p>

<p>Like the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Maxwell), I want us to enter Europe. Listening to the hon. Gentleman's peroration and his description of the countries which are prominent members of the European Community, I could not understand why he should want us to enter, because he seemed to have a very poor opinion of each of them.<br/>
I hope that the Government&#x2014;and I wish them success in their negotiations&#x2014;have spent some time not only preparing the ground by visits to the capitals but also preparing a staff of negotiators with detailed knowledge and experience of the Common Market countries. They will not just be dealing with major questions. Although I agree that it is probably right to stick to the major issues, it is the minor questions, the groceries, with which we as constituency Members will be concerned. The details of the negotiations must be prepared very thoroughly, and I hope that this will be done with the greatest care.<br/>
The Prime Minister is some one who can say that we are going to join the Common Market and that there will be no cause for failure on our part, but if there is cause for failure it will be his responsibility because I am not satisfied that he has prepared the ground or the diplomatic staffs with the detailed knowledge required for hard negotiations on many of the details.<br/>
A great deal has been said about agriculture and there is little I can add on the subject at this stage. It is expected that the price of food might increase by 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. It is essential that we should negotiate an interim period of approximately five years. That would mean that the increase in the cost of food could go up 2 per cent. or 3 per cent. a year over those years. As everyone knows, it has gone up far more than that in the last three years. It is essential to protect our contribution to the Guidance and Guarantee Fund. One of the things which has been brought out is that the guidance fund is limited in extent. I hope that it will be possible after 1970 to increase that fund, because that is something which will produce the potential for new methods in agriculture.<br/>
I do not think many of my hon. Friends or hon. Members opposite who disagree deeply with our entry have accepted the possibility that we might for once&#x2014;this is very rare under this Government&#x2014; actually have a reduction in taxes. We on this side of the House must insist that such a reduction of taxes shall be passed on to those who will suffer because of the increase in food prices, and passed on to the sector most in need.</p>

<p>I am not sure how my hon. Friend thinks that we shall get a reduction in taxes when we remember that the burden of taxation is higher in the Common Market countries than in ours.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-05-10a.1607.1" hansard_membership_id="10023" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29135" speakername="Mr. Webster" colnum="1607" time="">
<p>The agriculture support system is different. That is how there could be such a reduction. There is a great risk of the contribution to the Guidance and Guarantee Fund being anything from &#x00A3;150 million to &#x00A3;230 million, but it would be a bad negotiator who settled for less than &#x00A3;100 million or &#x00A3;120 million contribution to that fund. For that reason we should wish our

negotiators to be very thoroughly attuned to attitudes and thinking of the people in the European Commission.<br/>
There has been much talk about technology. This country, which has only a limited amount of raw materials, is dependent on skills. Hon. Members on both sides represent those skills in this House. We have been suffering from a brain drain not only through the loss of ability to pay people who are skilled engineers but through the loss of the capacity and loss of potential. There is a real dramatic scope for those industries in Britain and Europe. Despite the efforts of President de Gaulle, the brain drain is common to the French. It is common to the Germans and to every country in Europe. We see a crisis in at least one of the Communities which we are seeking to join. Euratom for the last 12 months has been unable to agree on a common budget. Much of the technological advance which we seek is to a great extent dependent on this. Projects at Winfrith stand at risk because of this. I hope that our entry will bring about negotiating skills for an agreement in this respect.<br/>
There are also the aircraft industry and the computer industry. The right hon. Member for Kettering (Sir G. de Freitas) spoke about institutions in Strasbourg and in this country. At that moment Black Rod came into this House. I gathered that it was for the last time. That is a procedure which, as he knows, does not happen in the European Parliaments.<br/>
If Britain goes into the Common Market, we in the House must insist that we contribute to the development of institutions in the Common Market so that the fears of the right hon. Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell) are allayed. We should have a European Parliament directly elected which can bring a European Commission to book. This is absolutely essential. At present, there is no control over a European Commission if it becomes excessive in its powers. There are various procedures, but they are seldom evoked. The British genius for democracy is greatly needed in developing the institutions which would be commen to all of us.<br/>
Those in the country and in the House who oppose our entry will, I think, agree that for the last fifty or sixty years there


has been an increasing spirit of malaise about this country. We have withdrawn from our Empire. We have withdrawn from our influence as a great naval power. When a country withdraws in that way, with whatever dignity, with whatever self-respect, and whatever institutions it attempts to bequeath to the countries it leaves behind and for which it has done its best, the operation is, at best, not an inspiriting performance. It is difficult and hard for all to bear.<br/>
Here for this country, on the threshold of Europe, there is another opportunity, another challenge. Those hon. Members who oppose our entry have eloquently put forward the challenge. I believe that this country and this House would rise to this challenge, make the great new partnership successful, and assist European countries in their own development.</p>

<p>I hope in the course of a very brief speech to make two passing references to the points which the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Webster) has made, particularly with regard to technology and horticulture.<br/>
At the outset it would probably be as well for me to declare an interest. This is an extraordinary debate in which to declare an interest, but such are the demands of the House that it is perhaps as well that I do so. In fact, upstairs at a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting I made a confession during the debate on the Common Market; but, through one of those curious aberrations,this happened to be one of the statements which was not leaked out in the course of the reports which appeared.<br/>
The declaration of interest which I feel compelled to make in this debate&#x2014; I apologise to those of my hon. Friends who have heard me say this for repeating it&#x2014;is that my wife is Australian, my maternal grandfather was Italian, and one of my maternal great-grandmothers was French. I am, therefore, in the position of being one-quarter Italian and one-eight French. I leave it to European computer development to work out exactly what my children will be. I have long felt that, if Britain joined the Common Market, in my case this would really mean the Common Market would be joining me.<br/>
I have felt for a long time that the ideal solution undoubtedly is to join the Common Market, provided that arrangements can be made to avoid letting down our friends and dishonouring the commitments which we have entered into. I am among those who have supported the concept of a wider Europe. I believe, together with many of my hon. Friends, that any decision to join should be linked with some clear commitment here.<br/>
Clearly, Britain's aim must be for closer links with Europe as a whole. There is undoubtedly a danger that the present European Economic Community could become increasingly inward-looking. I believe that Britain could make the E.E.C. more outward-looking as a body. Britain has a vital role to play in forging closer contacts, particularly with the Eastern European nations. In one body connected with the British Council, I have had something to do in the past eight or nine months with relations with Eastern European countries.<br/>
Considerable progress has been made in the past two years in improving relations between East and West, and I do not accept that membership of the European Economic Community would necessarily make these links harder to secure. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer said yesterday, it is notable that France under de Gaulle has made considerable strides in building up trade and other contacts with Eastern European countries, including some of the smaller countries, notably Rumania. Whether inside or outside, Britain must give greater momentum to these developments for closer links with Eastern European countries. From inside, we could help such developments, a point to which I shall return in a moment.<br/>
Insufficient attention has been paid in this debate, I feel, to what should happen if we do not succeed in our application&#x2014;if we make one&#x2014;to join the E.E.C. Last time, what damaged Britain's prestige more than anything else was not so much that there was humiliation felt because Britain did not get in but that, when the negotiations finally came to an end, the then Government seemed to be floundering, without a thought about where to go next. It may have been a factor contributing to our failure to get in last time that the alternatives were not sufficiently explained and dealt with during the negotiations. We had, and


have, no sufficient fall-back position. This was the mistake last time. Now, we must be ready with a prepared programme if we do not succeed in our application, if made. Nothing could be worse than a sense of let-down if we fail to get in and have not prepared for that possibility.<br/>
I should like to hear much more from the Government about the courses of action which they would propose to take in that event. There are two great advantages in putting forward the alternatives at this stage. First, there is the advantage of avoiding any sense of letdown. Second&#x2014;here I disagree profoundly with the view which the Leader of the Opposition put yesterday&#x2014;it would help our negotiating position if those with whom we shall be negotiating have a clear and precise indication of the alternatives which we consider to be open to us. After all, we are supposed not to be crawling into Europe. If the alternatives are explained sufficiently beforehand, this will be an added advantage in our negotiating position.<br/>
Whatever happens, whether we go in or not, we must be ready to maintain the momentum of developing links with Europe. If things go well with our application, this will, obviously, create a momentum of its own. If they do not&#x2014; I am not one of those who would regard that as an unmitigated disaster&#x2014;we must be ready to continue in top gear with a prepared series of alternative steps. In that event, the first steps to be taken, one assumes, would be a round of top-level talks with the East European countries&#x2014;I hope that this will take place in any case&#x2014;and with the Commonwealth countries as well, while maintaining our close contacts with the E.F.T.A. countries. Undoubtedly, these plans ought to be prepared in advance, and, as I say, such preparation would help our negotiating position.<br/>
Several hon. Members have said that we should show enthusiasm in making our application. If we put forward the alternatives open to us in the event of our not getting in, this of itself will show our determination to get in. It will be a measure of enthusiasm, and will be a help in our negotiating position.<br/>
There are a number of specific moves which ought to be made in connection

with this, moves not of some vague wider European concept, but tangible proposals for developing trade and other exchanges with East European and other countries. Much has been said about the need to develop the technological community which the hon. Member for Western-super-Mare mentioned in his speech, something which has been developed in a very tangible and specific way. There is also the need for a clearing house for scientific and technical information. These are specific tangible propositions which would provide an alternative series of proposals which could be followed if we fail in any application which might be made.<br/>
We cannot contemplate going through these convulsions once every five years. I do not often find myself in agreement with the hon. Member for Peterborough (Sir Harmar Nicholls), but I agree with him that it would be wrong to go through this upheaval once every five years, and it ought to be stated categorically now that this is a one-and-for-all exercise. Every time we engage upon any series of negotiations to enter the E.E.C. this obviously arouses both hopes and fears at home and abroad among our E.F.T.A. and Commonwealth partners. Although I am broadly in favour of entering the E.E.C. at this stage, I believe that we should state quite clearly that this application, if one is made as a result of tonight's Division, should be a once-and-for-all exercise and that if it fails we should then be prepared to go ahead with a clearly stated set of alternatives.<br/>
I have kept on fairly general points without going into some of the detailed balance sheet arguments. Obviously, coming from a partly agricultural constituency, I should like to mention some of the difficulties affecting agriculture and particularly affecting horticulture. But the important things which should be borne in mind in any application are that we should be ready to go ahead in top gear with an alternative in the event of failing to enter, and, secondly, that we should make it clear to our E.F.T.A. and Commonwealth partners that, if we fail this time, we do not intend to apply again.</p>

<p>I started my speech on Mr. Macmillan's Motion under Article 237


of the Treaty of Rome six years ago by expressing my sense of privilege that I was taking part in so momentous a debate. I feel that I cannot improve on that for a start to this speech in 1967, but I cannot offer any guarantee that in the rest of my speech I shall necessarily maintain that agreeably uncontroversial standard. Then as now some of my right hon. and hon. Friends felt constrained to put down an Amendment to the Motion, and I now commend our Amendment to the House.<br/>
In 1961, the economic side was stressed the more strongly, and it was necessary in those days to bring out the fact that there were great political and constitutional implications. Today, that is taken for granted. Indeed, the Government have said that their main purpose derives from the political aspect. It was said by the Prime Minister and confirmed today by the Foreign Secretary. Never-theless, it is still, of course, necessary to strike an economic balance sheet.<br/>
Economics after all, are a very important part of politics, and politicians who forget that soon have it brought home to them. I want to start by saying a word or two on the economic aspect. When one strikes an economic balance sheet, there are items on both sides, as there are in all but the very simplest transactions of life. Surely the salient feature here is that, whereas the economic advantages tend to be speculative and contingent, the economic disadvantages are certain and inescapable.<br/>
Let me try to make that proposition good. There are two main economic advantages claimed by advocates of entry. First there is the avoidance for our exports of the common external tariff of the Six, and secondly the claimed advantages of the so-called economies of scale&#x2014;the technological and other advances which are expected to accrue from a large market. The first of those advantages is factual. It is the only certain economic advantage of joining the Community. It is priced at &#x00A3;75 million a year.<br/>
On the other side of the balance sheet, the list of economic disadvantages is long and chilly. The increase in the cost of living we are told, will be 3 per cent. to &#x00BD; per cent., with its inevitable consequence of an increase in our production costs. and therefore in our export costs, with this difference, that the disadvantage

will not be confined to the Community, but will handicap our export endeavours in all the markets of the world.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has been long enough in the House to know that I always like to give way. I am not being guilty of any discourtesy, but at this stage of the debate we are on a timetable, and I have an argument to make. I hope that he will forgive me.<br/>
The list is: loss of Commonwealth and E.F.T.A. preferences, &#x00A3;130 million a year; increased costs of our imports, &#x00A3;150 million a year; payments on the compulsory agricultural levy, up to &#x00A3;250 million a year; adverse movement of capital, &#x00A3;100 million a year. <i>The Times</i> has obligingly done the arithmetic for us. It is &#x00A3;630 million a year to gain &#x00A3;75 million a year.<br/>
Gamblers who plunge rashly on being told that there is easy money to be made are called suckers. What then, is the right term to attach to a Government who plunge rashly when they know that they are to be involved in a certain loss&#x2014;a certain loss not even compensated by the so-called economies of scale, because the economy, we are told, will then be so deflated that we shall not be able to put them into operation?<br/>
When we last debated this matter in this House in November of last year I said, of the economic aspect, that at best it was non proven. In the light of the figures, and the knowledge that we now have, like Clive in Westminster Hall, I stand astonished at my own moderation. These are the calculations put forward for us by <i>The Times,</i> and they have not been gainsaid or rejected by the Treasury.<br/>
These are matters of trade. If they were to be refuted, who more authoritative, one would think, than the President of the Board of Trade, a man of known integrity, ability and experience? But we have not heard him in this debate. [HON. MEMBERS: "Where is he?"] My hon. Friends say,


"Where is he?". He has visited us from time to time at the far and less visible end of the Treasury Bench a transient and embarrassed phantom, scarcely even accorded the traditional privilege of the small boy&#x2014;to be seen and not heard. Anyway, he certainly has not been heard. I put this question to the right hon. Gentleman the Prime Minister, were he here and would forgive so simple a canine metaphor, why has the President of the Board of Trade been muzzled?</p>

<p>To what doghouse has the President of the Board of Trade been sent? Perhaps the Prime Minister will find that licensing is a two-way traffic. There may be those with the courage and integrity to hand back their licence if they do not agree with what is done.<br/>
Mark the strange turn of events; mark the curious paradox with which we are faced. <i>The Times</i> concludes its gloomy but convincing analysis with these words:
<q>Parliament must decide whether the economic cost is worth the political benefit.</q>
What strange words are these? Up to a short time ago, the advocates of entry were telling us that it was the political cost which was to be justified by the economic benefit, so strong was it. Now that argument is turned on its head, and we are invited to reach the same conclusion as to entry on precisely opposite reasoning.<br/>
It is not only the arguments which are not the same. The proponents are not the same. The commanding general is leading his troops in the opposite direction. In this debate we have heard a lot about conversion. I make no general criticism of political conversion. That is

partly what we are in politics for&#x2014;to convert other people to our way of thinking. Genuine conversion and frank avowal of error should never be reprobated. It should be respected and applauded.<br/>
The Prime Minister's conversion is notable; and, with the generosity so characteristic of him, he is determined not to keep it to himself. He is going to extend it to all his right hon. and hon. Friends. There was once a Roman Emperor, an early convert to Christianity, who had his troops baptised in battalions. That is the Prime Minister's technique: whipped into the water, a compulsory and collective immersion, zealots and sceptics alike.<br/>
We have heard several comparisons in the debate. The right hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger) made a comparison with the Road to Damascus. There are some ingredients which seem to be in parallel. The suddenness of the occasion is a close parallel. I am not so sure about the next one. St. Paul's conversion was wholly unconditional. After what the Foreign Secretary said, perhaps that also applies to the Prime Minister's. Then, of course, St. Paul's conversion was characterised by a shining sincerity. I hope that that also applies in the present case. After all, there is no harm in hoping.<br/>
I read another comparison in a newspaper which struck me as being nearer&#x2014;Peel's abandonment of Protection in 1846. The House may echo the sad query of a contemporary newspaper in 1846 in regard to Peel.
<q>The error of the right hon. Gentleman",</q>
said the newspaper,
<q>is perfectly inexplicable. The arguments in support of the Protection which he has so frequently and so eloquently used would have convinced us &#x2026; even had we not other irre-sistable evidence &#x2026;</q>
It ended with the sad query:
<q>&#x2026; how does it happen that they have not convinced himself?</q>
I also commend to the House what Disraeli said on Peel's conversion as being applicable here, too:
<q>Do not then because you see a great personage giving up his opinions&#x2014;do not cheer him on, do not give so ready a reward to tergiversation.</q>
Of course, it is not easy to see what caused his conversion.<br/>
It is fair to say that the Foreign Secretary had no need of conversion&#x2014; he is an old Common Market man&#x2014;and it would be nice to think that it was his cool, detached, analytical logic, his careful and patient ratiocination which had at last brought conviction to the rest of his right hon. Friends. It does not, however, fit in with the character given to the Foreign Secretary by his right hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell) and his hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot).<br/>
The hon. Member for Ebbw Vale likened the Foreign Secretary in his itinerant journeys to Sancho Panza. I, perhaps, having a kindlier nature than the hon. Member, have discovered a r&#x00F4;le equally useful, but more dignified, in the Foreign Secretary's relationship with the Prime Minister. As heir apparent, he stands in the same relationship as James Duke of York to Charles II: "They won't kill me, George, to make you king."<br/>
Just as there is nothing in the economic factors to justify this conversion, there is nothing either in the political or the constitutional. If there were political and constitutional objections in 1961, and, indeed, in March, 1966, they are still there today.<br/>
It has been said that I am making the same objections to the Treaty of Rome now as I was making six years ago. It is said by way of criticism. Consistency on matters of principle used to be a political virtue. Of course, principle now, as we know, is <i>d&#x00E9;mod&#x00E9;, vieux</i> jeu. It is pragmatism that is the rage, <i>le dernier cri.</i> I believe, however, that principles are still a good guide in politics, and not to be blown hither and thither by every passing puff of political fashion. If I am making the same points about the Treaty of Rome now, it is because it is the same Treaty of Rome, unamended and binding in perpetuity.<br/>
I have two short but, I hope, sufficient propositions on this aspect of the impact of the Treaty of Rome. I have always accepted that there is no express commitment to political federation or the wider aspects of defence and international relations in the Treaty of Rome; but it does not follow that we can disregard those matters.<br/>
Suppose that in time, in five, ten or fifteen years&#x2014;a short time in the life of a nation&#x2014;the Six decide to go forward

to full political federation, and we have signed the Treaty of Rome meanwhile. Would not our arrangements be so inextricably intertwined with theirs that we would have to go along with them whether we wanted it or not?<br/>
The first of my propositions is this. As we know, if we sign the Treaty, Britain will at once have to approximate her laws, over a wide range, to those of the Community. There is no dispute about this. The only dispute is as to how significant it would be. The Prime Minister, and the Lord Chancellor in another place, sought to mitigate it by producing a little list of laws which would not be affected&#x2014;the criminal law, the law of divorce, and so on. But most citizens do not spend their time in the criminal courts or the divorce courts. They are commercial people. And even then the list was inexact. One of the matters excluded was town and country planning; but the system of industrial development certificates would have to go, and this is at the root of planning for industrial use&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Somebody says "Nonsense", but perhaps the hon. Member would be good enough to look up Section 38 of the Town and Country Planning Act, and he will see how close the connection is; and, perhaps, then pass it on to the Prime Minister, and the Lord Chancellor, too.<br/>
The matters which are covered&#x2014;taxation and tariffs, transport and agriculture, the movement of workers and of capital, social services, and the distribution of industry are the heart and substance of our economic and social life.<br/>
Then for the future&#x2014;my second proposition&#x2014;Article 189 of the Treaty has been referred to. It says that, for the achievement of their aims,
<q>The Council and Commission shall issue regulations and directives</q>
and that the regulations
<q>shall be binding in every respect and directly applicable in each Member State.</q>
That means that Parliament here would not be able to reject or vary the regulations. The collective laws of the Community would bind the individual British citizen, and Parliament and the courts alike would be powerless to intervene.<br/>
These are what are called lesser issues &#x2014;or, perhaps, not even issues at all. How can such things be? How can the sovereignty of Parliament and the rule of law be lesser issues? And what are the scales which can give such short weight as that? I say these are great issues&#x2014;the long unfolding of our common law, and the evolution of our Parliamentary system, cradled here in Westminster, and copied, adapted and emulated to the far corners of the earth, the envy of the bond and the model of the free. These are great issues, and they are to be weighed in the scales of principle.<br/>
The House will recall what Burke said in regard to Ship Money:
<q>Twenty shillings would not have ruined Mr. Hampden's fortune. But the payment of half twenty shillings, on the principle on which it was demanded, would have made him a slave.</q>
May I conclude by saying a word about my vote tonight and the reasons for it? It will not be a mere anti vote. The newspapers, for ease of reference, tend to label me and those who think like me as anti-Marketeers. That is, of course, a considerable over-simplification. I am not hostile to the Community. Far from it. At the very outset of this controversy, on 2nd August, 1961, I testified in this House to my respect for the Community, for the nations which comprise it, and for the gentlemen who administer its affairs; and I abide by that today. I further claim to be as good a European as the advocates of entry.<br/>
To be a good European, one does not have to be exclusively European. That is what we are now told we must be. We are told that we must loosen our Commonwealth and Atlantic ties, that we must turn our backs on the outside world, that we must become not only exclusively European but exclusively Western European to the prejudice, if need be, of our partners in E.F.T.A. I am too good a European to acquiesce in any breach of faith with them. We are told that we must do these things in order to induce General de Gaulle to raise the portcullis and let us in.<br/>
I find that something of a paradox. Consider the dates. The Treaty of Rome was signed in March, 1957. The General came to power in France in May, 1958. Supposing that those dates had been reversed. Does anyone think that France,

under his leadership, would have signed the Treaty of Rome in its present unamended form and accepted all its supranational rigidities and its invasions of sovereignty?<br/>
Now we are told that the General is the arbiter of this matter; and I must say that it saddens me somewhat to hear people conjecture, with bated breath and resigned expressions, whether or not the General will let us in, and how great a renunciation he will demand of us to do so. I do not think that Britain's fate and fortune should be at the decision of any man, however illustrious. In saying that, certainly I mean no disrespect to the General. He is a great man, a great leader and a great patriot. I do not think that I can add that he is a great democrat, because I understand that he takes a somewhat robustly Cromwellian view of Parliamentary institutions.<br/>
The House will recall the familiar lines:
<q>Upon what meat does this our Caesar feed, That he is grown so great?</q>
and,
<q>&#x2026; he doth bestride the narrow world.</q>
<q>Like a Colossus; and we petty men</q>
<q>Walk under his huge legs, and peep about".</q>
I will not conclude the quotation, because I believe that it is not apt either now or at any time. There will never be a dishonourable grave for Britain, whether in the Common Market or outside.<br/>
I believe that Britain still has a lively and useful part to play on the world stage. It will not be the same role precisely as we have played in the past, because it is a changing world, and certainly I accept that. It is not because this application has in it vast change and great risk that I shall say "No" tonight. Britain has always accepted risk and weathered change; and we must accept change and the need for adaptability if we are to go on playing our part in the fast-moving modern world in which we live, with all its hopes and its hazards, its perils and its problems.<br/>
I am not inward looking nor backward looking. I am concerned with Britain's global contribution in the future in a changing world. I believe that this contribution can best and most effectively be made with the minimum of regional restriction and institutional inhibition.<br/>
Given those circumstances, I believe that there is still a great world r&#x00F4;le for


Britain to play as the advocate and exemplar of all the great causes, for which Britain has traditionally stood&#x2014; for justice, for peace, for freedom, for tolerance and fair dealing between man and man, and as an interpreter and emollient influence in a troubled and turbulent world. That is a r&#x00F4;le to which I believe Britain can and should still aspire. Believing this, it is in no negative spirit but in that profound conviction that I shall cast my vote tonight.</p>

<p>I am very pleased that three days of patience have been rewarded, but I am sorry that the only woman to speak in this debate should be left to the end. I promised you, Mr. Speaker, to sit down at five minutes to ten. So I have only five minutes.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) has put very effectively the economic cost of Britain's entry into the Common Market, which is one of the main reasons why I oppose it. I always have done so, because I can see quite clearly that the burdens of Britain's entry, as burdens always are, will be put on the shoulders of those least able to bear them. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said on Monday that certain consumer goods are likely to be reduced in price. We have been told that apples and tomatoes would come down in price. That is marvellous. That is the basic fodder&#x2014;is it not?&#x2014;for large families, for pensioners and for people with less than &#x00A3;12 a week.<br/>
The fact is that the basic commodities that these families need are bread, dairy products, butter and meat&#x2014;which some of them are already able to afford only infrequently&#x2014;and that these will become prohibitive in price. My right hon. Friend also said all would be well if we could achieve a 3 per cent. growth in our national product. But, <i>pace</i> the National Plan, we have not been able to achieve an increase in our national product so that the only way in which we can finance the balance of payments deficit is by deflation of something like 10 per cent. or by increasing the level of unemployment to 4 per cent. That is what <i>The Times</i> told us in the article quoted by the right hon. and learned Gentleman. This is good enough reason for me as a Socialist to be opposed.<br/>
But my main reason for opposing British entry is on political grounds. My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Maxwell) gave us a geography lesson, and in his interpretation Europe is divided into three <i>blocs.</i> I do not believe that our going into one <i>bloc</i> will give us more independence to do what we ought to be doing, and I do not agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Mr. Boston) that we should try to go into the Common Market first. We should first be doing what he suggested&#x2014;that is, to try and bring the three <i>blocs</i> together.<br/>
This is one of the main reasons for my disappointment with the speech of my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, in which he showed no cognisance of these problems and their solution in bringing together the E.E.C., E.F.T.A. and Comecon. Together, all these countries have a greater gross national product than the United States, and that is the main economic problem of the world.<br/>
If my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary were to use their enormous talents, the skill they possess, the influence they have in the world and the expertise they have obtained in their journeys around Europe to do precisely that, it would bring enormous benefit to our people, because here is a really expanding market.<br/>
The market of the Six is not an expanding market any more. It is slowing down. West Germany has the same number of unemployed as we have. Its productive capacity has fallen. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The market of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, on the contrary, is a growing market where our consumer goods and our engineering products could find a ready sale.

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The "gentlemen's party" is not very polite tonight.<br/>
It is in this direction that I believe the salvation for our people lies and not in going into this restrictive group which cements the divisions of Europe. Our destiny lies in seeking to create the united Europe and the united world that I believe all of us want to see.<br/>
I say to my right hon. Friend that a great deal of the solution to our problem lies in our own endeavours. For heaven's sake, let us take the brakes oft the British economy and make our approaches in those markets where we know there is a rising standard of living and a demand for the things that we can produce.</p>

<p>On a point of order.

<p>I am glad that you said "in the reply". Mr. Speaker. This has been a debate of remarkable quality, fully measuring up to the immense significance of the issues that we have been discussing. Many points of view have been expressed, in every case with frankness, clarity and conciseness. In the course of this three days' debate, we have run over the whole range of the arguments. It is now right for us as a House to take this solemn decision. It is my responsibility, on behalf of the Opposition, to sum up the reasons why we shall support the Government Motion this evening in the Lobby.<br/>
I am sorry to have a difference with my right hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith). I well understand the anxieties which underlie their Amendment. We all well understand them. The Government still have a responsibility to try to dispel or mitigate some of these anxieties. They have not done so so far.<br/>
I want to take up a point with which I hope the Minister will deal&#x2014;the question of the minor issues, or groceries. What are they? Sincere questions have been asked by hon. Members on both sides of the House again and again. What are these minor issues which are to be relegated for decision after entry into the Community? I hope that the Minister will answer this question fully, because it is of immense importance.<br/>
I must oppose my right hon. Friends and recommend to my other right hon. and hon. Friends that they should oppose them, for the overwhelming reason that the effect of the Amendment would be to register the opposition of this House to the Government's initiative&#x2014;to register disapproval&#x2014;and this we cannot do. The Conservative Party has constantly expressed, at and between elections, its belief that it is right for Britain to make a further effort to join the Community. For that reason, I am afraid that with great regret I must recommend my hon. Friends to reject the Amendment.<br/>
I have been concerned with the problems of the European Economic Community for more than 10 years. I have always been convinced that it is in the interests of this country and the whole of Western Europe to have a single Western European economic system.<br/>
This debate has been called historic. It is historic in the sense that it is important and in the sense of unity between both sides of the House to such a remarkable degree&#x2014;but it is not new. It is part of a continuing process that has gone on for many years. We attempted, in the Free Trade Area negotiations in 1957 and 1958, to achieve an objective of this character. The right hon. Member the Leader of the Liberal Party quoted something that I said about not having dreamed of trying to enter the Common Market in the late 1950s. This was because we then had the possibility of a free trade area which would have avoided many of the difficulties of joining the Common Market and&#x2014;this is often forgotten now&#x2014;which was explicitly accepted before the Treaty of Rome was even signed by all the other European countries, including the heads of Government of Germany and France.<br/>
We were therefore in 1957&#x2013;58 trying to achieve a free trade area. If we had done so, it would have made a better


basis for the future of Europe than we see at present. The attempt failed, as we know. The veto was imposed. Then there came my right hon. Friend's attempt to see if we could find a means of entering the European Community. What is now happening is a continuation of that process.<br/>
The Foreign Secretary this afternoon tried to draw a distinction which I do not follow. I can see no distinction between a conditional application to join and an application to join on the basis of conditions to be agreed in negotiations. He made it: clear&#x2014;I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends noticed this&#x2014;that if the conditions were not right the Government would not be prepared, in those regrettable circumstances, to recommend to this country final agreement to entry of the Community.<br/>
It is therefore right for us now, as we have done through the debate, to weigh the issues pro and con, both economic and political. Although it is balanced, the decision comes down definitely and decisively on the side of applying to join the Community.<br/>
There are both long-term and short-term considerations, and I believe that far too much attention has been paid in the debate to the short-term considerations. We are discussing a decision which holds good not for five years but for fifty years and more. We are discussing the whole economic future organisation of Europe and probably of the Western world&#x2014;the whole political future, in many ways&#x2014; and, important though the short-term considerations are, it is the long-term future which matters, and this must be what we concentrate on.<br/>
The great disadvantage is that the short-term factors, which are, on the whole, adverse economically, are far more easy to quantify than the long-term advantages. One can add up, after a fashion, the short-term difficulties, but it is hard to put any figure on the long-term advantages.<br/>
In an extraordinarily powerful speech, the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot) talked about guesswork. I do not think that it is guesswork. I think that it is judgment and faith which we need in this matter. We have to make a decision about what, in the long term, will be the interests of this country. This

is a matter just as much of faith and of judgment as it is of guesswork.<br/>
While we weigh in the balance in this debate, as we are doing, whether it is right for this country to go in and to apply or not to apply, once having made our decision, let us pursue it with enthusiasm and determination all the way through. It is no good being halfhearted. It is right to be dispassionate and to reject sentiment about the past and about the future, and there is danger of both. The judgment having been reached dispassionately, it must be followed with all the enthusiasm which we can manage.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Webster) said that this is a challenge. Let us regard it as a challenge. Having made our decision, let us accept the challenge and obtain from meeting it all the benefits for our people and those of Western Europe which can be involved in a historic move forward of this character.<br/>
I look first at the economic considerations. In the short term, of course, there are difficulties. Prices, particularly of food, will rise, as we know. Against that, one must offset, first, the falls in prices of other commodities and, second, a substantial reduction in Government expenditure as a result of the reduction in subsidies. Both these factors can well mitigate the effect of the rise in the food prices on the cost of living.<br/>
Second, British agriculture will have to face great changes&#x2014;they might better be called distortions: shifts from one form of production to another&#x2014;but, in total, I have no doubt that our highly efficient modern agriculture will benefit from participation in a wide community with a rapidly growing consumer power, a community in which the political power of the farmers in terms of numbers is probably much greater even than it is in this country.<br/>
It is hard to assess the immediate effect of joining on the balance of payments. We gain access to an enormous market and we gain access on a basis of preference against our main external industrial competitors, the United States and Japan. This will be an enormous gain, particularly to our engineering, electrical and modern developing technological industries.<br/>
We lose preferences in E.F.T.A. and the Commonwealth, and little has been said about our Commonwealth preferences. Indeed, I say frankly that not enough has been said on this issue, remembering that they are valuable still and because we must recognise what we are losing by giving them up. We face competition in our own markets from Europe. In many cases, such as chemicals, we will have to have tariff protection against third countries lower under the common tariff than we enjoy under our own one at the moment.<br/>
Little has also been said on the question of invisibles. This is something which gives us an enormous part of our export income, and from invisibles and the skill and ability of the City of London, the banks, insurance companies and commodity markets, this country will reap a rich harvest in a wide European market. This is a big factor concerning entry which has so far been virtually ignored.<br/>
Then the question of capital movement. I agree that there are dangers in free capital movement, but we should not assume that all the risks are on one side. The City of London has the most highly developed capital market outside the United States&#x2014;way ahead of any capital market on the Continent of Western Europe. Our ability to mobilise savings, not only here but from European countries as well, will be of great importance.<br/>
Added to that is the almost certain development of greater United States investment in the United Kingdom as a result of our joining the E.E.C. I am sure that we could look forward, if we are confident and capable enough, to a substantial gain on the balance of payments on the capital side of the account.<br/>
We must, then, consider the agricultural levies. It is logical to say that, in a complete economic union, levies on imports should fall into the same fund, whatever the port of entry, as it were. But complete economic union is a long way ahead, and at the present time the effect of the regulations unamended would throw a heavy burden on the British balance of payments. The Prime Minister rightly made this point, and I am glad to know that it is one matter on which he will be keeping a close eye during the negotiations.<br/>
I can sum up on the short-term issue by saying that the factors are adverse and that we will probably lose on the balance of payments. The Prime Minister calculated that there would be a &#x00A3;100 million a year shift to export or import saving on an accumulative basis. This is a formidable figure, and I am inclined to think that it may be an underestimate. A shift of &#x00A3;100 million from domestic consumption to exports may easily mean more than &#x00A3;100 million off domestic demand. On top of this, we have the other problems which are involved in the need to expand our economy while maintaining a healthy balance of payments position. To do all this as well is a very formidable task indeed. I hope that the Government are not underestimating it and that they realise that the House is entitled tonight to hear more about how the Government hope to catch up on this problem, remembering that it will be a practical, early, and growing one.<br/>
These are the short-term factors as I see them, and, as I have said, I believe that they are outweighed by the long-term advantages. I am convinced that we will come to this conclusion if we look at the basic economic problem of this country, which is to increase our productivity, and if we compare our performance with that of our main industrial competitors, particularly the United States, which has three main advantages&#x2014;first, a larger market; secondly, far greater research and development and, thirdly, different attitudes in industry on the part of management and unions. These three things can be dealt with by our joining the E.E.C.<br/>
The size of the market is too obvious to need stressing. The availability of long runs of production obviously brings down costs enormously. Recent figures we have seen about the chemical industry show clearly how the very efficient plants in this country cannot compete in terms of cost with the American plants of equal efficiency. This is because the Americans have so much bigger a market. That is a very important factor, indeed.<br/>
A second factor is the development of technology&#x2014;not merely producing the bright new ideas that our own scientists do produce but turning them into the construction of hardware to be produced on the factory floor. Development problems, problems of technology, must


always yield more easily to those who have greater numbers to apply to them. If the Americans can put eight engineers on to a problem and we can put only one, the Americans are likely to solve it better and more quickly than we shall. We cannot get this large technological basis for industrial development unless we have a market of adequate scale on which to found it.<br/>
As to the attitude of industry, both Management and unions, we can increase our productivity greatly without any additional capital equipment simply by working better and with more modern applications. I fear that it is harder to get Englishmen to change their methods of work than it is to get them to work longer hours. If we join a wider economic area, the effect will be large revivification of management and unions in their attitude to responsibility, innovation and progress in British industry. These are the three major economic arguments for joining the Community.<br/>
There are, of course, matters on the other side. A small country can exist and prosper alongside big countries, as is the case with the Swiss chemical industry or the Swiss machine tool industry, or the Swedish aircraft industry and the Swedish motor industry. It is quite possible to be small and efficient. One must not over-exaggerate the arguments about scale.<br/>
Secondly, to get the full benefit of the advantages that scale can bring one wants not merely the suppression of tariffs but such things as a common company law, a common taxation basis, a common commercial law&#x2014;all the things that exist in economic union and are essential for the creation of the major international companies which will have to be formed if we are to get the benefits of modern technology on the maximum scale.<br/>
I therefore conclude, basically, that we need the room to expand our industry and, above all, we need the room to expand our technologically based industry. If we look at the pattern of our trade, it is quite clear that more and more we are concentrating on more highly specialised development projects, and this demands a market of adequate scale. That is the first reason why I believe that, in the long-term, it must be right to try to join the European Economic Community.<br/>
The second reason is the negative one. Suppose we stay outside, suppose we are excluded, we shall be facing across the Channel a competitor with an industrial base on the scale of the United States but with levels of wages and salaries more akin to our own than to the American. This would be a formidable competitor, not only in Europe but throughout the rest of the world, including those areas like E.F.T.A. and the Commonwealth where we still continue to enjoy a preferential position. Those are the two fundamental economic arguments: we need the large markets, and to be excluded would present us with a competitor on a formidable scale.<br/>
It has, of course, been stressed on many occasions that there are alternatives. I agree that there are alternatives. I am not sure that we need necessarily chase after new ideas, but I would not dismiss the idea of a North Atlantic Free Trade Area quite as quickly as did the Foreign Secretary this afternoon. But why do we need alternatives'? I believe that if we fail to get in we can still prosper and grow on the existing trade patterns, but we shall not prosper and grow, and Europe will not prosper and grow, on the scale that could be achieved if we were in the Community. This is the fundamental point. It is not ruin outside and prosperity inside, since we work together in both cases, but far greater success inside than could be obtained outside.<br/>
The difficulties which have stood in the way of our membership of the Community are, of course, well known. I do not believe they need be in any way decisive. I am quite convinced that experience has shown that any difficulty that can exist can be solved given good will all round and a mutual determination by all countries concerned to solve, those problems.<br/>
Agriculture used to be a stumbling block in 1957&#x2013;58, and it was difficult in the early 'sixties. It is not the same difficulty now with the ready acceptance, rightly I believe, by the Government of the Common Agriculture Policy. The Commonwealth used to be put forward as a great difficulty, and there are difficulties which exist, but it is now apparent to all Commonwealth countries that basically their interest is in a strong British


economy, a strong consuming country and a capital-providing country. Given proper attention to such problems as New Zealand butter and the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement, it must be in the Commonwealth's long-term interest and, therefore, for the strength and health of the Commonwealth that we should be inside the Community rather than outside.<br/>
The other argument which is sometimes advanced against our membership is that we are not true Europeans. I find this a difficult argument to understand. I do not quite know what it means. We are by history, by tradition, by everything in our nation, Europeans. If it means that we do not wish to participate in a narrow inward-looking Europe that is true, but that is not my conception of what is meant by being European. I want to be a member of a European Community which is fundamentally outward-looking, West and East alike.<br/>
The question of our special relationship with the United States often comes up, and I should like to say a word or two about this. I believe that we in this country have a special relationship with the United States, but properly understood this relationship would bring to the Common Market not an element of disruption but an element of greater strength. There are permanent and transient features in our American-British relationship.<br/>
The permanent features are in custom, history, kinship, friendship&#x2014;all human relationships which spring from something which is permanent. There are the less-permanent features which are strategic and defence which are affected by particular circumstances. But in the long-term our relationship with America is of a special human character. To bring this into the Community would be of tremendous value. I am certain that to see a new division arising between North America and Western Europe would be of great danger to all of us. To see a return by the United States to isolation would be for the United States to cut herself off from the culture and political experience and contacts of Europe, and that would be bad for her; indeed, to see the possibility of the United States and the Soviet Union coming to a deal over our heads in Europe, as they might well be tempted to do if we cut

ourselves off, would be disastrous for us. I ask the Government to concentrate on this.<br/>
The Prime Minister in his first speech, emphasised&#x2014;I think I am right in my recollection&#x2014;that his concept of a united Europe including Britain was one which should contribute to greater strength of the Atlantic Alliance and of the Atlantic Community. That is of tremendous importance. There is a real danger that in the years ahead if there were to be created a rather inward-looking Europe and if all our forces were withdrawn from east of Suez the Americans might say, "The Europeans are now the isolationists. We will turn our backs on Europe, look across the Pacific and with Australia and New Zealand we shall concentrate our objectives there and ignore Europe." I hope very much that in our dealings in these negotiations we shall have constantly in mind the need for maintaining the unity of the Western world.<br/>
Another difficulty raised about our membership is the position of sterling. As the Chancellor explained cogently, this is not a real difficulty. We can deal with balance of payments problems within the parameters of the Treaty of Rome as well as outside. As for the position of sterling as a reserve currency, this in a sense is a red herring. People sometimes talk as if having a reserve currency is a privilege. It is not, it is a burden. We have a reserve currency because other people hold our currency and this means we owe money. This is a fact which I sometimes point out to Continentals who say that they would like to have a reserve currency. I think that we would welcome that. Both the United States and Britain would welcome the emergence of other reserve currencies to supplement the dollar and sterling.<br/>
Indeed, in the proposals I put before the I.M.F. meeting in 1962, we were suggesting bringing in other strong currencies and imprinting on them the stamp of the I.M.F., in order to create new reserve currencies to help fulfil this function.<br/>
There is a deep misunderstanding here which must be dispelled. We are not clinging jealously to some special privilege in having a reserve currency. We are proud of sterling as an international medium of exchange. We are determined


to maintain our obligations to those to whom we owe money. Subject to that, the sooner methods can be devised&#x2014;on a world-wide basis&#x2014;not on a European one&#x2014;of supplementing the two reserve currencies the better we shall be pleased. Therefore, I do not see any possible difficulty to our joining the Community arising from the special position of sterling as a reserve currency.<br/>
These are the main economic problems that seem to exist before us. I come briefly, in the few minutes remaining to me, to the political problems. Where do we stand with E.F.T.A.? Will the Minister in replying please be absolutely clear as to where we stand with our colleagues on E.F.T.A., because we do not wish in any way to jeopardise our obligations to them?<br/>
As to the Commonwealth, we have heard about New Zealand butter and about sugar. What about the arrangement my right hon. Friend worked out with such patience and success in Brussels dealing with die problems, for example, of India, and the problems of cereals from Canada and Australia? Where do the Government stand on them?<br/>
I turn finally to the question of foreign policy. It is argued mat this is mainly a political rather than an economic issue. I accept the arguments. There can be few higher aspirations for us than to play our part in avoiding, first of all, further or future conflicts within Western Europe and to play our part in me political and diplomatic development of Europe and in our relations with Eastern Europe. Also, I see it as a noble aspiration for Britain to try to ensure that her voice is made as loud, as clear and as effective as possible within Europe in the councils of the world. It might be said to be a choice, perhaps, between having a partial say in a very large voice and having complete control over our own voice. But in the modern world, to have complete control over one's own foreign policy and one's own foreign dispositions is asking more than history will grant now to any independent nation.<br/>
I am sure that we must look at this decision with eyes that are clear and in no way starry, either about the past or about the future. We must not think too much in terms of black and white. These issues are far too subtle for that.<br/>
The progress of the Community, constantly bringing changes, means that a static picture is bound to be misleading. The terms of the Treaty of Rome are modified, for example, by practice, as in the case of migration. The facts of economic life together will mean far more economic decisions being taken in common than are specifically provided for within the Treaty of Rome. We shall finish up, if we enter, with a common currency, a common reserve system, and common policies on the pressure of demand, because there cannot be a free movement of goods, labour and capital unless we work on this basis. This is not part of the Treaty of Rome. It is part of the sheer logic of economic co-operation.<br/>
Then, on the political side, it is true that there is nothing in the Treaty about political unity. But, as the right hon. Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell) pointed out&#x2014;he referred to an article written by M. Spaak&#x2014;political unity underlies this great concept of economic unity.<br/>
On the other hand the question is asked: how can there be a single voice speaking for Europe, unless there is a common foreign policy? This is a good argument in logic but a bad one in practice. It is a good example of having too much black and white, because the way these things will develop is far more pragmatic than that, if I may use a word which is a little overworked in this debate, perhaps. This is where our political skill will mainly be deployed. If we try to argue between theoretical federation or the theory of the <i>Europe des &#x00E9;tats</i>, we would not cope with the real problems, which are the problems coming up every day in economics and in politics.<br/>
The way in which the voice of Europe will get stronger is by European countries working together, understanding one another better, and coming to common policies; not by being forced to do so, but because they want to do so.<br/>
Those are the reasons why I believe, as I have for some time now, that it is right for us to apply to join the Common Market. There are dangers. There are the short-term economic problems, I agree. One cannot be certain what will develop in the future. There are great political problems and changes to be


faced among all the nations of the Western world, and there is the need to maintain the cohesion of the Western world in a highly dangerous international situation. All these are dangers. We cannot embark on a course like this without facing dangers.<br/>
We have to weigh the short-term disadvantages which we can see clearly with the long-term advantages which we can see if we have an eye to look for them and determination to realise them. As I said at the beginning, I believe that we should weigh this decision carefully and calmly, and then, having taken our decision, enter upon our course with all the enthusiasm and determination which this nation can muster.</p>

<p>At the outset of this impressive debate, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made very clear the difficulties and problems which this country will face in the approach to the European Economic Community and the difficulties which will confront her in the opening years of membership of the Community. Each one of my right hon. Friends who has spoken from this Box has done the same in his own field.<br/>
I am sure that it was right to state the difficulties plainly. It was right, in the first instance, from the point of view of our own countrymen. It ought not to be said at the end of this debate that the Government have made any attempt to minimise the real and serious problems which face us, and, in view of the speeches which have been made, I am sure that that charge could not now be levied. It was right, also, to make the difficulties clear for the purpose of the negotiations themselves. Those with whom we are to negotiate should not be left in any doubt that the matters which we shall raise are by no means trivialities. They are matters vital to this country. It is important to stress this plainly so that no one need suppose that, when we raise them, we are in any sense making unnecessary difficulties. We want there to be, on both sides of the negotiations, a correct appreciation of the size of the problems, neither maximising nor minimising them. It was right, therefore,

during this debate, to make clear the size of the problems with which we are faced.<br/>
During the debate itself, each hon. Member who has spoken, as, I suppose, was natural, has developed, according to his particular experience, constituency concerns and personal knowledge, this or that problem. Altogether, it is a tough thicket of difficulties through which we have to make our way. But, while it is entirely right that this should be made clear in the debate, we must not&#x2014;here I agree with the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Barnet (Mr. Maudling)&#x2014; make the mistake of taking too short-term a view of what is involved. If we see without illusions the tough thicket of difficulties, we must also have sufficient vision to see what opportunities lie beyond once we have carved our way through that thicket, and we must have the prudence to see what dangers lie in wait for us if this effort either is not made or is unsuccessful.<br/>
The difficulties to which reference has been made in the debate are partly economic and partly political. I take, first, the range of economic difficulties. These are partly concerned with the joint effect on our economy of changes in the cost of living, the balance of payments, and capital movements.<br/>
Many estimates have been made and quoted during the debate of what they are. When trying to assess the validity of these estimates, we should notice that there are the following considerations which we should bear in mind. The first is a very obvious one, but it has certainly been obscured in the presentation in some organs of the Press, that, for example, the changes in the cost of living do not occur all at once and overnight. This was made very clear in the speech of my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture when he stressed&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.]&#x2014;I expected that reaction and I will now invite hon. Members opposite to consider what they really wanted in this respect. Did they want the Government to come to the debate and minimise the serious problems which face us in this respect? Do they think that my right hon. Friend was wrong to present as clearly and as plainly as possible what those difficulties are? Do they think that he was wrong to say that, because of that, a long transitional period would be necessary?<br/>
Those questions they have not answered. The right hon. Member for Grantham (Mr. Godber) agreed with my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture that the House ought not to tie his hands by an exact statement of what the transitional period would be, and any responsible person knows that. I was present at the end of the debate last night and nearly all the back benchers of the party opposite were baying at the Minister to name an exact period, and the right hon. Member for Grantham, who today says that it would be wrong to tie the Minister's hands, offered not one word of rebuke or discouragement at the time to those of his hon. Friends who were doing so.<br/>
In a true assessment of the economic difficulties, we have not only to take into account the fact that there will be&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-05-10a.1637.1" hansard_membership_id="12514" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30989" speakername="Mr. Stewart" colnum="1637" time="">
<p>I have listened to about three-quarters of the debate during the three days which it has lasted. I think hat I am entitled to reply and I think hat hon. Members who have spoken are entitled to hear what I now have to say in reply. The hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Sir J. Rodgers) tells me not to be party political; he might have made that remark to his right hon. Friend the Member for Grantham.<br/>
A true assessment of the size of the economic difficulties means that not only must we take into account the fact that there is a transitional period, but also that we ought not to make at the outset the assumption that we shall have no success in any negotiations about the levies, about the use of the Fund, or about any other adjustments which may be made. It is a significant fact that some of the estimates of our difficulties are made on the assumption that we shall secure no success in negotiations in any of these matters. It is not a legitimate way to conduct the argument to assume that if we go in, everything will be unfavourable to us in the course of the negotiations, but that if we stay out, all the surrounding circumstances will be favourable.<br/>
For instance, it has been asked whether, if we do not attempt to go in, or if we fail, E.F.TA. will remain for us

still to belong to. I hope so, but it would be quite wrong to talk as though that were a fixed and certain fact. If we are to take a gloomy view of what we achieve or do not achieve in the negotiations, we have to take a similarly cautious view of what threatening things might happen to us if we do not make the attempt, or if we do not get in.<br/>
We should also notice, in assessing the size of the economic burden, that a large amount of money now spent on agricultural support costs will not be needed for that purpose. We shall, at least, not have to pay twice over, in the Community's way and in our own. In the attempt to assess the whole net effect of the immediate economic burden, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor gave the cumulative figure of &#x00A3;100 million, climbing over a period of five years, to which the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Barnet (Mr. Maudling) referred.<br/>
I quite accept his point that we must not treat this as if it were a light achievment, but it is right to set it in proportion. This is about one third of 1 per cent. of the gross national product. I accept that this is not money that falls into only one flat. Neither is it something so enormous that we ought to support this argument by saying that it is something beyond the powers of this country to achieve.<br/>
The mention of it brings us to the point that very much turns in this argument on what we may expect in the way of increased powers of growth in this country. It is to that in a few minutes which I shall turn. Before doing so, I should like to make this last remark on the question of the undoubted immediate difficulties. It has now been stated in all quarters of the House that the necessary measures, fiscal or through the social services, must be taken to see that these burdens are not left casually to lie where they fall, some of them hitting people who can least afford to be hit. It was made quite clear by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in the television interview that it would be necessary to deal with this problem through pensions and social services. A similar statement was made, I was glad to notice, by the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Sir Alec Douglas-Home), when he


spoke of the need to help those who might be hardest hit.<br/>
Other speakers, particularly those representing agricultural interests, have in some cases asked for particular compensation for particular people. The House will be with me when I say that it would be quite unreasonable to try to spell out at this stage of the proceedings the exact machinery with which one deals with that problem. I am sure that I am right and I am sure that the House will agree when I say that we must start from the general principle that if any particular group is bearing a particular share of the immediate burden, the community should come to its rescue, and such difficulties as there are should be fairly spread, just as, we trust, the later benefits will be spread throughout the community.</p>

<p>This is a very important point. I take it that when my right hon. Friend mentions the lower income groups, he is including in this, we hope, the lower wage earners who, because they are wholly employed under the National Insurance Acts today, cannot get any assistance?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-05-10a.1639.1" hansard_membership_id="12514" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30989" speakername="Mr. Stewart" colnum="1639" time="">
<p>My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister dealt with that point on television. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The point that my hon. Friend makes is a right and entirely legitimate one, and it falls within the compass of what I have said, that wherever one finds a particular group which can say that the action of Britain in going into the Community has struck it particularly hard, the community must go to its rescue. Clearly as essential is the fact that the growth of the economy during those years should be sufficient to justify the attempt to make it possible, not merely to counteract the immediate burden, but to bring to this country a great many advantages. There are very solid reasons for believing this to be so.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Albu) pointed out, I think rightly, that he, some time ago, was the first to emphasise in this House the great and increasing importance of economies of scale in industry. That is a point which I need not labour now. It has been made by many hon. Members. The only point which I wish to make in addition is that not only is it of great importance now, for example, in the chemical, plastics, elec-

tronics, motor car and computer industries, but that it is a factor which will be of growing importance to our economy in the years to come.<br/>
That will mean that if we do not get into the Common Market, as the years go by the difficulties which we shall face in trying to sell in world markets in competition with industries that can reap the economies of scale will grow over the years. This is an additional reason why we cannot, in trying to strike the balance sheet, tot up the burdens and difficulties, on the one hand, and then assume that if we do not go in, everything will proceed smoothly. We must accept from the nature of industrial development that if we do not go in the struggle to provide our people with a proper standard of life will be conducted in increasingly difficult circumstances.<br/>
We should notice, too, that one of the problems which we face in this country, in a number of industries, is this. Is it possible to have firms of the size where they can really reap the greatest advantages without their being so near a monopoly as to threaten the interests of the consumer? That can happen if the total market with which one is dealing is the market only of this country, or of this country and E.F.T.A. It is far less likely to happen when the whole market with which we are dealing is to the 300 million people.<br/>
We should notice also that one effect of entry into the Community will be to give what our industry particularly needs at the present time: a special impetus towards the export field. This is undoubtedly, in coping with our present difficulties, one of the things for which we have particularly to look. We know in many instances the technical things that need to be done in industry to increase productivity. What we want is a sufficient motive and drive to get those things done particularly in the export and in the import-saving field. One of the things which entry into the Community can bring to us is this impetus towards exports.<br/>
These advantages, although they are very real, will not drop into anyone's lap. The right hon. and learned Member for Hertfordshire, East (Sir D. Walker-Smith) warned the Government against seeking easy money. I was much amused


by his speech. He spoke to us of the problems of the convert. As one who has known him for many years, even when he was a Liberal, I understood how he felt about converts. When the right hon. and learned Gentleman says that the Government must not look for easy money, we are all fully aware of that. The door to these advantages is opened if we go into the Community. They are not achieved without very considerable effort.<br/>
That effort will mean the application in industry of the whole range of industrial discoveries which we now find being made in private industry, in the National Economic Development Council. The right hon. Member for Barnet asked me what steps the Government would take to ensure that we could reap those advantages. If he studies the con-elusions of last autumn's National Productivity Conference, he will see the view of industry itself on the lines of policy that should be pursued in particular industries and firms. These have to be pursued with greater vigour.<br/>
We have also got greatly to increase the opportunities for training of skilled labour in this country; we have to encourage forms of payment of wages which give direct encouragement to productivity and the more efficient employment of labour; we have to press ahead with our regional policies to see that we do not leave in many parts of the country unemployed labour and resources.<br/>
The anxieties that have been expressed on economic matters have not only been about these immediate economic burdens. A number of my hon. Friends have expressed doubts about the position of the development areas, and I want to say something therefore about regional policy in this connection. I would say to my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot), who particularly raised this point, that it is perfectly true that, at the present time, if we deny an Industrial Development Certificate to someone who wants to go to the South-East or the Midlands, he will probably have to go to one of the development areas in this country, whereas, if one pictures us in the Community, he could, at least in theory, go somewhere on the Continent. It is no good denying that that is so.<br/>
But it would be a gross exaggeration to imagine that this could or would happen in the great majority of cases. If one looks at the kind of firms and the kind of enterprises for which applications are made, it is clear that, in the great majority of cases, their interests would not at all be served by a move of this kind and we must remember also that there are many other instruments of regional policy.<br/>
There is the Government's policy of dispersal of organisations under their own control; there are the differential rates of investment grants; there are the building of advance factories and the steady improvement of the transport and other infrastructure of the regions&#x2014;although I would say there that one of the things to which special attention will have to be given if we enter will be the improvement of communications between the development areas and the ports of the South and East coasts. That is one of the things to which the Government will have to give their attention.<br/>
But there would be nothing in the Treaty of Rome or in the practices of the Community to prevent us, for example, from going ahead with the policy of regional employment premiums which the country is now discussing. There was some question also&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. Every hon. Member has been listened to up to the moment. I hope that the conversations will cease.</p>

<p>There is also the question of how far policies involving planning and public ownership could be continued in the Community. If one looks not only at the wording of the Treaty of Rome but at the actual practice of the Community, both the individual countries in it and the planning activities of the Community collectively, it is clear that there is nothing that we do or want to do now that we should be inhibited from doing if we were in membership.<br/>
The question was asked, "Granted you can plan, that you can have such public ownership as you wish, what about the ends with which this is concerned?" There again, if one looks both at the wording of the Treaty and at the practice of the Community countries, we see that increasingly they are regarding the ends of economic policy as not only the


individual standard of life but social welfare and that they are doing this in some cases to an extent that leaves us behind. I do not believe therefore that the anxieties expressed on economic policy go anywhere near making the case against entry into the Community. But I share the views which have been expressed in many quarters that a very great part of this argument is an argument about future political development.<br/>
Some have asked, "What are our obligations towards E.F.T.A.?". I should make it clear to the right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition and to my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale that it is not right to say that we waived a pledge to E.F.T.A. The E.F.T.A. countries accept as fully as we do that the London Declaration is no longer appropriate to the position today. That was fully and equally understood between us. The nature of the obligation we now have is to keep them fully informed during the negotiations, to have regard&#x2014; although not to the wrecking of our own chances&#x2014;to their opinion while we are negotiating and, as is stated in the Communiqu&#x00E9;, to make sure that if one or more E.F.T.A. countries enter and others are still on their way in we do not take action, such as the immediate dismantling of tariffs, which would distort the pattern of trade among the E.F.T.A. countries. This is a reasonable and negotiable undertaking.<br/>
But some of the political anxieties go futher than this. There have been anxieties about the political structure of Europe. Are we letting ourselves into some kind of federal prison? We should notice that the political institutions of Europe have still to be worked out. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the Opposition gave us one piece of good advice. Speaking of last time he said that it was a mistake on our part to try to negotiate and settle matters for the future which had not already been settled in the E.E.C. That is good advice, and of wide application.<br/>
We ought not to approach&#x2014;and we need not approach&#x2014;these negotiations in the belief that we have to adopt a particular position, either about future political institutions in Europe, or defence, or monetary matters. I was a

little surprised at the right hon. Member forgetting his good advice by trying to plant on us a recipe for defence that, as far as one could understand it, seemed to be dangerous and ill-considered.<br/>
There were also anxieties about what part Europe will play in the world and what part the individual countries of Western Europe will play in the whole community of Europe itself. Every Member can have his own hopes or, perhaps, his own nightmares about this. Some axe concerned about the possibly undue predominance of one Power or another. But one thing common to all the imagined futures of Europe that people adopt if we do not make this attempt is that whatever happens it will be settled more and more without us and over our heads.<br/>
I understand the anxieties of my hon. Friend the Member for Penistone (Mr. Mendelson) about defence, but if the countries of Western Europe and the United States were to act in the manner that he feared they might&#x2014;I do not share that fear, but if he were right it would be something to be concerned about&#x2014;our absence from the European Economic Community would not make it less likely, if it is likely at all. There would be increasing danger that on one issue after another things would be settled without us and over our heads. In all the imaginary pictures of the future of Europe there would be one common feature, or lack of feature&#x2014;the absence of the United Kingdom.<br/>
Another reason that moves people politically is a sheer emotional reason&#x2014; and a quite legitimate one, at that. I say to my right hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell) that we all have something of an Ancient Briton in us, and if the time comes when his statue is placed side by side with that of Queen Boadicea in her chariot on Westminster Bridge there will be many who will be with him in spirit.<br/>
The mistake we make is to suppose that these strong and passionate feelings are peculiar to the British. We must accept this fact. May not a Frenchman feel pride in the great achievements of his country throughout the centuries? May not a Belgian feel pride in his country's emergence through centuries of slavery to its present independent and free institutions? Yet none of these has felt that


this was incompatible with membership of a Community designed to give a fuller and richer life to Europe as a whole.<br/>
Other political anxieties concern East-West trade and the part Europe can play towards the developing countries. Here again, my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale and the hon. Lady the Member for Watford were concerned&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I apologise to my hon. Friend.<br/>
One thing which hon. Members who are concerned over this point will notice is that it is not only this country which is concerned about the possibility of increasing trade with Eastern Europe. There is great and growing interest in all the countries of the Community; and here again there are no grounds for supposing that the separation of this country from the Community will help the process of trade between Eastern and Western Europe. That trade will proceed, as trade with the Commonwealth will proceed, and as the possibility of giving aid to the</p>

<p>underdeveloped countries will proceed, in proportion as Western Europe, including ourselves, moves forward towards higher productivity and to a higher standard of life.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-05-10a.1646.1" colnum="1646" time="">
<p>I mentioned the developing countries and the problem of aid. The Community has greater total wealth and greater resources for that than we have. But we have great knowledge and skill in the application of aid. In this sphere of aid, as in technology, what is needed is a marriage of our skill and knowledge with the increasing wealth that would be available in the development of the Community. All these things&#x2014;increasing East-West trade, the possibility of an increasing <i>rapprochement</i> with the East and more generous aid to the underdeveloped countries&#x2014;are among the things which can be achieved in a greater Europe.</p>

<p>Will Europe have the vision to do these things? I believe it can and I believe that that would be more sure if we were in than if we were out, for what does the very derivation of the word, the very name, Europe mean? It means "wide prospect, broad vision". That is Europe's name and may that be Europe's destiny.</p>

<p>After the drama, tension and excitement, not to say discomfort, of the past few minutes, it would be an understatement if I were to say that this Adjournment Motion was something of an anti-climax. It is, however, a welcome relief to get back to the mundane problems of Lancashire, and North-East Lancashire in particular, after a three-day debate of, we are told, such historic importance.<br/>
The subject which I now bring before the House has, however, particular relevance and flows naturally from some of the great events which we have been discussing over the past three days, because much of the debate on the Common Market centred on what Government policy towards the regions would be in the event of entry. I for one am delighted that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made it clear that the present trend of concentrating industrial development and economic growth in the regions, which previously had been neglected, will not, and need not, be overturned as a result of going into the Common Market.<br/>
The problems of East Lancashire are not unknown in this House. I do not want to make a speech full of statistics; the emotional appeals that had been associated with the particular economic problems that have hit Lancashire over the past few years are equally well known.<br/>
What are those problems? Any debates on Lancashire's problems must be seen against the background of the decline of its two basic industries, coal and, even more important, textiles. We have had a full debate on textiles, and I do not want to take the time of the House tonight by going into the details.</p>

<p>Cotton textiles; I am obliged to the hon. Member. But we cannot allow a basic industry to decline so rapidly and in such a concentrated


fashion without bringing in new industries to replace it, and that, in a nutshell, is the immediate need for Lancashire.<br/>
I am pleased to see that my right hon. Friend the Minister of Housing and Local Government is here. He represents the neighbouring constituency of Rossendale. It is not for me to speak on his behalf and he could certainly speak on this subject more eloquently than I. I am sure that if he had the freedom I have to express opinions, he would be expressing them as forcibly in this House as he does, I know, at the meetings concerning textiles and Lancashire which he attends regularly.<br/>
I am not surprised to see my right hon. Friend here for this debate because he was also here throughout the debate on textiles which took place at an unearthly hour of the morning. Ministers are easy to hit. They are easy targets. They are popularly conceived to be powerful figures but they are by convention frequently unable to hit back. I am happy to pay my tribute now to my right hon. Friend.<br/>
One of the other problems facing Lancashire is the lure of the surrounding development areas. I pay tribute to what the Government have done to try to bring employment into areas which have suffered over the years from consistently heavy unemployment, but development areas as at present designated should not benefit at the expense of areas such as North-East Lancashire, which are not economically sound themselves, and that is what is happening at the moment.<br/>
The nearness of Skelmersdale, for instance, and the threat of a new town in the Chorley area is viewed with severe forebodings in North-East Lancashire. What we fear is that the increased development grants and the inducements which will follow from the setting up or the proposed setting up of another new town will increase the disparity even more between the development areas and the old industrial areas, with their problems of urban renewal, slum clearance, derelict and obsolete factories and ugliness.<br/>
The increased grants that will induce the building of factories in the Chorley area will mitigate even more strongly against North-East Lancashire in the pre-

sent unbalanced situation and I should like my hon. Friend to give an assurance that he is well aware of the feeling in North-East Lancashire about the possibility of such a new town being built. Recently, we read that Courtaulds intend to build a new weaving factory, but we were horrified to find that it is not to be built in Lancashire but in Carlisle. That sums up the difficulties with which the area is faced.<br/>
Obviously, with the great financial inducements that development areas can offer&#x2014;and no one begrudges them the help they are given&#x2014;Lancashire feels very much that it is being written off at the moment. We view also with concern the suggestion of new employment premiums for the development areas. These would further increase the disparity between the old industrial areas and the new, attractive towns being built. One of the great needs of North-East Lancashire is for help in urban renewal. At the moment Lancashire is not benefiting from the handsome grant which is given to the development areas.<br/>
The problem of urban renewal in Lancashire is a very large one. We feel that the Government should give special, considerate and sympathetic help to the councils which are doing such a splendid job, from their own resources, to clear the eyesores that have plagued Lancashire for so long.<br/>
We need action now in Lancashire. The excuse that the Government have put up in the past few months&#x2014;I appreciate the sincerity and good intentions behind it&#x2014;is that it is necessary to solve the problems of the development areas first. But some of these areas have been development areas for 20 years, and they might go on being development areas. If we allow time to drag on the problem will become so difficult that the very regions that we are trying to help, and to which I am drawing attention, will have problems as difficult as those of the development areas. Then it will be too late to help them.<br/>
What I am asking for is well known to the Government. The Lancashire and Merseyside Industrial Development Association and the North-East Lancashire Industrial Development Association have made very plain what they feel to be the only answer to Lancashire's problems. First, the whole of East Lancashire


should be made a development area; secondly, it should have very generous Government help for slum clearance and urban renewal and, thirdly, there should be a campaign to attract new industry into Lancashire, to replace the declining textile and coal industries. There should also be less luring away of existing industry to the development areas surrounding the area.<br/>
I do not share the pessimism that prevails in Lancashire at the moment. I am sure that the Government mean well to Lancashire and will not let Lancashire down. I would like my hon. Friend to tell Lancashire plainly that he understands its problems and will do something about them, and that Lancashire has not been written off.</p>

<p>I have great sympathy with what the hon. Member has said, but he seems to give the impression&#x2014;when he says that East Lancashire should be made into a development area&#x2014;that it is necessary to bring in new industry to replace the dying cotton trade. I think that is not precisely the impression he intended to give. I should like to know whether he wants to see the cotton trade revitalised, so that it can be much bigger than it is now.</p>

<p>I have made my views on cotton known in this House. I spoke at some length in the debate on the cotton trade. Of course I want to see the industry revitalised, but I am equally concerned that new and modern industry should be attracted to Lancashire.</p>

<p>I am sure the House is grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) for raising this problem tonight. His concern is a genuine one. It is shared by a number of hon. Members who have constituencies in the North-East Lancashire area, and I feel that their concern is demonstrated by the fact that the Minister of Housing and Local Government, my right hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr.Greenwood), is sitting next to me.<br/>
I can tell my hon. Friend straight away that it is important to separate as far as possible the short-term from the long-term problem of the area of which he has been speaking. The short-term problem

can be traced to events in the economy since last July; the general effect on economic activity in the country of the measures taken then resulted in, to some extent, halting the flow of new work and new industry to North-East Lancashire as well as to other areas of the country. In addition, there is the particular problem of the textile industry, which has been caused by the tightening credit situation and by a certain amount of de-stocking. However, these are temporary factors. Nobody would dare to venture a strong opinion about the fortunes of the textile industry, because it is difficult to predict with accuracy about it. My view is that the coming year should see some evidence of recovery. Imports have been checked considerably in the past year and in the earlier months of this year and we expect to see an end to de-stocking. We also hope to see some increase in consumer demand, which will be of general benefit.</p>

<p>Would the hon. Gentleman recognise that this problem is not due solely to the rundown of the textile industry? It is a process which has been happening for a number of years, with young people being lost to the area, in which the average age of the working population is far too high. The trouble has been caused by a flow of working capacity away from the area.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-05-10a.1662.1" hansard_membership_id="3393" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20594" speakername="Mr. Shore" colnum="1662" time="">
<p>I began by distinguishing between the short-term and long-term problems so that I could come on, in the few minutes remaining to me, to the long-term basic problems of North-East Lancashire. It is important to consider these problems and not to over-concentrate on the short-term problems of the past year.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Accrington is aware, the basic problems about which we are talking have been with the North-East Lancashire area for a long time. Depopulation is an old problem. More than 600,000 people lived in the area in 1911. Today only about 475,000 live there. We are, therefore, not discussing a new problem, but one that has existed for many decades. It is inevitable that, with depopulation on this scale, the age structure of the area will be unbalanced, with a high proportion of people over 45.<br/>
Why has this movement of population taken place? Only by considering that question will a solution be found I suggest that this big "why" can be answered in this way. First, there is the long-term decline of the cotton textile industry. I need say no more about that. It has gone on throughout our lifetime and has greatly affected the North-East Lancashire area. Secondly, the area has a certain remoteness. Communications have not been good in the past and its roads system leaves much to be desired. This is an obstacle to industrialists when considering the area as a possible location for new plants. Thirdly, housing in the area is poor. A lack of modern development and building has resulted in many towns in the area not looking particularly attractive. Over 37 per cent. of the houses were shown by the 1961 census to lack bathrooms.<br/>
In addition, there is the general problem of the industrial inheritance of the nineteenth century and, above all, the smoke and smog that hangs over a great deal of the area. That is the background of the decline, and my hon. Friend was right to draw attention to the need for a double policy of bringing in new industry and, most important, generally improving the area's amenities and infrastructure.<br/>
I want to say just a word about Ley-land and Chorley. This should not necessarily be regarded as a threat. In a sense, it could be something that complemented and added to the prospect of the other towns in the area. A preliminary study has been made, and I believe that the consultants have now submitted their report to my right hon. Friend the Minister of Housing and Local Government, who will be considering it. Further, when the report is published it will be considered by the Regional Economic Planning Council and the local authorities in the area. I can assure my hon. Friend that the worries he has expressed will be examined objectively by the council and the other bodies in the area. I hope that he will not take an over-pessimistic view of the possible effects of development before the whole thing has been assessed.<br/>
I turn now to the two other main problems that concern my hon. Friend. The first is the policy towards new industry in the area. I can well understand

his feeling that the problem would be solved if these areas were put on a par with development areas generally. In fact, under our Industrial Development Act we have given much wider terms of reference to guide the President of the Board of Trade in determining what would be a development area.<br/>
It would be very difficult to argue the case, particularly at present, that North-East Lancashire comes within the scope of the Act. We are dealing here with levels of unemployment which, although they have been high, regrettably, during the winter, if taken over a period of years, have been extremely low. I have looked at the period from, say, March 1964 right through to September of last year, and I do not think that during the whole of that period unemployment has averaged over I per cent. It is not a long-term unemployment problem, but one of a rather different kind.<br/>
There are two possible ways of dealing with the problem. One is to try to find, as it were, a new method of helping areas of this kind which do not qualify for development area status&#x2014;what some people have referred to as "grey" areas. I cannot say tonight what our thinking is on the subject, but I assure my hon. Friend that we shall be giving the subject very careful and close study. There are problems. First, we do not want to dilute the aid given to the development areas&#x2014;they have great problems which we must help them to solve. Secondly, we have the problem of establishing, as it were, criteria to define what a grey area is. Thirdly, we have to decide which of the available policy instruments would be most appropriate to use.<br/>
In the meantime, I can assure my hon. Friend that the I.D.C. policy in the North-East Lancashire area is now being, and will continue to be, exercised most liberally in favour of firms in that area. Further, there is the assurance of the President of the Board of Trade that he will assist the development of new industries wherever there are major releases of labour to be faced from the cotton textile industry. It is not just a matter of a liberal I.D.C. policy for firms that are already there, but where my right hon. Friend sees a danger of any substantial release of labour from the


cotton textile industry he will apply a liberal policy.<br/>
I turn now to the problem of environment and communications. This is extremely important. Some developments are taking place which will be beneficial to the North-East Lancashire area.<br/>
I refer to the road developments, such as the link with the M6 which will come about with the improvement of A59 which will also go east into Yorkshire. In addition, there is the improvement of the A56 which links the area direct with Manchester. Thirdly, there is the link with the M61 which goes south of Burnley. These are very important developments which will be of great benefit to the area. They must be pressed ahead with as quickly as the road programme will allow.<br/>
I agree that housing and urban renewal are extremely important and on these local authorities have been extremely active. I do not wish to select unduly, but Burnley has been very enterprising and under the town development scheme it has agreed to build 5,000 houses over the next 10 years. This is contrary to the trend of depopulation in the area and will be welcomed by all in North-East Lancashire.<br/>
In addition, there is the general improvement of environment which will come about by extending smoke control orders. Local authorities vary a great deal in the vigour with which they carry out this legislation, but Burnley has declared about 50 per cent. of its area under the scheme. It has been estimated that we can get 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. more sunshine in North-East Lancashire by vigorously dealing with the problem of smoke pollution.<br/>
My hon. Friend may perhaps find reassurance in the fact that we now have the advantage of areas of this kind being within the scope of survey by regional economic planning councils. It was only in 1965 that we had the first report on the north-west area. For the first time we had a report which not only looked at the whole area but which began to analyse the sub-regions in a systematic way and to consider their problems. The council is now pursuing a variety of

studies which are relevant to the future of North-East Lancashire.<br/>
This has been a valuable debate. I assure my hon. Friend that there is a built-in awareness by the Government of the problems of North-East Lancashire. Its problems are familiar to many Ministers and they are being looked at by the Regional Economic Planning Council. When proposals begin to come forward from the Council, my Department will give them most serious consideration and we will do all in our power to help the sub-region.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has not dealt with the most important sector of this problem. the total imbalance which will be caused if development areas are given subsidised wages. This is the biggest threat to East Lancashire and the Minister has totally failed to deal with this issue. He has totally under-rated the fear of East Lancashire that it will not get a fair crack of the whip and the fear that the development areas will take the cream of industrial development. It is a pity that the Minister did not take this opportunity to tell East Lancashire in much clearer terms what the Government's intention is with regard to these areas.<br/>
With the running down of the coal mines and of the textile industry, the people there are in grave doubt as to what their future will be. The hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Arthur Davidson) will be disappointed with the Minister's reply. We in East Lancashire looked forward to the debate with hope. We believed that we might get some indication from the Government of what the future of East Lancashire would be. We have had no answer. We have had some woolly words about smoke clearance. Smoke clearance is not much good to people who are out of work. It is not much good to an area whose young people are leaving. It is no good to an area whose two great traditional industries of mining and textiles are in decline. The Minister says that smoke clearance is the answer. Smoke clearance will not be enough for East Lancashire.<br/>
As a result of the debate, my constituents and those of the hon. Member for Accrington, and the people of Burnley, Nelson and Colne, and Blackburn, will be extremely disappointed&#x2014;</p>
