<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-19a.1290.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="1290"  time="012:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061219/debtext/61219-0005.htm#06121938000935">
	<p pid="a.1290.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I respect those who took a different view at the time of the war; they did so for a variety of reasons. As he knows, I was against the war and explained why in the debate that took place on, I think, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-18">18 March</phrase>. Having recently looked at that speech, I see no reason to resile from any of the comments or opinions that I expressed. I accept that others have taken a contrary view. That does not absolve any Member of this House from their responsibility properly to scrutinise Government policy in this area, nor does it absolve the Government from being fully accountable to the House on the most important foreign and defence policy issue in recent memory. The unwillingness of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary to come before the House to answer for that policy should be deplored.</p>
	<p pid="a.1290.1/2">Without wishing to reopen the sores of that debate or our current difficulties in looking back at some of the matters that were put before the House, I cannot allow one issue to go without comment. As we know, the weapons of mass destruction on which so much of the Government's initial case was based were not found. I said in my speech that I did not doubt the Prime Minister's sincerity in saying that he believed that they were there. However, that sincerity has been brought into doubt by the evidence of Carne Ross, former First Secretary at the United Nations, who said in his evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.1290.1/3" class="indent">&quot;During my posting, at no time did&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1290.1/4">the Government&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1290.1/5" class="indent">&quot;assess that Iraq's WMD (or any other capability) posed a threat to the UK or its interests. On the contrary, it was the commonly-held view among officials that any threat had been effectively contained.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1290.1/6">That was not the complexion of the evidence laid before the House by the Prime Minister or by other Ministers at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1290.1/7">We have also heard from Professor Bulmer-Thomas at Chatham House. Again, it may be a retrospective view, but it is nevertheless an important contribution. He talks of the &quot;disaster&quot; in Iraq and the damage to the United Kingdom's international influence. I cannot indulge myself by taking too much of the House's time, but I have to say that the United Kingdom's authority in foreign affairs has been enormously damaged by Iraq. We are seeing the evidence of that not only in the Prime Minister's lack of influence with the President on Capitol Hill, which has been the subject of blunt assessments, but in the region itself, where the Prime Minister is making belated but well intentioned attempts to secure some sort of coalition around further progress on middle east talks. The fact is, however, that his association with the war in Iraq means that he is unable to play the pivotal role that we would want for this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-19a.1295.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1876" speakername="Angela Browning" colnum="1295"  time="013:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061219/debtext/61219-0006.htm#06121938000941">
	<p pid="a.1295.0/1">I wish you, Mr. Speaker, and all members of staff of the House a very happy Christmas. I thought that I would put the festive greetings in at the beginning because last time I had a bit of a rant, and when I said &quot;Happy Christmas&quot; at the end, everybody burst out laughing. I am not sure why.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/2">I want to raise one thing. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-08">8 November</phrase> <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> carried a story as a result of information that the Conservatives had obtained under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 about proposed closures in small hospitals around the country. When I read the article I was surprised, because it listed the Mid Devon primary care trust in my constituency as one of the PCTs that was likely to suffer closures, in our hospital at Tiverton.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/3"><i> The Daily Telegraph</i> said that the Secretary of State had drawn up maps with something that she called &quot;hot spots&quot; to ensure that closures did not occur in marginal Labour seats. There is no way my seat is a marginal Labour seat, I am pleased to say, but I kept the cutting. Although I was unaware of any proposed closures, lo and behold, in the past three weeks they have been announced, not only at the Tiverton hospital in what was the old Mid Devon PCT, but at the Honiton hospital, which serves a large catchment area of the east Devon part of my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/4">It was obvious some time ago that the Government anticipated the closures, and the form that they have taken means that the minor injuries units at both hospitals are closed to the public between 11 pm and8 am. In addition, beds have been closed, albeit on a temporary basis until the end of next March.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/5">Small hospitals, serving sparsely populated rural communities, which is what I have in my Tiverton and Honiton seat, rely very much on local services. In particular, I want to consider the implications of the closure of minor injuries units. It is important to flag up why that has happened. As a result of Government policy, what were six primary care trusts have been brought together as a pan-Devon primary care trust. Collectively, by the end of the current financial year they must claw back some &pound;7.6 million. As we all know, according to the bizarre formula that the Government apply to the NHS, if PCTs overspend they must recoup not just the amount overspent but twice that amount, thus making cuts even deeper than they would otherwise have been.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/6">The two hospitals also serve local general practices, in that GPs often make referrals to them. If my constituents could not have access to the minor injuries units at night, they would be forced to go to the casualty department in Exeter, quite some distance away. Obviously, in some cases they would depend on an ambulance service. Devon PCT tells me that the minor injuries units are little used at night, but a father from Tiverton wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/7" class="indent">&quot;as a worried parent whose 3 year old son has benefited from the immediate treatment he has received&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/8">from the local minor injuries unit&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/9" class="indent">&quot;three times for serious attacks of croup, all occurring overnight ... the worst attack ... was treated by a doctor within15 minutes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/10">What worried that father was that if the unit closed&mdash;as it now has&mdash;the delay involved in taking the child to the larger casualty unit a long way away could have a devastating effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/11">Even if we accept that minor injuries units have less throughput at night than during the daylight hours, we must ask what the consequences of closure will be for the patients who present there. It worries me that although the closures were flagged up in <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-08">8 November</phrase>, there has been no proper consultation. There are no contingency plans to deal with the possible knock-on effects on the general hospital, on the ambulance service or on referrals through NHS Direct. It looks as if the decision was made in order to tick some boxes and save some money.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/12">I have some sympathy for those who must administer the health service and balance the books accordingto the formula that they are required to employ. However, the people of whom no account seems to have been taken are patients&mdash;and, for that matter, professionals. One might have expected the doctors who service the hospital at least to have been consulted, but that has not happened. I was told by a GP in my constituency this morning that a meeting had been called for tonight, long after the closure of the units.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/13">Apparently, a bizarre process will now operate when people turn up at Honiton hospital after 11 pm thinking that they can receive treatment at the minor injuries unit, as may happen. A nurse&mdash;and there is sometimes only one trained nurse&mdash;will have to come to the casualty department from one of the wards, fill in a form stating that he or she has received the patient, and then redirect the patient elsewhere with the form. Nurses on night duty, particularly those on medical wards, are kept pretty busy. The proposal to divert them to perform an administrative function and, if a patient has a serious problem, to cope with that as well, shows a lack of forethought and also a lack of knowledge of what goes on in a hospital, especially at night.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/14">Seven beds have been closed at Honiton hospital. Beds in small hospitals, particularly during the winter months, are an important facility for elderly people with respiratory problems. Respiratory problems can develop quickly and turn into something serious very quickly, so getting those people into hospital beds is very important. However, no thought seems to have been given to the fact that we are approaching the months of the year in which demand due to flu, or just among the elderly, is likely to increase rather than decreasing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/15">When I spoke to someone at the hospital this morning, I was told that yesterday it had discharged two patients, and both beds were filled within half an hour. It is not that there are empty beds sitting about, or that there is a lack of demand even now. The fact is that none of these matters seem to have been discussed or considered from the point of view of patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/16">The closure of hospital beds usually means a reduction in staff, especially nursing staff. I am told by the nurses' union representative that there has been no consultation with professional staff about the impact on nurses. I always understood that employers had a statutory obligation to consult union representatives, and to take account of the views of professional staff. On so many counts, the way in which information has come into the public domain suggests that these decisions were made with only one purpose: to reduce the budget by cutting services&mdash;we are told&mdash;at the end of the financial year, which means the end of March. Meanwhile, none of the procedures that might have been expected to take place have taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/17">Let us consider what has happened to the health service in recent years. I picked up, literally at random, a couple of the documents that have arrived on my desk, most of them from the Government. In 2002 we all received copies of &quot;Delivering the NHS Plan&quot;. Paragraph 5.9 states</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/18" class="indent">&quot;For some services, for example emergency care, however, choice will have a more limited role to play. Here most patients will only want fast access to their nearest local hospital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/19">I do not think any of us would disagree with that, but if it is part of the national health service plan, what has happened to that plan?</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/20">I know from raising matters with Ministers that they often pray in aid the idea that &quot;It's the trusts out there that must make the day-to-day decisions. Nothing to do with us, guv; we provide the money, they decide what to spend it on.&quot; That is all well and good, but we know that the trusts are not free to make the decisions that they want to make at local level. They must constantly work within a framework in which finances are controlled from the centre, and all the boxes that must be ticked if financial penalties are to be avoided are imposed from the centre. There is no real freedom of choice for trusts, or for the professionals managing local services in our NHS hospitals around the country. Everything is predicated on the priorities of the centre, despite the fine words in the documents that we find on our desks every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1295.0/21">When the Government decided to abolish those primary care trusts and group them together, South West Peninsula strategic health authority invited consultation, which ended in March this year. The consultation document talks of &quot;working closely with partners&quot; and others to ensure integrated services, and providing &quot;appropriate clinical leadership.&quot; When I asked the chief executive of Devon primary care trust what clinical advice he had received or taken in deciding to make changes and cuts, I was assured that there were clinicians on the PCT's board. The clinicians who were out in the field delivering the service were clearly not part of the consultation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-19a.1302.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" colnum="1302"  time="013:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061219/debtext/61219-0007.htm#06121938000948">
	<p pid="a.1302.0/1">It is always a great pleasure to listen to and follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" name="Ann Cryer">the hon. Member for Keighley (Mrs. Cryer)</phrase>, whom many Opposition Members find always speaks a great deal of sense. I particularly agree with her concluding remarks about the search for what binds and unites us as a country. As someone whose own brother is a teacher of English as a foreign language, I can say that English is of course a fundamental component in that regard. What the hon. Lady said was tremendously welcome; it needs to be said more often and I commend her for saying it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/2">I want to raise&mdash;briefly, as a number of Members want to get in&mdash;four issues brought to me by my constituents and two of wider interest. First, I want to put on the record my support for Bedfordshire primary care trust's revised bid for a community hospital in Leighton Buzzard, in my constituency. Various Members have expressed concern today about the scaling back of health services such as community hospitals in the areas that they represent. Leighton Buzzard is one of the largest towns in the whole country without any form of hospital facility&mdash;if not the largest&mdash;so I am very pleased that Bedfordshire PCT is putting forward a bid for a community hospital there. I was with the PCT on<phrase class="date" code="2006-12-01">1 December</phrase>&mdash;the day on which it had a meeting with the East of England strategic health authority. The bid will have to be finalised by next summer, and if the community hospital is deemed needed and affordable, it could be built within some 18 months, particularly if NHS capital is used, so we could have it by 2009. The proposal is for a new main facility in the town, but also for more and better services on existing health sites in the town. We can expect facilities such as diabetes treatment, wound care, consultant out-patient clinics, extended primary care, social care and various diagnostic facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/3">My constituents have waited a very long time for some form of community hospital in Leighton Buzzard, and we are naturally cautious&mdash;seeing will be believing. When we see bricks going on other bricks, we will know that we have reason to celebrate. I am heartened by my last meeting with the primary care trust and wish to put on record my full support for bringing the project to fruition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/4">My next point is about transport and especially the journeys faced by constituents who live in Leighton Buzzard and the wider commuter hinterland around it. The capacity of the railways was much touched on in Transport questions earlier. Leighton Buzzard is growing fast and is scheduled to grow much faster still, but it has nothing like enough jobs to support its working population. Indeed, that is a feature of the whole of my constituency and at least 55 per cent. of my constituents commute out of the area to work. I was therefore very concerned recently to receive a letter from Silverlink, the train operator, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-22">22 November</phrase>, in which it said that it was not possible to put on any more fast trains from Leighton Buzzard into London and that the existing fast trains cannot be made any longer. The commuter services are already very full and if we see the increase in Leighton Buzzard's population that is anticipated under the Government's sustainable communities plan, I wonder how people in the town will be able to get to work and back again. I do notsee joined-up thinking between the Department for Transport and the Department for Communities and Local Government and I wish to put my concern about that matter firmly on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/5">I also have reason to believe&mdash;it has been said to me by several senior local authority figures in Bedfordshire&mdash;that since the announcement about the Olympics those of us in other areas of the country have sensed a movement of money towards ensuring that we can put the games on successfully in 2012. I wonder whether large parts of the Government's sustainable communities plan are not fully feasible because of how much money will have to be spent on building the Olympic facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/6">The third issue that I wish to raise is the exclusion of children from lessons, which can be quite an emotional subject. I have mentioned before&mdash;not least recently in the excellent Adjournment debate instigated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> in Westminster Hall on children with speech and language difficulties&mdash;my concerns about children who are physically restrained by teachers or learning support staff in schools without their parents being made aware that it is happening. Parents have a fundamental right to know what is happening to their children in schools, certainly as far as physical restraint is concerned. I see parents as part of the solution, not part of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/7">In my surgery last week, I had a mother and father who told me about the experiences of their young child, who was being regularly excluded from a substantial part, or the whole, of periods in the school day. The parents were not being told that that was happening. I look at such issues instinctively. I do not reach for a party handbook and see what the line to take is, but instead react as a human being and father. I think about how I would feel if that happened to my own children. Frankly, if a child is excluded from a whole or substantial part of a lesson, the parents should be told that that has happened at the end of the school day. I am not saying that the parents should be told immediately, but they should be told by the end of the day, because&mdash;I repeat&mdash;parents are part of the solution. Education is not a linear relationship between the school and the children, but a triangular relationship in which the parents are fundamental.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/8">I was surprised to find that such exclusions were happening. I know that the situation varies in different schools and local education authorities, but I am concerned about it and wish to place my views on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/9">The next issue I wish to raise is training, especially for those no longer in the first flush of youth. A constituent came to see me recently who is 44, as I am, and is on incapacity benefit. He wanted to train as a plasterer&mdash;an excellent idea, as we have a shortage of plasterers in the area. However, the plastering course that he was considering lasted three years. For young people who live with their parents and so do not have expensive accommodation costs it may be fine to go on a training course for three or four years. However, for people in their 30s or 40s, perhaps with a family, a training course of that length is impossible to complete. I suggest that such courses should be held, to the same standard and as rigorously, on a much more intensive basis. Students would work for longer during the day and perhaps over weekends so that the courses could be completed in six months or so. More people on low incomes or benefits would then be able to complete a course and gain a skill with which to earn their living. The plastering course was three years, as was the plumbing course. A qualification in health and safety took four years, and the electrician course took three years with one year of on the job training. We need to consider the duration of such courses and I have raised the issue with Ministers in the Department for Education and Skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/10">Like every other hon. Member I have been shocked and appalled by the events in Ipswich in the past few days. I read the biographies of the five women who were so brutally and horrifically murdered and I cannot have been the only one to be struck by the fact that they were all heroin addicts. It is a problem that affects all our constituencies&mdash;there will not be a single Member of Parliament who does not have a heroin problem in their constituency. Given that we know that 90 per cent. of the heroin on UK streets comes from Afghanistan and that we have a major military presence there, it is extraordinary that we cannot do more to stop the poppy crop ending up here. I know that right hon. and hon. Members have raised that issue with Ministers. I recall that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase>, to name but two, have done so. Not so long ago under the common agricultural policy we were able to buy up crops in the European Union, although the regime has since changed. The Minister looks at me quizzically, but my question is: why, given that heroin can have legitimate medical uses, cannot we buy up the Afghan heroin crop and use it around the world for pain relief? That would stop it flooding into this country illegally. We need more serious thought about that issue. The UK was charged with overall responsibility for the opium issue in Afghanistan and it is a subject that has been raised with Ministers by my Front-Bench colleagues recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/11">Finally, I wish everyone a happy Christmas, as is traditional for hon. Members speaking in this debate. We have had a healthy debate about the very words &quot;Happy Christmas&quot; this year, with a satisfactory outcome. I am pleased by the work of the Christian Muslim Forum, which involves Muslims and Christians working together. Many Muslims have said that they are not offended by the celebration of Christmas in this country or by people wishing them a happy Christmas, just as I as a Christian am not remotely offended if someone wishes me a happy Diwali or happy Eid. A few days ago, I saw an e-mail from the Hindu Council of Britain saying that this country's Hindu community was absolutely happy with the celebration of Christmas in this Christian country. I was also especially struck and impressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1542" name="Shahid Malik">the card from the hon. Member for Dewsbury (Mr. Malik)</phrase>. He is a Muslim, but his card to me and the other hon. Members on his extensive Christmas list very clearly wishes us a merry Christmas. That is an excellent example, and one worth raising in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/12">I have been keeping a little list of the people who have sent me cards with the message &quot;Season's Greetings&quot;. There are far too many such cards from people in Bedfordshire who should know better. I agree with the hon. Member for Dewsbury, who made it clear that, as Muslim, he was wishing us a happy Christmas. In that spirit, Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish you, the staff of the House and other hon. Members a very happy Christmas.</p>

	<p pid="a.1311.0/1">I wish every hon. Member, all the staff and all those who provide us with our security and food in the House a very happy Christmas and restful new year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/2">I also felt that my constituents would have a happy Christmas&mdash;I attended a celebration last Thursday evening of a Eid, Hanukka, Diwali and Christmas joint event in the integrationist-minded Muslim community centre at Eton road in my constituency&mdash;but on Friday morning, I attended a meeting, also in my constituency, with the local health bosses of the four primary care trusts, two acute hospital trusts and mental health trusts and representatives of the London region of the NHS to discuss a programme called &quot;fit for the future&quot;. That was referred to in passing during last night's Adjournment debate on the fantastic new Queen's hospital in Romford, which is a great tribute to the record investment, which has increased from 7 to 9 per cent. of gross domestic product under this Labour Government. But plans are now afoot that will make health and hospital provision in my constituency seriously worse for many of the poorest people if the plans that are envisaged for the &quot;fit for the future&quot; team are not stopped.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/3">I want to spend some time dealing with that issue because I am very conscious that people all over the country raise their concerns about changes in the health service, but I am doing so in a context where we do not have static population in east London and we do not have changes in technology that can be used alone to justify changes in provision. A massive increase in population could take place just when significant reductions in hospital provision are planned in my constituency and across Ilford.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/4">The four PCTs in outer north-east London&mdash;Barking and Dagenham, Havering, Redbridge and Waltham Forest, each of which is borough-based&mdash;plus the Barking, Havering and Redbridge acute hospital trust, which has two hospitals, the new Queen's hospital in Romford, which has taken over the work of the old Oldchurch and Harold Wood hospitals, which have been closed, and the King George hospital in Ilford, which was a new hospital, built and opened in 1993 in my constituency to replace an old 1920s facility, plus the Whips Cross university hospital, which is based in Leytonstone and is principally a collection of 1920s and '30s buildings, and the North East London mental health trust, which covers the whole of those east London boroughs, are discussing in detail those proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/5">Those involved have come up with five options. Given what I was told on Friday, it is clear that they favour what they call option 4, under which the accident and emergency department at King George hospital, Ilford, and the children's accident and emergency department will be closed and all elective work in the hospital will be ended. Although a new independent sector treatment centre is just about to open, it has a five-year contract for a minimum number of operations. It will be there for five years, but not necessarily for much longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/6">Over recent months, we have had a series of what the local NHS bosses call stakeholder workshops, run by a firm of management consultants called Finnamore. They have taken the circumstances of a few dozen local people supposedly to model various options with various weightings, which are then supposed to give an objective outcome of choice. They have had problems with their process. They were supposed to make the proposals public by the end of the year. They now intend to put them to the boards of the four PCTs in January. If they are approved, they will then go to the London NHS in February. A public consultation exercise to rubber-stamp the process will then be run for three months, presumably from March until the end of June or July.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/7">But in my opinion, on the information that I have, that whole exercise is rigged, flawed and unacceptable. Why do I say that it is rigged? I do so because London NHS is not asking every area in London to undertake similar exercises; only our areas in London are doing so, and none of the neighbouring boroughs, Newham and Hackney, nor the areas of Essex&mdash;where, for example, Harlow hospital is located&mdash;is undertaking a similar exercise. The exercise is constructed simply to look at patient flows and the local health economy of outer north-east London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/8">What is very interesting is that those involved have come up with proposals that are designed to reduce the services in some hospitals in my area, while no consideration is given to the neighbouring boroughs. We have discovered that there is, in effect, a preconceived agenda: as the new hospital is built up and established at Romford, it is a fixed point, and they are trying to create a situation where either the Whipps Cross hospital in Leytonstone or the King George hospital in Ilford is significantly downgraded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/9">The whole basis of the process is designed, of course, to create rivalry between neighbouring Members of Parliament and neighbouring communities. In those circumstances, it is very difficult to take an objective look at the overall situation. Those involved are failing to take account of the facts. I got these figures from the Library last week, and the facts are that the population of my borough, Redbridge, based on natural factors&mdash;fertility, demographics and the movement of people in, not additional house building&mdash;will increase over the next 25 years, from 2004 to 2029, by a total of 46,300. Havering's population will go up by 14,700, and Barking and Dagenham's by 12,000. Yet there is no provision for any new hospital facilities; on the contrary, there is a reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/10">At the same time, let us take account of the proposed house building. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">My hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> referred to the Thames Gateway. At present, 1.5 million people live in the whole of that area, from east London to the south of Essex and north Kent on the other side of the Thames. Over the next 10 years, until 2016, something like 128,500 new homes are going to be built in that area. In just 10 years, the population is going to increase by15 per cent. That will mean 275,000 additional people in the Thames Gateway area. A large proportion of that increase is in the Thames Gateway area of the east London boroughs and alongside the Essex part of the River Thames.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/11">In 2004, before the North East London strategic health authority was abolished and merged into the new London NHS, it said that, in the 10 years, there would be increases in population of 100,000 or 51 per cent. in Tower Hamlets; 99,000 or 40 per cent. in Newham; 7,000 or 3 per cent. in Havering; 17,000 or 8 per cent. in Waltham Forest&mdash;although that is outside the Thames Gateway area&mdash;and 21,000 or 9 per cent. in Redbridge. Most significantly, it said that in Barking and Dagenham, which is where people go from to King George hospital in Ilford, there will be 44,000 additional people&mdash;a27 per cent. increase in the population&mdash;in the next10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/12">There are no plans to build any new hospitals in the Thames Gateway whatsoever. From the Newham general hospital and the Royal London hospital right the way through to Basildon there are no new hospitals. Yes, there is the fantastic new state-of-the-art Queen's hospital in Romford. However, it is proposed to take out of the equation several hundred beds from either the King George hospital in Ilford, or the Whipps Cross university hospital in Leytonstone. The way that decision is pointing is that the beds will be taken out of the hospital in Ilford, in my constituency. That is being done because it is argued that there are financial deficits, which is true. The Barking, Havering and Redbridge Hospitals NHS Trust has a 4.8 per cent. deficit of &pound;16 million on a turnover of more than&pound;334 million. The neighbouring Whipps Cross university hospital has a deficit of &pound;15.8 million on a turnover of &pound;182 million, which is 8.7 per cent.&mdash;one of the largest in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/13">I am concerned, however, that if facilities in my constituency are closed, there is no guarantee that there will be improved primary care facilities that will be proportionate to the closures that will be announced. The ongoing deficit at Whipps Cross will have to be financed. In answer to questions at the meeting on Friday, it was admitted that that deficit would take at least five years to eliminate. The Waltham Forest primary care trust has a deficit of &pound;1.884 million to cover as well. We are facing a situation in which there is disinvestment in some services in Waltham Forest and disinvestment by Waltham Forest council in some of its social services spending. We in Ilford will presumably make a contribution in the form of the savings that the primary care trust will make overall by reducing services in Ilford.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/14">I am conscious of time. I do not wish to go on too long, but I want to make an even more serious point. There is something bizarre about the process. On<phrase class="date" code="2006-12-11">11 December</phrase>, the chief executive of the NHS London region, Ruth Carnell, sent a letter to all London Members of Parliament in which she said that the NHS London region is commissioning a major document from Professor Sir Ara Dazi setting out a framework for</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/15" class="indent">&quot;radical thinking about how to deliver services&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/16">across London. That is to be published in spring 2007 and a final health strategy for London will be published in the summer. That seems bizarre and absurd: one starts the process to carry out cuts in services in one part of London and then one decides the strategy for the whole of London. It is bonkers. That is the wrong way round. I cannot understand why the NHS does not say, &quot;In view of the decision to set up this work by Professor Ara Dazi, we need to look at London as a whole and then look at the sub-parts of London&mdash;the particular boroughs, outer London north-east, south-east London and west London,&quot; rather than doing things this crazy way round. There is something seriously wrong with the way in which the matter is being approached.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/17">The other thing that worries me is that the local &quot;fit for the future&quot; team seem to have given only cursory consideration to the impact of the changes that they are making on the neighbouring areas. I have already referred to Newham and Hackney, but there is also the possibility of movement of some patients to other hospitals in London, such as the North Middlesex university hospital. We were told at the meeting on Friday, which was attended by five Members of Parliament, that those involved had written in October to ask for information from those neighbouring hospitals, but the people had not got any detailed information to give us. It does not seem that there is any sense of co-ordination, particularly given the massive increases in population that are going to take place in Newham and Tower Hamlets as a result of development in the Thames Gateway.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/18">Those involved have also done an odd exercise with regard to consideration of travelling to hospitals. I asked, &quot;Have you done detailed studies of how a woman with four young children and a pram, who does not have access to a car, will get to the hospital in Romford or Whipps Cross university hospital from the south of Ilford or even from Barking and Dagenham?&quot; I was told, &quot;Well, we've done some simulation exercises of journey times.&quot; However, the information is not public and I suspect that, as with everything else in this case, there is a preconceived outcome and a rigged process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/19">I asked the Library of the Commons for some data on travel times and the number of households that do not have access to a car. Interestingly, the wards in my constituency furthest from the hospitals are the ones with a higher number of people who do not have cars. It is odd, because the document produced by the &quot;fit for the future&quot; team says that &quot;fit for the future&quot; is supposed to be &quot;addressing local health inequalities&quot;. Yes, it is true: it does address local health inequalities&mdash;it addresses them and makes them worse. Some 38 per cent. of households in Loxford in my constituency do not have access to a car. In Valentines the figure is also 38 per cent. and in Clementswood it is 35 per cent. The figures are slightly higher in the wards in the neighbouring borough of Barking and Dagenham. However, in leafy Monkhams, in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the constituency of the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase>, which is up near Whipps Cross university hospital, only 16 per cent. of households do not have access to a car.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/20">If services at King George hospital are run down and decimated to make it available for ambulatory care&mdash;as it is called&mdash;only, people may well have to amble there, travelling several miles, and then find that they have a more serious ailment and be rushed by ambulance to another hospital several miles away. It is a ridiculous situation. We need to stop the process. Either the London NHS should stop the whole process now or the boards of the primary care trusts&mdash;particularly Redbridge&mdash;should vote down the proposals so that they cannot go through and are referred back. Alternatively, if we go through this exercise, I hope that tens of thousands of local people throughout Redbridge, Barking, Dagenham and elsewhere will come out and say loudly, &quot;No, we do not want King George hospital to be closed.&quot; If that does not work, Redbridge council's scrutiny committee should refer the matter to the Secretary of State so that we can deal with this nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="a.1311.0/21">I believe passionately that the Government have done a lot of good things to improve investment in the NHS, but we have a set of self-serving, bureaucratic, accountant-minded managers who are coming up with proposals that are not in the interests of the poorest people in the poorest communities, including those in my constituency. These mad proposals have to be stopped.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-19a.1339.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="1339"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061219/debtext/61219-0013.htm#06121938000971">
	<p pid="a.1339.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1521" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">The hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> highlighted in her speech one of the roles that perhaps we overlook sometimes. The Army plays a role not just in high profile areas such as Afghanistan and Iraq, but in many other parts of the world, bringing peace and stability to those areas. Unlike <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase>, I do not have a cunning plan. He seemed to have adopted the role of a parliamentary Baldrick. I listened to what he said about having been joined to Norfolk and wishing that his area had been part of London instead. I do not know whether that would be a cunning plan: he would be under the domain of Commissar Livingstone, w<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">hereas he could stay with my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339.0/2">I want to raise a couple of issues. As a party, we support the calls that many Members have made for a debate during this Session or the next Session about the situation in Iraq. At a time when there are complaints about the lack of equipment and when it appears that the Government are looking for new supporters in Iraq&mdash;including two of the countries that appearto have been supporting the insurgency&mdash;and are prepared to give evidence to the Baker committee in America, but not to bring those issues before the House, thus diminishing the role of Parliament, it is important that there is a debate. That does not mean that we are undermining those who have gone out to do a difficult job. If anything, it would show the people who are doing a difficult job that those of us who represent the constituencies in which they live across the United Kingdom are concerned about the conduct of the war, the equipment that is available and the direction in which the Government are going.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339.0/3">People in Northern Ireland feel that parliamentary vacuum even more, because much of our business is carried out in this House in a way that does not offer a proper opportunity to scrutinise Government. So sloppy have the Government now become in Northern Ireland affairs that over the past month the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has been in court three times&mdash;or he will have been by the end of this week. In fact, somebody back home remarked that the Secretary of State is in court more often than Tim Henman. He has been in court over lack of consultation, the way in which the Government have handled legislation and the way in which major decisions have been made. Whether in relation to the sexual orientation legislation, water charges or public appointments, we find that some of the Secretary of State's decisions&mdash;and the way in which business is being handled&mdash;are, increasingly, subject to judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339.0/4">Although we are working towards devolving to Northern Ireland many of the issues that are currently dealt with here, nevertheless there is a requirement that, if devolution does not come about, Northern Ireland business be dealt with in a much more democratic and accountable way in this House. However, that will not stop people in Northern Ireland working to try to resolve their difficulties and to get devolution. Given the attitude of Sinn Fein towards the policing issue, many of us despair of the deadlines and the requirements set by this House for devolution in Northern Ireland being met by <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase>. If they are not met, I do not believe that we can go on with the form of direct rule that we have had for so long. There must be ways of dealing with Northern Ireland business in a much more accountable way in this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339.0/5">I want to raise two or three issues, but I shall try to keep my contribution to 10 minutes because I know that many other hon. Members want to speak&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] I knew that that would get applause, because it was a populist thing to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339.0/6">The first issue concerns teacher training in Northern Ireland. Over the past few years, the number of people leaving teacher training colleges and finding a job has diminished rapidly from 82 per cent. in 2001 to 22 per cent. this year, if the teaching unions' figures are to be believed. The most recent Government figure we have relates to the year before&mdash;it was 62 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339.0/7">We are talking about people who have invested in their own education, paid their fees and put themselves through teacher training college. They have acquired the necessary skills, yet they find themselves coming out at the end without any prospect of employment. If they do not find employment in the first year, many of them find themselves barred from jobs in subsequent years, because they do not have the necessary experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339.0/8">That is taking place against the background of an increasing number of people taking early retirement in the teaching profession and then walking back into supply teaching or part-time teaching jobs, perhaps the very next term. Such jobs may not be on a full-time or permanent basis, but they could have been made available to trainee teachers to give them the opportunity, at least, to gain some experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339.0/9">The Department of Education in Northern Ireland knows about the situation, which has taken place against a background of fewer teachers being required because of falling rolls. The teacher training intake has been kept the same, but schools have been given no firm direction to give opportunities to young trainee teachers, rather than bringing back those who have taken early retirement. The relevant Minister needs to address the issue urgently, otherwise many people will become cynical about the opportunities available and the outcome for those who obtain a teacher training degree.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339.0/10">The second issue that I want to raise concerns health. Ministers here tell me almost every week that waiting lists have been falling in England and on the mainland, but in Northern Ireland they have remained stubbornly high. The length of time taken to get care in hospitals has not fallen there, despite huge sums being poured into the health service. While those who get through the process of seeing a consultant can quickly get into hospital, a back-loading has taken place, whereby, in order to ration places, operations and so on, the period taken to get to a consultant to find out what work is required has been lengthened. Rather than taking account of all the experience that a patient goes through, things appear to have been divided into little chunks, so that targets can be met in one place by delaying things in another. That problem must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339.0/11">The other big recent health issue in my constituency has been the decision to close Inver House, all that remains of a local hospital in Larne. The situation affects two wards where people could go for palliative care and where people who were recovering from operations could be looked after locally. All of that has been centralised, and the argument is that the care will take place in the community. However, no evidence has been provided that resources will be placed there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1339.0/12">There are many other issues that I could raise, but I promised that I would keep to 10 minutes. I will keep that promise because the DUP always keeps its promises. I will not, therefore, deal with those issues, other than to say&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1343.1/1">I refer to an Iranian movement which is concerned about the President of Iran and everything that goes on in that country. It seeks justice for the people in Iran. There was a hearing at the European Court of Justice on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-12">12 December</phrase>, which annulled the court's decision to include the organisation in its terror list and the decision to freeze the group's European assets, but still the British Government include the organisation on the proscribed list.

	<p pid="a.1343.1/2">My final point is about a chap called Raf Islam. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1652" name="Mike Gapes">The hon. Member for Ilford, South (Mike Gapes)</phrase> and I have been trying to get that gentleman freed from Chelmsford prison. He and his brother were brought from Bangladesh in 1993 aged 10 and 11. Their mother had already died. The father died and they were left with their stepmother. They came home from school one day and found that the stepmother had disappeared, taking with her their passports and visas. The older brother looked after his younger brother, who has never been in trouble with the police, but unfortunately the older brother has. He has served his time and should have been released on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-10">Friday 10 November</phrase>, but his Christmas present is to find that he faces deportation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1343.1/3">It is a scandal that this chap, who has been in care looking after his brother, is facing deportation. I say to the Minister, who may get a note from one of his officials when he winds up the debate, that the huge number of people to whom I and the hon. Member for Ilford, South have spoken are very nice and are all sympathetic, but the fact remains that Raf Islam is still in Chelmsford prison. My wife will visit him there on Christmas eve. What a wonderful Christmas present it would be if that visit was not necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1343.1/4">I am delighted that West Ham United beat Manchester United on Sunday, following in the footsteps of Southend. I hope Southend thrash Spurs on Wednesday. I wish you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and everyone else a very happy Christmas, peace, prosperity, good health and a wonderful new year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1353.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who is an expert in this area, for that intervention. I am talking about children with moderate learning difficulties, who are not exported outside the county. They are certainly not exported from Castle Point, where there is a wonderful MLD school called Cedar Hall. Its referrals have been cut in the past two years to a very small proportion, compared with two years ago. That has happened not because there are fewer SEN children, but because of the policy of Essex county council. A campaign on this issue received national publicity, and the Prime Minister addressed it in the run-up to the last election&mdash;as did Maria Hutchins, one of my campaigning constituents&mdash;as my hon. Friend will doubtless recall.</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/2">My third point regarding special children is that we must get more speech and language professionals into work. The problem here is the Government, not the county.</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/3">The current shortfall of professionals is intolerable.<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">My hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>, in his inimitable style, treated Westminster Hall to a speech on this issue on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November</phrase>. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/4" class="indent">&quot;At present, some 7,000 therapists are on the books. It is estimated that there is a shortfall of 2,283, which...will bemet only by 2013.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>,<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-28">28 November 2006</phrase>; Vol. 453, c. 4WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/5">The House will see that allowing a whole cohort of children to be betrayed in that way for the next five years or so is intolerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/6">So homelessness and special needs children are my main concerns as I canter towards Christmas, but I wish to make a couple of additional points. I need an answer on an important matter concerning the importation of liquefied natural gas&mdash;LNG&mdash;on to Canvey island. I have asked Ministers previously, but I have not had a straight answer yet. I ask the Minister on the Treasury Bench to urge the appropriate Minister in the Department of Trade and Industry to acknowledge that there is no Government safe siting policy for top tier LNG COMAH&mdash;control of major accident hazard&mdash;sites. Such a policy would specify details such as acceptable distances from residential homes and schools and in the absence of such a policy I cannot see how an inspector could possibly allow an appeal for such a site. If there is a safe siting policy, may I have sight of it so that I can test the policy against the dangers that my constituents would face from that unacceptable proposal? I do not think that there is a policy, and that is a problem for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/7">A key factor is that the island has no reasonable or sustainable means of access in an emergency, be it an LNG escape or another flood. So I make my now traditional cry from the heart for another separate access to the island, which should probably be from the Northwick road area. I congratulate Councillor Rodney Bass, the cabinet member at county hall, on his consistent support for our third road.</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/8">In a debate on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-25">25 July</phrase> I spoke about the rationing implicit in the NHS caused by decisions of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and the postcode rationing of treatments even when they have been approved by that body. Since then, the finances of the NHS have been shown to be in difficulties, with cutbacks, closures and redundancies that bring shame upon those of us who believe that the NHS is the jewel of the welfare state and something that we as a nation should cherish. I readily accept that additional money from our extra taxes has been put into the NHS by the Government, but we still need&mdash;indeed, we have a duty&mdash;to question why the outcomes are not proportionally much better. The Royal College of Physicians consensus statement on hepatitis C in 2004 stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/9" class="indent">&quot;What is certain is that, if we do not invest now, we will not be able to afford the consequences of failing to tackle this epidemic&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/10">As I pointed out in July, cost-effective treatments are available, which are recommended by NICE, so why have we identified only 23 per cent. of the carriers of that disease while Australia, for instance, has identified more than 80 per cent.?</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/11">Then there is coronary heart disease. The British Heart Foundation statistics database calculates that the overall cost of CHD to the UK economy is &pound;7.9 billion a year. So much of that human tragedy and cost burden is preventable. Cholesterol is a factor in about half of all CHD fatalities, more than any other risk factor. Cholesterol levels can be controlled and reduced, particularly for high risk patients by lifestyle and cost-effective treatment in primary care. But 79 per cent. of the NHS health care costs for CHD fall to in-patient costs and only 3 per cent. to the primary care sector. That proves the old proverb about a stitch in time saving nine.</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/12">While I am on the subject of the NHS, I ask whatever happened to simple common sense and decency. A little girl ended up with no limbs and a wonderful and caring community clubbed together to help her to rebuild her life&mdash;two of the people who helped to raise the funds are coming for dinner with me at the House of Commons tomorrow night. Yet we see utterly stupid and uncivilised policies that damage that little girl. Let me quote from an e-mail from my constituent Tony Simmons this week. He states that</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/13" class="indent">&quot;a lot of people raised a lot of money in this borough for&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/14">that little girl&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/15" class="indent">&quot;to get her on her feet. I see in the news today that she has been turned down for NHS physio because her limbs were not supplied by the NHS. Who are these toadies who make judgements like that, she is a child for gods sake. If you get a chance, put your oar in, stir up a bit of muddy water.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1353.0/16">My oar is well and truly in, and paddling furiously. May I wish that little girl, her family, homeless people and all at the Palace of Westminster a joyous Christmas and a healthy and peaceful new year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-19a.1354.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" speakername="Richard Benyon" colnum="1354"  time="017:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061219/debtext/61219-0015.htm#06121938000988">
	<p pid="a.1354.0/1">I shall be brief, but I want to refer to two matters in connection with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the railways that the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> touched on earlier. The first arises from the Ufton rail crash of just over a year ago, and I must declare an interest: my house is a few hundred yards from the site of the crash, and I was there about five minutes after it happened. Moreover, land surrounding the site is in my ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/2">I want to talk about the needs of my constituent David Main, who lost his wife Anjanette and his daughter Louella in the tragedy. In a few months, an inquest into the crash will be held at Windsor's Guildhall, and it will involve representatives of the Department of Transport, the rail operators, Network Rail and the Health and Safety Executive. All of them will be well represented by barristers, and they will have all the support that they need. In contrast, the victims are being denied the proper legal representation that they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/3">The Legal Services Commission recognised the problem when it gave Mr. Main leave to obtain the exceptional funding that is available in such cases. However, the Department for Constitutional Affairs has opposed the LSC award, and Mr. Main has been forced to take the matter to judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/4">The madness of it all is that winning the case will cost the Department more than giving Mr. Main the legal representation that he needs would. Two groups of civil servants are fighting over their different pots of money, and the Minister of State at the Department for Constitutional Affairs is unable to give leadership in the matter. At the bottom of the pile is my grieving constituent, who just wants to get on with his life, and who should be allowed the legal representation at the inquest that he needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/5">We saw the Minister of State's irascible performance at Question Time earlier today. However, I hope that the new year will imbue in her a spirit of good will so that she will be able to say that the judicial review process is a ridiculous waste of public money and should be dropped.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/6">I turn now to a problem to do with rail services to and from west Berkshire that affects many more people. I am indebted to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">my hon. Friend the Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase> for tabling early-day motion 526, which has been signed by hon. Members of all parties. I urge others to continue to put their names to it, as it concerns the chaos following the introduction of First Great Western's new timetable on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-11">11 December</phrase>. The new timetable is causing real unhappiness, and huge ill will towards both the company and the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/7">A year ago, First Great Western bid for and won a franchise that included a very prescribed timetable that had been set by the Department of Transport. Its central purpose was to increase capacity from cities and large population hubs at the expense of smaller communities and commuter regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/8">Earlier this year, people in my part of Berkshire ran a huge campaign that involved a petition that was presented on the Floor of the House and letters and e-mails of protest to Ministers and senior people at First Great Western. I had a meeting with the then hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate, who was rail Minister at the time. I subsequently attended another meeting with the then Secretary of State for Transport, who is now the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. At that meeting, I was accompanied by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1537" name="Michael Ancram">my neighbour and right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase>, who represents an area at the end of the branch line running through my constituency that was going to be extremely badly affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/9">Our experience at that second meeting was surreal. I sat on the Secretary of State's right hand side, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes sat on his left. All three of us sat on the sofa, and the Secretary of State was using Bradshaw's rail timetable to decide how many trains should stop at Kintbury, Hungerford and other similar towns. If the former Secretary of State had not had such a svelte physique, I would have said that he was the ultimate fat controller. What an absurd situation it was, with rail timetables being decided in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/10">I am glad to say that I was able to write to the Secretary of State after the consultation period and thank him for listening because many of services to the smaller stations in my constituency that had been under threat were reinstated. However, the inconvenience that has arisen from many of the train times remains. Many people are having to spend longer commuting and changing trains, and it is taking them an awful long time to get home. We have still lost a great number of services, the most important of which is the late night train from Paddington to Newbury, which was much valued by local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/11">I have discovered that, as a result of the train changes, people have changed their work patterns enormously. Previously, they decided to stay longer at home in the morning, to have breakfast with their children, take them to school and then go to work, and come home on a late train. Now, they can no longer do that. People's social lives have also been dramatically altered. Many young people used to go to Reading in the evening; they can no longer do it because we have lost the late train.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/12">When I raised the matter in questions to the new Minister with responsibility for the railways, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">the hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase>, he replied that I had</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/13" class="indent">&quot;probably been misinformed about cuts to services.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-17">17 October 2006</phrase>; Vol. 450, c. 723.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/14">I was so incensed that I wrote to him because there self-evidently had been cuts to services in west Berkshire and the whole area. I received a wholly unsatisfactory reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/15">As a result of the new timetable that came in last week we have fewer trains, longer commuting times and massive inconvenience to the commuting public, who are having to change trains. Without much warning, First Great Western has changed the rolling stock on two key commuter trains from Hungerford through Newbury and Thatcham and beyond. Instead of two Turbo trains with approximately 550 seats, it is now using Adelante trains with 282 seats. This has caused chaos and severe overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/16">Some of the 220-plus e-mails that I have received from the travelling public have given a graphic account of the sheer misery that has been visited on them in west Berkshire in recent days. I quote just a few of them. One says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/17" class="indent">&quot;The service is so overcrowded that the gangways are blocked. This is dangerous and breaks safety regulations. (from a member of FGW staff) ... I have to leave work 20 minutes earlier to get a train that serves Thatcham.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/18">That does not sound a great inconvenience, but if it is added up over a week, a month or even a year, it is an enormous inconvenience. Another says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/19" class="indent">&quot;The new ... service is taking significantly longer (10 minutes more in the morning and around half an hour in the afternoon&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/20">Another says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/21" class="indent">&quot;Since moving to Newbury in September in part to be closer to train services into London and better train/bus connections to Heathrow I have found the local service to be overcrowded, uncomfortable and local rail staff rude and high-handed. As a consequence&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/22">I really hope that the Minister responsible gets this important point&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/23" class="indent">&quot;I am now driving into London and the airport more often than travel by train&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/24">Last week we heard that Newbury had one of the most congested school runs in the country. I have been struck by how many parents and children have contacted me to give me their experience. One mother says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/25" class="indent">&quot;My daughter attends St. Bart's School in Newbury. She commutes every morning by train from Hungerford.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/26" class="indent">Since the changes to the morning train timetable, my daughter has to literally run to school,&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/27">a long way, I should add&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/28" class="indent">&quot;to avoid being late.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/29">Another child writes to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/30" class="indent">&quot;The changing of the trains has dramatically affected me getting to school every morning. I have to travel from Kintbury to Newbury every morning and have no other choice because of my parents being market traders. The train leaving Kintbury at 8.18 every morning, and me having to be in school by 8.40, causes great issues.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/31">I am sure that it does.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/32">I will not burden the House much longer because I want to allow other hon. Members to speak. I am indebted to the Vodafone intranet. Vodafone is for the moment the largest employer in my constituency. The Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston is fast catching it up, but 3,500 employees of Vodafone work in Newbury. It has done a trawl via its intranet to see the effect that the timetable changes are having on one company. I was struck by a debate that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" name="Robert Wilson">my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> initiated recently on transport infrastructure in the Thames Valley. He pointed out that Hewlett Packard was moving out of Reading due to pressure from its employees about the amount of time that it takes for them to get to work. I quote a couple of Vodafone employees. One says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/33" class="indent">&quot;Needless to say, I went out and bought a car and now drive to London, which is cheaper and I can come home to Newbury at whatever time I like.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/34">Another describes his commuting experience over the last couple of weeks:</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/35" class="indent">&quot;I was sitting in a seat where three people face each other and we actually had people standing between myself and the passenger opposite ... One woman got very distressed and claustrophobic and started screaming and shouting but there was nothing anyone could do, as you couldn't move an inch.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/36">Finally, a great many people raised the issue of bicycles. As one said, if we are to have an integrated transport system, we need to make provision for bicycles. He thought that the sooner the Adelante trains are gone, the better, because there is not enough room for bicycles on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/37">There is a major social dimension to this matter. Research in the US&mdash;ground-breaking research by Professor Puttnam, culminating in his book &quot;Bowling Alone&quot;&mdash;showed that for every 10 more minutes that people spend commuting, 10 per cent. less time is spent on community activities, social events, sports clubs, other voluntary work and even family gatherings. It is a major issue, not just one for rail users. It affects car users, who are stuck in greater congestion. We talk about general well-being and this is a real health issue. People are more stressed at work, it affects the economy and it affects communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/38">I finish with one more quote. Alec Mellor sent me an e-mail, in which he referred to his &quot;sum of displeasure today&quot; as</p>
	<p pid="a.1354.0/39" class="indent">&quot;2 hrs standing up on top of a 10hr working day. This cannot be the quality of my life for 5 days a week. I cannot do any work on the trains any more, cannot read and am seething for the entire durations.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-19a.1378.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" speakername="Keith Vaz" colnum="1378"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061219/debtext/61219-0019.htm#06121943000026">
	<p pid="a.1378.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to bring to the House's attention the matter of the proposed closure in December 2007 of the General Electric lighting factory in Leicester. This is our last debate of 2006 and it really is an eleventh hour appeal to get the factory's corporate management to reconsider its proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/2">I would like to thank the Minister for Industry and the Regions, whom I have known for the past 30 years and who is, in my view, one of the best and most accessible Ministers in the Government. I also welcome the hundreds of hon. Members who are watching this debate on their television monitors. This is, of course, the last parliamentary day of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/3">The GE Lighting factory on Melton road in my constituency employs in the region of 400 people, many in skilled and irreplaceable jobs. However, merely citing the number of job losses does not properly project how devastating the closure of the factory would be to the community and the local economy. The factory has been in the same location for 60 years and many of its employees have worked there all their adult lives. Those are not just statistics; they are men and women with husbands, wives and children to support. Many have given their all to the company&mdash;people such as Stuart Will, the plant manager, Mike Flay, the human resources manager, Eustace Richardson, the Amicus union representative, Aruna Patel, Linda Haulett, Rafiq Lohar and Bipin Misby. They are all hard working, honest, loyal and dedicated people, whose employers have given them the worst Christmas present imaginable. Their hard work is rewarded not by the mega-bonuses that their bosses in New York will be receiving, but by potential unemployment and a very uncertain future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/4">My objective in the debate is to present the case that General Electric, in proposing to shut down the factory, is making a huge mistake, and that the Government and other relevant stakeholders such as the East Midlands Development Agency must mobilise all their resources and efforts to fight this decision and encourage GE to reconsider its drastic and callous action.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/5">I would like briefly to outline the history of the factory in order to inform the Minister and the House of the background to the closure. Following conversion from a wartime plane parts factory, production originally started there in 1947. In 1967, Thorn Lighting bought the firm and turned it into Europe's biggest lamp and bulb making plant. The lights of Europe were literally made in Rushey Mead in Leicester. As well as providing Europe and the world with lighting products manufactured on site, the factory has been involved in some of the biggest scientific breakthroughs in lighting technology in the past 60 years, including inventing the first mass-production fluorescent bulb.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/6">Only 12 years ago, in 1994, GE Lighting bought Thorn Lighting and since then has, sadly, instigated several rounds of redundancies at the factory, with the latest round in April this year. In November, GE Lighting announced that it was considering plans to close the Leicester factory and move production to Hungary at the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/7">I feel it is the ultimate duty of a local Member of Parliament to do all they can to help constituents when their jobs and livelihoods are put at risk. I have assisted employees at the factory when they faced problems before and I will do so gladly again on this occasion. It has been a centre of excellence in design, distribution and production for 60 years; with the necessary vision and investment, it could remain as such.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/8">The factory and its committed staff can, given the chance, meet the challenges of globalisation head-on. One has only to look at the success of foreign car makers in Britain to see that manufacturing in this country is not some relic of the 19th and 20th centuries, but one of the key sectors that will drive Britain's economy forward in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/9">The UK is one of the most competitive economies in Europe, coming fourth out of 27 in the most recent Lisbon league table for economic competitiveness. We have low interest rates, low inflation and one of the longest periods of sustained growth ever known. The infrastructure for moving goods around the country and into mainland Europe is first class, and I believe that our skills base for research and development is the best in the world. That is why it is so surprising and illogical that GE Lighting is looking to close its Leicester factory now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/10">The company has given three main reasons for the closure of the plant. First, it cites high manufacturing costs; secondly, declining volume; and, thirdly, the pending discontinuation of a product made at the Leicester factory. Although it is true that manufacturing costs in the newer EU countries are lower than those in the older member states, I feel it prudent to point out that, as standards of living rise in the newer member countries, so will their wage rates. One has only to look at the case of Portugal&mdash;a weak economy on entry to the EU in 1986, and now a thriving one, with living standards very similar to the rest of western Europe and wage levels to match. Therefore, I believe that it is extremely short-sighted for GE Lighting to abandon its skills base and loyal employees in Leicester for a relatively short period of cost advantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/11">As for the declining volume of production and the pending discontinuation of a product made at Leicester, those arguments are so weak that I am surprised that they are advanced. The reason for the decline in production is that round after round of redundancies have been made by the company&mdash;not any decline in worker productivity. In the lighting industry, innovations and new products are constantly becoming available; the Leicester plant has produced them and, in fact, often provided the research and development to do so. What GE Lighting actually means when it says</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/12" class="indent">&quot;a key product made at the Leicester factory is being discontinued&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/13">is that it is unwilling to continue investing in the factory and updating the production lines, as has been done for the past 60 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/14">Leicester is renowned as a manufacturing hub, and huge investments have been made in recent years by other companies that are keen to take advantage of Leicester's excellent strategic location, superb transport links and skilled work force. For example, in 1999, International Radiators opened a new &pound;6 million factory in Leicester, which represents the biggest investment that that company has ever made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/15">As the Minister may be aware, I am one of the most vocal supporters of the European Union's expansion eastwards. I believe that free trade and the Common Market are key to Europe's continuing prosperity. However, one of the negatives of the expansion is that it has encouraged a certain herd mentality among employers, whereby production is moved simply because doing so is in vogue with other companies, without a more holistic consideration of other factors, such as skills, infrastructure and a country's overall economic competitiveness. It is quite ironic that, as hundreds of thousands of eastern European workers move to the UK because of our economic competitiveness&mdash;a movement that I wholeheartedly welcome&mdash;GE Lighting is proposing to move in the opposite direction by taking production to eastern Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/16">I visited the factory on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-24">24 November</phrase> this year, together with Councillor Kuldipp Bhatti, and met the employers, employees and trade union representatives. It was made clear to me while I was there that the work force were not prepared to accept the proposed closure and that they plan to do everything that they can to fight it. I promised them my full support. Since then, I have been in active communication with the head of manufacturing in Europe, Mr. Istavan Salekovics. I have asked in business questions for this Adjournment debate and have tabled a number of motions, including early-day motion 307, which has been signed by many right hon. and hon. Members and which calls for GE to reconsider its plans to close the Leicester factory at the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/17">I spoke to Mr. Salekovics only yesterday and I listened carefully to what he had to say about the impact that globalisation was having on his business in Europe and the United Kingdom. I have heard all the arguments before&mdash;when they have been put by Ministers&mdash;about the rising power of India and China and the issue of labour costs. However, I put to him the fact that GE is a worldwide company that manufactures at a number of bases all over Europe and the world. If the proposal to close is going to go ahead, surely there must be something else that can be produced on the Leicester site that will benefit the company. I am delighted to tell the House that Mr. Salekovics has agreed to meet me in London when he comes here at the end of January, which is within the consultation period. Is my right hon. Friend the Minister also prepared to meet him to hear what he has to say about the reasons why the company felt that the closure was necessary?</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/18">Unfortunately, I have had little success in arranging a phone call with Mr. Jeffrey Immelt, the chief executive officer of General Electric, the second largest company in the world. My office has telephoned to New York on a number of occasions to speak to him. That culminated in a rather bizarre call between my office and the head of public affairs for GE in New York. He informed us that he was in the middle of eating his Thanksgiving turkey and therefore unable to take the conversation forward. There will be no turkey eaten with relish by my constituents in Rushey Mead this Christmas, because of the tragic news of the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/19">The Amicus representatives from the factory have met with the management in Hungary. I am disappointed to have to inform the House that they felt that, despite making the trip to Hungary to meet the management, they were given only a rushed meeting in which the proposals were treated more as a definite plan than a possibility. Alternative plans put forward by the union were not really given much time and the company did not really pay much heed to them. Unfortunately, as I have said, that attitude reflects what&mdash;prior to the call that I had with Mr. Salekovics&mdash;I have felt has been the way in which the company wishes to discuss these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/20">The company has not consulted broadly or deeply, as it should have done, and has not shown the necessary duty of care to its hard-working staff in Leicester. It has not taken into consideration the effect on the local economy. It has not had any discussions with the east midlands development board. It has not approached Leicester city council to talk about the cost of the council tax on its business. There have been no discussions of any kind. I would like to see proper and full consultation and I would like alternative plans to be given serious consideration. I want to see substantial talks with the relevant stakeholders that show genuine concern for the contribution that our city has made to the manufacturing success of GE and before that Thorn. Genuine concern should be shown to the employees for their lifelong commitment to the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/21">Mr. Salekovics's visit to London may be the opportunity to do that, but I have made it clear to him that I am prepared to travel to Hungary or the United States to assist my constituents in trying to save their jobs. Will the Minister, even at the eleventh hour on the last day before the Christmas recess, join me and call on General Electric to re-examine its proposals and instead invest in the historic factory that has so long provided lighting for the whole of Europe and whose workers are so skilled?</p>
	<p pid="a.1378.2/22">The factory has a long and wonderful tradition of displaying Christmas lights. Every year, children expect to see the tradition upheld. Anyone who travels from Nottingham on the M1&mdash;if they can manage to get through the M1, given all the traffic that is on it these days&mdash;and comes off at junction 21A and then goes into Leicester will see the General Electric factory with a wonderful display of lights all around it. In this spirit, will my right hon. Friend the Minister consider turning on the GE Christmas lights at the factory next year? Hopefully, it would not be the last time that anyone would do so. I also urge her help and that of other hon. Members so that the lights might not go out over Leicester after all.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-19a.1383.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" colnum="1383"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061219/debtext/61219-0020.htm#06121942000083">
	<p pid="a.1383.1/1">Indeed. I was just about to come to my right hon. Friend's remarks, but the final pointthat I wanted to spell out was that the Secretary of State for Education and Skills recently announcedthe establishment of a national skills academy for manufacturing, to ensure that we maintain the skills that we require for the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383.1/2">To respond to the specific issues raised by my right hon. Friend, of course I am happy to meet Mr. Salekovics when he comes over, and I will certainly lay out for him some of the ways in which we can benefit the company. It has a long history in the UK, and I will work with my right hon. Friend to see what we in government can do to keep it here. The East Midlands Development Agency met GE on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-12">12 December</phrase> to discuss ways of reducing relative costs, and to consider productivity levels. I understand that GE is considering those suggestions, and will come back to EMDA on the issue shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383.1/3">Clearly, if the talks and the attempts to keep the company open are not successful, we must look tothe future for the individuals who will be affected by the closure. In that regard, we have a well-established mechanism that we will want to bring into play, which will bring together the regional development agency, the local learning and skills council, Jobcentre Plus and the Leicestershire economic partnership. They will see what they can do to support individuals during that extremely difficult time, either by linking them to new job opportunities or by providing the appropriate training to help them to get another job.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383.1/4">Of course, those actions are being taken in the context of a very successful macro-economic climate. Since 1997, when we first came into Government, we have created some 2.5 million extra jobs, so although the individuals will feel very low and worried as we come up to Christmas, they should be reassured by the health of the UK economy and the economy in my right hon. Friend's area, and by the Government's determination to put all resources into play, so that we provide the very best support for individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1383.1/5">As for my main message to my right hon. Friend, I hope that in his discussions with GE&mdash;I am happy to support him as best I can in those&mdash;he will stress that outsourcing production as planned may well not be in the long-term best interests of that company, if it wants to maintain a good market share and a vibrant industrial capacity in Europe. What the Government are offering includes access to research and development resources, access to macro-economic stability, access to a highly skilled work force, and access to a liberal labour market. Those are all features of the UK's economy that make us an attractive location for inward investment. I hope that my right hon. Friend's efforts will help to save the company for the future of Britain.</p>
