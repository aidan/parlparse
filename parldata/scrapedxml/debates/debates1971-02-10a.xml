<p>The two Concorde prototypes have now completed nearly 400 hours of flight testing, including tests at Concorde's cruising speed of twice the speed of sound. The results of these tests are now being assessed. About &#x00A3;500 million has been spent on development so far.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman appreciate that, bearing in mind that the Concorde is powered with Rolls-Royce engines, its commercial future has been gravely prejudiced by the Government's reluctance to renegotiate the contract to supply the Rolls-Royce engines for the Lockheed TriStar, and also by the disgraceful way in which the right hon. Gentleman himself knocked Rolls-Royce engines in his speech on Monday?</p>

<p>I entirely reject the hon. Gentleman's proposition. It is thoroughly mischievous to suggest that this will happen. I am confident that the American airlines will judge Concorde on its commercial aspects. With regard to the other matter, if hon. Gentlemen will re-read the context in which I made the remark that the engine was behind, they will realise that it applied solely to time. They know that delay has destroyed the best technical advances, such as Comet, but if they like to make political capital out of a grave national disaster like this, it is up to them. I propose to give the House as honest an assessment as I can of what I believe are the prospects.</p>

<p>Would my right hon. Friend agree that, so far from the commercial prospects being prejudiced, the flight test development so far has given the British aircraft industry every indication that it has a product which it can sell to the airlines? There have been 60 hours of supersonic speeds and six to eight hours at more than Mach 2.</p>

certainly the French reactions to the Rolls-Royce engine in no way confirm the fears expressed from the other side of the House.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that the greatest concern would be caused if the aircraft were to continue in production with insufficient orders, allowing it to trickle on neither making a profit nor producing enough to offset the money spent on it? Leaving aside the money already spent, what estimate has the Minister made of the numbers of aircraft required to be sold to break even?</p>

<p>I have explained to the House and to the hon.

It is on that review and the prospects that the future depends. As for the number, the answer is approximately 100.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend not agree that, in addition to his remarks about Concorde, its sales prospects will not be determined by whether or not the Americans or anyone else think that we are nice chaps, but by the speed with which B.O.A.C. and Air France place orders for the aeroplane? Will he continue to do all he can to encourage those companies to convert their interest into a firm order for Concorde?</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware, with reference to the point he made in answer to the first supplementary question, that it was not only his attack upon the RB211 but his slighting reference to the 1011 compared with its competitor in the United States that has caused grave damage and made the position worse. Does he agree, too, that the credibility of Rolls-Royce has been affected and prejudiced by the decision on the RB211 and that this may affect Concorde? Does the right hon. Gentleman intend to make political representations at the highest level in New York State and in Washington on the noise question, which could be the decisive issue in the end?</p>

<p>The answer to the first part of the right hon. Gentleman's supplementary question is that I made no damaging remarks about the Lockheed 1011, except to indicate that the DC10 was clearly getting more orders.<br/>
I am in very close touch on the matter of the noise level, and I saw Lord Cromer about the noise problem before he left.</p>

<p>I thank my right hon.

<p>In the Minister's reply to my intervention on Monday, he was courteous enough to say that the reason why he did not intervene in the negotiations with Lockheed was that there might be a contravention of Section 332 of the Companies Act. Is the Minister seriously saying that the reason why he did not try


to renegotiate the Lockheed contract and so save the firm of Rolls-Royce in a compromise settlement was that it might be interpreted as a contravention of Section 332&#x2014;as an attempt to defraud the creditors of Rolls-Royce?</p>

<p>There is no question of defrauding the creditors. As I sought to explain before, the situation was that the time was excessively short because the Rolls-Royce decision was made when it was, as I think I put it, right up against it from the point of view of meeting its liabilities. Within that time, we did our best, and we got in touch with the United States Government and with Lockheed.</p>

<p>In view of the great interest shown in this country in VTOL and the importance of the multijet as opposed to the deflector jet for vertical take-off, will my hon.

<p>I cannot give my hon. Friend the undertaking for which he asks. As he knows, these aircraft were originally delivered in 1961 as experimental aircraft. But he is entirely right in suggesting that a lot of the knowledge gained has already been incorporated in such aircraft as the Harrier.</p>

<p>Imports of aircraft, aero-engines and parts from the United States of America amounted to &#x00A3;86 million in 1970; the corresponding figure for exports was &#x00A3;49 million. We shall continue to give every assistance to British exporters that we can.</p>

<p>Do not those figures show the confidence of the industry in the policies of the previous Government and, in particular, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn)?

<p>I take these Questions to apply to civil projects. No expenditure was incurred on design studies or development of V/STOL projects, but the Department continued to support exploratory work. Future expenditure will depend upon the results of the studies now nearing completion

<p>I agree with a great deal of that. This is an important, though potentially expensive, development which could take many years. As the hon.

<p>My hon. Friend is right in saying that we are doing extremely well in the exploratory work, but I do not think it is right to say that we have a unique lead in what we are really looking for, which is a commercial civil aircraft. It it in the military field that we are so distinguished.</p>

<p>While I appreciate the care which my hon.

<p>I thank the Chairman of the Kitchen Committee for that reply. Does he not think that there have been many increases during the past year? When he wants to put up prices, should he not consult hon.

<p>The last increase in the price of meals and the like served to hon. Members was more than a year ago, in January, 1970, if my records are correct. I owe the House an apology in that we did not promulgate these increases, which were agreed by the sub-committee without dissension. It was my view that we should see the prices on the menus and price lists in good time, but I gather that this was not the case. Clearly, we should have asked the Whips to circulate an announcement.<br/>
As for maintaining prices, we have to make each of the so-called eating places severally pay its own way individually. That is the only way to proceed.</p>

It is my constant desire to improve the quality and choice of the dishes available to Members in the dining rooms, cafeterias and tea rooms in the House, but at the same time I am trying to keep the cost of food to a minimum.

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement about the Report of the Court of Inquiry under the Chairmanship of Lord Wilberforce.<br/>
The Report of the Court of Inquiry chaired by Lord Wilberforce into the dispute in the electricity supply industry is being published this afternoon. Copies are now available in the Vote Office. It makes three main recommendations.<br/>
First, the Court makes recommendations about rates of pay. For all industrial staff other than skilled workers, the Court recommends that the employers' offer of an increase of &#x00A3;2 a week should be accepted as fair and reasonable and should take effect from last September. This recommendation covers around two-thirds of all industrial staff. The Court recommends that this offer should be increased by &#x00A3;35 a year for skilled workers only and that some increase should be made in shift allowances. It also recommends that the employers' offer of one day's additional holiday should be increased to three days. The Court recommends that these improvements over and above the employers' offer should take effect only from 14th December when industrial action ceased.<br/>
Secondly, the Court recommends a speeding up in the introduction of the local incentive bonus schemes provided for under existing agreements dating from 1967. It considers these by far the best way of ensuring an efficient and well paid labour force, and believes that the present rate of progress is too slow and causes real dissatisfaction amongst unions and employees. As an incentive to both management and employees to make more rapid progress, the Court recommends a scheme of "lead-in" payments to operate


by 1st June for those groups of workers who are not by then covered by bonus schemes.<br/>
Such a group would be offered a "lead-in" bonus if a majority of employees in that group formally accepted by majority vote the introduction of a bonus scheme in principle, the carrying out of such work study and work measurement as would first be necessary and the need to run down the number of employees to the point where a bonus scheme could be introduced and bonuses earned. Thereafter each individual worker would be asked to sign a note of acceptance.<br/>
The "lead-in" payments so proposed would be 20s. a week increasing to 30s. a week in October, 1971 and to 40s. in January, 1972. They would however stop once a bonus scheme was introduced or such a scheme was rejected. The economies to be achieved are in the Court's view of such a scale that these payments should not add significantly to labour costs.<br/>
Thirdly, the Court found that the action of the unions in refusing to let the dispute go to arbitration was a breach of their agreement and the Court deplores this action. The Court also finds that the action taken during the work-to-rule was, in many areas, in breach of agreements, and that it was wrong for the union leaders to put the public at risk by a failure to issue more specific instructions to their members. The Court recommends that obligations and responsibilities should be clarified for the future.<br/>
In framing these recommendations, the Court considered in particular the productivity record of the industry, including the contribution the unions and the employees have made, and the bearing on the public and national economic interest. The Court says that it recognises that the country is at present in a dangerous condition of spiralling inflation; and that it should have regard to the dangers of giving this an extra twist. It concludes, however, that set against past and prospective performance in the electricity industry and the special factors relating to this case the settlement it recommends ought not to intensify inflationary pressures.<br/>
The employers estimated that their last offer would have increased average earnings by 9&#x00B7;7 per cent. On the same basis

the Court's recommendations would represent 10&#x00B7;9 per cent. in the year from September 1970. The total addition to the wage bill should, however, be substantially less than this with the continuing redaction in the labour force which the Court believes should be accelerated with the more rapid extension of bonus schemes. It is in this way that the Court believes that electricity workers can best&#x2014;and justifiably&#x2014;benefit from increased efficiency in the industry.<br/>
The Court makes it clear that its recommendations are related specifically to the circumstances and special factors in the electricity industry, particularly the contribution that the unions and employees have made and can increasingly make in improving productivity. There is therefore no question of the Court's recommendations being applicable in other industries in different situations. I must reaffirm&#x2014;as the Court itself accepts&#x2014;that if inflation is to be brought under control the general level of pay settlements must be reduced as rapidly as possible to a level much closer to the general rise in national productivity.<br/>
I have communicated the Report to the employers and unions concerned and I understand they will be discussing it together at an early date. I hope the recommendations in the report will provide an early settlement.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.528.0" hansard_membership_id="4880" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2085" speakername="Mrs. Castle" colnum="528" time="">
<p>Would not the right hon. Gentleman agree that his first consideration should be to try to bring peace to this industry by getting acceptance of this Report? That being so, will he not be more frank with the House and the country and admit, first, that the Court recognised that the workers concerned had a genuine grievance which was not being met by the electricity boards' offer; and, secondly, that the Court has therefore recommended substantial improvements which amount, in terms of an immediately operative improvement, to 12&#x00B7;6 per cent. taking into account shift payments, the additional payment for skilled workers and the additional holidays, and that, further, the lead-in payments which are to come into operation by next June at the latest will add another 2&#x00B7;8 per cent., making an average increase in earnings of 15&#x00BD; per cent. in all, with further increases due in October and next January?


Will the right hon. Gentleman, in order to correct the bowdlerised version of what he says the Court said about inflation, read to the House those passages in the Report pointing out that it is impossible to cure the inflationary problem by trying to lean on individual wage payments without taking into account the need to hold down price increases and stimulate growth?</p>

<p>I agree, and I should have hoped that the right hon. Lady would also agree, that it is the job of all of us to try to ensure that the Report of the Court of Inquiry leads to a settlement. I certainly agree with that. I do not think that the right hon. Lady's words contributed very much to that cause.<br/>
I was completely frank with the House. I underlined certainly once, and I am almost sure more than once&#x2014;and if any hon. Member reads HANSARD tomorrow he will see it confirmed&#x2014;that the Court had stressed that the contribution of the unions and their members to productivity had been outstanding and that that was the only reason it was able to make the recommendation it made. That is quite clear.<br/>
Secondly, the figures which I quoted were the Court's own figures, and I have the authority of the Court to make that clear. It accepts the figures which I have given, and I do not for one moment accept the figures which the right hon. Lady has given. Her figures are not right. They are a most irresponsible contribution to the major overriding need of this country to bring inflation under better control. How they can be uttered by a right hon. Lady who left her Department with a White Paper saying that price increases should not&#x2014;<i>[Interruption]</i>.&#x2014;wage increases should not exceed 4&#x00BD; per cent., and with prices rising faster than they had risen for 20 years, passes all bounds of credibility&#x2014;even the right hon. Lady's credibility on industrial relations.</p>

<p>I trust that the arguments used in this Report and the analysis on which they are based, which I believe are of a very high order, will be read, marked and taken into account by all other people. The vital thing in the Report is that the Committee underlines the special circumstances of the case into which it was looking and, therefore, the 10&#x00B7;9 per cent., on the same basis that the employers' offer was labelled as a 10 per cent. offer, is not held out by the Committee as, and should not be taken by anybody else to be, a norm of any kind, because it was justified only by the exceptional contribution of productivity in this industry.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend refer to page 48 of the Report which arrives at the conclusion that the settlement, which he has quantified at 10&#x00B7;9 per cent., would not result in an increase in "inflationary pressures"? Having regard to those words, will my right hon. Friend give the House an assurance that the Government's control over the tariffs of nationalised industries will preclude any possibility of an increase in electricity prices as a result of this award?</p>

<p>I draw the attention of my hon. Friend, the House and the country to the point made in the Report that if the productivity incentive bonus payments, as the Court prefers to call them, are widely implemented, it will be an example of how individual earnings can be increased without increasing costs. That is the essence of this Report, and


if that lesson is learned in every industry, including this industry, I think that my hon. Friend and the country will be highly satisfied about the effect on prices.</p>

<p>Can the right hon. Gentleman tell us what will be the additional cost to the industry of this award before the efficiency agreements come into force? Does he agree that the very fact that Lord Wilberforce and his colleagues have limited their Report to one industry shows that they see it as the Government's duty to establish some principles for regulating wages in the public sector and it cannot be left to a series of <i>ad hoc</i> inquiries into various industries? If the criterion is to be extra productivity, is it to apply to all nationalised and public services and, if so, how are some of them to achieve it because in some of them it is almost impossible to relate work to productivity?</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has raised some fundamental points, but I would remind him and the House of two things.<br/>
I do not believe that that is the central message of the Wilberforce Report, although, quite properly, these matters are discussed in the Report. One of the central messages of the Report is that the Committee accepted the overall spiralling of inflation, which it said was dangerous, and it said that each and every claim and settlement must be judged in that context and that context must, therefore, affect each and every settlement. That is an immensely important thing for the Committee to have said, and it is immensely important for the future.<br/>
As to the wider points of the right hon. Gentleman's question, we have to differentiate here sharply between the world of theory and the real world of practice. In theory, when this Government came to power last June it took over an instrument for surveying all these things which, on paper, was a nice tidy-looking incomes policy under which increases should not have been outside the 2&#x00BD; to 4&#x00BD; per cent. range. In practice that policy was a "busted flush". It would have been quite pointless to have continued it.</p>

<p>Has the Secretary of State seen the Press statement this morning attributed to the general secretary

of the Union of Post Office Workers indicating that the U.P.W.'s executive council will consider, against the background of the Wilberforce recommendations, whether to prolong the Post Office dispute or seek arbitration? Will the right hon.

<p>If the rate of national production is rising at about 3 per cent. per year, is it not clear that an award of 10&#x00B7;9 per cent. is exceptionally generous? If it is to be regarded as a universal yardstick, would it not be a recipe for national disaster?</p>

<p>Would not the right hon. Gentleman accept that at the moment the primary need is to get both sides of the industry to accept the decision of the Wilberforce Committee? Will he not also accept that any attempt to write down the award is likely to induce the unions not to accept the Committee's Report? Is it not true that the overall affect of the Report is to give to the trade union a 13&#x00B7;4 per cent. increase, and ought he not to emphasise that factor in the hope that we can get the unions to accept the Report so that there is no recurrence of the dispute?</p>

<p>I have not written down what the Report indicates. I repeat that the figure I gave is the figure which the Court itself had, and I have the Court's authority to say this. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we ought to try to get this accepted as a basis of settlement. The overall recommendation offers the opportunity to all the workers in that industry substantially to increase their earnings in return for increases in productivity which will not add to the overall


costs of the industry. That is the great opportunity this offers, and the whole purpose of the lead-in bonus payments which have been suggested&#x2014;which are totally different from the old lieu bonuses with which all of us in industry have been familiar for so long&#x2014;is to give a strong incentive both to management and employeees to move faster in the direction of these incentive bonus systems, which will give the individual and industry much higher earnings without increasing costs for the community.</p>

<p>Could the Secretary of State, for the convenience of the House, give the paragraph number of the Report in which the Court gives the percentage figure that he has quoted to us? If it is not in the Report, why was it not in the Report? Why was it suddenly produced like a rabbit out of a hat for the advantage of the right hon. Gentleman's argument? Is it not a fact that if the Court had wished to put a percentage figure in the Report itself it could and would have included one, but has not done so? Although it is true that the Report is merely dealing with a particular wage claim, it has general remarks to make about the way in which it cannot be expected that any group of workers will accept restraint in wage demands as long as there is no attempt to control prices or to hold out any hope of growth.</p>

<p>As for the percentage figure, it is correct that it is not in the Report. [HON. MEMBERS: "0h."] It is entirely up to the Committee to decide what it does or does not put into its Report. <i>[Interruption]</i>. I never said it was in the Report. The Committee believes that its argumentation stands on its own feet without the mention of percentages, and in the Committee's view percentages would be misleading. As a general method of calculation, it is difficult to decide how best to present the effect of any settlement in any industry. Anybody who likes to present the figure as a higher percentage cannot then claim that the employers' offer was 9&#x00B7;7 per cent.<br/>
What is incontrovertible and absolutely accepted by the Court, which is the figure it had before it&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Which paragraph?"] I did not write the Committee's Report for it. [HON. MEMBERS: "0h."] I can only report

what is true, which is that 10&#x00B7;9 per cent. was the figure which the Committee had before it before signing the Report and which it accepted as being the effect of its recommendations. I have the Committee's authority to say this to the House. <i>[Interruption.]</i><br/>
Since this is evidently regarded by the House as an important matter, perhaps I should indicate the basis of the calculation. The employers' offer was calculated to add &#x00A3;15&#x00B7;091 million to the annual wage bill as it stood at last September. The annual wage bill of the industry as at last September was &#x00A3;155&#x00B7;9 million. On that basis that offer represented an increase of 9&#x00B7;68 per cent., or 9&#x00B7;7 per cent. as I said to the House. The Committee's additional recommendations add &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;905 million to the employers' offer, making a total of &#x00A3;16&#x00B7;996 million, which is 10&#x00B7;9 per cent. of the last September wage bill of &#x00A3;155&#x00B7;9 million. This is the basis of calculation of the employers' offer and the comparable offer put forward by the Court and is therefore&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The two things are strictly comparable, but if the House wishes to judge what the Court has proposed by the same yardstick as it judged the employers' offer, the correct comparison is as between 10&#x00B7;9 per cent. and 9&#x00B7;7 per cent.</p>

<p>Whilst congratulating the right hon. Gentleman on the use of cosmetics in presenting the Report this afternoon, may I ask whether he agrees, on the figures which he has just read out to the House, that the calculated figure which he gave earlier was based on an annual rate from September, 1970, the date which he quoted, and that, since a number of the Court's recommendations&#x2014;only a small proportion of them&#x2014;go back to September, 1970, but some take effect in December and some during this summer, the annual rate from now on, from the date of publication of the Report, is as was stated by my right hon. Friend earlier? If the right hon. Gentleman is not satisfied with that calculation, may I ask him to present the figures to the House in a White Paper, or in some other way, so that we can do our own calculations without the benefit of cosmetics?<br/>
Secondly, since the right hon. Gentleman made this very moving plea, which really impressed some of us&#x2014;<i>[Interruption]</i>. certainly&#x2014;when he was arguing


that it was very misleading to use percentages in these cases, will he say why three of his right hon.

<p>I think that before the right hon. Gentleman criticises the use of percentages, he must accept&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i>&#x2014;two things. First, from his own and his right hon. Friend's experience, the right hon. Gentleman must know that it is very difficult to know what is the best and most accurate way of putting these matters forward. Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman must know that, despite these difficulties, the Labour Government consistently used percentages as the basis of their criteria, that their criteria for 1970 was between 2&#x00BD; and 4&#x00BD; per cent., and that we are here dealing with something of the order of 10 per cent., which is a long way above that.</p>

The difficulty in proceedings of this kind is that when the Chair has made a pronouncement, such as you, Sir Robert, have just made, and somebody else subsequently takes the Chair, we get a confusion of Rulings. You have ruled on something under your liberal guidance, probably somebody later will rule on a constrictive basis.

<p>I apologise to my hon. Friends, and I hope that they can now hear me.<br/>
We are now discussing one of the major issues raised by the Bill, and it is whether a trade union, as it has existed for the last 60 years, may continue to be a trade union because, under the terms of the Clause, unless a trade union is registered as a trade union, unless it chooses to go through the hoop, it will, for the purposes of this Measure, no longer be a trade union.<br/>
The purpose of this group of Amendments is to elucidate whether a trade union, unless it goes through the hoop of registration and complies with the requirements laid down by the Government, will become only an organisation of workers and be exposed to many penalties, and whether, if it wants to continue as a trade union, it may do so on one condition only, and that is a condition which I do not think is attached to any comparable organisation. The condition is that it may be a trade union only if it gets licence from the State.<br/>
The provisions for the giving of a licence are unequalled anyway anywhere because, to get a licence, a trade union has to observe the principles set out in Clause 61. These are principles for which I believe there is no precedent in any other legislation about incorporation. There are no similar provisions in the Companies Acts. If there were, it might be that brewers would have to observe certain principles, and perhaps be struck off the register for subscribing money to the Conservative Party.<br/>
The whole purpose of legislation is to be precise, and that is what industrial collective bargaining is all about. We must have agreements which are precise, and which people understand. One hoop through which a trade union must go before it is registered is that it must comply with certain principles. I challenge the Solicitor-General to give us examples of so vague a concept being applied to the running of any other organisation.<br/>
One principle is that the organisation is to be denied the right to choose its own members, a principle of association which is not observed in any other sphere. Secondly, it has to jump through the hoop of Schedule 3. Under that Schedule, if a union is registered it will be robbed of the discretion to appoint its own officers and officials and to specify which official does what. If a union wants to have a degree of discretion to be able to change duties from one person to another in the light of particular situations, it will not be able to be registered.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman said that Clause 61 precluded unions from having the right to elect its own officers. Is that a reference to subsection (4)? If so, does not the hon. Gentleman agree that that is subject to the words
<q>by way of any arbitrary or unreasonable discrimination"?</q>
Surely the hon. Gentleman is not suggesting that it is wrong to have a principle that there should be no arbitrary or unreasonable discrimination in the selection of officers?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.540.1" hansard_membership_id="4631" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30154" speakername="Mr. Fraser" colnum="540" time="">
<p>I am not arguing that case. We shall in due course discuss Clause 61 in more detail. If one looks at the earlier wording of the subsection, one sees that it is so drawn that it includes many people who may not be able to be admitted to a trade union. For instance, the subsection refers to a person being "reasonably well qualified". The right hon. and learned Member is a member of the Bar. Will he tell me whether somebody who is reasonably well qualified&#x2014;not qualified&#x2014;will, under this provision, be allowed to be admitted to the Bar? The same question may be asked about solicitors, or about any other professional organisation. The earlier part of the subsection is drawn so widely that one is virtually denied the right to choose the members of one's trade union. There are enormous practical implications here, not only for organisations such as Equity, mining organisations, fire officers, safety officers, and so on, but many others, of which no doubt my hon. Friends will give examples.<br/>
The other point to note is that in order to get a State licence a trade union runs the risk of investigation by the Registrar


under Clause 79 if it has acted in contravention of the principles set out in the Bill. The point here is that there is a vague concept of principles, and it is important to note that the Clause does not say that the union can be investigated for a breach of its rules, a concept which I could not accept anyway, but merely that if a trade union has broken what, in the Government's view, is a broad concept, and has not spelled out in detail, as most Statutes would do, what it has done, it will be subject to investigation, and again I can find no precedent for such a provision.<br/>
4.15 p.m.<br/>
Clause 64 is the most objectionable Clause of all. Under it, in order to get its State licence, a union must comply with requirements imposed by the Registrar. There is no qualification of the Clause, and my view is that one has to read its provisions in the light of Clause I, and this is where it begins to assume significance. Clause 1 says that trade unions have to be responsible. "Responsible" is a subjective word, and therefore I take it, from the conditions which will be attached to the licence granted to a trade union, that one could get the situation that the Registrar will use political tests, based on the vague concepts in Clause 1, to decide whether a trade union will be registered or not. This really smacks of such a wide discretion as to affront any reasonable lawyer, and it smacks of the wide discretion which is common in countries which do not know democracy.</p>

<p>I now come to deal with Amendment No. 768. A federation cannot apply for registration as a trade union unless all its constituent members are also registered trade unions. This means that the Government are putting federations through the hoop because, under the terms of the Clause as it stands, the T.U.C. cannot become a registered trade

union unless all its constituent members also become trade unions, and the same applies to other federations of trade unions. The result of this provision will be to drive a divide in federations of organisations. The result will be to drive a divide in the T.U.C., which will then be faced with doing one of two things. It will either have to expel the affiliated organisations if it wants to get registration&#x2014;because all its constituent members have to be trade unions before it can become a trade union for the purpose of the Bill&#x2014;or face the possibility of not being a trade union. In that event, it will be possible for the T.U.C. to be sued for damages for aiding and abetting a strike in breach of contract.<br/>
That is the Government's recipe for better industrial relations. They propose to drive a wedge in the T.U.C. by making it difficult for it to carry on as the kind of organisation that it is now. The Government propose to drive wedges through federations of trade union organisations and then to expose the T.U.C., if necessary, to actions for damages. This is another hoop through which any organisation will have to jump in order to get its State licence. This concept of a State licence is an assault upon the right of association such as one knows it in most democratic countries.<br/>
As I said last night, no such provision exists for companies.</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not want to mislead the Committee. He will be aware that if he or I sought to register a new company, or even if we applied for a name for it, the Registrar would want to be sure that the composition of the board of the proposed company was of such standing as to merit use of such a name, particularly if it was a territorial name which gave the public the impression that it was a company of some substance. There are all sorts of requirements of that nature in company legislation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.542.1" hansard_membership_id="4631" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30154" speakername="Mr. Fraser" colnum="542" time="">
<p>As I pointed out to the hon. Gentleman last night, the company does not have to register. It can continue as a partnership and does not have to go through the hoop at all. The law which applies to a partnership in relation to third parties and the law relating to a company and its relationships with third parties, on the sort of issues with which we are dealing, industrial contracts, the


law of tort and so on, will be basically the same. The second mistake which the hon. Gentleman makes is that he equates the duties and the responsibilities thrust upon a number of people who, let us say, work in a sweat shop, who want to get a decent standard of living, with a company that wants to register with a capital of &#x00A3;1 million in order to trade all over the world. There is an imbalance of power between many working class people and the holders of power and wealth.<br/>
The sort of rules laid down here do not apply to companies, otherwise the Solicitor-General would be saying that no company would be able to issue non-voting shares. Since the company is on one side of the bargain and the trade union is on the other side, why is it that the shareholders, the people who contribute to the wealth and prosperity of the country, should be denied even a vote for the choice of their board of managing directors. There is no equation between the two, first, because the power is not equal, second, because some of the principles of these rules go much further than those applying to any other association, and third, in all other spheres of activity people have the right to choose between becoming registered and not becoming registered. The whole purpose of the Bill is to force trade unions into registration.<br/>
Last night we had an inkling of the reason for requiring registration and compliance with the principles, directives and broad discretion set out in the Bill. It was that if the trade unions want certain privileges they have to undertake the requirements of registration. What an insult to the trade union movement. Do the Government believe that the T.U.C. exercises unreasonable privileges in the way in which it tries to work in the fostering of our economy? What about trade union leaders' contributions on economic development committees and the time that they voluntarily give for the good of the country? Do they think that that is a privilege? It is not. These services are willingly given for the benefit and prosperity of the country. Do the Government think that the unofficial duties undertaken by trade union officials outside their organisations are privileges for which they have to suffer penalties

under the Bill? That is an insult to the trade union movement.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well that we do not have a problem of abuse of privilege by the trade union movement, and that it acts responsibly and enters into responsible bargains. In its thinking is very often way ahead of employers and certainly of this Government. To say that up to now they have enjoyed privileges as a result of which they must now be subjected to registration is an insult to many millions of people belonging to the movement.<br/>
The Government force them into this because they say, "If you do not register you will be liable for damages, and for many activities which you undertake at present for your members you will risk prosecution in the courts. If you do not register you will not be able to claim the legal right of recognition. If you do not register, you will be deprived of many of the rights and customs which you have been able to enjoy up to the present time." Therefore, the hon. Gentleman is forcing them into his registration and his kind of registration.<br/>
Many unions may choose not to register. Many people may choose to exercise their right of association, as an organisation of workers, in a way in which they think fit. There is no evidence that unions are undemocratic. Broadly speaking, their rules are good ones, and better than those of other organisations. But the Government are forcing them either to register&#x2014;which some will find difficult&#x2014;or not to register. If they do not, they will be subject to damages. What they are trying to tell the Committee and the country is that somehow this legal claptrap will improve industrial relations, and that somehow they will be improved if the T.U.C. is laid open to actions for damages. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that applications to the High Court by the Registrar to deregister a union because it does not come up to the terms of his requirements, which are broad and vague in the Bill, will improve industrial relations, he is making a very severe mistake. This is an assault on the right of association. It is an insult to the trade union movement. Our Amendments should be accepted and it ought to be dropped.</p>

<p>The parallel with the registration of companies which the hon. Member for Norwood drew is not a bad one. He, however, equated companies with partnerships. But the privilege which the company gets from registration, as opposed to the partnership, is the great privilege of limited liability. It is an enormous privilege. The privilege&#x2014;again using the word in its legal sense&#x2014;which the registered trade union will get is in a sense a greater privilege, because its liability would not merely be limited but would be nil. Therefore, there is a parallel between the requirement of registration of a company and of a trade union, in principle though not in detail. It is a parallel in principle in favour of the registered trade union, because its liability will be nothing, whereas the liability of the company in actions in the court is limited to the amount of its paid up capital, or capital whether paid up or not. Whether it be right or wrong socially, that is the legal reason for calling the position "privilege".<br/>
We are dealing with the new Registrar, who is certainly a very different and much more powerful animal than the old Registrar of Friendly Societies. The Registrar of Friendly Societies, who has hitherto dealt with these matters, has had no compulsory powers, although about 80 per cent. of trade unions find it convenient to register. and his task has been chiefly one of examining the internal finances of trade unions and seeing that the right annual returns are made. Fortunately, in this country here have been no great financial scandals about trade unions, as there have been, for example, in the United States. Therefore, his functions have been out of the public glare altogether. No very great change is suggested

in that regard under the new Registrar. But the new Registrar now takes on a very much greater importance. He has to pass the rules, not those merely connected with the making of reports relating to the property and income of a trade union, but those set out on page 175 of the Donovan Report, concerning who shall be qualified for admission, who shall decide who is qualified for admission, what right of appeal someone not admitted shall have, questions of discipline, questions of election, and, according to Schedule 3 of the Bill, questions of expulsion. It is on that last note that I would like to hear what my hon. and learned Friend has in mind for what some hon. Members may regard as a bee in my bonnet, and that is the question of expulsion from a union which is operating an agency shop.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
There is nothing in Schedule 3 giving any such question of expulsion a special place. To take up some words used by the hon. Member for Norwood, I wonder whether the rather vague words in Clause 64(4)<i>(b)</i> have any connection with what I am now discussing. When the rules are submitted to the Registrar,
<q>If on any such application the registrar is satisfied&#x2014;<i>(a)</i> that the body making the application is an organisation of workers and that it is eligible for registration as a trade union, and <i>(b)</i> that the requirements of subsection (3) of this section &#x2026;</q>
and then follow the very vague words,
<q>&#x2026; and any other requirements imposed by the registrar as a condition of registration, have been complied with &#x2026;</q>
That can scarcely be construed <i>ejusdem generis</i>. It is extremely wide, and I wonder whether that is to be the way in which, where an agency shop is operated, the registrar will require rather better provisions as to appeal from expulsion than are normally provided and are suggested in Schedule 3.<br/>
If that is one of the "other requirements" that are envisaged, it will have my support. But I agree with the hon. Member for Norwood that we want to know what sorts of "other requirements" the Registrar is likely to demand. It is a very large discretion. It is true that there is an appeal from the Registrar's discretion to the Industrial Court under Clause 72(3). In other words, there is some safeguard against a Registrar taking


too rigid a view. But I assume that courts are not likely to interfere with the Registrar's decision except where he has not exercised it judicially, and that he remains a powerful person with a wide discretion in the way that I have suggested.<br/>
It may be that my hon. and learned Friend can meet some of the hon. Gentleman's fears by indicating, preferably with examples, how he envisages the other requirements that the Registrar might see fit to impose as a condition of registration. I am not against giving the Registrar these powers, if they are properly defined or at least indicated. It is right, for example, that in Clause 77 someone who has been expelled from a trade union may ask the registrar to investigate the circumstances. That seems to be a very proper power. Again, I assume that there is an appeal to the Industrial Court against the Registrar's decision. However, we should be clear that we are setting up machinery which is very novel and powerful and which I regard as necessary if the paragraphs of the Donovan Report dealing with trade union rules are to have any reality. Without the interposition of a powerful agency such as that of the registrar, all the rest will be so much beating the air.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. John Fraser) has drawn attention to the difficulty, which has been recognised even by some hon. Members opposite, about the meaning of "reasonably well qualified", and that is illustrative of the problems which will face trade unions as a result of this Clause.<br/>
The difficulty of forcing the independent trade union movement, with its extraordinarily wide variety of procedures, into a sort of straitjacket is known to all hon. Members on this side of the Committee, and it is beginning to be known by some hon. Members opposite. To be fair, it was already known to those of them who had some personal experience of the industrial world. Certainly it was known to some employers who are not in this House, because a number of them have taken the trouble to tell hon. Members on both sides about the problems that they will face as a result of trying to force the complex whole into a simple pattern.<br/>
The situation facing Equity in this connection is extraordinarily difficult. I do not suggest that it is unique, because it is similar to that which faces other unions. However, Equity is a useful example to take in order to illustrate the problems which will be faced.<br/>
Here is a trade union in which the reasonable qualification for entering is the possession of a contract. No one who has failed to persuade an employer that he is sufficiently well qualified to be given a job can enter the union. Right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite may cry, "Closed shop". However, it is an open or union shop. It is not a closed shop. In the sense that we are discussing this series of Amendments, the possession of a job is all important. The union says that, if anyone can persuade an employer to give him a job, he will be accepted into membership. The job is his qualification. So we are not even discussing a pre-entry closed shop. The union says that the job is the qualification for membership. That is the "reasonably well qualified" operation in this respect.<br/>
It is written into every contract of employment that directly or indirectly the means of identifying the performer's qualification is that he shall remain a member of the union. That brings us immediately to the next subsection, which claims the right for a person to resign from a union. In Equity if anyone exercises that right, he breaks his contract. The contract provides directly or indirectly that he shall remain a member of the union.<br/>
If that provision were put into effect, every single contract in films, television and the stage, would become invalid overnight. This provision goes to the root of the contract. It cannot be broken and still leave the contract in existence. In the event of this provision being put on the Statute Book, every contract in the entertainment industry will become renegotiable overnight.<br/>
It may be said that the situation arises because of the very nature of the business but that it does not go to the heart of the industrial welfare of the country. I have been a member of five unions in my lifetime and never a member at any one time of fewer than two. I am at the moment a member of the A.S.T.M.S.


which was referred to the other day as Mr. Clive Jenkins' union. That is an example of a union which is becoming, almost the trade union equivalent of the conglomerates into which industrial organisations are moving.<br/>
If hon. Members want the trade union movement to modernise itself, to match itself to developments in industry, we will have amalgamations and some sections of members of the same union being placed in an entirely different position from other members. These are all expected to be subject to the same rules which this section seeks to force into a set, ordered pattern.<br/>
We on this side face an impossibility. Nothing which we can do to amend this part of the Bill can make any sense of it. Nothing can make it operate in a fashion which will be to the interests of the employing organisations, let alone the unions. The only thing which we can do is to try to remove some of the more absurd anomalies.<br/>
Later, I shall explain this in greater detail, on a specific Amendment relating to Clause 61(3), which provides that every member of a union shall have the right to terminate his membership&#x2014;at anytime. This is entirely intolerable and unreasonable in some spheres. We cannot have a situation in which, at the drop of a hat, perhaps in the middle of a dispute, a member may say, "I think that I will resign; I will walk out of this situation. It does not apply to me, it is all right for you Jack". This is to apply "at any time".<br/>
What a situation for the trade union movement. What a situation of chaos for the employers. This series of Amendments does something to mitigate these harmful results. All we can do is make it a little less bad: there is nothing that we can do to make it a good Bill.</p>

<p>I do not complain that both hon. Members opposite who have spoken should feel concerned about the details of the system of registration embodied in this part of the Bill. Indeed, they would feel that they were neglecting their duty if they did not scrutinise such provisions with great care. Nevertheless, the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. John Fraser)&#x2014;I hope that he will forgive me if I simplify his argument&#x2014;asked whether trade unions, as they have existed for the past 60 years, will continue to exist.<br/>
I believe that they will continue to exist broadly as they have in the past, but they will be assuming an even larger r&#x00f4;le. In many cases, in the past, their limitations&#x2014;if such they may be described&#x2014;have sometimes been due not to excessive power or excessive claims or privileges but sometimes to lack of power and lack of means. In this Bill&#x2014;this Clause is only part of the change&#x2014;certain additional powers will be given to most of the unions which choose to register.<br/>
The hon. Member then complained that if a particular union chose not to register, it would suffer some penalty or disability. I quarrel with that statement. Those unions which choose to adopt a new system of registration will enjoy enhanced powers or privileges. To that extent, those which do not register, in comparing their new situations with those which do, might be tempted to say that they are suffering in comparison, but it is not accurate to say that new penalties will be imposed upon them.</p>

<p>May I give one example? If a trade union has entered into a legally binding collective agreement under the law as it is at the moment, and then does not or cannot register, all sorts of penalties and liabilities will attach to its officials in respect of the contract made before the passing of the Bill, if it becomes law, which would not have attracted to it when the contract was first made. That is why I said that penalties will attach to trade unions which either cannot register or do not choose to register.</p>

<p>I still say that these are not penalties, as described by the hon. Member. If any Government, this Government or any other, once decided that a system of registration should be introduced&#x2014;this has been decided upon as one of the bases of this legislation&#x2014;it would be a strange registration if all the unions, whether they registered or not, were in exactly the same position afterwards. In other words, it would be an astonishing kind of registration if a union which did not register was in exactly the same position, in every respect, as one which did. The registration


system could then be said to be worthless. I hope that no one would expect any legislative assembly to introduce a worthless system of registration.</p>

<p>But does not the hon. Gentleman realise that the supporters of registration and of this part of the Bill cannot simply claim that there is bound to be a change if one adopts this change? They must prove, with good, sound, positive reasons, why it is necessary and what it will be useful for.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.551.1" hansard_membership_id="5017" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11544" speakername="Mr. Gower" colnum="551" time="">
<p>All that has been argued at great length, at other times and in other places, and it would be out of order at this stage for me to deploy the full argument for this system. We are here arguing the merits of this kind of registration. I agree with the hon. Member, as I think did my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) that some of the words deserve further examination. An example is the words in Clause 64(4),
<q>&#x2026; and any other requirements imposed by the registrar as a condition of registration &#x2026;</q>
I should like to see those words taken from the Bill and something more precise substituted. This could also apply to the words quoted by the hon. Member for Norwood, in subsection (2):
<q>Any such application shall be made in such form and manner as the registrar may require.</q>
I would favour some more precise definition there. If my hon. and learned Friend can evolve some more accurate wording, that would be an advantage.<br/>
The system of registration which we will have can have some value&#x2014;indeed, it would be senseless to introduce it otherwise&#x2014;only if it places a registered union in a position different from that of an unregistered union.<br/>
Both hon. Members oposite who have spoken queried suggestions&#x2014;by whom, I do not know&#x2014;that the T.U.C. had in the past usurped some unreasonable privileges. Those suggestions have not come from this side. The so-called privileges or powers of the T.U.C. have been merely those which individual unions have been prepared to grant that body, and in that sense it may be said that there is nothing in the Bill to interfere with the privileges or the powers

which unions may be prepared to give to the T.U.C. There is nothing in the Bill to diminish those privileges or powers. There is nothing in this system of registration, because as I understand it registered or unregistered unions could be members of the T.U.C. in future. They certainly could be members of a common Congress upon which they could confer rights and powers.<br/>
The hon. Member for Norwood said that this was legal claptrap and that it will not improve industrial relations. We are not seeking to improve industrial relations solely by legal terminology. There cannot be an accurate system of registration without legal terminology. It would be unreasonable to suggest that there should not be detailed requirements. Many of the requirements specified in the ensuing subsections are for the benefit of individual trade unionists. They are not designed for the benefit of anybody else. They are designed to ensure that registration shall be efficient and effective and a detailed system of registration requires, not legal claptrap, but detailed legal language of this kind.</p>

<p>To the extent that the hon. Gentleman arguing that everything in the requirement to register is to the advantage of trade unions he is, by his own reasoning, conceding that failure to register imposes a comparable disadvantage on trade unions. The whole question therefore is: should trade unions register? Does the hon. Gentleman realise that one of the first things that Hitler did was to transfer the trade unions over to State authority? That theme runs throughout all authoritarian countries.</p>

<p>I have suffered or enjoyed this dual personality for many years. In fact, the friends "Norman Orme" and "Stanley Atkinson" have been involved in A.E.U. schools and struggles for 25 years. For 20 of those years "Norman Orme" and I have been debating and discussing in various schools similar Bills to this and some of the provisions which we are now discussing. I see one or two members on this side of the Committee who have been involved in exactly the same discussion for about 15 years. We all seem to be a kind of rent-a-crowd, discussing exactly the same issues.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Dar-wen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) and six of his colleagues on that side were at one time leading members of the Labour Party and they signed a constitution which was to the exact opposite effect of what is implied in Schedule 3. The passage of time has taken the hon. and learned Gentleman and six of his colleagues, including one member of the Government, out of that commitment and they are now arguing exactly the opposite; they are now arguing for the annihilation of the Labour Party/trade union arrangement.<br/>

<p>I have much to say and I want to deal with some fundamental

principles. We have in the House of Commons the equivalent of the "Guinness Book of Records". My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham. North (Mr. Arthur Lewis) will find spelled out in that book the political history&#x2014;"Zoology" is perhaps a better word&#x2014;of hon. Members. My hon. Friend will find set out there what has happened over the years to certain hon. Members opposite, including one or two of the younger members of the Government.<br/>
I want to take up the hon. and learned Gentleman's description of these matters as "novel aspects". The Solicitor-General has also used the word "novel". Novel they may be, but they are totally unacceptable. It is because of this Clause that trade unions will decide not to register.<br/>
Another facet of the argument against the Bill is that the Prime Minister, the Minister of State for Employment, the Solicitor-General and the Under-Secretary of State for Employment who is now on the Front Bench, do not understand industrial relations and are not familiar with industrial practice.<br/>
That may be true, but it is not the point. We would mislead people if we sought to convey the impression that the Bill has not been compiled with a great deal of knowledge behind it. It has. Those who have been associated with the design and the construction of the Bill have had tremendous experience as employers' representatives, either legal or otherwise; and, as a result of their many years of experience, they have come to certain conclusions and therefore they have spelled out with great accuracy in the Bill the best way of clobbering the shop stewards' movement. This Clause taken in conjunction with Schedule 3 is intended to do that.<br/>
A trade union that does not register will be vulnerable in the courts because of the repeal of the 1906 Act. Non-registration dramatically affects the finances of trade unions. The A.U.E.W. and the Transport and General Workers' Union are faced with a tax problem if they decide to contract out of registration. In the case of the Transport and General Workers' Union, it is estimated that it would have to pay an additional annual sum of up to &#x00A3;750,000. In the case of the A.U.E.W., the accountants estimate that we should have to pay about &#x00A3;600,000 in tax equivalent if we were


non-registered, and assuming that we were no longer able as an organisation to register with the Registrar of Friendly Societies.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
Plainly, a great deal of money is involved for our funds. The Government know that. They know what they are doing when they talk about the consequences of non-registration. They will apply right across the board, and particularly to those unions which have property and superannuation funds; they will become extremely vulnerable. We are, therefore, well conscious of the consequences of non-registration, and especially the financial consequences.<br/>
It is not a question of whether one registers or not. Under the Bill as it stands, every trade union will be automatically registered. In fact, there is continuity between the existing Register of Friendly Societies and the register under the Bill. Therefore, every trade union must decide whether to contract out of its registration after three months. The point of the period of three months is that this offers the only practical way of rewriting the rule book of every union. One can do it no other way if one wishes effectively to rewrite the rule books of the trade union movement. That is what we are now discussing, and that is why I refer to the intentions of employers' representatives when they have tried to devise a method of effectively rewriting the rule books and bringing them into line with the legally enforceable procedures which one finds spelled out throughout the Bill.<br/>
This is an absolute "must". If the Government wish to achieve the objective which they have spelled out, there must be agreement between the requirements of union rule books and the procedures enforceable either by the C.I.R. or by the National Industrial Relations Court. There must be agreement at all levels on these aspects of functions which stem from the Bill.<br/>
The difficulty in the rewriting of the rule books lies in the complication of the law. This is why the Bill has 150 Clauses and all these Schedules. It is a most complicated operation. There are five hon. Members here who, back in 1957, together listened to a discussion

about how complicated was the process of bringing the law or legally enforceable procedures in industrial relations and union rule books into line. We were never in favour of doing it, but we listened to the arguments advanced by all sorts of employers' representatives and academic groups who were talking about the possibility of doing it.<br/>
It has always been recognised that it would be a most complicated business, and, in that sense, I am surprised at the brevity of the Bill. One might almost describe the Bill as like an Agatha Christie novel in its length and complication, with the murder of a shop steward in every Clause. It reads with a continuity and mystery of that kind, and the complication and mystery come from the complexities in trying to alter union rule books.<br/>
I shall illustrate my argument by reference to what happens at present in manufacturing industry, referring for this purpose to what we often call in engineering the pyramid agreement. As I am anxious to quote directly from the opening passage of that notable employer-trade union agreement, the York Agreement, perhaps my right hon. Friend the Member for Newton (Mr. Frederick Lee) will be kind enough to find the passage for me. It is directly germane to what we are discussing in considering whether it is possible for some unions to register and alter their rule books.</p>

<p>In the natural break while that quotation is being found, perhaps the hon. Gentleman will be kind to say a little more about the financial penalties to which he refers. I take it that they are not the penalties referred to in "In Place of Strife" which would operate if a union did not register. I assume that the hon. Gentleman is talking of other financial penalties. They are not mentioned in the T.U.C. document "Reason" as one of the arguments against the registration proposals. What are they?</p>

<p>I was pointing out that there would be a cost to the trade unions for not registering. This has not been discussed so by the T.U.C. but it has been discussed in each individual union. The unions have to make up their minds how vulnerable they are and how exposed


their funds will be. They have to try to devise a watertight method of transferring their property, strike fund and various other moneys out of the union as we now know it, salting them away, as it were, so that they are not vulnerable to any decision which a court may subsequently take against them.<br/>
In other words, the unions have to try to protect themselves against the consequences of non-registration. That process is going on. Every union is employing lawyers and other advisers to devise a method of protection. At present, a trade union which is registered as a friendly society has certain tax concession. If it is not registered as a friendly society or the equivalent, a union has to pay full tax on certain funds. I have already said that for the T. &amp; G.W.U. it is estimated that the additional cost will be up to &#x00A3;750,000 a year. The sum I gave for the A.U.E.W. may be more now because the draughtsmen are included in the amalgamation.</p>

Also, we contributed &#x00A3;47,000 so that retired miners could receive the coal which the Coal board would not give them. All these and other amounts are calculated in such a way&#x2014;</p>

<p>Certainly. One would expect the Solicitor-General to wish to assure the Committee that the Register of Friendly Societies will continue as we know it at the moment so that there will be no such vulnerability. I take it that the hon. and learned Gentleman has gone into the matter in some detail and has a ready answer. Will the Register of Friendly Societies continue? Will a non-registered union be protected as it is at present? I have given notice of that question to the Solicitor-General, so perhaps

he will give an answer during the debate. I am not getting much response now, am I? I know that he understands the problem because many of his officials have looked at it and advised people about it.</p>

<p>Subsection <i>(a)</i> of the preamble says:
<q>The employers have the right to manage their establishments and the trade unions have the right to exercise their functions.</q>
That is a very simple statement. It is a right that the employers are not prepared to forgo, which is why we cannot make any progress in renegotiating that agreement, and why other manufacturing industries cannot come to an agreement about procedures. It is the reason why it is not possible to see a solution to the problem in terms of the law. It is the reason why trade unions are not prepared to submit their rule books to any registrar to have them rewritten by the State, to have a rule book which concedes that point at the very beginning.<br/>
Why is this so important? Why do the employers insist on it, and why have they resisted pressure by trade unions to change it for 48 years? The employers have resisted change in that simple statement in procedural agreements in other industries for more than 50 years, since 1918. I refer to the managerial right, or the right of a person owning property. Under what is called the pyramid agreement in every industry, if a management representative comes into the mill, shop or whatever it is, wanting to change a practice or introduce a new one, the workers' representative, whether he is called a steward or something else, must go through a procedure if a controversy arises. The procedure differs according to whether the dispute is in a mine, factory, mill or something else, but it is roughly called a pyramid arrangement.<br/>
The employer has a right to take a unilateral decision to alter the material, sequence of operations, kind of person employed, machinery and so on. If that decision is contested, the shop steward must tell the foreman that he disagrees. If there is failure to agree between those


two, the steward goes to the senior foreman or the assistant manager. If there is again failure to agree, they must then bring in the convener or a works committee to discuss the matter with the works manager. It may go to the board, where the employer's representative and the trade union representatives get round the table and have a local conference. If failure to agree continues the dispute goes to York or to other places in the country where employers and trade unions come together at a national level. That is the sort of pyramid arrangement written into most agreements throughout manufacturing.<br/>
The point is that throughout industry people cut corners. When the employer's representative decides to introduce a new method with which the stewards disagree the stewards usually take a shopfloor decision to stop the job, and a dispute exists. The employers have always worried about this. This is what all the discussion is about. It is what the Bill is about&#x2014;how to stop that happening, to disarm the shop steward at the point where he meets the employer. No trade union has ever been able or willing to write into its rule books that the shop steward should be disarmed at the point where he meets the employer. There is no rule book in British trade unionism which says that a steward must go through a certain procedure. That may seem unbelivable, but it is absolutely true.<br/>
The A.E.U., which is typical of many industrial unions, has resisted pressures to change its rule book to take away from the shop steward the "unofficial" right to stop the job. It has signed many agreements, including the York Agreement in 1922. Every major trade union has an agreement with the employers spelling out in detail a procedure that the shop steward and the works committee must follow. But none of it is in a rule book. We have never yet had an industrial agreement written into a trade union rule book.</p>

<p>After those mutual apologies&#x2014;and I have a very great respect for you, Mr. Jennings&#x2014;I want to return to the point I was making to my hon. Friend. Will he put in a piece of history? The year 1922 was crucial. It was the year in which the million members of our trade unions were reduced to about 250,000 by unemployment, and we suffered one of the worst lock-outs in history. The conditions then were inflicted on us by the arrogant lash of necessity.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to my right hon. Friend, who is an eminent historian of working-class history. It is important for a comment like that to be recorded in this context. These points are closely related.<br/>
I should like to deal very briefly with what now faces the trade unions on the matter of procedure and the submission of rule books to be rewritten. The whole question of what the shop steward does in the event of disagreement is very important in industry. The A.E.U. has a rule dealing with the function of shop stewards. As far as I can check, this applies to seven other major trade unions. Oddly enough, in some cases it is rule 13.<br/>
When a trade union definies the function of a shop steward in its rule book it never attempts to write into the rules the agreements between employers and trade unions. They are left out deliberately. To have a legally-enforced system of industrial relations it is necessary to ensure that the rule books do not conflict


with the decisions of either the C.I.R. or the N.I.R.C. Therefore, it becomes obligatory under the Bill for trade unions to submit their rule books to a Registrar, whose job it will be to vet them and rewrite them in accordance with what the Registrar expects will be the decisions of the C.I.R.</p>

<p>Why has the hon. Gentleman any reason to believe that the matter will not be varied the other way round, that the C.I.R. will not take into account the rules of the trade union?</p>

<p>A quasi-judicial body or other representative of the State has never overthrown what the employers consider to be a fundamental principle, nor can I envisage this being done. If this were not so we need not worry about the political movements but could depend on the judges carrying out a revolution, shifting the power from capital to labour. We could revolutionise the country via the courts if what the hon. Gentleman suggests is possible or feasible, but the situation is totally different. I do not believe that a revolutionary situation exists in the courts. Therefore, it is fair to assume that, whatever controversy relative to the procedure is involved, whenever a case is referred to the C.I.R. or the court, those quasi-judicial bodies will confirm that section which I have read from the York Agreement.<br/>
This is the whole point about registration. It is why no trade union in these circumstances could submit its rule book to a registrar in order to have him rewrite the rules so that the shop stewards movement is obliged, by the rules of its own movement, to conform with local enforceable procedural agreements which might be suggested by the C.I.R. or some other part of this whole structure of changing industrial relations. It is a fundamental question and this proposal will be resisted with everything we have in the trade union movement. This is what the issue is about and I hope that, as a result of this debate, the Government will get

away from the principle of demanding that a condition for free trade unions to continue must be that they submit their rule books to a Registrar so that the State can rewrite them. That principle is totally unacceptable to the trade union movement.</p>

<p>I listened to the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson) with interest but mounting perplexity. He says that this is the heart of the Bill. But he has the whole clause wrong. It is a case of the chicken and the egg. He argued that the chicken comes first. The egg comes first, obviously. The whole point is that one starts with the trade union's rules and that the C.I.R. examines the agreement subsequently and will have to take account of what those rules are. I am sure that my hon. and learned Friend will confirm that that is the right way round. The whole basis of the hon. Gentleman's opposition to the Bill is on a false foundation.<br/>
I have one small perplexing question to put to my hon. and learned Friend. Why is Schedule 3 separate from Clause 61? Why does one have to look at Clause 61 for part of the required trade union rules and at Schedule 3 for the balance? Why should they not all be in one place in the Bill, which would make it so much simpler for mortals to understand? Someone has said that trade union rule books are more confusing than the law. There was a lot of wisdom in that remark. [HON. MEMBERS: "Who said it?"] The right hon. Member for Southwark (Mr. Gunter), who was Minister of Labour in the last Government. In the Standing Committee considering the Trade Disputes Act, 1965, he said:
<q>&#x2026; I can tell him that I find trade union rule books more confusing than the law sometimes."&#x2014;[OFFICAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A.</i> 25th March, 1965; c. 120.]</q>
So we have good authority for noting that some trade union rule books are a little confusing. I have been looking at the rule book of the National Union of Printing, Bookbinding and Paperworkers and it demonstrates to the Committee one of the needs for this part of the Bill. Under Rule 27, a member is liable
<q>&#x2026; to exclusion from the Union, a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;20, or a warning, as the Branch Committee may determine:</q>
<q><i>(a)</i> If having insulted any officer or member, or otherwise abused them"&#x2014;</q>


they are very sensitive officers, not to mention gentlemen&#x2014;
<q>either at meetings of the Union or elsewhere"&#x2014;</q>
in the pub having a drink afterwards&#x2014;
<q>by charging them with any act of injustice or improper conduct as to the discharge of their duties which they cannot prove.</q>
Fair enough. So this sensitive organisation finds that one of its officers has been insulted. What happens then? The following rule becomes operative&#x2014;that the member can appeal. But before he can appeal, if the appeal is against a fine,
<q>&#x2026; no member shall have the right to appeal without previously having paid the fine within 28 days.</q>
So having insulted these highly sensitive gentlemen&#x2014;these officers or members of the union&#x2014;the member is liable to a fine of &#x00A3;20 and has to pay it before he can make his appeal. [HON. MEMBERS: "It is arrears."] It is nothing to do with arrears. [HON. MEMBERS: "YOU know nothing about it."] I am quoting from the rule book. It is Rule 24. Hon. Members can see the book if they want to. That is what the rules say.</p>

<p>On a point of order. With great respect, Mr. Jennings, I am not sure that referring to a kangaroo court is not in order, because Parliament has certain forms of closure&#x2014;the guillotine and the kangaroo, which leaps from one Clause to another and back, which is what the debate is doing. It will all end with one vote at the end of the day. In the time of Mr. Speaker Brand and in the time of Mr. Speaker Peel it came to be a well-known device. On the other hand, I believe that the hon. Member is under an obligation in a debate fraught with so much emotion to define his terms. He does not know what a kangaroo is. Is he using it in a parliamentary sense?</p>

<p>The word "kangaroo" in the sense in which the right hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell) is using it is a procedural kangaroo. The word "kangaroo" as used by the hon.

I remind him of our debates on Clause 33 when I pointed out, without rebuttal from the Government, that that Clause made factory agreements legally binding in certain circumstances and Clause 34 would impose on shop stewards, or others who have entered into those agreements, a policing responsibility. In other words, the Bill and nothing else is compelling the introduction of precisely the kind of machinery which presumably the hon. Member is condemning.</p>

<p>I am condemning not the sort of activities to which the hon. Gentleman refers, but the secret trials without adequate rights of appeal which have occurred on a number of occasions. The example which I gave earlier was that of a man having to pay a fine of up to &#x00A3;20 before his appeal could be heard. That seems to be a breach of common justice.</p>

<p>If I can get through without another interruption, I shall do my best.<br/>
The T.U.C. spoke of the need for proper procedures to safeguard the rights of the individual, to give prior notice and

a fair hearing, and the Bill follows the same lines by laying down that there must be writ ten notice of the charges and a fair hearing. One sees a continuing similarity between the requirements of the T.U.C., which had no power to enforce them, and the requirements of the Bill.<br/>
I should like my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General to examine the Clause for what I believe to be a small defect. It does not provide for a right of appeal to a committee different and separate from the body which imposed the original disciplinary sentence. The best existing trade unions provide an appeal procedure by which the appeal is put to a committee other than that which imposed the original sentence, which is right and proper, but there are some 50 unions which do not have such a procedure and where the appeal is heard by the body which imposed the original sentence. That is not right, fair or just and the Pill should do something about it. I recommend my hon. and learned Friend to extend the requirements of a trade union's rules to ensure that they provide for a body to hear an appeal separate from that which imposed the original sentence.<br/>
The Bill seeks to raise the standards of the minority to embody in their rules the standards of the best.</p>

<p>After what he had said, if he cannot take a little bit back then he is a poor Parliamentarian and he will have to learn. I am not known for discourtesy, but the hon. Gentleman has shown some discourtesy towards the trade union movement and we are a little sick of it on this side of the Committee.<br/>
To return to the debate and this question of registration, as my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson) and my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. John Fraser) have said, this is a central issue of the Bill. It is through the form of registration, the right to impose rule changes and the framing of the rules required by the registrar that it will be possible to carry out the other punitive Clauses in the Bill. At the moment a trade union does not need a State licence to operate, because we are in a democratic situation.<br/>
There may be weaknesses within the trade union movement and no hon. Member on this side has tried to hide the fact that there are difficulties and problems. It is interesting that hon. Members opposite have had a great deal of difficulty in highlighting the real problems. They were challenged yesterday about demarcation and today about union rules but they have not come forward with what can be regarded as concrete objections. If the objections we have here are the main charges against trade unions then there is no need to introduce this Measure with this form of compulsory registration.</p>

<p>The hon. Member made a statement earlier about trade unions and disciplinary action and he has just made another which is just as irresponsible. He ought to learn, when we are talking about a matter affecting millions of people, to act in a reasonable manner and not like his hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke who throws innuendoes about the Committee.<br/>
Mr. Victor Feather has said in the foreword to the T.U.C. document "Reason" that the unions have never been above the law, have always worked within the law and that the law has conferred no privileges upon them nor have they sought such privileges. The trade union movement throughout its long history has grown with our democracy and is one of the bedrocks of that democracy. Now it is said that the trade union movement is so irresponsible that it must have rules which allow the C.I.R., whether quasi-judicial or otherwise, the industrial court, judges and lawyers to impose what they think ought to be the rules, disregarding the fact that trade union members act responsibly providing their own rules and democratic structure.<br/>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
As hon. Members know I am a member of one of the largest unions in the country, the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, with something like 1,200,000 members. That union had its beginnings in 1851, 20 years before the 1871 Act in which voluntary registration was allowed. Most unions today are registered under that Act, which imposes no restriction on a trade union and which works in a sensible manner. My trade union has, over a time, built up a measure of democracy which I would claim is second to none. This democracy is based on the rule book of the union, which I have here, which puts the power of the union in the hands of the membership.<br/>
Its officers are democratically elected by ballot; it has a national committee which makes policy through the rank and file members and, more important. if any member feels that he has any grievance


against the executive council or any full-time officer, he has a direct right of appeal from his branch, without being restricted by the executive council, to the final appeal court which comprises 11 rank and file members elected by the membership. The only full-time officer who attends that appeal court is the general secretary and he has no vote. That body elects its own chairman and sometimes meets for as much as two or three weeks a year to hear appeals on what are most simple matters but for the individual concerned most important matters. When the procedure has been exhausted no member of our union who has used it, who is fully paid up, can claim that he has not been dealt with justly or that he has been denied a right of appeal.<br/>
When we have established such a democratic procedure it is highly insulting to be told that we must be registered, our rules must be examined, changes may be imposed upon us, not by our membership but by a form of law which brings about a corporate mentality, a corporate State philosophy. One of my hon. Friends mentioned Germany in the 'thirties. This action more readily brings to mind Mussolini and the acts which took place in Italy. This brings about a corporate mentality which removes the true independence of the trade union. An independent trade union, not beyond the law, but operating within it, is a pillar of democracy.<br/>
The Solicitor-General is fathering a Bill which is an absolute disgrace. This is an anti-trade union Clause and it will be resisted by the trade union movement.</p>

<p>Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that the rules about appeals against disciplinary action within the union to which he has referred are an exemplary example to other unions and to the country of how these matters should be handled? But would he not equally agree that it is wrong that other unions should have standards which fall far below those which he has described?</p>

<p>I welcome the hon. Gentleman's point of view, but he has put the argument in a different way. We do not put ourselves forward as paragons of virtue. I have said that the trade unions are not perfect. The T.U.C. and its

recommendations have been quoted, but the point has been missed.<br/>
We say that this is a matter for the trade union movement and for voluntary application. Everything which the trade union movement does is done under the searchlight of the mass media. Things which need changing are being changed continually in the trade union movement. It is the right of the movement to examine itself. It co-operated in the Donovan Report. I was not in complete agreement with the Donovan proposals, but the recommendation about registration in Donovan was that there should be a registrar with two trade unionists appointed by the T.U.C. That is not the recommendation made by the Solicitor-General in this Bill.<br/>
After three years of searching inquiry, the recommendation in the Donovan Report, with one or two contradictions which were all recognised, was that the trade union movement was, and should remain, a voluntary movement. Mr. Victor Feather and the General Council of the T.U.C. are aware of their responsibilities. They want better agreements to be made and they want trade unions to have better rule books if they are necessary. But, in view of the amalgamations of trade unions which are taking place, one would be hard put to find many rule books which were not satisfactory from a democratic point of view. But the members have the right to change those rule books, as they have the right to change the officers of the union. Quite drastic changes in the rules and the leadership of trade unions have been made through the democratic method and process.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman knows my views on that matter, but it is interesting that the T.U.C. and the trade union movement were able to convince the Government that they were capable of carrying out any necessary reforms and reorganisation.<br/>
This debate on the question of licensing trade unions is fundamental to the


trade union movement. It is at the core of what the Solicitor-General and the Secretary of State are introducing. The challenge will be thrown down and the trade union movement will be faced with the harrowing choice of registering or not registering, with all the penalties which can be imposed for not registering. The decision of my union is that it is not prepared to co-operate. It does not believe that its rules and conduct are inferior to what is suggested in the Bill. It thinks the Bill insulting. It is opposed to it and will fight it. I hope that we shall return much sooner than some people think to sanity in industrial relations and that we shall tackle the problems which need to be tackled.</p>

<p>I hope that the Committee, and particularly hon. Members opposite, will understand that Members have conflicting duties and that it is only those duties which prevented me from being able to attend the debate from the beginning. I hope that it will not be thought discourteous of me that I was unable to be present in the Chamber for some time.<br/>
I hope that the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) will not take it amiss if I say that I have a great deal of personal sympathy with what he said. When I have listened to him and his hon. Friends on this subject, they have reminded me of nothing so much as some of my hon. Friends who have been aroused to equally sincere and deep passion on such matters as Rhodesia and others which went deep to the heart of their beliefs. I understand how the hon. Member for Salford, West feels. I do not think I misrepresent him when I say that to him the Bill and the provisions in it about the registration of trade unions are an outrage and an insult. They seem to him totally unnecessary and cast a reflection on institutions which are as dear and sacrosanct and as much above criticism to him as are the Brigade of Guards and other similar institutions in the hearts of some of my hon. Friends.<br/>
I ask hon. Members opposite&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I dare say the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. Concannon), who is waving his Guards' tie, will understand, because his sympathies are obviously widespread. He realises how deep loyalties go, and I hope that hon. Members opposite will not sneer at me or

deride what I am saying because, although I am not passionately attached to the loyalties of the hon. Member for Salford, West, I do know that they are sincere and that in debating the Bill we are, in a sense, beyond reason and beyond argument. I do not think that that is altogether dishonourable and undesirable.<br/>
However, I hope that it will not be thought quite intolerable by hon. Members opposite if I say with great respect that there is another point of view about this matter. It may be wrong and unfair, but&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It is the opinion of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer), who we all know feels very deeply about this matter, that the Bill is unfair and outrageous. There are other people, misguided though they may be in the hon. Gentleman's eyes, who welcome this legislation. I do not want to put the boot in, because possibly more than enough of that has been done from this side, but it is true that right hon. Gentlemen opposite were capable of entertaining this possibility, although later, as the hon. Member for Salford, West said, they were brought to think better of it. My right hon. and hon. Friends are not being brought to think better of it by the hon. Member for Salford, West.<br/>
It is one of the brutal realities of life that there comes a time when argument is over and one of two things has to supervene: either voting or shooting. We in this country have a prejudice in favour of voting. The voting on this issue is not only the voting that will take place in Committee and in the House on this Bill. The voting that determines the issues in the Bill took place when the entire electorate had an opportunity of making its opinion known.<br/>
There is a vast swathe of the electorate, with whom hon. Members opposite do not seem to be in sympathy, who greatly welcome the Bill. They do not think it an outrage. They feel that these provisions are right.</p>

<p>Of course. The hon.

<p>Life is difficult for hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber, but is the hon. Member aware that a salient feature of the present Bill was not put before the electorate&#x2014;and that is the question of the imposition of agreements although both sides did not want them?</p>

<p>That is an arguable matter. I think that it would not be in order to argue that issue of enforceability of agreements on this Amendment. We are at the moment talking about registration which as the hon. Member for Salford, West said, is central to the Bill. He and I agree on that. We disagree whether it is right or fair and whether it is desirable.<br/>
My view that it is right and fair is not new-found. I moved a Motion for leave to introduce into the House on 31st July, 1957 a Bill which was almost exactly the same as this Section of this Bill, namely to the effect that the rights of trade unions should be dependent upon registration and that registration should be dependent upon unions' rules conforming to certain standards. I was refused leave by the House to introduce that Bill. I was subsequently told by one of my right hon. Friends who was then Patronage Secretary that my initiative was extremely ill-conceived and unwelcome. The then Patronage Secretary is the present Prime Minister.<br/>
I subsequently moved to introduce a Bill in similar terms some years later. I was then told by the then Minister of Labour in the Conservative Government that that was an ill-conceived move and that he would have no part in it. The Minister of Labour at that time is the present Prime
Minister. Therefore,

whether I am right or wrong, and whether my right hon. Friend is right now in having been converted to my view, I cannot be charged that I have not been sincere in supporting the substance of this portion of the Bill, for I have manifestly done so for a very long time.<br/>
I represent a constituency of people who would describe themselves as ordinary members of the public who, by and large, are not members of trade unions. They are people who mostly work in service industries and in the City of London. They are the people one finds on the Central Line any afternoon. Probably now at this time they are coming towards the end of their journeys home.</p>

<p>Perhaps I could make some rather uncharitable remarks on that score if I had a mind to, but I should be out of order. My argument was directed to the fact that the Clause as it stands would command the confidence of people who elected the Conservative Government to pass this legislation. The Amendment should not be accepted because the Clause conforms with the general wishes of the electorate as a whole.<br/>
The hon. Member for Salford, West may find what I am about to say offensive, and I can understand why he thinks on those lines, but he should accept this as a valid point. Those people think that whether trade unions have, as I believe, rights, privileges and benefits in their situation, trade unions undoubtedly have substantial and real social economic and political power. I believe that those people are right in believing that, and I do not believe that hon. Members opposite would deny it or say that it was undesirable.<br/>
Moving from the idea in people's minds that a considerable degree of power should be balanced by a considerable degree of responsibility, those people see


nothing objectionable in the people responsible having a statutory basis for the exercise of their responsibilities in the sense that their power shall be regulated by regulations made by registrars with whom they must register if they are to exercise that power. That is the philosophical and logical basis of this part of the Bill, which has substantial public support. The hon. Member for Salford, West need not feel that the dignity or authority of his union or of any other union would be in any way impugned if the way in which it conducts its affairs, now voluntarily, were backed by legislation such as this. I do not see why hon. Gentlemen should think it so outrageous. Why should not trade unions register according to certain guiding principles for organisations of workers such as are set out in Clause 61, to which we shall be coming&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I did not hear that.

<p>I was hoping that the hon. Member for Walton would answer the question to which we on this side find no answer at all. What is so wrong with these principles, in accordance with which trade unions should be required to register? Hon. Members opposite boast, proudly, and quite rightly, that unions in the main conduct their affairs in accordance with these principles. Nobody has said why they should not register if they conduct their affairs in accordance with these principles.</p>

<p>&#x2014;why the Opposition opposed the Government's policy of registration, and he clearly put forward the trade unions objections to it. The hon.

<p>I know that had I been in the least out of order you, Sir Robert, would have assisted me to return to it.<br/>
My argument is that these Amendments should be resisted because they are against the principle of registration of unions, which is necessary in my view if they are to have public confidence as conducting their affairs in the way in which they should conduct them, if they are to exercise the power which greatly affects the lives of ordinary people. I remain entirely unconvinced by everything which I have heard, especially from the hon. Member for Salford, West, who seemed to be putting forward substantial arguments in favour of the Bill as it stands. The hon. Gentleman said that trade unions organise themselves in a proper manner without the assistance of the law and that it is in some way insulting that those who do not so organise themselves should be required to register. I am sure that when it comes to judging between the Opposition and the Government on this issue, the electorate will give the same answer in future as it gave in the past&#x2014;namely, that it is high time that the trade union movement was brought to a sense of responsibility such as is exercised by the best trade unions, of which the union of the hon. Member for Salford, West is an example.<br/>
I am sure that the Committee will reject the Amendments and that it will be right to do so.</p>

<p>I have not spoken on the Bill since I spoke against the guillotine Motion. However, I made it clear at that time that the reason, above all others, for my objection was the central matter of registration.<br/>
There has been no lack of speakers. Over 22 years I have had plenty of time to speak in the House, but I feel it my duty to reaffirm now the conviction which I have held, with increasing ratio, over so many years.


When I referred my hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson) to a matter of history, it was not so much academic history as something in which I took part. If I may address the Solicitor-General, the great dispute of 1922 was about managerial functions and the idea that employers had the right to do what they liked. We were locked out for four months. We had no voice then regarding the manning of machines, wage rates, or anything else. That kind of view of employers, which was inflicted at a time of great adversity for the trade union movement, is still held today. This is fundamental.<br/>
The hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) thought it was an irrelevancy when I intervened to point out what took place in Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. I should like to read a section from Mussolini's Labour Law. I do not mean to be insulting, but I note that the Solicitor-General has left the Chamber. The Italian Labour Charter of 21st April, 1927, states that syndica&#x2014;which means trade union&#x2014;associations are free, but only those syndicates which are recognised by law and subject to the control of the State have the right to represent legally the whole category of employers or employees for which they are established.<br/>
It is bureaucratic language&#x2014;the usual gobbledegook which might come from any Government Bill, but particularly from this one. Of course, this runs through the Bill.<br/>
I believe that proposals for registration ensure that trade unions become part of the State apparat&#x2014;no longer free voluntary associations, but at the diktat of lawyers who take a certain view of human relations. This is my fundamental objection. It even supervenes the principles put forward by the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger).<br/>
I recognise the vote of 18th June. But that election was not won or lost on this legislation.</p>

<p>I said that it was not a fair comparison and that it could be illustrated by referring the right hon. Gentleman to Clause 114 which states that no court shall order any specific performance of a contract of employment or an injunction or compel an employee to do any

work at all. In Germany or Italy at that time it would have been quite the opposite. The two kinds of law, if the right hon. Gentleman so describes it, are completely incompatible.</p>

<p>The Clause to which the hon. Gentleman referred is rendered completely nugatory by the register. It does not matter how it is achieved. We have only to look at what is lost through the Bill. The Trade Union Act, 1871 states:
<q>The advantages which a registered trade union has over an unregistered one are as follows.</q>
I am reading here from a real authority, Citrine, who, after all, proved that one did not need to be a lawyer to be an advocate.
<q>(1) A registered trade union is entitled to exemption from income tax under Schedules C and D in respect of interest and dividends which are applicable and applied solely for the purpose of provident benefits.'</q>
Presumably that would be lost by my union if it failed to register. I am told that failure to register by one big trade union will cost over &#x00A3;500,000. Let us not underrate what is at stake in regard to registration.
<q>(2) On a change of trustees of a registered trade union the land and other property of the union which is vested in them (other than stock in the public funds) automatically vests in the succeeding trustees".</q>
That is lost. Registration lays the trade union movement open to considerable risk of litigation.
<q>(3) The members of a registered trade union may dispose at death of sums payable by the union, not exceeding prescribed limits, by means of a mere written nomination.</q>
All that goes. More litigation. When one goes over to lawyers, it is not only the Registrar of Friendly Societies who believes in a healthy idea of spreading the environment of his own trade, its productivity and profitability&#x2014;but all those who will be appointed under him.<br/>
There is a whole list of other things. It goes on to say:
<q>The treasurers and other officers of a registered trade union are legally bound to render accounts and to deliver up to the trustees all property and effects in their hands or custody on being required to do so, and may be compelled to do so by any competent court.</q>
That shows how much, under the present legislation, trade unions are under some form of control.


If the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. David Mitchell) were here I should take him up on this point, because I understand that he is the Chairman of the National Advisory Council of a Conservative trade union. Being a registered trade union gives the union a certain autonomy to inflict fines according to the rules. In my trade union, which is the same as that of my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme), before a person becomes a member of it he is given a book of rules to study for a fortnight, and he is asked questions before steps are taken to proceed with his initiation. I believe that my hon. Friend is a little out of date in the history, because in fact the union goes back far beyond 1851. It goes back to 1826, to the old boilermakers' trade union, and I could, in fact, take it back to 1780.<br/>
A person wishing to join my union is asked whether he has read the rules, having been given a fortnight to do so. It might interest the Committee to know that on one occasion when the president of our union was dismissed by the final appeal court Lord Goddard asked, "Did you read the rules when you joined the organisation?", and on that simple question the president lost his job, because he was required to know the rules, and anybody who joins my trade union knows that if he outrages the rules he is subject to fines.<br/>
The hon. Member for Basingstoke made some point about paying a fine pending appeal. There is a distinguished lawyer here. Everyone knows that when one goes to court to take part in litigation it is often necessary to deposit a considerable sum of money pending the outcome of an appeal. Anybody who has had experience of litigation knows that.</p>

<p>I am referring to what the hon. Member for Basingstoke said. I do not know about the "kangaroo" court. The hon. Gentleman was complaining that a trade union, or rather the district committee of a trade union, according to its rules, perfectly legally, fined a member and said that the person had to deposit &#x00A3;25 pending an appeal. I have never known that in my trade union. I have known that in my trade union, when a

recalcitrant member has failed to pay a properly imposed fine, the sum has been debited against him on his card, and he has gone into arrears with his payments.<br/>
When I spoke to the House during the debate on the guillotine Motion I quoted from an article in <i>The Times</i> of 27th January, and perhaps I might quote it again, because it puts the matter very succinctly. It says:
<q>This is more than a nominal degradation"&#x2014;</q>
It is a degradation of the status of trade unions&#x2014;
<q>The present definition of a trade union, in the Act of 1913, is 'any combination, whether temporary or permanent, the principal objects of which are under its constitution statutory objects &#x2026; the regulations of the relations between workmen and masters, or between workmen and workmen, or between masters and masters, or the imposing of restrictive conditions on the conduct of any trade or business, and also the provision of benefits to members'.</q>
That is vital, and the whole of the 1871 and 1906 Acts defining union immunities are repealed. This is a substantial step and it was on this ground that I objected to the guillotine.<br/>
The registration of trade unions deserves an Act of Parliament all of its own. This is so wide and the consequences so great and so misunderstood by hon. Gentlemen opposite that these provisions deserve a Bill of their own, a Second Reading. a Committee stage upstairs, and all the other stages that are gone through before a Bill becomes law. Here I want to make another protest. This Bill makes the complete case for abolishing the old-fashioned Parliamentary Session which is based on a pastoral society, on the rotation of the crops, spring time and the harvest.<br/>
Instead of bringing things to an abrupt end in November, we ought to be able to take into a new Session any unfinished legislation and complete it then. We ought to be able to do this by a simple reaffirmative process, by a sort of Second Reading. We ought not to be governed by the need for Members who rise for the Summer Recess. The present arrangements were invented by Chief Whips, and ought to be abolished. The Bill is too big to be dealt with in one Session and it ought, therefore, to have much longer consideration.


I know that there are many hon. Members who wish to address the Committee.</p>

<p>If a trade union is not registered it can get a certificate to promote a political fund. Will that right be repealed? Everything is being conditioned to the say so of the registrar. I do not want to get out of order, but legal decisions are founded on precedents. This court will follow precedents and deviate only when something does not affect the establishment. I shall not refer to the breach of the Official Secrets Act, but there is no doubt that if Lord Goddard had been presiding, as he was in the Fell case, there would have been a different judgment. These things have to be elastic.<br/>

<p>Let me deal with something about which I know. Where there is a failure to agree on the shop floor, there is a confrontation between the shop stewards and the employer at that point. Everybody knows that the procrastinating processes which can be used will lead to innumerable further disputes. Everybody knows that trade unions will not

give up the right to confront the employer. The whole business of registration is founded on the idea that one can take industrial discontent and somehow lift it into the courts.<br/>
In most disputes the employer claims the right to do something, but the trade unions have always maintained that before progress is made the <i>status quo ante</i> must be restored. If a man has been dismissed, he must be reinstated before discussion about the dispute can go any further. In future such matters will be dealt with by the Registrar, deputy registrars, and so on. This process of registration will prevent a trade union from being a free voluntary movement and make it part of the apparat of the State.<br/>
6.30 p.m.<br/>
Whichever way one looks at it, that is the result at the end of the day. The Solicitor-General should be concerned about what will happen about the consequences of failure to register. It would be a very bold man, or a very bold lawyer employed by a great trade union, who countenanced or gave them the advice not to register. If they knew the consequences of refusing to register, it would be an act of considerable courage if the trade unions said that they would not do so, because courage is the ability to face a problem when one is most afraid of it.<br/>
Two of the great trade unions most affected have said, "We will not register". Will the Government take them on? It will come right down the line to hundreds of thousands of people in factories. That is why there is great protest against the Bill.</p>

I was drawing attention to the fact that I thought it relevant to the great point which has been made by the right hon. Gentleman and other hon.

attention to this rule to get that so-called spontaneous feeling expressed.</p>

<p>I want only to tell the hon. Gentleman what I once told somebody when I was interviewed at an airport when I was a Minister. They asked whether I would comment on an industrial dispute, and I said, "Industrial disputes are like married life. Only the people in it really know what it is all about." Consequently, I should not presume in the Committee to judge a hypothetical case which the hon. Gentleman puts up. I do not know from what it springs. I do not know to what "kangaroo" court the hon. Member for Basingstoke was referring. Like my hon. Friend, I must take responsibility in my own trade union.<br/>
I was once at the wrong end of the stick on an appeal against something which I did as a shop steward. I knew something about that. But we know how complicated human relations are. If it is difficult for me to accept, not the hon. Gentleman's word, but the basis of his case in the Committee, how much more difficult would it be for some Registrar, weeks after the event, to accept the say-so of various witnesses who may not be as literate as the hon.

<p>A point arises very often from a necessity in trade union branches to dissociate the whole question of delegation from the rules of the branch or union. Very often a resolution is passed in the branch which is able to prevent the union having to pay delegation fees, bus fares and so on to people attending meetings. That is one of the reasons why these resolutions are moved. It is for the opposite reason to that to which the hon. Gentleman refers. It is not to compel people to go but to prevent the branch having to pay out large sums of money in delegation fees and bus fares when practically every member of a branch is about to attend a rally. That is the reason that some of the issues to which the hon. Member for Basingstoke refers are raised.</p>

<p>I must resist the blandishments of my hon. Friend to help me through my speech. May I give one example, which I think would not be wasting time? I ran across a dispute

some years ago when a man in a shop got married&#x2014;not an unlikely event but a very desirable one. Afterwards he did not like night work, and when he went to the manager, the firm immediately said that he could have all day work. The whole shop went on strike. It was a sensational matter and the newspapers pictured this as somehow unreasonableness and lack of sympathy towards a young married man. But it was not. The newspapers were silent about the fact that the striking workers were on a collective bonus system on the day shift, and every man on the day shift stood to lose 17s. 6d. a week, so they said, "We will not have it." How would that dispute appear when it came before the Registrar three and a half months later?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman does not think that this would come within his scope, eventually it would reach the Registrar if people took a gloomy enough view of a matter such as that. National disputes are started on a great variety of local matters like that. This is the weft and woof of industrial life.

<p>Despite the prolonged teach-in on industrial relations which has been conducted in the Chamber, it is still apparent from this afternoon's debate that hon. Members opposite do not appreciate the fundamental nature of trade unionism. I say that with the greatest respect.


It requires a Member of the Committee such as my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell) to offer all of us a glimpse of the essential character of trade unionism, so that we can draw something of its flavour, and perhaps even put our finger on its pulse. This came out during the exchanges two or three minutes ago. With respect, the hon. Member for Leek (Mr. Knox) had not thought about registration as my right hon. Friend was thinking about it when he was speaking. My right hon. Friend was being emotional, because he knows in his bones something of the impact that this set of Clauses which we are considering&#x2014;some of which we shall not consider today&#x2014;will have upon industrial relations.<br/>
He is absolutely right. It is a crucial set of Clauses, from Clause 57 right through to Clause 84. It is Part IV of the Bill. Some hon. Members opposite might think that we are in sight of home, that the great contentious aspects of the Bill are behind us. But some of us think that we have yet to come to the crucial Clauses. I entirely agree with my right hon. Friend.<br/>
Some of us may have a chance to recall through HANSARD tomorrow the contributions made so far in the debate from this side of the Committee. I do not believe for a moment that I can keep up the standard and contribute to the feel for the problems involved which has been demonstrated by them, and the contributions coming from the other side, notably that from the hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger). When the hon. Gentleman was addressing the Committee, I was wondering whether I should be fortunate enough to be called immediately after him. If I had been, I should have had difficulty in commenting on his speech. I have never sought refuge in the time-honoured phrase, "I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not mind if I do not follow his line of argument." I should not have known which point to pick up from the hon. Gentleman's contribution, which was no more than an elegant piece of waffle. Yet, if we think about registration and what it involves for trade unions and trade unionists, especially at the grass roots level&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is precisely what I hope to do. I was about to say that I would even agree with what my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West said just now, when he commented that he thought eventually that the registration of trade unionists might result in a corporate state where the liberties not merely of the trade unions were in danger but those of society as a whole.<br/>
The trade unions, among other things in our society, represent one of the bulwarks of our liberties. My right hon. Friend spoke about Hitler, If Hitler and his troops had landed in this country during the last war, they would have met no greater resistance in any part of society than from the ranks of our trade unions, including the shop stewards, whom this provision requiring registration now threatens. That was the experience on the Continent, where the backbone of resistance was provided by shop stewards, most of them Communists, and representatives of the Church.<br/>
I was inclined to believe that the misunderstanding of the situation by right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite was due to the way in which one or two of them earlier today likened trade unions to limited companies, and this point came out well in the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. John Fraser).<br/>
How can one compare a limited liability company with a trade union? Historically, there has been the greatest possible contrast in constitution between a limited company and a trade union. In the former, all power has always resided at the top, the board of directors, and the lower parts have only been allowed to exercise such powers as the top permits. I have in mind the powers of a branch manager of a Tesco supermarket and those of the chairman of Tesco.<br/>
By contrast, in a trade union all power resides at the roots. The top, the executive, can exercise only the powers specifically given to it by the rules. A branch


secretary, being appointed by the branch members, can be removed by them. But he can be removed by the executive only if the rules say so. The position varies from union to union, of course, and some are inclined towards authoritarianism. But some still retain their 19th century democratic origins, notably the union represented by my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West and my hon. Friends the Members for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) and Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson).<br/>
It was suggested from the benches opposite earlier today that what was good enough for a limited company was good enough for a trade union, and it may be that that explains why we have this provision in the Bill. A number of my hon. Friends have argued in recent days that much of the inspiration for the Bill has come from the United States. However, I believe that the inspiration for this provision to set up a Registrar and lay down his projected role comes from the Restrictive Trades Practices Act, 1956. The model for the provision of a Registrar in this Bill is the Registrar set up by that Act, and perhaps in a moment I might relate the experiences of some members of our society at the hands of that Registrar.<br/>
6.45 p.m.<br/>
Perhaps a further reason why the Government have introduced the Registrar is that, like some of their hon. Friends, they are disposed to liken trade unions to limited companies. However, limited companies were an idea imported from France only 100 years or so ago to fit an existing industrial and commercial need. The trade unions grew out of local societies which, in time, amalgamated with other societies and then joined up on a county and national basis.<br/>
By 1906, it was seen that the growing size of trade unions presented problems. For example, was it right that a local branch in Cornwall, say, which was uncontrolled by the executive should be able by its folly to inflict a penalty on the membership throughout the country? In 1906, this House answered the question in the negative. The Trade Disputes Act, 1906, limited the penalty in most cases to the perpetrator of the folly or his district. That was the effect of Section 4 of that Act, which gave trade unions exemptions from liability in tort&#x2014;a wrong

not arising out of a contract&#x2014;in nearly all cases. That Section allowed trade unions to continue safely with constitutions with power in the roots even though these unions got bigger and bigger.<br/>
Yet we have heard again today the charge that trade unions are privileged at law. We all know that the 1906 Act is to be repealed. However, although most of it is to be re-enacted, Section 4 of it is not. Thus, the penalty for a tort committed in Cornwall will be inflicted on the whole membership. Damages for a libellous newsletter by a Cornish branch secretary will be obtainable from head office funds. What is more, penalties for unfair industrial practice, though committed only by a local branch, will also be recoverable from head office funds, and we know how high those penalties can be.<br/>
In these changed circumstances, one wonders whether there will not be an immediate move towards unions revising their constitutions, regardless of the attitude of the Registrar, so that they have as much control over their branches or shop organisations as the board of directors of Tesco has over its branches. It is hard to see how a union ultimately will be able to afford to do otherwise. They may incorporate parts of the Companies Act, especially Table A, into their constitutions.<br/>
Much attention has been given by the Press, by speakers in the country and in some instances in this House to the penalties under the Bill. We have had to wait until today, and then only in speeches from this side of the Committee, for our attention to be focussed upon this impending compulsion to revise the constitutions of trade unions and all that may flow from it&#x2014;a revision of rules which in many cases will not be wanted by the unions and which eventually will be insisted upon by the Registrar.<br/>
The crux of these Clauses lies outside what we are discussing, so I must not go further in that direction. However, already we see that Clause 61 and others between them provide the strongest possible disincentives to a union to become or remain unregistered. Any unregistered body which takes part in industrial strife or makes use of the industrial weapon is <i>ipso facto</i> guilty of unfair industrial practice. The industrial


court is not even able to decide on fact, whether the conduct is fair or unfair. It has to condemn it as unfair by statutory requirement.<br/>
Registration is not automatic. One has to satisfy the requirements of Schedule 3 and Clause 61, which will force upon trade unions certain new features, which some may want but others may not&#x2014;for example, control from the top over all funds, under Clause 63 (1) <i>(b)</i> or open entry, under Clause 62 (2), or the requirement for no compulsory arbitration which is to be found in Clause 61 (10), or the absolute control from the top over shop stewards in Schedule 3 (6).<br/>
I wonder what has happened to the hon. Member for Ilford, North, who was so anxious to know why we were so distressed at what we regarded as the very real implications for trade unionists of registration. Registration will also impose upon unions the need to make their funds fully public. Their funds will be fully audited for the first time. The duties of their officers will have to be defined, which partly explains the increased turnover of full-time trade union officers in the United States, following similar supervision.</p>

<p>Yes, of course there is no question of malpractice; it is merely a tightening of authority in the union.<br/>
The overall effect of these requirements is to force or persuade the trade union towards a policy of power and funds being located at the top, rather than continuing with their traditional power and funds

at the roots constitution. This is the phrase which I wish to commend to the Committee. Second, it will make the obtaining of compensation, as we shall find in a later Clause, and the selection of targets by employers more easy. In other words, non-registration will be made uncomfortable, to put it moderately. Registration will then be used as a weapon by employers and ultimately by the Government to impress their policy, through the unions, on the economy.<br/>
My main concern, as I hope I have shown, is the way in which registration will force a change in the constitution of trade unions which will have the effect of changing their character. It will tend towards making them tools of the State. It will certainly make them creatures of employers. To this extent, we are in danger, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West said, of sliding towards the corporate State, whereas, as I have said, trade unions represent an important safeguard of our liberties. Nowhere is this more evident than at the grass roots, at the level which will feel the earliest and greatest impact of registration.<br/>
I represent a constituency in Sheffield which is Labour-run. There are not many country boroughs now which are Labour-run, and one reason why Sheffield is Labour-run is that it is well run. It has a remarkable post-war record of reconstruction and urban development and it is run, in the main, by trade unionists, by men who learned their local government craft in their unions, at branch level. This is something which we should remember, that trade unions have traditionally been training grounds for democrats.<br/>
By threatening the life of trade unions at branch level, we shall have to pay not merely an industrial price but also a social price. I fear that it is precisely at that level that registration will make its earliest and greatest impact.</p>

<p>With respect to the hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Duffy), I cannot see that anything implied in registration will, of itself, make a trade union a more pliable instrument of the State, or in any way more amenable to employers. I do not think that it will. That was a grossly exaggerated fear of his.


The nub of this debate was revealed in a speech of the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson). It struck me that his distinction between what he described as the shop steward movement and the trade union movement was absolutely at the heart of the matter. Far from finding his speech perplexing, as did an hon. Member opposite, I thought that he was dealing with exactly what registration is aimed at.<br/>
The mischief which the Bill is intended to meet is the mischief which we have been talking about for many years now, whether under a Labour or a Conservative Government&#x2014;that is, that many more industrial disputes are caused by unofficial action than by official action. The aim and purpose of the Bill, whether it is right or wrong, is to make unofficial action more difficult and trade unions much more responsible for their shop stewards.<br/>
Hon. Members like the hon. Member for Tottenham and the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) have kept an absolutely consistent line on this matter. They were equally against the Labour Government in this matter as they are against this legislation. They see this as a direct threat to the movement in which they have been brought up, which is not only the trade union movement but the shop steward movement within it.<br/>
As I see the requirements for registration, they will strengthen the trade union movement, but at the expense of the shop steward movement. What the Committee should be addressing itself to is the question of whether this is desirable in itself&#x2014;it has many advantages as well as disadvantages&#x2014;and whether, if it is desirable, this is an efficacious way of doing it.<br/>
The hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. John Fraser) did not do justice to his Amendment, since he dealt with it rather superficially, compared with the hon. Member for Tottenham. He spoke of "legal claptrap". That is no way to treat Clauses which, after all, if the Bill is passed, will govern the relationship of the trade unions on registration until at least the Bill is changed&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "Repealed."]&#x2014;or repealed&#x2014;whatever happens to it.<br/>
Therefore, it is very important to look at the effect of these Clauses and this

Amendment. It is entirely academic to discuss this matter on the basis that unions will not register. Of course they will. Whatever they say now, no legal adviser could advise them not to register, because it will be advantageous to register and disadvantageous not to register. What the registration requirement and all that follows from it will hit is the splinter group, the chance of developing new unions, the shop stewards on the shop floor doing things at a remote distance from union headquarters, and union headquarters will be able to bring pressure to bear on them because they are the registered trade union and have to "carry the can" for the shop stewards.<br/>
7.0 p.m.<br/>
Anybody who has to study trade union rules is interested to find how much they vary. The hon. Member for Salford, West described his own union rules. I have not examined them, but from his description they sounded like what could be a model for other unions. Some unions have vastly different rules from those.<br/>
One of the matters with which we are for ever concerned in the Bill are the rights of a man to join a union and the powers of a union to get rid of a man. There is one easy device which has been accepted and used by some unions. When a man whom they do not want particularly applies for membership&#x2014;it may be a 100 per cent. union membership shop&#x2014;the method sometimes employed is for the union to enrol him, not as a member, but as a temporary member. He is issued with a different coloured card. He is entitled to a job, but not to the rights of a full member.</p>

<p>S.O.G.A.T. is one. Any number of unions have such rules. They may be perfectly valid rules.<br/>
I see no reason why there should not be standard rules for trade unions. I do not understand why hon. Members on either side object to there being standard rules, which Schedule 3 would provide and which would give the registrar, who will clearly be an important personage under the Bill, powers to amend or change the rules if they did not suit the circumstances of particular unions.


Few trade union rules make much mention of shop stewards. Shop stewards have grown up as a movement within unions without having official status in many unions. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] The hon. Member for Tottenham knows that what I am saying is true. The rules of many unions hardly mention shop stewards. Shop stewards have unofficially attained a very important position in unions, but they are mentioned only sparsely in union rules. Their real power is very much greater than would appear from the attention that they receive in the rules.<br/>
The hon. Member for Salford, West said that to rewrite the rule book would be a very difficult matter because the rule book as such does not correspond with the actual powers of those involved in the shop steward movement.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman is a lawyer and has great experience in the House of Commons. I do not accept his argument, however, and I do not think that any of my hon. Friends will accept it. I remind him that the House of Commons, which has existed for hundreds of years, has never recognised political parties. We are all hon. Gentlemen and we are equal theoretically. The hon. Gentleman is advancing a purely academic argument. I believe that, when everything has to be spelled out in rules or in a code, free will and free bargaining go and become the cat's-paw of successful lawyers who advise on things that they do not understand.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood me. I was not criticising the unions for not mentioning shop stewards. I was merely stating it as a fact which must be dealt with. One of the questions which this Government and any other Government must ask in dealing with this matter is: if the Bill is enacted and there is this movement which is intended to discipline people further down the line, will it succeed? Can it succeed? Can one by this procedure succeed in making unions so change their rules and their discipline that they can control the shop stewards' movement as it has developed? As I understood him, the hon. Member for Tottenham said that in his opinion the unions could not do it in any event and

that, no matter what legislation was passed, the unions would not succeed in controlling the shop stewards' movement.</p>

<p>It is not quite clear whether the hon. and learned Gentleman is saying that it is desirable that the influence of the shop stewards should be diminished.

<p>Can I clear up the point about the rules? I was arguing that in my unio&#x2014;the A.E.U., as it used to be; the A.U.E.W., as it now is&#x2014;the rule is clear about the functions of shop stewards. A shop steward does not have the right to take action on the shop floor to stop the shop in the absence of a district committee decision if the <i>status quo</i> applies in the factory. In other words, if an employer's representative comes into the mill or factory and changes the <i>status quo</i> a shop steward has every right to act independently of the district committee and to stop the shop. I was discussing the functions of the shop steward and saying that no trade union has ever attempted to design its rule book to prevent a shop steward from having the right to take unofficial action.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Barking (Mr. Driberg) has asked me if I am in favour of reducing the power of shop stewards. I believe that this power must be reduced or changed. I do not believe that in practice it will so much be reduced as changed in character. One of the dangers about the Bill is that there will be more official stoppages and fewer unofficial ones, because the nature of the movement will change.<br/>
I am obliged to the hon. Member for Tottenham for explaining the position of shop stewards <i>qua</i> rule books.<br/>
As to registration, we shall be left in this dilemma. The actual power in the union does not always correspond with the so-called rules. The actual power is not so much at the top but is dispersed widely at the bottom, on the floor.</p>

<p>Certainly. There still must be co-ordination. Britain has failed


in the matter of co-ordination. We would not have had so many unofficial strikes if there had been co-ordination. There is something wrong when a Labour Government and a Conservative Government say that the great evil in Britain on the trades dispute side is the unofficial strike, as opposed to the situation in America, where there is the official strike.<br/>
Balancing these matters, I believe that it is desirable to have registration. The analogy has been drawn that Mussolini required registration. So does Sweden. That is an argument neither for nor against and it does not help at all.<br/>
It is desirable that there should be model rules, because I accept that the trade union movement is a great bulwark of liberty. Some trade unions have the most excellent rules. Like rules in all other organisations, they are sometimes bent a little. Some unions have rules which are not so good. I do not see any reason why there should not be model rules. I see no reason why the Registrar should not have power over the rules in this way. I see no reason why the whole thing should not be controlled.<br/>
As I said on Second Reading, trade unions have become a fourth escape. Having reached that state, they need rules of a much more formal character than they formerly did. When any body over a period of time evolves, it is found that to safeguard freedom within that body more formalities and more rules are needed than the body had in its formative years. Exactly the same has happened to the British trade movement. When all the ballyhoo is over, people will find that, for the established trade unions, registration will have made very little difference.</p>

<p>Until my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Duffy) spoke, I thought that I was attending an A.E.F. love-in.

<p>Perhaps then my right hon. Friend could claim to be a member of the first largest union, not just the second.<br/>
My hon. Friends paid proper regard to the rules of their union. It is an ancient union with a long and distinguished history. They are proud of their rules. But so are we all proud of our rules. Our rule books enshrine our rules, the rules which we make in deciding what regulations shall be applied to our affairs. They are the rules which we lay down for the running of our own unions. They are ours; that is the important thing about them.<br/>
The Bill would change our rules. It would say that someone else could examine the rules of my union, go through them, examine them closely, and, perhaps, say that a rule did not meet, for example, the provisions of Clause 1. In that case, that rule would be out.<br/>
It so happens that my union expresses in one of its rules the implementation of Clause Four on the Labour Party. In fact, we had it before the Labour Party did. But is that within the "national interest" as Ministers interpret it? Speaking earlier about registration and what was responsible trade unionism, the Minister said that "responsible" must be interpreted in relation to the national interest. We asked what "national interest" meant, but he could not define it, or he refused to do so.<br/>
This is the nub of our argument when we say that these provisions will start us on the way to the corporate State. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. John Fraser) went through the steps, showing that ultimately we should have a political decision reached on what was or was not good for trade unions. This is what makes the provisions about registration so reprehensible within the framework of a Bill of this kind.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) is probably right when he says that registration does not matter one way or another. Sweden has it, he says. But so does Italy. What matters is what lies within and behind registration, and that is what we are arguing about. To hear hon. Members opposite talk, one would think that we had not had registration of trade unions for almost a century. But it is there.


It was introduced to protect trade unions, to protect our funds, and to enable us to organise ourselves in society. We were able to do that, but the Registrar had no power to say what was or was not right for us as free men in our own societies, free men deciding what our own rules and regulations should be, whom we would admit and whom we would not, and so on. Even if the A.E.F. does not register under the Bill, it can be forced to take in people whom it does not want. So merely staying outside the register will not affect the matter. That is an important point.<br/>
I think that it was Sir Arthur Bryant in one of his histories who spoke about an English yeoman farmer who, before he died, left directions in his will that spikes were to be put over his grave, because no one had ever trampled over him in life and he intended no one ever to do so after he was dead. Hon. Members opposite would applaud that sort of sentiment. Do they not understand that our rule books are our spikes? They protect us and they protect our societies. The Solicitor-General and his right hon. Friend wish not just to blunt the spikes but to pull them entirely away. In effect, the Government are saying that the rules of our societies must be subject to the decisions of the Secretary of State according to his interpretation of the national interest. This is what percolates through the whole Bill, and it worries us greatly.<br/>
7.15 p.m.<br/>
In the speeches of hon. Members opposite&#x2014;one almost heard overtones of it in the speech of the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery&#x2014;there is the suggestion that, in some way or other, the trade unions exist only to make industry more efficient, to make the wheels of commerce move more smoothly, to make a profit. They do all that, and they do it very well, but that is not their purpose. Their purpose is to protect the interests of their members. This is why we regard as so reprehensible the centralisation of power entailed in what the Government propose regarding union rules. The whole philosophy of Donovan about negotiations, and the changes which have been taking place in our industrial structure, have been away from the national agreement and towards individual plant bargaining.<br/>
If we are to have individual plant bargaining, we shall have to give more power and influence to the branch official, the shop steward and the person working in the plant or factory. That is where questions will be decided. That is where disputes will start. If we stop the negotiation and settlement of disputes there, we shall build up the cancer which leads to the mighty industrial explosion which can bring a whole industry to a halt or create the sort of situation which we shall later, perhaps, discuss when considering the question of cooling-off periods and ballots.<br/>
We must give responsibility to the person who is concerned locally, and one cannot define that responsibility in nice lawyer's phrases, hedging it round, squaring it off, saying that this is what he shall be allowed to do and the other is not. One cannot do that. One cannot legislate for a constantly changing situation, be it in workshop, ship, quayside, farm or even a school. One has to take the situation as it is. There has to be sufficient acceptance of the idea that the responsible person there, be he shop steward, branch official or ordinary union member, will be able to understand the situation and decide what is the right thing to do. Only within that sort of framework can one have rules and regulations in one's organisation.<br/>
This part of the Bill dealing with registration&#x2014;it goes right through the whole thing&#x2014;takes from us our trade unions. It takes from us our society. It takes from us the protection which people like my parents and grandparents, poor and illiterate peasants coming from Ireland, used to build up their own society, strengthen their position, and give opportunities for their children. This is what the Government will be taking from us when they say that the State should be able to look at these things.<br/>
We will not let them do it. These are our unions, not the Secretary of State's not the Solicitor-General's. They are our trade unions, and we intend to keep them so.</p>

<p>I think that we can find it in Donovan under "Registration". There was the first faltering step in the paragraphs dealing with registration, beginning at No. 788, and in the sections dealing with union rules. I can find them if the hon. Gentleman wishes. The tenor of the whole of those arguments is in parallel with what the right hon. Lady suggested in paragraphs 107-109 of "In Place of Strife", where registration was proposed in terms and where a financial penalty was to be imposed by an industrial board. Presumably, the board was to fine those unions which did not register. The right hon. Lady's proposal would have imposed on the unions that did not register a fine in addition to the penalties to which the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson) referred, arising from different tax liabilities and so on. Incidentally, I found it helpful to have the fuller explanation of this matter and the quotation from Citrine

given by the right hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell).<br/>
There was a substantial difference between the right hon. Lady's proposals and those of my right hon. Friends, who are saying not that penalties will be placed on those that do not register but that there will be certain advantages that they do not gain. It may be a matter of semantics, but I prefer my right hon. Friend's approach to the right hon. Lady's imposition of a financial penalty.</p>

<p>Since the hon. Gentleman has not got them, may I give him the proper references? In paragraph 649 of Donovan, we are told:
<q>We think that the requirements can and should be revised with a view to ensuring better safeguards for individual members."&#x2014;</q>
and this is the important part&#x2014;
<q>but without impairing the freedom which trade unions ought to enjoy to frame rules to meet their own circumstances.</q>
In paragraph 109 in "In Place of Strife" we are told:
<q>Unions will be free to frame rules to meet their own requirements.</q>
The essential distinction is between the unions framing rules to meet their own requirements and being told the rules that they must have in their rule book.</p>

<p>If someone is told, "You must write your own rules, but they must meet certain criteria", that does not seem to me to be vastly different from saying, "These are the things which must be in the rules." This is not a point of principle but of semantic detail.<br/>
The gravamen of the argument in the Committee is not about the words in Donovan, "In Place of Strife" or the Bill but about the fears sincerely held by right hon. and hon. Members opposite that in the provisions there is something much more sinister and dangerous than I see in them. They see much greater dangers and difficulties than exist, and are making somewhat of a mountain out of a hillock, if not a molehill.<br/>
I hope that all hon. Members accept that union rules are not perfect. The rules are extremely good in many of the major unions, but there are ways in which they should be brought up to date. That view is supported by any fair reading of Donovan, of the T.U.C.'s document "Programme for Action", and the words


used by Victor Feather in commending that document to the Croydon conference. Union rules should be brought up to date particularly to provide better safeguards for the individual freedom of members. We can find quotations to that effect scattered through the documents. I do not believe that hon. Members opposite would seriously challenge the assertion that there have been occasions, albeit very rarely, when things have not gone as they should.<br/>
I accept in turn that Donovan and "In Place of Strife" stress that there is no serious abuse of union power across the board. But we are not always concerned just with the generality. This brings us back to the discussions on Clause 5. In matters of individual freedom we should be concerned with specific cases and aim to provide legslation to protect individual rights. I see these Clauses as having that at least in part as their objective, particularly where individual rights may be under attack, even if only rarely, by abuses of union power.<br/>
It is stated in "In Place of Strife" that the Royal Commission found no evidence of "widespread abuse" of union power. The presumption, therefore, is that it found evidence of some abuse. Therefore, it is right that criteria should be laid down in the Bill to improve union rules and draw them up to the level of the best. We cannot leave it to voluntarly action. The T.U.C. can do something and, particularly since June, 1969, has been doing things to improve the rules of its constituent members, but even if it succeeds with all of them there are 300 or 400 small unions outside the T.U.C.</p>

<p>Does not the hon. Gentleman agree that it is not a question of the Bill's bringing the rules up to the best but of introducing, under Clause 61(7), for example, aspects which are entirely new? For example, a union will have to accept into membership people who may well have scabbed against it in a dispute, people whom it does not want in the membership.</p>

<p>I will take the advice which the hon. Member for Penistone (Mr. John Mendelson) is always giving to his hon. Friends when hon. Members on this side seek to intervene. As I hear him he mutters, "Don't give way." Perhaps I should on this one rare occasion take his advice and I give him due notice that I shall not take it on any other.<br/>
I was impressed by what the hon. Mem-for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) said, again in that lyrical way in which his heart shone through as well as his mind, in talking about the virtues of his own union. It would seem that his union is the very perfection of democracy and that that perfection is shared by nearly all other unions. I ask those who believe this why the percentage of people voting at elections in unions generally is often as low as it is. Why is the number of people who turn up at branch meetings generally so low? I know how low it is from my own experience in attending the branch meetings of my own union in the past. I do not believe that these figures underwrite entirely the belief that the quintessence of perfection of democratic behaviour exists in all the trade unions of the country.</p>

<p>Everyone wants to see the highest possible percentage. We should like to see 99 per cent. voting in parliamentary elections. Unfortunately, however, in some constituencies less than 50 per cent. voted and in municipal elections the turnout is often between 20 per cent. and 30 per cent. In a recent election in my union for a major office, the voting figure was 20 per cent. Members of trade unions go in their own time to branch meetings and I wish there was 80 per cent. attendance then. But one cannot compel members to go. They have the democratic right to go or not go.</p>

<p>I accept that, but I say that it is an indication that improvements can be made and that the situation is not as perfect as we would wish. The hon. Gentleman has quoted a figure of 20 per cent. He knows that, quite often,


the percentage voting can be as low as single figures. In my experience, I have found this to be true and again some examples are given in the relevant paragraphs of the Donovan Report.<br/>
I hope that my hon. and learned Friend will resist the Amendment. The arguments used in its support are based largely upon a totally incorrect reading of the motives of right hon. and hon. Members on this side of the Committee. Hon. Members opposite ascribe to us evil motives in this regard, but on the basis of their total misunderstanding one can have some understanding of the words which have been used to describe what might happen under the Bill. Take away that misunderstanding, and many of the speeches made by hon. Members today have been incomprehensible and not in line with what I believe will happen under these Clauses.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.605.0" hansard_membership_id="9245" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18321" speakername="Mr. John Mendelson" colnum="605" time="">
<p>From the beginning of this debate perhaps only one speech so far&#x2014;I do not say this scathingly&#x2014;has tried to deal with some of the true purposes of the Bill. That was the speech made by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hopson). It is therefore to his contribution that I want to address myself and why I am anxious to take part in the debate. I will not judge the Government's case on the kind of support they have received from their own benches. That would not be a fair measure of the case the Government are trying to make.<br/>
It is not very important to consider, therefore, whether these expressions of general sentiment are relevant to the Clause. What matters is a point which the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery left out. He dealt with the matter of registration and all the points involved in the Amendment as though one could treat the registration Clauses in theory and in isolation. But the nub of our case concerns the consequential Clauses which follow upon the appointment of a registrar under the terms and conditions of the Bill. That is the issue to which we have to address ourselves if we are to understand all the sentiments to which hon. Members opposite have referred <i>ad nauseam.</i> I am getting a little tired of their declarations of how much they admire the sentiments of my hon. Friends. My hon. Friends have not expressed sentiments. They have made a reasoned case

and it is to that case that the Government have to address themselves.<br/>
If further evidence is required, I quote Mr. Victor Feather as a man who is not dealing in sentiment. He had this to say about these Clauses:
<q>All this follows from deciding to replace existing social rights by a State licence to operate.</q>
<q>These proposals are not extending the rights of working people. They are intended to convert the rights that workpeople have established and defended themselves into legal 'privileges "dependnt on good behaviour.</q>
That is not a sentimental view. It is an historic summing up by the present leader of the British trade union movement of what lies behind these proposals.<br/>
Why are they being objected to? I and many trade unionists who have discussed this matter with me at the many meetings in which I have taken part object because of the connection with other parts of the Bill. When Mr. Feather refers in his telling phrase to there being a licence for good behaviour, one has to look at Clause 61. More attention should have been paid to the text of the Bill in the speeches we have heard from hon. Members opposite. Subsection (7)<i>(a)</i> reads:
<q>to take any action which, in accordance with any provision of this Act, would constitute an unfair industrial practice on his part &#x2026;</q>
that is, the individual trade unionist. The subsequent Clauses deal with the terms of reference which are to guide the registrar once he is appointed with the important powers that hon. Members on both sides agree that he would have. For example, the hon. and learned Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) agrees that he would have them. These are the terms of reference by which the registrar will have to be guided. A whole range of activities vital to a free trade union movement are affected. This is not just a one-Clause Bill to allow the appointment by the Government of a new registrar.<br/>
The Government are asking the House to accept the whole of the Bill and all its consequential Clauses. Once the Bill has been passed, the terms of reference would allow the registrar to work by reference to new phrases and new implications and new legal facts constituting unfair industrial practices. That is the decisive issue which the Committee is debating and which my hon. Friends have been rationally arguing all afternoon.</p>

<p>That is why a man as responsible, sober and level headed as Mr. Feather&#x2014;and nobody has called him a sentimentalist who deals in emotion&#x2014;says that it is objectionable to replace the acquired rights of working people, built up in their history of 150 years, back to the time of the famous strike of the scissor grinders in the City of Sheffield in 1797, preceding even 1857 and the other dates which have been mentioned. That is what Mr. Victor Feather has in mind when he talks about the rights which working people have built up over so many years.<br/>
The Government are attempting to say to the trade unions that from now on they must not go on building up their rights and conventions in their own movement, but must be forced to accept a biased Bill, including new definitions of unfair industrial practices and allowing the registrar, by reference to these new provisions, to decide whether a union should be registered. This is unacceptable to the trade union movement. As the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery knows, I agree with him that we must not exaggerate the implications of the Bill, and he had reason wholly on his side when he said that, but there is a connection between this provision and the rest of the Bill which the hon. and learned Member failed to make.<br/>
That is the kernel of the whole argument, but now I turn to the more general argument which explains why so many of my hon. Friends are sensitive about this subject, and again this is not a matter for sentiment. They know very well, when the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery talks about weakening certain sections of the trade union movement and reducing their influence, that these provisions are not: only objectionable to shop stewards all over the country, as he seemed to imply, but are meeting the total and unanimous opposition of the general secretaries and presidents of unions affiliated to the T.U.C. It would be wrong to allow to stand on the record his implication that only some people, removed from the centre of the trade union movement, object to these provisions.<br/>
The Prime Minister, whom we have not seen much in these debates, made a

speech attacking a group of people, shop stewards and others, whom he called loud-mouthed. Hon. Members will remember that it was a Saturday evening speech. During that particularly offensive speech. the Prime Minister talked as though he was referring to a different part of the trade union movement. But trade unions are so organised that people with local duties in factories and those in charge of a district, or a division, or a region, or at national headquarters, have much more contact than is often visible to the naked eye; after all, the telephone was invented some time ago.</p>

<p>That is the trouble with a great deal of academic research&#x2014;too many people compare pages of print and do not know what goes on in British industry. I speak as a graduate of the L.S.E. and I do not take it remiss that the hon. and learned Gentleman has mentioned it, but that institution, honourable and learned though it is, often falls into the category of those who are too fond of texts and rule books and not enough of travelling the country and spending a few years seeing what goes on in the workshops and factories.<br/>
There is a great deal of convention in industry, as there is in our constitution. The hon. and learned Gentleman may not know about these conventions, but they are most effective and they are being acted upon all the time.</p>

<p>Custom and practice in industry and throughout the country. The general secretaries and presidents of unions and the central leaders know very well that the design behind the Bill is not to put a few shop stewards in their place, but to weaken the trade union movement as a whole. That is why their opposition is as unanimous and as bitter as that of the shop stewards themselves.<br/>
Much has been said about the disciplining of members. This is another important aspect of the argument. The


trade union movement has reformed its arrangements from time to time. Hon. Members have to understand that it is not only because people feel that it is morally objectionable or sentimentally offensive for the State to say to an organisation like a trade union, "You will reform your rules in this way".<br/>
I want never to shirk in our discussions of the Bill any difficulties which we had when in office. Hon. Members who are well informed on these matters will know that there was a serious argument between some of my hon. Friends and the General Council of the T.U.C. for several weeks precisely on the subject of how the trade union movement should change its rules. I do not want to shirk this issue. We do not want to be only propagandists. Why should we not discuss these matters as grown men and women? During that important argument, the members of the General Council of the T.U.C. refused to have their rules rewritten for them by any Government, no matter what its party, because they believed, as they now believe, that, as members of a free, democratic trade union movement, it was for them to decide how their rules should be reformed.<br/>
It is wrong for the Government for ever and a day to quote bits from one White Paper or another. What we are debating is the Government's attempt to do something which is deeply objectionable to the leaders and members of the trade union movement, not only on emotional grounds, and not mainly on emotional grounds, not only because they think that it is morally offensive, but because they are convinced that it is wholly unrealistic, will not work, and has nothing to do with the free movement of trade unions.<br/>
They take the view that the worst thing that can be done to help to make the necessary reforms within an organisation such as the trade union movement is to say, "You are now required to do this, because we as the Government say so". The Government will never be able to divorce themselves from this, however many protestations they make about desiring the reform of the movement only in order to strengthen it, because the facts are against them.<br/>
This can be tested against one proposition. One of the unfair industrial practices

which will become part of the terms of reference of the Registrar will be the desire or otherwise of a group of trade unionists to work with non-union labour. We always return to this subject, because the weakening of the trade union movement by forcing people into being heroes when they are blacklegs runs through the Bill from beginning to end. When we discussed this earlier in the definition Clause we had this in mind, that the early definition would always be returned to in other parts of the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has twice said that trade union members have refused to have their rules rewritten. He will recall that in this Chamber a few years ago traders had their rules rewritten as a result of the abolition of resale price maintenance. Would it have been right for traders to have their rules rewritten in the same way?</p>

<p>This is not relevant to the argument, but I want to be courteous to the hon. Gentleman, and what I am saying is that the British trade union movement has always been within the law. I deeply object to the constant use of the word "privilege". The hon. and learned Member for Darwen tried his best for his hon. Friends by saying that when they used the word "privilege" as they had done for many days, they were looking forward to what will be a privilege if and when the Bill is passed.<br/>
He will have to agree that the term is much more loosely used, that people have referred to the rights of working people have referred to the rights of working people acquired over the last 150 years as if they were privileges. Trade unions have been within the law and will continue to be within the law. They are not prepared to accept this attempt to weaken the movement in the disguise of legal trade union reform.</p>

<p>It ought to be made quite clear that so far as these rules are concerned, trade unions, every two years or every four years depending on their constitution, have a rules revision conference. These are alterations not by the general secretary or president but by the members.</p>

<p>It goes much further than that. The present Registrar of


Friendly Societies has certain clearly defined powers. The argument has nothing to do with rules or whether they ought to be reformed but with the general attempt, linked with this Bill, to turn trade unions into licensed organisations. We are to have privileges as a substitute for what have become free rights, independently built up over the years. That is why we object to this provision. The Government can address themselves to this objection only if they accept that they must deal with the subsequent parts of the Bill relating to the appointment of a new Registrar.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Penistone (Mr. John Mendelson) will forgive me if I say that we have enjoyed listening to his contribution even if we do not necessarily agree with it. I have not seen one of his attacks quite so soundly rebuffed as it was by the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson), and I think he has been man enough to concede that he has lost ground on that point.<br/>
Like the hon. Member, I have sat through virtually the whole of this debate. We have had a continuing chorus from the other side of the Committee, taking certain cases out of context and building on suppositions, drawing the worst possible conclusions from these proposals. My hon. Friend the Member for Heston and Isleworth (Mr. Hayhoe) made an excellent speech which I thought was one of the more constructive contributions to the debate.</p>

<p>An interesting point is that the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heifer), who is managing to keep up a running commentary at the moment, referred to one of the few objections in detail. We have had tremendous fears expressed about the implications of the registrar but we have had very few objections to the code of principles the registrar might be asked to follow. Only now at this late stage has there been any suggestion that there is anything offensive in the principles for which the registrar will be looking.<br/>
One comment made by the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson)

needs answering firmly. It has already been contradicted by his hon. Friends. He tried to say that this was a bosses' charter, that the Bill had been cleverly devised by all of the best brains on the employers' side to construct an aggressive weapon for dealing with the unions. Yet the most common debating point, which hon. Members opposite love deploying, is how often employers agree with them on some point they are putting forward. This seems to defeat his argument.<br/>
I do not think that my right hon. Friend would claim that the Bill entirely satisfies either employers or unions. There are certain areas where the Government have taken an independent view in what they consider to be the future national interest. There may be cases where both employers and unions are agreed about their position with regard to certain points but after the fullest consultation my right hon. Friend considers that it is appropriate to propose otherwise.</p>

<p>I recognise the feeling for history of some hon. Members opposite. The trade union movement has a tremendous record and I can understand the continual references to its history. It seems incredible that while there are references back there has not been a single reference forward into the sort of industrial society into which we are moving. We are not making amendments, regulations, and laws for what has happened. These laws and this Measure will relate to the future and it is surely this which is relevant.<br/>
The hon. Member for Salford, West took great exception to an intervention of mine which was not intended to be offensive. He was drawing a perfectly fair point asking where were the examples of past occasions that would justify this Measure. I was making the point that it is not solely past occasions but that we must anticipate problems, and it is this for which we are attempting to legislate.</p>

<p>The hon. Member was probably not with us a little earlier when we had a few exchanges on this point. I do not want to weary the Committee with my comments again, about my personal experience of how united the trade union movement is and about our doubts as to the genuineness of the spontaneity of the opposition. If he consults HANSARD tomorrow he will be able to read it.<br/>
I did not want this analogy to be emotive, but I took that used by the Ministry of Transport to justify road improvement. In that case there has to be a past history of accidents and not a genuine concern for the future and problems that may occur. It is the future with which we are concerned. Hon. Members have made great play of Mr. Victor Feather and the hon. Member for Penistone quoted at length from him. I am sure that he will accept another quotation of Mr. Feather's:
<q>But rules must reflect realities and there is some evidence that union rules have not always been changed to keep them in line with changes in the pattern of collective bargaining.</q>
The most interesting point is the recognition there of the change in the industrial situation. If I may relate that to yet another famous quotation of Mr. Feather's:
<q>One man's strike is another man's lay-off.</q>
We have had hon. Members talking about the responsibility of people to their brothers in the same union. We also recognise the responsibility of union members towards other union members in other activities. As the hon. Gentleman said, there are many different unions and styles of activity. But in the industrial society which we are creating, with lower stock levels in factories and a far more complex interlocking relationship between supplier and producer at different stages of production, there is a responsibility of one group with another. This is a particularly significant future trend and under it union members have a right to know that other unions on which they may depend are also governed by rules which conform to certain basic standards. If one accepts this common responsibility one quickly realises that there must be some arrangement for ensuring

that the desired situation is achieved.<br/>
I do not share the fears which have been expressed about all the terrors which might lurk behind the door. I believe that these provisions are a reasonable means of achieving the fair-minded objective of all of us.</p>

<p>I am grateful to all the lecturers and lawyers who have sought to deploy the case for the trade unions. I listened intently to the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Tom King). I know that he has been charged by the Conservative Central Office to go round the country explaining the Bill. My advice to him is to stop reading the Central Office brief and to read the Bill.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Hooson) talked about the place of the shop stewards in the order of things. He said that many unions made no provision in their rules for shop stewards. That is true. But what are generally known as shop stewards are not always known as shop stewards in industry. When the hon. and learned Gentleman was speaking I thought about the catering industry, in which the person who performs the function of the shop steward is called a house representative. The shop steward in many industries is not necessarily called a shop steward. He may be a branch secretary, chairman of the committee or a house representative.<br/>
May I say, for the benefit of hon. Members opposite and particularly of the lawyers who think that they know something about the trade union movement, that people are not appointed on the basis of names in the trade union movement. We are not dealing with unions and trade union rules in a vacuum. We are dealing with the sort of guidance which should be given in the context of our industrial organisation. Trade union rules are designed in a certain fashion because it happens to fit in with the industrial organisation within which trade unionists have to operate.<br/>
One can point to defects in any trade union rule book. The Press, lawyers and lecturers tell us the defects in the rule books of the A.E.U., the Transport and General Workers Union or U.S.D.A.W.


But, according to them, there is nothing wrong with the rules governing the B.M.A., the B.D.A., the R.I.B.A., or the lawyers. Apparently, only the trade unionists, and not professional people, have defects in their structures and organisations.</p>

<p>Yes. The fact that the solicitors can do the job did not make the slightest difference.

<p>I have read so many things in the last week or two that perhaps I have not read the Courts Bill. If there is not a closed shop and a very tightly knit system of rules and regulations in the legal profession, then I have lived in cloud cuckoo land for many years.<br/>
Clauses 64 to 73 deal with the rights of democratic organisations to fashion the rules under which they shall operate. My right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. C. Pannell) talked about Fascism. I finished my Second Reading speech on this theme because I believe that it is part and parcel of the corporate State. It is the same type of registration and binding of trade unions the exists in the syndicalists in Spain. The trade union movement fashions its rules and regulations in the context of the circumstances in which its members have to operate.<br/>
If in industry we had the same democratic rights and principles which exist outside industry, we could start thinking in terms of creating the perfect rules and regulations that hon. Members opposite want; but we have not. We have a totalitarian system in industry. This is one of the facts of life. All of us have our aspirations and desires. We can all say, "If this were in this shape and form it would be perfect". But we are dealing with human beings. As long as there is a totalitarian system in industry we shall have to have rules and regulations in the trade union movement.<br/>
Although we may have a registrar who says to the trade union movement, "You must submit your rules to me", and although the official trade union movement may dutifully submit its rules and regulations, when it comes to the practical realities of the shop floor it will not matter two hoots what rules and regulations are registered because the majority of disputes in industry are caused, not because of the rules of the union, but because of a failure in communication at plant level in the factory. All the registrars in the world could produce the most wonderful rules and regulations, and yet it would not make one iota of difference to industrial productivity which, I gather, is the primary purpose of the Bill.<br/>
Trade union rules do not remain static. I know nothing more democratic than the British trade union movement. To take my organisation as an example, the power of my union is vested in the rank-and-file members and every two years we set up a rules revision committee. The members of my union are not fools. They know that we live in the real world, that the situation changes, and therefore the rules constantly have to change. In a democratic society a democratic organisation should be able to mould its own rules and then change them in accordance with an alteration in circumstances. There is no reason that the Government should seek to introduce a registrar to tell the members who have created a union that they are not capable of framing their own rules and that the registrar will frame the rules for the union&#x2014;or indeed that the Secretary of State will do so. We all know how brilliant the Secretary of State is. He could not write a rule in the trade union movement.</p>

<p>I had not intended to intervene but I have been following the remarks of the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Loughlin) with care and it bothers me that he should think that anybody will interfere with the democratic rights of a union to make its own rules. For some years I have been associated with the British Legion, which is a chartered body and must go before the Privy Council every time it alters its rules. There are of course other chartered bodies such as The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, and so on, and their rules must be approved. Therefore, the whole case put by the hon. Gentleman falls to the ground. That is the only intervention I wish to make.</p>

<p>I have sat through a considerable part of this debate and have had the pleasure of listening attentively to a number of powerful, and mostly good-humoured, speeches. We are debating matters far too serious to use this opportunity as a vehicle for scoring small debating points in the manner of an Oxford Union debate or a discussion by an academic group of people who take a number of books and documents and juggle with them like a conjuror in a circus. We are dealing here with something that goes to the root of industrial relationships. I am as concerned about the future of industrial relations&#x2014;and I have taken part in the process for most of my life&#x2014;as is the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State.<br/>
The hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Tom King) referred to the chorus of protestations from this side of the Committee. That happens to be true. There are protestations from this side of the House about this Clause and many others since, because of the operation of the guillotine, they have never been discussed. Does

it not strike right hon. and hon. Members opposite who have devised this legislation as somewhat ironic and significant that in the twenty years I have been in this House&#x2014;and I have taken part in the deliberation of all sorts of contentious matters&#x2014;members of the Labour Party have never been as united as they are today in their opposition to this legislation? There is absolute unanimity on the right, on the left, and in the centre&#x2014;and I do not wish to be placed in any category since I am not concerned with labels but with realities. This should be a significant fact to the right hon. Gentleman, who is almost punch-drunk from the consequences of his own folly in bringing forward this monolithic piece of legislation. He has only himself to blame for being duped by all the academic boffins who have been advising him. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am making a serious speech and I am trying to keep it short.<br/>
We are constantly regaled with pleasant speeches by the hon. Member for Heston and Isleworth (Mr. Heyhoe) and many of his hon. Friends which are full of good intentions. I took the liberty the other day of reminding the Solicitor-General that in this House we cannot legislate for good intentions. We are putting on the Statute Book a code of conduct and behaviour which will subject trade union members or officials to certain penalties and disabilities if they transgress these provisions.<br/>
We are constantly told by the Conservative Party on public platforms that this country has been overborne by too much government and that government is to be truncated and reduced. Yet here the Government are going in the opposite direction and seeking, by the guillotine process, to force on to the Statute Book a highly controversial and massive piece of legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has freedom of speech in this place, arid long may it continue. But let us not go on the downward track which will convert the House of Commons from a free Parliament into some kind of Reichstag. We


should all take the strongest exception to that. Without using the word "sinister", which I think the hon. Gentleman employed in his speech, I believe that these indications or tendencies are dangerous for the future and have given rise for justifiable concern by my hon. Friends.<br/>
I should now like to deal with the serious arguments deployed by the hon. Member for Heston and Isleworth, who has just returned. When challenged from this side on the argument which he was deploying, the hon. Gentleman quoted. quite fairly, certain sections of the Donovan Report, which some of us took the trouble to study when it came out. The hon. Gentleman was forced to admit, as a result of the exchanges which took place&#x2014;the hon. Gentleman made a good-humoured and temperate speech; even if we disagreed with him, we liked his tone and manner&#x2014;that the abuses referred to in passing by Donovan were very small in relation to the generality of trade union conduct, which is not under criticism.<br/>
We have one of the Law Officers of the Crown with us this evening. Indeed, we are honoured to have two senior Members of the Cabinet sitting on the Government Front Bench at the same time&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "Only one is in the Cabinet."]&#x2014;Perhaps the hon. and learned Gentleman will work his way up. If I might have the Solicitor-General's attention, I should like to put this point to him. One can excuse the hon. Member for Heston and Isleworth, who is still&#x2014;I say this without disrespect&#x2014;an apprentice in this place, for making a slip; but for a senior Member of the Government to try to blast us with a lot of technical arguments and to argue that to legislate on this scale to govern trade union conditions and practice is legislating for the odd cases of abuse and hardship, is quite wrong. It has always been a constitutional principle, accepted by experienced Members, that the worst kind of legislation is that which is directed against setting apart some minority. We cannot legislate for special cases in a matter like this. We must legislate for the generality of cases.<br/>
It is wrong for right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite to put forward this kind of legislation on the pretext that it is to deal with unions which have defective

rule books and abuses of the rules by perhaps dissident members of unions. When a man is doing something drastic or taking action on an industrial matter. the first thing&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not wish to give way. The hon. Gentleman must excuse me. When a man does something drastic in connection with an industrial matter, the first thing that he does is perhaps to give notice or that to give notice that he is going on strike. But he does not go round to some office and say, "May I have the rules?" and look up the position.<br/>
If I decide to do something in the House which I am convinced is right, I do not go running to the Library before I make a speech. I never speak in the House unless I know what I am talking about. I am open to challenge on any statement I may make recklessly, but I try not to make such statements.<br/>
Rational trade unionists are the product of over 150 years of sacrifice and self-help. The great shibboleth of the Tory Party is that we should not have a regimented State: the State must not do everything and people must, by their own efforts, lift themselves from the disabilities and hardships which they have suffered in previous generations. The trade union movement has been doing that. I think that it should have earned credit for doing that rather than that the Government should seek to make it accept some monolithic legislation which will put it in a straitjacket subject to the authority of politicians. I cannot see any force in the argument that the trade union movement will not be put by the Bill in a straitjacket subject to poltical direction. With the kind of sophisticated modern State which is operating now, the registrar will certainly be subject, if not to direction from the Government, at least to [heir blowing down his neck and putting pressure on him to do things according to the policy of the Government.<br/>
I have made this intervention rather longer than it ought to have been, but at least I have the feeling that hon. Gentlemen have been listening. They may not agree with me, but I can tell when they are listening. It is not always the midnight-oil speeches to which attention is paid. I have heard a lot of


heresy from both sides of the Committee&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>If hon. Gentlemen wish me to go on for a long time, I shall find no difficulty. However, we are under the guillotine and the longer I speak the less time there will be to discuss other matters. I have to draw the line fairly equitably between my desire to have a few points recorded and the need to have time to discuss other matters later.<br/>
The Government have much expertise and many boffins behind the scenes, propagandists and advocates specially trained to run round the country delivering these turgid briefs. It is no use hon. Gentlemen opposite coming here with their turgid briefs and putting them forward. They may put them forward to the Primrose League or sometimes to Tory women's organisations in the backwoods of the county shires&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I will give way to the hon. Member for Keighley (Miss Joan Hall) if she wishes to intervene. I am delighted that she has come into the Chamber to listen to the debate.<br/>
I am being provoked. While I want to be reasonable and allow time for my hon. Friends to deliver their speeches, if hon. Gentlemen opposite want me to go on I can continue for a long time on this theme, because the Amendment and the Clause deal with a matter of the utmost importance.<br/>
I know something about rule books, because in a previous incarnation, I functioned as a national officer of one of the great unions of this country. One of the tasks which came under my supervision and authority was handling, on a national scale, the legal activities of the union. I have spent many hours ploughing through rule books to see what they mean.<br/>
For anybody to suggest that a trade union, which may be a composite body consisting of many other unions which have amalgamated, ought to have some kind of regimented, rubber-stamped, standard rule book handed down on a plate from the Mount of Olives by some&#x2014;<i>[interruption.]</i> I am not sure whether it is the Mount of Olives, and I am sorry if I have made a sublimal joke but I am

sure that hon. Members have got the point. To imagine that this can be done by legislation is to fly in the face of human experience.<br/>
This legislation is denying independence to the mass of sensible trade unionists and elected leaders. Whatever may be the fate of this Clause and of the Bill, however it comes out of the sausage machine at the end of the day, I hope it will be realised that the resistance of my hon. Friends and myself to it is based on the fact that the trade union movement is not prepared to accept the penalties and handicaps which will undermine its authority as an independent body which has been created by the sacrifice, endeavour and intelligence of many generations of people before us, and we, as its guardians, will raise our voices and protest throughout the course of the Bill's progress through the House.</p>

To come back to what we are really debating, it is the principle that the organs of the Labour movement in this country, the trade unions should, in order to achieve the full standing rights, and the new rights conferred by this legislation, be required to register.

<p>Almost every kind of institution we can think of is subject, as a matter of course, to registration. If an hon. Member comes to the House and seeks to introduce a Bill under the Ten Minute Rule saying that it is right that fly-by night travel agents should be registered so that in the name of society we can have some protection in respect of them, he is acclaimed as a hero. With this new generation of matters such as travel agents, if someone wishes to register pre-school play-groups which are serving small aspects of society, registration is accepted as a matter of course. We are here concerned with bodies&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Loughlin) made an important point. He said that we are not legislating in a vacuum, and that these bodies do not exist in a vacuum. I quite agree. The bodies with which we are concerned have power. It is a power which they will retain to inflict great damage upon society, and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Tom King) said, because of the interdependence of our society, to inflict damage upon each other, upon each others' members and upon individuals. They have that power to that extent because of the framework of law with which they have grown up. It is the framework of law which goes back, perhaps, to 1871, and certainly to 1906, which has given them the position of power and authority which they hold, and it is that which we say, at the very least, entitles the Committee and the House to consider the basis upon which that power should continue.</p>

<p>Surely the Solicitor-General is under a misapprehension in using the argument which I deployed, because the trade unions&#x2014;I use his words&#x2014;do not exist to inflict damage on any body or any section of the community. The rules of the unions are not designed, either deliberately or accidentally, to inflict damage.</p>

<p>If I may revert to the central, over-simple point, there are a thousand institutions in our society which do not exist to inflict damage: limited companies, registered partnerships, travel agents, hairdressers&#x2014;none of these organisations exist to inflict damage. But as a matter of course, they are all subject to scrutiny by the House on behalf of society and subject to such rules as society seeks to lay down in respect of them for the protection of the wider national interest and of those who come into contact with them.<br/>
It is astonishing to see the extent to which the argument has been advanced from the other side of the Committee, saying that this is some treading, by this the mother of Parliaments, on hallowed ground. It may be right, as one hon. Gentleman opposite said, that the Labour Party in this House has not for a long time been as united as it has been in its opposition to the Bill. I would venture to assert that in so far as it finds itself united on this subject, never before has it found itself so isolated from the great mass of informed opinion in this country.</p>

<p>Does not the Solicitor-General realise that to begin by saying that trade unions are organisations which can inflict great damage, is to give away the whole bias?

<p>I accept that completely. It is common ground on the benches opposite, and we do not challenge it. I accept that the trade unions exist to serve their members, and they play an important part in the community. What appears to be in issue, though I cannot understand why, is that, like every other institution, they are capable of inflicting damage on the community, on their members and on other unions. One man's strike is another man's lay-off. In his book, Will Paynter argues a cogent case

for the way in which the consequences of damage inflicted by the Labour movement unregulated are now so much more serious than they were years ago.</p>

To come back to this point, just how far out of touch is it possible for right hon. and hon. Members opposite to get from the facts of reality? Is it seriously disputed as a foundation for this debate that organised labour, in a framework of law that is inadequate and does not secure for it the rights that we are trying to secure for it, by taking industrial action unnecessarily in pursuit of unfair and unreasonable objectives, is capable of inflicting harm on society which we should seek to avert if we can?</p>

<p>I am very interested in this point about trade unions and shop stewards inflicting harm. What kind of harm was inflicted by the shop stewards who came to this House on Monday? Those who came to this House from Rolls-Royce did not come to inflict harm. They came with a begging bowl, hoping for assistance from this Government. What harm can they inflict? The only harm that they can inflict is when the market forces suit them, which is very rare.</p>

<p>I thought that it was common ground that we in this House and the country are concerned with the problem of industrial relations. Disputes between powerful unions and between powerful unions and managements can cause widespread disruption. We should all strive to avoid it. That is an objective which commends itself to the country and to my right hon. and hon. Friends, even if not to right hon. and hon. Members opposite.<br/>
I come to the central point of registration. We have heard two arguments advanced from the benches opposite. I am not sure where we stand. To some, the whole concept of registration is intolerable because it embodies the idea of a State licence to operate.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that, under the 1871 Act, unions have a right to register or not, but the majority of the unions, because there are certain benefits, in regard to money and so forth, are registered? But if a union is not registered, it is not penalised, as will happen under the Bill. In other words, it is to the union's advantage to register, and most unions are, but they do not have to register. That is what we mean by a voluntary system.</p>

<p>Yes, that is a fair observation, but that which was good enough for 1871 is not necessarily good enough for 1971. When we have seen, over recent years, the Donovan Commission and the right hon. Lady both asserting that, in order to acquire the status of a trade union, a body should be required to register and exposed to various sanctions, we are surely entitled to regard that as reasonably common ground.<br/>
The only argument, I understand, is as to the nature of the sanctions. The Donovan Commission majority said that registration to qualify as a union should be secured by withdrawing immunities under Section 3 of the 1906 Act. The Donovan Commission minority recommendation said that it should be secured by financial sanctions. It was the latter which recommended itself to the right hon. Lady. We put forward a selection of measures and we say that certain new rights shall be available only to registered unions, and that registered unions shall comply with other obligations. I cannot see the room for reasonable argument, as it is looked at from the outside world, over the desirability and sense of registration of bodies which claim this status of trade unions.</p>

<p>One cannot be blamed for making a debating point of some value in the course of a debate. <br/>
What in fact are we attaching to the concept of registration? In essence, requirements as to the rules of those bodies, protection and remedies for the members of those bodies against the unions themselves and responsibility by the unions to conform to standards which arc to be laid down by the House for a modern society&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>.] The standards to be laid down are contained in Clause 61, the guiding principles. The distinction between the guiding principles and those dealt with in Schedule 3 is that Schedule 3 lists those matters in respect of which rules must say something, whereas Clause 61 sets down the standards to which the rules must conform on selected matters of particular importance. They are guiding principles for the guidance of organisations, registered or unregistered.<br/>
Again, I suggest to the Committee that it cannot be asserted that there is here something monstrous and wicked in the idea of requiring unions to register as such in this way. Nor is there something wrong, as one hon. Member opposite suggested, in trying to attach a corporate status to unions.<br/>
What is underlying this is paragraph 782 of the Report of the Donovan Commission:
<q>Law apart, we do not think that there is any doubt that most people look upon a trade union as something different from the members who compose it.</q>
The Commission then quotes Professor Dicey as saying:
<q>When a body of 20, or 2,000 or 200,000 men bind themselves together to act in a particular way for some common purpose, they create a body which by no fiction of law, but by the very nature of things, differs from the individuals of whom it is constituted.</q>

The Commission continues in this way:
<q>We think this is true; but even if it were not, we think that the time has come to clear away the uncertainties and obscurities which surround the position of trade unions at law, and that they should be granted corporate personality. In this we find ourselves at one with the Society of Labour Lawyers.</q>
<q>784. &#x2026; We think the better solution is the grant of corporate status to all trade unions. This will involve a concomitant liability to register, but the particulars to be registered would be common to all unions.</q>
Following this through on to paragraphs 791 and 792, this is not a voluntary register as the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West suggests. It is made perfectly clear in paragraph 791:
<q>&#x2026; a law which obliged the unregistered trade union in future to become registered would not, in our opinion, impose a hardship, work any injustice, or deprive unregistered unions of some valuable liberty.</q></p>

<p>I bow to your Ruling, Mr. Jennings. I am anxious to develop the argument. It is not a continuous quotation. Paragraph 792 of the Report contains these words:
<q>The definition of a trade union would be exclusively related to registered unions. New unions would be required to register within a stated period after formation.</q>
Going on from that to the requirements as to union rules, once again looking at the Donovan Report, and indeed at "In Place of Strife", they are to be requirements in respect of what union rules must deal with. Donovan makes it perfectly clear that the registrar is to have the power to ensure that the rules comply with the standards to be laid down by the House of Commons and that unions are to have time in which to see that their rules comply with those standards. This is the principle we are talking about.</p>

<p>The Solicitor-General said, I think&#x2014;perhaps he will confirm this, because there is some difficulty here&#x2014;that Clause 61&#x2014;the guiding principles is intended to apply to an organisation of workers whether it registers or not. Did the hon. and learned Gentleman mean to say that? Is that why it appears as a Clause and not in Schedule 3?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.631.0" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="631" time="">
<p>That is perfectly right. Clause 61(1) says:
<q>The principles set out in the following provisions of this section shall be guiding principles in the conduct of every organisation of workers, other than federations of workers' organisations.</q>
We believe that these principles are not unreasonable principles to lay down for the conduct of any organisation of this importance relating to the individuals belonging to it.<br/>
Can it be argued that it is wrong to lay down standards saying that a member or a person who seeks work and who is reasonably well qualified should be entitled to secure admission to a union membership of which is necessary for him to his job? This is the first principle. We cannot see that it can possibly be justified that an organisation should be entitled unreasonably to exclude from membership a man who is qualified for the work which that union regulates.<br/>
This again is at the heart of the approach of the Donovan Commission, because Donovan said that this does not happen very often, but that it is possible, without regulation of unions' rules, for a man to be hounded out of a job. Donovan quotes examples. We can all think of cases. There was the case of Mr. Bonsor years back who, having been expelled from his union, died scraping the barnacles off Brighton Pier because there was no set of guiding principles relating to the relations between him and his union.<br/>
Is it to be suggested that it is wrong for a man to have the right, on reasonable conditions and on reasonable notice, to terminate his membership of an organisation? We put that forward as a condition to be attached to registration.</p>

<p>Here is an example. A collective agreement is coming to an end. There is notice of a strike. A strike is to take place. A couple of people

want to "scab" on the rest of their fellows by saying, "We resign from the union, and we do not accept this". I thought that my hon.

<p>It would be a question for the rules of a particular union as to how far the conditions and length of notice given were reasonable in that case.<br/>

How can it be objected in those terms that somebody should not have the right, given reasonable notice and complying with any reasonable conditions, to terminate his membership? This is the difference of approach between the two sides of the Committee.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman has asked a question, and I respond to his invitation. We want to help him. We think that he is honestly flogging away at a loser. Why, he asks, should not a person have the right to resign? It concerns us to hear one of this country's leading and distinguished lawyers enunciating that principle. The hon. and learned Gentleman knows very well that, if he resigns from the Bar Council and does not pay his Bar fees, he will not be able to earn a living as a lawyer; he will be dependent entirely on his parliamentary salary, and a damn sight poorer than he is now.

<p>I practised at the Bar by virtue of qualifications which I secured from an institution, in the same way as anyone else taking professional qualifications secures them. Quite distinct from the qualifications which I gained, there is our trade union, the General Council of the Bar, to which I subscribe and to which I belong of free choice, from which I may resign at my free


choice, and on the executive of which I sat for a number of years, listening to some of my colleagues say that 90 per cent. membership of our trade union is not good enough. In that setting, as here, I argued that it was intolerable for the executive of that union to begin using coercive measures to secure the membership of the remaining 10 per cent. I could resign from that union and continue to practise, just as solicitors&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I will come to it. Until the hon. Gentleman interrupted I was asserting that people holding professional qualifications laid down independently are in no sense to be compared in this argument with those who do or do not belong to unions. This applies to any occupation. For example, society

lays down certain standards of competence to be achieved by barristers, doctors, colliery managers and shot-firers. They have to obtain specific statutory qualifications. If they do, they should be free to develop their skills and use their qualifications doing the work for which they are qualified. We also think that they should be encouraged to belong to trade unions and that agreements should be made with their employers to encourage them. But we stop short of the last point, the power of the trade union organisation to expel them on arbitrary or unreasonable grounds, to deny them the right to resign on reasonable notice. It is not unfair or unreasonable for society to lay down standards to which those organisations must conform. It is to that end that we think it not unreasonable for registration to be the foundation of the status of trade unions.</p>

<p>Clause 5(1) gives the individual an unqualified right
<q>to be a member of such union as he may choose.</q>
Is not the hon. and learned Gentleman by these two provisions allowing any individual the statutory right to hop in and out of any such union as he may wish, irrespective of the circumstances?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.634.1" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="634" time="">
<p>The concept of someone hopping in and out of a union is slightly bizarre. The right to resign is one to be exercised on giving reasonable notice and complying with reasonable conditions. The right not to admit, or the obligation to admit, is by reference to reasonable conditions. There is no doubt that if hopping in and out were a hazard it could be fairly regulated in that way.<br/>
I do not want to deal with the detail of that now. I return to the central theme. The idea of registration for these large organisations was put forward in Donovan and was asserted in "In Place of Strife". There may be room for argument about the particular conditions and particular points, but we assert with confidence that the time has come for unions, defined, enjoying the position of power and privilege that they now enjoy, to be required to register, and that it is not an unreasonable provision to include at the centre of this part of the Bill.</p>

<p>It is entirely right that we should have had this protracted debate, because we are dealing with one of the central issues of principle of the Bill. It is clear that a large number of hon. Members on both sides have been anxious to take part in the debate. Tragically, this means that because of the guillotine we shall have about three hours to debate the details of the rest of this large number of Clauses, yet every time we probe the Government on the details a new facet of what they propose comes to light.<br/>
We have just had a very interesting revelation from the Solicitor-General, which has entirely undermined the whole moral tone of his previous argument.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman admitted, under questioning from my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. John Fraser), that the principles laid down in Clause 61 are to apply to unregistered unions. I ask hon. Members opposite to think about what that means. I should like almost a moment's silence for the enormity of it to sink in. We nearly despair on this side of the Committee of ever getting through to hon. Members opposite just to what they are lending their names and their reputations. We gave up the Solicitor-General a long time ago. After all, he is the smoothest possible propagandist for his own brain child. He is like a besotted mother who cannot see a single fault in her own offspring. Of course we cannot get through to him. But we still retain hope of getting through to his hon. Friends, particularly since some glimmerings of comprehension have emerged in their speeches. I want to ask them to think for a moment about what he has just admitted.<br/>
It is not, in the case of Clause 61, a question of saying, as the hon. and learned Gentleman has said with such panache, that if unions want to enjoy the new privileges given by the Bill they should be prepared to register and accept control over their rules, because an unregistered union has no privilege at all. It has no bargaining rights; it cannot be a promoter of its own rights in an agency shop; it has no status in the bargaining unit or as a bargaining unit. All this was admitted to us yesterday. We know that, far from having privileges, an unregistered union is heaped with penalties under the Bill.<br/>
Again, it is not a question of saying, in the moving appeals to the general public of which we get so much from the Government, that it is necessary to protect society from powerful bodies which can, in the hon. and learned Gentleman's words, inflict grave damage. How can an unregistered union inflict damage? It has no legal right to strike at all under the Bill. It has no right to engage in any kind of irregular industrial action.</p>

<p>That is so. The hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. David Mitchell) shakes his head. He does not know what he is lending his name to or what he is voting for. The simple fact is that, if an unregistered union goes on strike, the protection of Section 3 of the 1906 Act is withdrawn. If an unregistered union goes on strike, it faces in specific terms under the Bill unlimited financial damages.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Lady explain the situation of an unregistered union which gives notice under its own procedure agreement? Will she say whether in that case there is any liability attaching at all?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is straining the normal definition of the right to strike. The Government themselves have to admit that it is almost impossible to have a strike without a breach of contract of employment. What they are doing is taking away something far more than just the protection of Section 3. The protection of Section 3, which gave to unions the present traditional immunity for action in furtherance of a trade dispute, does not apply under this Bill to an unregistered trade union. If such a union tries to operate such a strike, it faces actual unlimited damages. So how can an unregistered union inflict this grave damage that we were all told was the threat hanging over our heads? It is a body which has neither privileges nor power to inflict grave damage on the public interest.<br/>
Yes, despite that, the Government insist on the right under Clause 61 to tell an unregistered union whom it shall admit, what rights of terminating membership it shall give to its members, and, above


all, on applying to it the iniquitous provisions of subsection (7) which say that even though unregistered, it must write into its rules the freedom of its members to defy the Government's views, the Government's definition of an unfair industrial practice, the Government's definition of a closed shop, the Government's definition of the 100 per cent. union shop, the Government's definition of sympathetic action, as its right to exist.<br/>
I say to hon. Members opposite advisedly that this is sheer control for control's sake and this is why we say that the Bill reveals that we have a totalitarian Government and a totalitarian Bill, and that is no exaggeration. I suggest that hon. Members go away and talk it over and check it and think about it and consider the sort of high-handed actions with which they are associating themselves.<br/>
As for the rest; as usual, in a perfunctory speech, the Solicitor-General begged the whole question of the registration of unions. He said that no other major organisation would object to this public scrutiny. That is not the question. The trade union movement is subject to public scrutiny and the law of the land. There are more Questions in the House and debates in the House about the activities of trade unions than anything else. Of course they are subject to the law of the land. The question we are debating tonight is the trade unions' objection to what the Government propose.<br/>
I am confident that hon. Members opposite have not grasped the central theme of this part of the Bill and its meaning. What do the Government want and what do they seek to do through this part of the Bill? It is apposite to begin by saying that the practice of other countries has been quoted to us time and time again in justification of what the Government are doing, but there is not one Western industrial nation with registration provisions of this kind in its law, with this kind of control by the Registrar, with this scope of power of the registrar, with this discretionary action given to the registrar and, after him, to the courts. This is the exclusive brainchild of the Government.<br/>
We are told, and this is becoming the whole tenor of the speeches of the Solicitor-

General, that this is all in the Donovan Report and all in "In Place of Strife". I repeat my offer to the Solicitor-General&#x2014;if he thinks so much of "In Place of Strife," why does he not base his Bill on it? The answer is that we should have had something not designed to exercise a tyranny over the trade union movement, but generally designed to strengthen it. The fact is that the Donovan Report and the Bill are as different as chalk from cheese, and that is why the Government have to misrepresent it.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
At every stage of the Government's argument, when they ought to have been justifying these tyrannical new principles, we have merely had a misrepresentation of Donovan as the sole argument. We have had it over the imposition of procedure agreements. We have been told that it was all in Donovan, but when we turn up Donovan we find the contrary. We find that Donovan was never. under any circumstances, present or future, in favour of enforcing agreements that had not first of all been voluntarily agreed. I quoted the other day from Donovan, and that is on the record.<br/>
We have been told lies about Donovan on the imposition of procedure agreements. In the same way the position over registration is being deliberately distorted. Donovan was never in favour of making a condition of registration the acceptance of rules that the union had not agreed. That is the great dividing line, that is the great gulf that comes between us, the essential and enduring difference, and that is what we mean by a voluntary system.<br/>
We cannot impose on trade unions rules which they have not agreed and above all we cannot impose on them rules which do violence to their own innate principles and tell them, "Swallow it or die". That is what the Government are doing here. Neither Donovan nor the Labour Government in "In Place of Strife" ever made the compulsory registration of trade unions a central part of the industrial relations problem. The Solicitor-General gave us the evidence for this when he read from Donovan pointing out that the whole concept of compulsory legislation started from the idea that it might help unions to give them corporate status. It flows from that


that they would have to register. It did not flow from any necessity of the industrial relations situation; it did not flow from any evidence that the unions were abusing their power either in relation to their own members or in relation to the community.<br/>
It could not be put more explicitly than at paragraph 622 of Donovan. Here Donovan points out that the research people had endeavoured to find out what evidence there was of abuse by trade unions as a result of the fact that they were free to draw up their own rules. Donovan concluded as follows:
<q>But the general conclusion can, we think, be drawn with reasonable safety that if the questioning of some 500 trade unionists and 400 non-unionists selected at random yields so little in the way of adverse criticism it is unlikely that abuse of power by trade unions is widespread.</q></p>

<p>I agree he said that on occasions it happens. [<i>Laughter</i>.] Of course. It is essential in the light of all this talk about the power to wield damage on the community or on individual members that Donovan's basic conclusion should be put on the record. No one on this side of the Committee has ever argued that trade union rules are perfect or that trade union behaviour is perfect. We do not have to, because there is not a single organisation in the community that can go into a white sheet of perfection. Let us be realistic and face up to that. The question is, what is the size of this little nut for which the Government are bringing up this great hammer?<br/>
There was never any question in the Donovan Report of trying to dictate the content or even the principle of union rules. The Donovan Report pointed out that 85 per cent. of the total trade union membership was already in registered organisations on a voluntary basis. It said that the rules were not very onerous and that they needed to be extended in clarity and perhaps in scope, but time and again it came back to the theme which the Government are violating, namely, that better safeguards for individual members must be achieved
<q>without impairing the freedom which trade unions ought to enjoy to frame rules to meet their own circumstances".</q>

That is what is at issue and that is what the Government are violating.<br/>
Of course, this was the theme of "In Place of Strife". If the Secretary of State wants to hide behind "In Place of Strife", let him live up to the following principles. We said in paragraph 107:
<q>'"The Royal Commission found no evidence of widespread abuse of union power.</q>
We went on to say that we wanted the trade unions
<q>to conduct their business according to clear and comprehensive rules, and to deal fairly with any dispute between the union or its officers and the individual member.</q>
But we went on:
<q>This must be done in ways that are compatible with trade union internal self-government and independence.</q>
We said in paragraph 109:
<q>Unions will be free to frame rules to meet their own requirements and the Industrial Relations Bill will not propose that there should be provision for them to be challenged except on the ground that they do not adequately cover the subjects specified.</q>
That is what the Donovan Report said in its section on rules. It pointed out that there must be rules which deal adequately with the problem of elections and how a ballot is conducted if one is held and which deal adequately with rights of appeal, and so on. No one disputes that that is the end. There is nothing unacceptable in those principles. I, and no doubt many of my hon. Friends, would go further. I do not believe that there is any objection in principle to compulsory registration. It depends on how it is done and for what purposes. I am one of those who, as a back bencher, pressed for a long time for the compulsory registration of hairdressers because it is in their interests and in the interests of the community; and they want it. It is Governments who have always refused to concede it.<br/>
Of course, compulsory registration can be a good or an evil thing according to the conditions imposed and the purposes for which it is introduced. But there is no point in having compulsory registration if one's aims can ix., achieved in some other way. It is a bad principle to have compulsion for compulsion's sake. The fact is that we are achieving our aims in another way, and that is why our Industrial Relations Bill did not include provisions for compulsory registration.


The hon. Member for Basingstoke was right when he quoted from a survey into union rules conducted by the T.U.C. He seemed to think that it strengthened his case because the T.U.C. said that a lot of rules were defective. It does not strengthen his case; it strengthens ours. Our case is that long before the Government produced their Bill, way back in June, 1969, stimulated by the Donovan Report into voluntary action, the T.U.C. proceeded to issue circular after circular to its members. 1 have them here. We might put them in the Vote Office and then some hon. Members might get some enlightenment of what the T.U.C. is doing about trade union rules.</p>

<p>I am glad that the right hon. Lady has taken my point. All I said was that this indicated the need for a change in union rules, but the right hon. Lady will surely admit that those recommendations of the T.U.C. have not been put into effect. If they had been put into effect, the sort of rules which were quoted earlier would not now still be on the union rule book.</p>

<p>Of course, there is need for change in union rules. The T.U.C. admits it and has never said that the system is perfect and untouchable. It has said only that if we are to remain a free society we must do this for ourselves. This is the difference between us, and this is what was said in Donovan.<br/>
The hon. Member for Ilford, North (Mr. Iremonger) asked what was the difference in the T.U.C. overhauling rules, or taking internal discipline measures, or deciding who had the right to call a strike and somebody else doing these things. There is, of course, a difference in principle. First and foremost, there are the iniquitous principles of Clause 61. The Government are saying that by law these repugnant principles are to be written into trade union rules. The big difference, which has been overlooked, lies in the policing power given to the Registrar. It is this which is unique and new and it is this the Government have never explained to the House. This is what the Government hide, and the fact that they hide it reveals their true aim. The Government's true aim is not that the union should be well-run in the interests of its members, but that it should be run in the interests of Government

policy. What the T.U.C. objects to is that the Registrar will control not only the content of rules, but their operation. The House must weigh the implications of Clauses 73, 77 and 79 in which the registrar can go to court and demand the cancellation of a union's registration because it does not fulfil that vague and dangerous phrase,
<q>any other requirements imposed by the Registrar".</q>
Then there is Clause 11, which is the bother-causer Clause, under which any person who was, is or wants to become, a member of a union can make application to the Registrar and say, "That union is breaking the rules or breaking the registrar's principles." That complaint can be taken to the court and backed by legal sanctions. Or there is Clause 79, the "spying" Clause, under which, if the registrar has reason to suspect that there has been a serious or persistent breach of rules or action in serious contravention of the principles of Clause 61, he can haul a union before the court.</p>

<p>I have made a very brief reference indeed, Mr. Jennings, but it is essential to the argument to say that it is the policing of these rules by the registrar which is one of the most iniquitous practices to which we object. It is this which gives significance to paragraph 10 of Schedule 3 which, unfortunately, we shall never have time to examine in detail.<br/>
Of course, the rules should say who has authority to call a strike. The T.U.C. says this, and it has circularised the unions saying that they should have that in the rules. Indeed, the T.U.C. went further. It said that it should be laid down in the rules who should have the right to conduct a strike. It is an entirely different thing to include such rules in a voluntary system rather than in a system which at every turn is regulated by legal sanctions. It must be remembered under these Clauses that a union can be taken to the Industrial Court for a breach of this rule and it will face cancellation of registration by order of the court to


prevent a continuance of the breach of that rule. So that all freedom of action by a union in, for example, a Pilkington situation, has been forfeited under this group of Clauses. Because the right hon. Gentleman cannot or will not see any difference between that and Donovan, he has forfeited all credibility in industrial relations.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
This policy puts a monstrously unfair burden on the shop steward. It is impregnated with the assumption that the only people who ever cause strikes are the shop stewards, the unions, or the workers. Never at any point is recognition made that strike after strike is caused by management, not only because it refuses recognition or dismisses unfairly, but because it is bad management.<br/>
I was given an example only the other day by the district secretary of one of our major unions working in a key plant in the motor industry. He told me of an occasion on which he had to negotiate with his local management on the duration of an unofficial strike. Hon. Gentlemen opposite have no idea what happens in industry. Here was a case where conditions were bad. The men made a complaint not about pay, but to get local conditions rectified. Because, in this multi-plant company, management had not delgated authority for action down to local management level, the local manager had to say to the union, "Bring the lads out and they will soon move at headquarters and give me authority to meet your complaint, which I think is justified.</p>

<p>fled". So they negotiated about how short a period of unofficial strike would be necessary for the men to get a legitimate grievance regularised. This happens time and again in industry.</p>

<p>The Bill puts no responsibilities and penalties on management. The Bill and this provision has been in the minds of Conservative lawyers since 1959.

Twelve years ago the lawyers of the Conservative Party were spelling out how we ought to have this type of registration and regulation. This was not at a time when according to the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State the unions were too powerful. This was the period when he said that they were so weak that the closed shop was justified.</p>

<p>But it was already the policy of the Solicitor-General, who is now in a position to carry it out and thrust it upon us. The hon. and learned Gentleman is answering the debate today because the Bill is not conceived in terms of improving industrial relations. If it were, it would be the responsibility of the Secretary of State to deal with this important section of the debate. It is a lawyer's brainchild. It was a tragic day for the Conservative Party and for this country when the Secretary of State put his own more practical judgment in pawn to lawyers who could not see beyond their noses.</p>

<p>I have been asked by a body which does not have a representative in the House of Commons to bring to the Minister's attention certain anomalies which will arise on the clause.<br/>
Kangaroo courts and star chambers have been referred to today, but the Bill makes no mention of the disciplinary bodies which many employers' associations have. A group of us have tabled an Amendment to Schedule 3, which relates to suspensions or fines imposed on trade unionists by certain employers. Although the Bill provides that unions rules must be approved by the C.I.R., there is no provision that the rules of employers' associations must be so approved.<br/>
The rules I have in mind are those of "undisciplinary" bodies, from which a man can obtain a decision as to whether his suspension or dismissal is unfair.<br/>
Under the Bill it will be possible for there to be suspension for 14 days on full pay, followed by another period of suspension for 14 days, rather on the lines of the South Africa detention laws, and the suspension can be continued in perpetuity,

even on full pay, without the criticism of unfair dismissal being invoked. An anomaly could arise which is not catered for by the Clause.<br/>
I will give two examples of, behaviour which results indisciplinary action. A miner who takes a cigarette down a coalmine can be suspended, fined or dismissed. A trawlerman going on board drunk can be suspended or fined. In each case the trade union representative sits on the disciplinary body.<br/>
The Professional Footballers' Association is a trade union affiliated to the T.U.C. It works for a <i>bona fide</i> employers' associations from whose disciplinary court there is no appeal. The employers' association has a disciplinary body for the Football Association and the Football League on which the trade union&#x2014;the Professional Footballers' Association&#x2014;is not represented.<br/>
A professional footballer can be sent off during a game and, unless he pays the costs of the disciplinary court, he cannot even have a personal hearing. In other words, the court sits in secret without the Press being present and then may sentence him to be suspended for six weeks without pay or to a fine of up to &#x00A3;300 and often the trade unionist is not heard.<br/>
10.0 p.m.<br/>
That might be fine in the case of Georgie Best, Peter Osgood or someone like that who can afford it, but the Professional Footballers' Association is concerned about the lower-paid players in the fourth division who cannot afford it


but who may well have to face, as trade unionists, &#x00A3;70 or &#x00A3;80 costs of the body which sits to sentence them before they can have a personal hearing.<br/>
In our view&#x2014;I am sure that the Minister and hon. Members opposite agree&#x2014;that is a complete denial of any sort of freedom. In effect, it is worse than a kangaroo court because, at least, at a kangaroo court a man has the right to face his accusers. The professional footballer does not have that right unless he pays for it.<br/>
Often, outside evidence such as television films is not admitted in evidence. There have been occasions when the Football Association or the Football League has suspended players for life, taking away their livelihood, following a court case involving bribery or unfair practices, as in the case of Swan, Kaye and Layne. The Professional Footballers' Association in such cases has not even been allowed to represent them at the hearing. It has been a completely open and shut case, without proper representation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.655.0" hansard_membership_id="7823" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30376" speakername="Mr. Kenneth Lewis" colnum="655" time="">
<p>The truth is that every professional football player is permitted to be represented by someone who can speak for him, whether someone in the club or a representative of the Professional Footballers' Association. Furthermore, the statement which the hon. Gentleman has just made is quite contrary to the truth, for, only the other day, when a player was suspended, there was a run-through of the television film in evidence.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.655.1" hansard_membership_id="424" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2349" speakername="Mr. Ashton" colnum="655" time="">
<p>That is not generally true about the run-through of television films, although it is desired, and Mr. Cliff Lloyd, the secretary of the P.F.A., assures us that players are not allowed to have legal aid or to be legally represented.<br/>
It is easy in such circumstances for an employers' association like the Football Association or the Football League to run a disciplinary court which is totally unfair to the trade unionists involved. It may be said that the trade unionists concerned should take industrial action, should refuse to play, or should refuse to sign contracts. But in many cases they sign their contracts at the tender age of 16 or 17, and the registration is held by the club.<br/>
It is possible for the club to deprive a player of his livelihood simply because he said something on television which the employers do not like. There was the case of Jack Charlton who referred to a certain incident on television, using the same right of free speech which any hon. Member would wish to exercise, but he lost money by being dropped out of the England team because of it, and with no right of appeal because of a rule operated by an employers' association which said that he should not say anything which the employers thought might bring the game into disrepute.<br/>
We say that the rule books of employers' associations, too, should be open to examination by a reference to the C.I.R. Also, we draw attention to the suspension tactic, which is not prevalent in just one industry. Just before Christmas, there was the case of Mr. Terry Devey, reported in <i>The Times</i> and covered in full in my local newspaper, the <i>Sheffield Morning Telegraph.</i> I give credit to the investigation which it made.<br/>
Terry Devey is a shop steward who was paid &#x00A3;3,000 [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I hope that hon. Members do not think that I am mentioning it because I am having a bitter battle about the "demo" the other night. Compensation of &#x00A3;3,000 was paid to Mr. Terry Devey afer a five-week dispute at Batchelors in Sheffield, which closely affected many of my constituents.<br/>
After the men had lost five weeks' strike pay, just before Christmas, the shop steward accepted &#x00A3;3,000 rehabilitation money, as it was called. I do not know whether it was provided in the employers' association rule book that one could break procedures which had been laid down or break the usual methods for settling disputes in that way. It is certainly a tactic which has never been used to my knowledge, and it is one which we do not want to see adopted again. Employers' associations' rule books are far from ideal.<br/>
I do not intend to press the matter to a vote, but I hope the Minister will look at the question of suspension, particularly when the trade unionists and the trade unions do not have proper rights of representation.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend does his homework very diligently in the main,


but apparently he has not done so this time. If a man takes a cigarette down a pit, that is a breach of the mines regulations. The manager deals with it, and if the trade union representative thinks that the sentence is too severe, he makes representations to the management. The trade union does not sit on the disciplinary court.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but the fact is that there are the powers to make representations to the management. That is part of the negotiating procedure. But if the Professional Footballers' Association feels that someone has been dealt with too harshly for telling the referee that he does not like his face, the association has no power to appeal against the sentence.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will look at this question of suspensions. It could lead to a South African-detention type of law, with 14 days, even on full pay, renewed every 14 days, without the employer bothering to dismiss the man or go to the court. Under the existing set-up, the matter could not be referred to the court, because the man would still be employed and the employer would still be paying his stamp and, in some cases, his basic wage. It is a major anomaly that should be examined.</p>

<p>If I respond briefly, it is not out of any disrespect for the hon. Gentleman's point, because I know that it represents the same argument as underlies the Amendment he has tabled to Schedule 3.<br/>
The r&#x00F4;le played by employers' associations in some situations in disciplining employees is distinct from any provisions in the Bill. The provisions of the Clause are those which regulate and define employers' associations. Such an organisation <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> its own members must comply with the same guiding principles under Clause 65, and cannot be registered as an employers' association unless it is shown to have rules conforming to it. I take the hon. Gentleman's point that the fact that the employers' association, if registered, and even if not registered, is required to be fair to its own members, does not meet the situation he is putting where an association has disciplinary or semi-disciplinary powers over employees. This situation exists in some places, and

in some cases it is a subject either of collective bargaining or statutory regulation.<br/>
The hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) spoke about the coal industry, where it is clear by Statute and collective bargaining that unfair disciplinary measures by the colliery manager can be challenged by the union on behalf of the worker concerned. if what the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Ashton) says is right, it is plain that there is no comparable machinery in respect of the professional footballer <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the association in question. It would be difficult to resolve that in the context of the Bill, because we are not here seeking to regulate relations between employers and individuals by setting up statutory schemes for discipline comparable, for examples, with that set up under the National Docks Labour Board. It requires a very special exercise of analysis to devise something like that.<br/>
Quite apart from the relevance, admissibility or acceptability of the hon. Gentleman's point in the context of this legislation, certainly the Department of Employment would be more than willing to meet such people as are appropriate to investigate further the facts underlying the point the hon. Gentleman raised to see whether, even if not within the Bill, it is something in respect of which help or guidance could be given.<br/>
I hope that, in the circumstances, that will be regarded as a sufficient answer to the hon. Gentleman's point.</p>

<p>I shall also make a very short speech on the question of the appointment of the registrar. We listened with great interest earlier to the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mrs. Castle), who said that she accepted the view of registration and the idea that there should be some supervision of trade union rules in relation to accountancy, ballots, membership, election of officers and so on. It seems that the only parts of the Bill objected to would be Clause 61(7) and paragraphs 6 and 10 of Schedule 3. It seems, therefore, that it would be appropriate that the Registrar and his assistants should have legal training of some sort.<br/>
Can my hon. and learned Friend explain whether the whole of the responsibilities of the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies as they apply to trade unions will be transferred to the new Registrar of Trade Unions and Employers' Associations? I do not believe that this is made clear in the Bill. This move would be in connection with the investments of trade unions and employers associations and the handling of questions in connection with political funds and their rules. These are the main categories on which we would like elucidation.</p>

<p>May I recall our earlier discussions and ask the Solicitor-General to give a reply about the existence of friendly societies? Can he tell us whether an unregistered union can continue to register under the Friendly Societies Act in the way in which it has done over the years? Is an unregistered union prevented from doing so, even though a sectional exclusion is mentioned in the Bill?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.659.2" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="659" time="">
<p>I will deal first with the point raised by the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Atkinson), because he raised it in an earlier discussion. The position is that a trade union&#x2014;indeed an organisation of workers registered or unregistered&#x2014;is not under this Bill entitled to register under the Friendly Societies Act. This is as a result of Clause 140(1)<i>(b).</i><br/>
I point out to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. John Page) that the Bill transfers to the new Registrar of Trade Unions the functions of the present Registrar of Friendly Societies in relation to the Registrar</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.660.0" colnum="660" time="">
<p>of trade unions the functions of the present Registrar of friendly Societies in relation to the registration of trade unions and in relation to trade unions. That is provided for by Schedule 7. It does not transfer what I might call the friendly society functions; although this does not prevent the possibility of the same person holding the registrarship of both friendly societies and trade unions. This is hiving-off the trade unions from the Registrar of Friendly Societies' work but not the other aspects. I hope that sufficiently explains the position.</p>

<p>May we assume from what the Solicitor-General says that he is conscious of the amount of money involved for the average non-registered trade union, which would have to find an enormous sum of money?</p>

<p>Yes, I noted that point the hon. Gentleman made of that. The size of the funds will vary not only according to the size of the union, but according to a whole range of factors affecting its history, and the larger funds are associated with some of the older unions, as the hon. Gentleman said.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.660.4" hansard_membership_id="725" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22787" speakername="Mr. Atkinson" colnum="660" time="">

<p>I noted the figures which the hon. Gentleman gave. It is clear that an organisation which was unregistered could not qualify as a friendly society, but, once registered, it could immediately recover, or continue, all the benefits currently available under the Incomes and Corporation Taxes Act, 1970, in respect of provident society funds, which is what it now enjoys. Under the 1871 Act, registration enables a trade union to enjoy the benefits of a friendly society in respect of provident funds, while registration under the Bill would carry the same consequences, but it would not be admissible for an unregistered organisation.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 741, in page 47, line 9, leave out 'reasonably well' and insert:
<q>'eligible under the rules of the organisation to be admitted as a member and'.</q>
In some respects, this Amendment is a continuation of the previous debate. We have reached the crucial Clause 61 which the trade union movement finds particularly obnoxious and which, as a result of the powers given to the Registrar by it, means we are at least heading for a corporate State. Certainly it is corporate State thinking.<br/>
We think that the words "reasonably well" are dangerous and can lead to a series of complications within unions and can dilute the character of some unions, particularly those which are craft based.<br/>
[Miss HARVIE ANDERSON <i>in the Chair</i>]<br/>
10.30 p.m.<br/>
The trade union to which I belong, which is a craft organisation, the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, has just united with the Association of Building Trade Technicians, with the bricklayers' union and with the painters' union. I say this for the benefit of those hon. Members opposite who believe that the trade union movement never makes any progress towards amalgamations and unifications. The facts are that within that united organisation we shall continue to have trade sections. For example, it would be unrealistic if a bricklayer was in exactly the section as a joiner or if a joiner was in the same section as a painter, and so on. That is so obvious it hardly needs to be said, but it is important to point the facts.<br/>
We do not regard the number of years of apprenticeship, be they four or five or whatever may be the figure, as magic figures. There has been some argument over the years about what the apprenticeship period should be. I myself was in apprenticeship for seven years. At one time it went down to five years, and has now gone down to four. We argue that the number of years can be varied according to the type of training required to carry out a particular job. Therefore, we

must be flexible in the matter of apprenticeship.<br/>
My organisation accepts workers who have been trained in Government training centres. There was some argument about this matter. Naturally, in areas of high unemployment workers are deeply concerned about workers trained in Government centres who can take work in a particular trade after only a short period of such training. But we have been flexible and have taken in those members in certain circumstances and conditions. However, the Clause says that we have to open our doors to an unlimited number of workers whether or not we wish to have them. The only requirement is that they should be "reasonably well qualified members of the organisation. What is meant by "reasonably well qualified"?<br/>
One hon. Member opposite said he felt a little disquiet over this point. The Solicitor-General mentioned in this connection people trained as solicitors or barristers. He said that to be a barrister one had to be a member of the Bar Council, but a person could operate in that profession if he had the qualifications and did not have to belong to a trade union. In our trade union we have to have definite qualifications. If anybody believes that without years of training they can make or hang those doors at the other end of the Chamber, then they do not understand that ours is a highly qualifield and skilled craft. Part of our trade union organisation involves the maintenance of skilled craftsmanship as an important element of our system. Yet the Bill says that they have to be "reasonably well qualified". That is all.<br/>
What does "reasonably well qualified" mean? There are people who pick up the trade and become what we call bodgers. They do all kinds of odd jobs, and make an absolute mess of them. Nevertheless, it could be argued that they are "reasonably well qualified" and that the union must accept them. If the union does not accept them, they can make a complaint. It is not just a question of acceptance of Clause 61&#x2014;</p>

<p>Clause 62 specifically states:
<q>It shall be an unfair industrial practice for any organisation of workers, or any official


of or person acting on behalf of such an organisation, to take or threaten to take any action against any member of the organisation or other person in contravention of the principles set out in section 61 of this Act.</q>
That deals particularly with subsection (7).<br/>

<p>Only because 1 should not want to see that unflattering description of bodgers go unchallenged. "Bodger" is the name given to craftsmen who turn out chair legs in the furniture industry, and they do their job well.</p>

<p>I am talking about bodgers in the building industry. I assure the hon. Gentleman that they do not turn out chair legs very well.<br/>
Incidentally, for the hon. Gentleman's information, although I am sure that he knows, my union, A.S.W., and N.U.F.T.O. have an agreement to accept each other's cards, because it is recognised that the members of each union are trained craftsmen, able to do woodworking of one kind or another, who may from time to time have to exchange their particular industries.<br/>
That, incidentally, raises another point relating to an agency shop or the sole bargaining agency. In a shop where the A.S.W. became the sole bargaining agent, N.U.F.T.O. members would have to join the A.S.W. or become non-unionists, or vice versa. This is one further example of the complication in the Bill.<br/>
Trade unions will be faced with the problem that their strength is likely to be undermined because they have to accept people who are not acceptable. The membership would be taken out of their control in that sense and would be determined by the registrar. It would also be damaging to the skills of the particular trades.<br/>
I should like to point out what Donovan says about admission in paragraph 650:
<q>The rules should state who is qualified for admission to the trade union &#x2026; but"&#x2014;</q>
this is the point&#x2014;
<q>unions must be allowed to retain discretion in deciding whom they should admit.</q></p>

<p>May I ask the hon. Gentleman to read the clause which lies between the two Clauses which he read? It is not even a continuous quotation. if the hon. Gentleman will start at the beginning of paragraph 650 and read the first two sentences the Committee will have the meaning.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.670.1" hansard_membership_id="5612" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11612" speakername="Mr. Heffer" colnum="670" time="">
<p>Certainly. It says:
<q>They should be framed in such a way as to avoid discriminating arbitrarily against any type of applicant, but unions must be allowed to retain discretion in deciding whom they should admit.</q>
That is precisely what happens now in my organisation. That is the position.<br/>
I think that I was a little more courteous to the Solicitor-General just now in giving way than he was to me, because when I wanted to intervene when he was speaking during the last debate he refused to give way. I do not know why. I have never refused to give way to anybody, whether I have been on the back benches, or speaking from this Box. At no time have I refused to give way, and I hope that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen will be equally courteous when we debate issues of fundamental importance to the trade union movement.<br/>
The situation referred to in the Donovan Report is precisely that which exists in most trade unions, and certainly in my organisation. We have rules by which a person can apply for membership. If the branch turns him down&#x2014;because he has to apply to the branch&#x2014;he must be told at the branch meeting, and at that point he has the right of appeal to the national executive committee, and there have been occasions when, on appeal to the national executive, the executive has decided to allow the person concerned into the organisation. That happens now. We do not need the law to provide for that, and it is obvious that in introducing this proposal the Solicitor-General is unnecessarily introducing a law at a stage at which it is not needed.<br/>
Trade union rules are flexible in relation to the admittance of people into trade union organisations. During an earlier debate, I think that it was the Solicitor-General himself who said that all the Government were hoping to do by having this guiding principle was to bring the backward trade unions up to the standards of the best unions, but this proposal goes


beyond that. The Bill says that people must be accepted by trade unions whether the trade unions want them or not. I have already referred to the problem of unemployment. If there is a high level of unemployment, why should a trade union be forced, in those circumstances, to accept people whom it has no wish to accept?<br/>
There are many arguments about what "reasonably well qualified" means. Who, for example, is a "reasonably well qualified" docker? Most hon. Gentlemen opposite would not last five minutes on Liverpool docks. None of them is reasonably well qualified to be a Liverpool docker, and neither am I. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, someone could be regarded as being reasonably well qualified. One has only to ask what the phrase means to realise just how absurd it is.<br/>
I shall ask my hon. Friends to support the Amendment, and I trust that on this occasion the Solicitor-General, or the Secretary of State, will accept the force of the argument that is put forward and realise that we are arguing a sensible and practical case. This is important to craft trade unions in particular, and to all trade unions in general. This is a matter of great importance to us, and we ask the Government to accept that the Amendment is put forward in the best interests of the trade union movement.</p>

<p>Before replying to the points made by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) on the Amendment, may I say that I hope that I have always tried to give way as often and as graciously as I can and should. If I was discourteous to the hon. Gentleman during the previous debate, I apologise, but one has always to judge between making progress in the debate and in one's speech, and being over-generous in giving way. I certainly did not intend to be discourteous to him.<br/>
10.45 p.m.<br/>
In this subsection the Government do not intend to prevent organisations laying down their own standards and rules. It is clear that the organisation can prepare its own rules. We say that a prospective member
<q>&#x2026; shall not, by way of any arbitrary or unreasonable discrimination, be excluded from membership &#x2026;</q>

so that the person who is reasonably well qualified for employment should not be arbitrarily or unreasonably discriminated against. This leaves it entirely free for a union or organisation to lay down clear and specific grounds on which a person shall not be admitted or should be expelled. A person with a bad membership record would not have any right to admission. A person with no qualifications at all or who had manifestly poor qualifications would not be entitled to admission. We accept the case for the concept of craft unions and qualifications. The unions have played their part in asserting and raising standards. But there comes a point where qualifications defined in that way are being used as the foundation for excluding people who ought to be entitled to be admitted to particular kinds of work.<br/>
If one has, for example, a rule&#x2014;as one has in some unions&#x2014;that only a son or grandson of a former union member or a former employee in a particular kind of work should be admitted, how can that be justified? Suppose that people who are superlatively qualified by any standards for the trade which that union is regulating are confronted with rules which say, "I am sorry, but whatever your qualifications you cannot be admitted because you do not meet this arbitrary &#x2026;"&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am trying to get to the argument of the debate. It may be asserted by some hon. Members opposite that entry should be founded upon the hereditary principle. I have not heard it widely argued.<br/>
I suggest that it would not be acceptable to either side of the Committee to accept the existence of arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination in respect of well qualified people.<br/>
We accept the case for sections and branches. The wording of the Clause:
<q>Any person who applies for membership of the organisation, or of a branch or section of the organisation &#x2026;</q>
makes perfectly clear that different standards of qualification for different skills in different branches and sections would be acceptable. I take the point about the ex tent to which unions are merging. One of the ways of facilitating


this is the existence of different sections with different skills, as part of the conglomerate. We accept that reasonable standards should be laid down. The only point on which we insist is that there should not be arbitrary discrimination against the background of reasonable qualification.</p>

<p>I am worried about the definition of "reasonably well". I see the difficulties which the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heller) has raised. Looking at it practically, I find it hard to understand how one could define "reasonably well qualified". Is it not possible to delete those two words and leave it as "qualified"? What would be the disadvantage of doing it in that way?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.673.1" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="673" time="">
<p>I take my hon. Friend's point. It marches in line with my next point, and I will answer it.<br/>
In the Report of the Donovan Commission, there are two paragraphs dealing with the relationship between training and the right of admission to organisations. Paragraph 358 says:
<q>Once objective standards have been laid down by which qualification for skilled work can be judged, trade unions should review their rule books and make any revision of the rules necessary to ensure that no qualified worker will be arbitrarily denied either the right of admission to the union or the right to use the skills which he has acquired. Failing this, any worker who alleges that he or she is qualified to do skilled work but has nevertheless been refused membership of the union &#x2026; should have the right of appeal to the independent review body &#x2026;</q>
In that paragraph, the word is exactly as my hon. Friend puts it: "qualified", rather than "reasonably well qualified". The intention is that people who are qualified should have the right of admission. But, in many sections of industry at the moment, we have not got clearly laid down objective qualifications. It is a matter which will have to be judged, as we think, in the light of conditions in the industry and in the light of the applicant concerned.<br/>
To say "qualified" would imply a plainly identifiable standard. If one takes the case of people who have been through Government training centres and who have achieved qualifications which may not march in line with any statutory

or clear standard or any pre-existing union standard, we think that the tribunal which will consider this should be entitled to say whether they are "reasonably well qualified". It is in order to provide that flexibility that the provision is worded in that way. I hope that that meets my hon. Friend's point.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.674.0" hansard_membership_id="6922" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29825" speakername="Mr. Hugh Jenkins" colnum="674" time="">
<p>Perhaps I might press the hon. and learned Gentleman a little further on this, because it may help the Committee to understand precisely what "qualification" can mean.<br/>
The word can have a variety of meanings. An apprentice, for instance, is obviously qualified when he has served his time. One can have other circumstances in which a person has no qualification that he can present, other than the fact that he has been offered a job. That might be considered a reasonable qualification. Would a union be acting arbitrarily and unreasonably if it refused admission to someone who had no job on the ground that he would be adding to the unemployment in the area, or could it properly refuse admission because the person had not the necessary qualification of an offer of employment?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1971-02-10a.674.1" hansard_membership_id="387" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16355" speakername="The Solicitor-General" colnum="674" time="">
<p>I appreciate the sector with which the hon. Gentleman is concerned. The possession or non-possession of a job probably would be difficult to identify as a reasonably good qualification. On the other hand, the length of service in a job of the same kind would probably amount to a qualification.<br/>
In the case of Equity, X years' or months' service in previous jobs could well be regarded as qualification by service&#x2014;as one of several; there are others. There are no precise and exact qualifications or certificates. Cases would have to be looked at according to the conditions of the industry and the union operating in it.<br/>
We cannot accept that there is any single magic statutory form of qualification which can be encapsulated more precisely than others. On the other hand, we cannot accept that, against the background of reasonable standards, a union should be entitled to exclude from employment in a trade someone who is manifestly qualified for the job and being arbitrarily and unreasonably excluded from it.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heller) made a reasonable case about the craft unions, and there is another complex point about the general worker unions, like dock workers. Entry of the industry often starts with a sort of routine operation, and one proceeds to the more skilled operations on ships and in the docks.<br/>
The phrase "reasonably well qualified" can be interpreted in so many ways. Those who applied for the more skilled occupations on the docks and aboard ships would naturally say that some part of the labour force needed no expertise or qualifications, and they could call in aid this terminology.<br/>
People who were well qualified might be the subject of argument as to whether they were "reasonably" well qualified. I can imagine a heyday for those who use words and law as an occupation and who would make the reverse argument, that a man could be reasonably qualified but not well qualified. The situation for these unions is too blurred for clear definition, and this would be bad law.<br/>
With these other occupations, for which there are no diplomas or professional standing, people might transfer from one occupation to another, because of unemployment, on the basis that they were reasonably well qualified for any occupation. This would never do.<br/>
I am more concerned with the case law which would follow this legislation. Might not any court conclude that no

one could be debarred from membership on the basis that he did not possess the appropriate qualifications?<br/>
Paragraph 650 of Donovan shows that the unions have the necessary knowledge and information to protect their rules and constitution, and therefore shows those who are eligible for membership of the various general worker unions, and the various crafts and firms and extra specialities involved. This would be adequately covered by the Amendment. It would cover the situation to such an extent that there would be no dubiety.<br/>
If the Secretary of State is concerned about registration and believes that the Clauses concerning registration would provide adequate protection, I cannot understand his reluctance to accept the concept that the trade unions should be left, with their experience, to draw up appropriate rules; because the Registrar, under preceding Clauses, would have the control and, if he thought that the rules did not sufficiently indicate the qualifications which would be necessary to secure membership, he could ask that they be stated in the rules. The Amendment is far better in its approach, application and effect than the words in the Bill.</p>

<p>I am delighted that my hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General has undertaken to look at the Clause again. One of the difficulties facing us arises because of the varying skills required of different craftsmen. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heifer) and myself have a reasonable knowledge of conditions and practices in the building industry. There are many trades in that industry where this provision might cause confusion.<br/>
I suggest a simple solution. "Reasonably well qualified" could lead to difficulties of interpretation. Will the Solicitor-General consider adding "having regard to the skills required in that craft", which would make it easier to interpret the provision if a court ruling was required?</p>

<p>If the Amendment were accepted the Clause would read thus:
<q>Any person who applies for membership of the organisation, or of a branch or section of the organisation, and who &#x2026;</q>


<q><i>(b)</i> is eligible under the rules of the organisation to be admitted as a member and qualified for employment as a worker of that description.</q>
What has been said on both sides has indicated that the Amendment should commend itself to reasonable people. The uncertainty of the situation has been mentioned. This could lead to a tightening of admission clauses.<br/>
Equity exercises no determination in respect of qualifications. It leaves this question entirely in the hands of the employer. If the employer thinks sufficiently well of the person concerned to give him a contract, the union accepts that and does not attempt to determine whether the person is qualified.<br/>
I ask hon. Members to consider what can happen if the concept of reasonable qualification, which is within the union's determination, is introduced. If a pop singer wanted to follow in the tracks of Tommy Steele and the National Theatre wanted to cast him in the role of Bottom or what-have-you, that pop singer would have no qualification, never having undertaken any training of that sort. The union is to be given the power to determine casting, something which the union has rejected hitherto. Equity has always said, "It is not our role to say whether or not pop singer Tommy Steele shall or shall not appear at the National Theatre." Parliament is now saying to Equity, "It is your job to say whether Tommy Steele or his successor or the man who follows his successor is reasonably qualified to do this, that or the other."<br/>
I am not sure whether the Solicitor-General said what was imputed to him by the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Costain), namely, that he was ready to examine the Clause again and come back on Report with a new proposal. Persuasive arguments have been put from both sides of the Committee, and it may be that the Secretary of State is prepared to accept the Amendment as it stands. I think that he would have great difficulty in improving upon it. But, if he does not accept it as it stands, will he say that he recognises the force of the case which has been put, he will consider the matter, and come back on Report with a proposal designed to meet it? I do not know, not having discussed it with them, but I imagine that, if we

have a firm assertion of that sort, my hon. Friends might be prepared not to press the Amendment to a Division.<br/>
I shall be interested to hear the Government's view. For my part, if we have a firm assurance in those terms&#x2014;and it must be firm&#x2014;I should be ready to accept it instead of going into the Lobby on the Amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) referred to people who take courses at Government training centres and acquire new skills. There is a Government training centre at Manchester which was opened about four years ago. When I visited the centre at about that time I was told&#x2014;I think that the Minister of Labour made the same point in opening the centre&#x2014;that it was a great pity that virtually no engineering training could be undertaken there. I think that the only engineering trade taught at that time was welding, which was not covered by the Amalgamated Engineering Union.<br/>
The reason for that gap in the training facilities was that the district branch of the A.E.U. would not allow any trainee who came out of that G.T.C. to join the union. The hon. Gentleman notes that I speak of the district branch&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>The president, I beg his pardon.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said&#x2014;I can understand the point&#x2014;that in areas of high unemployment there was a natural reluctance to admit to the union people who had not gone through the normal period of apprenticeship. But an area of high unemployment is an area where firms are reluctant to open new plants, and often the reason for their reluctance is the lack of skilled labour in the area. So the union is, in effect, promoting a vicious circle: it will not allow trainees from the G.T.C. into the union, and the area remains one of high unemployment&#x2014;a development


area, a depressed area, however one chooses to call it.<br/>
I understand that that practice in the Manchester area is still followed by the successor organisation, the A.E.W.U. I have no doubt that it would not be acceptable under the terms of the Clause as drafted. I should be very glad to hear from the hon. Gentleman whether he thinks that that practice is defensible, and how it would be affected by the Amendment, if at all.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer) put the industry side very well, and was supported by someone on the employers' side of the building industry. The hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. John Hall) also gave the picture from the employers' side of the furniture industry.<br/>
My hon. Friend has a point here. The Solicitor-General now admits that it is very difficult to explain the words "reasonably well qualified". He does not know whether "reasonably" or "well" should be left in, but he evidently thinks that "qualified" should be left in.<br/>
I do not know why the trade unions should be restricted like this. They should be the ones to decide who should or should not be admitted. I do not see why they should be tied to a restriction on whether a person is reasonably well qualified, or qualified at all. They should decide, in the same way as I am sure the Institute of Directors would not admit my hon. Friend. He would rightly say that he would not want to be admitted. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am glad to have the sotto voce interjection that it would say that he is not qualified. I agree, because he is not a director. I also heard a comment from an hon. Member opposite about the Stock Exchange. It has very restrictive rules. I think that members have to pay &#x00A3;76,000 to join. I suppose that being able to pay that could be argued as being "reasonably qualified".<br/>
The Solicitor-General made a little aside that rather upset me and, I am sure, my hon. Friend. He made a slighting reference to dockers restricting membership of their union to the family, the son of the father. I asked whether the House of Lords did not restrict its membership to the sons of the fathers, with the qualification that they must not be certified

as lunatics. Apart from that they can be anything. They can be crooks. They can follow their fathers and be called "reasonably well qualified".</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is missing the point. It was not I who said it but the Solicitor-General. The Solicitor-General was attacking the dockers for carrying out something which he supports. I am not defending the dockers. All I am saying is that they are only doing something which the Solicitor-General and the Government have been doing by maintaining an institution which has been going on for 700 years. f the right hon. and learned Gentleman is attacking one as an example, he should attack both.<br/>
Another aspect of this matter concerns safety. There are many people who call themselves handymen, particularly in heating, plumbing and ventilation. As has been mentioned, the term in the building trade vernacular is "bodgers". Does the Solicitor-General realise how dangerous the activities of these people can be to life and limb? They establish one-man businesses for the installation of central heating systems which are often death traps. The national Press has taken up this matter. A man who is a bit disreputable and not qualified in the strict sense of the word may say that he is "reasonably well qualified" because he has installed several central heating systems. But they may be faulty and may not work from the date of installation and be a danger to the public. He may say, "The union will not be able to refuse me a ticket because I have shown that I am 'reasonably well qualified', and under the terms of the Bill I shall demand a ticket".<br/>
Mrs. Smith, having seen the publicity in the Press about being careful of the activities of these "bodgers" installing heating and ventilation systems, may say, "Before you start, I want to see your


qualifications". He will say, "You have heard of the A.E.U., which is a craftsmen's union? Here is my ticket". By law, he will have to have a ticket, even though he may not be qualified.<br/>
Another illustration which is vital to the safety of life and limb concerns repairs to cars and other vehicles. When I take my car to a garage I know that the engineer is qualified and that the car will be dealt with properly and will be safe to go on the road. [Hon. Members: "Oh"'.] Do hon. Members opposite say that garages do not do a good job? People who have no proof of qualification will be able to get a ticket by saying, "I am a qualified engineer because I have by law been admitted into the engineering union". The union concerned will not be able to refuse him a ticket.</p>

<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. Much as I respect and admire his point of view and opinion, the Solicitor-General is the person to whom I must listen because he has admitted that "reasonably well qualified" is open to doubt. As the Clause is drafted, the union would have to admit the person into membership if he can claim that he is "reasonably well qualified". The Solicitor-General has agreed to look at this point because he acknowledges that the wording is too wide.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for West Ham, North (Mr. Arthur Lewis) has again tried to woo the Committee by suggesting that it does not matter really whether the union should be allowed the complete right to decide who should join or who should not join. If we were talking about golf or tennis clubs, that argument would be a good one. But we are not. We are talking about organisations which, in certain sectors of industry, are in a position where their refusal of a union card

virtually means that a man cannot obtain or keep employment. That is the major point.<br/>
I suppose that one could say that, with the registrar now supervising much more closely the rules of a union, the terms of the Amendment might be sufficient in that members should be those who are
<q>&#x2026; eligible under the rules of the organisation.&#x2026;</q></p>

<p>That is true. On the other hand, I see no reason, other than that of tidiness, why, if one thinks a thing worth saying, one should not say it twice. I was attracted to the wording of the Amendment because at present there is no close supervision of union rules and therefore society should have that sort of protection. But under the new Registrar it may well be that the kind of wording proposed will cover the case.<br/>
Clause 61(2) seeks to prevent a union from acting arbitrarily or operating unreasonable discrimination against a person. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Kirkdale (Mr. Dunn) made the valid point that in most skilled trades or crafts it would not matter much whether one stipulated "reasonably well qualified" or "qualified" or anything else, because there is a recognised standard, which is generally accepted, before a person can become a fully skilled member of the union. We are talking about the kind of people he referred to&#x2014;those in the theatrical profession, in the docks and so on. Indeed, a whole host of people are concerned.<br/>
My hon. and learned Friend has gone a considerable way in accepting the fact that "reasonably well qualified" may not be the right form of wording and may leave the definition much too wide. I would have thought that "qualified" would be enough, but I hope that he will look at the matter between now and Report to ensure that the wording is such that it will achieve the objective that a union should not be unreasonably required to take into membership a person


it believes has not the qualifications it would normally require, while ensuring that it cannot operate arbitrary or unfair or unreasonable discrimination against an applicant. This is where the balance must lie.<br/>
I hope that my hon. and learned Friend can assure us that he will study the matter and, if necessary, produce some words on Report to meet the case which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee have made.</p>

<p>I have intervened before the Solicitor-General because as the debate has proceeded I have begun to realise more sharply than ever the reason for the insertion of the subsection and the misconception on which it is based. The arguments of Government supporters have shown how necessary the Amendment is. Quite apart from exposing the Solicitor-General's complete lack of understanding of trade union rules, they have clearly shown that the situation at which the Government are tilting and which is mentioned in the Report of the Royal Commission and about which we have read so much in the Press in recent years may be described by saying that we are spending a great deal of money on Government training centres to produce the craftsmen necessary for the expansion of industry, but the obstructive attitude of the unions is preventing such people from obtaining employment and so making a contribution to industry.<br/>
This attitude is based on a misunderstanding, and it is a confusion of two separate matters. The Solicitor-General referred to paragraph 358 of the Report of the Royal Commission which mentioned the products of Government training centres. The hon. Member for Oxford (Mr. Woodhouse) referred to a specific situation. What is being discussed is not a man's admission to union membership, or which union it would be appropriate for him to join, but his admission to employment.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Oxford mentioned, the A.E.F., my own union, may I put the record right? I am familiar with the situation in Manchester, having lived for many years close to the Government training centre there. It has been

established not for four, but more nearly 20 years at Denton. I was formerly a shop stewards convenor of the A.E.U. in that district.<br/>
The attitude of the A.E.F. is that it expects the first opportunity to fill a skilled vacancy to be offered to unemployed time-served skilled craftsmen in the district. If there is none, or if none wishes to occupy the vacancy, it should be offered then to a person appropriately qualified by virtue of experience and service in the establishment where the vacancy has arisen. If, those first two priorities having been met, the vacancy is still unfilled, the union has no objection to a Government trainee occupying it. That seems to be a reasonable position for the A.E.F., and it is not the position of obstinate obduracy about which we have heard so often and which was implied by the hon. Member's description.</p>

<p>Former Ministers on either side are not oracles and masters of the absolute truth. With the greatest respect to my right hon. Friend the Member for Southwark (Mr. Gunter), for whom I have a great deal of affection and respect, for the reasons that I have given, I can claim to be more familiar with the situation than he. He relied on the advice of his Department and I think that I know more about that situation than those officials. Hon. Gentlemen must bear in mind that this centre has not attempted for many years to put on courses in engineering, other than a welding course, so it has not tested the situation. Let it do that. Perhaps the hon. Member prefers to rely on the word of the local Engineering Employers Federation. The position in the A.E.F. is as I have described, and I have done it with care because it needs to be placed on the record.


I said that the situation with which this subsection seeks to deal is not the real problem. The subsection deals with union membership, with whether the man will be accepted for a particular employment situation but hon. Members opposite seem to think that what is at issue is the denial of the man's right to be a member of the A.E.F. It centres around the confusion between the different sections of membership in the A.E.F. and the distinction between section 1 and section 5. There is a common assumption that section 1 is exclusively reserved for craftsmen and if an applicant is not admitted into that section then he cannot, in A.E.F. terms, be a skilled craftsman.<br/>
This shows the error of the subsection to which we are drawing attention. The restrictions imposed on admission under section 1 are not merely restrictions placed upon applicants in terms of craft qualifications. They are restrictions in terms of age, because of the friendly benefit provisions. This is where the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends misunderstand the British trade union movement. One respect at least in which it is near unique among trade union movements throughout the world is in its deep involvement with friendly benefit provisions. It is this which is often a crucial factor in determining to which section an individual should he admitted.<br/>
There may be someone who has served 20 years in a skilled trade in the engineering industry, perhaps as a colliery fitter and therefore a member of the N.U.M. If he leaves the coal mining industry because of contraction there, because of a pit closure, and makes an application to be a fitter in an engineering factory, it may well be that he is denied admission to section 1 of the A.E.F., not because the A.E.F. says that he is an unskilled man, but because we say that he has passed the age of 40. That age is inserted because of actuarial considerations in determining superannuation benefit that goes with that section of membership. This is the point at issue in our Amendment and this is why we seek the insertion of these words.</p>

<p>I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has arrived at that position, because my feeling is that the 50- and 60-year-

<p>I am sorry; perhaps I am not making myself clear. I am trying to say that the widespread assumption that the distinctions which are drawn between the sections in the A.E.F. are based exclusively on craft or otherwise is false.<br/>
Let me read quickly from the A.E.F. "blue book" and quote the relevant part of the rule relating to admission into section 1. This is the green card section. I have my green card in my pocket&#x2014;paid in advance, I might say. I quote:
<q>A candidate into section 1 who has worked three years in the workshop in addition to at least four years in the engineering department of a technical school shall be eligible. Candidates into section 1 shall be at least 19 and less than 40 years of age.</q>
I said that that age band is chosen because one of the crucial differences between section 1 and other sections of membership is that it provides a superannuation benefit, and the superannuation fund has to be operated on an actuarial basis taking age considerations into account.<br/>
Let me turn to section 5 membership, the rule for which states that this section is open to
<q>Any male person between the ages of 19 and 50 years employed in the engineering trade. &#x2026; Candidates desiring skilled status must produce evidence as provided in Rule 23"&#x2014;</q>
that is, evidence of having served the appropriate number of years. That makes quite clear that an individual can still be a skilled man in section 5 enjoying fully-skilled status. The only reason why he is driven into section 5 instead of section 1 is that the age factor hinges on the superannuation benefit.</p>

If the rules are aceptable to the registrar, subsection (2), which has two paragraphs, <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i>, which run together, read together and are one sentence, provides that the worker must not only be reasonably well qualified, but must be of a description which is
<q>in accordance with the rules of the organisation".</q>


It does not, therefore, make any difference.</p>

<p>If I believed that the hon Member was right, I should be urging my hon. Friends to reconsider whether we should divide. Subsection (2) states, however:
<q>is a worker of the description, or (as the case may be) of one of the descriptions, of which, in accordance with the rules of the organisation, the organisation or that branch or section, as the case may be, is intended".</q>
It is "the description". That seems to me to say that irrespective of age, if under paragraph (<i>b</i>) a person is deemed to be reasonably well qualified, he can say "I can produce evidence of having served the requisite number of years in a fully-skilled trade. I therefore demand admission into section 1 of the A.E.F." That is what it seems to me to say. [HON MEMBERS: "No."]<br/>
If the Secretary of State or the Solicitor-General tell me that I am absolutely wrong, perhaps we should look at it again. Until we are convinced that we are wrong, however, I say that there is no reasonable objection to inserting the words of our Amendment, which seems to me to be reasonable and is carefully constructed. In any event, if the Government accept that what I have said should be the case, that will only underpin what we are seeking. Consequently, it should not be objectionable and, therefore, should be acceptable.<br/>
I hope, therefore, that when the Minister replies, he will say that the subsection means what I want it to mean and, therefore, he will have no objection to inserting the words which we suggest to make it clear beyond peradventure, because they could not be harmful. If he says otherwise, we must press our Amendment to a Division.<br/>
I hope that I have cleared up once and for all that silly nonsense we hear about the denial of the right to work for people who have attended Government training centres or such a denial because people are not admitted to skilled status in the A.E.U. At the same time I hope we have demonstrated that right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite do not understand what union rule books are all about.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has been dealing with the problem of what is meant by "reasonably well qualified", and he has no doubt noticed that subsection (3) uses the phrase "reasonable notice". Does he think the use of this term in the Clause has any significance in view of the power given to the Registrar in Clause 71 to examine the rules? Does he regard this as a means of letting the Registrar interfere directly with the rules of the union?</p>

<p>The premise of this debate is that there are situations in which unions can control a man's right of access to a job by controlling his right of access to membership of a union. The examples given by my hon. Friends the Members for Oxford (Mr. Woodhouse) and Totnes (Mr. Mawby) made that point. In these circumstances, we cannot acknowledge a union's right, any more than did Donovan, totally to control access to membership of people qualified by skill, craft and training for work in such a way to allow the union unreasonably and arbitrarily to exclude those people from jobs. That is both the starting and finishing point of the matter.<br/>
We attach importance to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Totnes on the need for some control of a union's rules. He attaches importance to the fact that rules are now to be under some kind of regulation and control as giving the safeguard that is needed. It is right that in Clause 71 the Registrar will have to see that the rules of registered unions dealing with matters such as the right of admission to a union are in accordance with these general principles. That is the central point.<br/>
On the precise formulation of the matter, I take note of the points made by my hon. Friends the Members for Wycombe (Mr. John Hall) and Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Costain), who speak with experience in different industries, that all we want to achieve is that a person qualified for employment has access in the last resort to membership of a union and cannot be excluded by arbitrary and unreasonable discrimination.


We are willing to look again at the words "reasonably well qualified" to see that they march in line with the point made in the Donovan Report. I was interested to hear the hon. Member for Doncaster (Mr. Harold Walker) when describing the Manchester rules of the A.E.F. use the phrase "appropriately qualified by their experience and skills". There are many different ways of formulating this, and we would be willing to look at the matter.<br/>
I regret that we cannot accept the wording of the Amendment that eligibility under the rules of the organisation to be admitted as a member is a sufficient test. If we were to accept those words, it would mean that a union could write into its rules, any kind of conditions it likes as to eligibility. We cannot accept that, although we are prepared to look again at the way in which we formulate the right of people qualified for work to get into unions. We cannot accept the Amendment because we cannot concede that amount of control over the structure of their rules to unions, registered or unregistered.</p>

<p>I strongly urge the Solicitor-General to think again. No one involved in industrial relations can lightly view a Government interfering with and directing independent organisations as to the members they should accept.<br/>
I say that people involved in industrial relations cannot view this matter lightly, because every organisation in industrial relations will come within the principle enunciated by the Government. Employers' organisations, although this might not be known to the Government, will come within the same definitions, and many of them are extremely concerned about the Government's intentions.<br/>
I do not think that any promise to examine further whether a man is qualified or reasonably well qualified has any bearing on the matter. The Solicitor-General, to some extent, misunderstands the union position. I do not blame the hon. and learned Gentleman, because he lacks knowledge of the practicalities of unions. But I think that the Committee as a whole must recognise that unions are not merely associations of people qualified to do a certain job. Unions,

in a great part, when admitting people to membership, take account of ethical and moral considerations. This provision will completely rob them of any right to judge membership of any man or woman on ethical and moral standards. The Government may think that this is not so, but I believe that if the Clause is passed as it is a great deal of interference will take place which cannot be justified.<br/>
The Solicitor-General has made clear what the debate is about. It is not about membership of trade unions at all; it is about the right of a man who is qualified to obtain work within an industry.<br/>
Must union rules be restricted because of the right of a man to work within an industry? It seems odd that a Government dedicated against the closed shop principle should, <i>de facto,</i> by this provision, accept the closed shop situation where a man must be a member of a union to obtain employment.<br/>
I now turn to another point which the Secretary of State might take rather more seriously. This principle will apply <i>de facto</i> to employers' associations and to everyone else concerned in industrial relations. I must here declare an interest. I am associated with the Federation of Builders, which was set up primarily for servicing matters in the industry and to adjudge codes of conduct. That organisation has local admission committees in different localities which judge the ethical and moral standards of people who apply to join.<br/>
According to the Bill, any employer within any industry automatically has the right to join his association, just as any man who is adjudged to be reasonably well qualified has the right to join a union. What will this mean to employers' associations if it becomes law? It will mean that discretion on ethical standards is completely withdrawn from those local admission committees. At the moment a local admission committee might say, "This builder in this locality is well known to be a jerry builder". It will therefore refuse him membership and not have to explain why. If the Clause is accepted as it is, I am sure that any builder so excluded will demand an explanation and the local admission committee, unless its decision to exclude


stands up in law, cannot refuse him membership.<br/>
Some people may ask: why should anyone be excluded on hearsay evidence? I am merely saying that the position will be extremely serious. It emphasises what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heffer)&#x2014;that to introduce legal proceedings in cases like this will lead to a great deal of distortion of membership in all organisations in industrial relations.</p>

<p>I was surprised, on Monday, 1st February, to hear the Secretary of State for Wales say that no inquiries had been made of him about the future potential of the South Wales ports, with special reference to Swansea.<br/>
I believe that the ports are one of the principal assets of the nation and should be listed in value to the nation. I believe that the reversal of this procedure, lack of inquiry, indicates a lack of liaison between Ministers of the Crown. Where Swansea and Wales are concerned, we cannot disregard the sea communications position in the Bristol Channel.<br/>
The future potential of the Port of Swansea is a matter of great importance to South Wales and, indeed, to the United Kingdom. The continued and increasing trade through the port must be maintained, and it is necessary to maintain a prosperous port in Swansea and a prosperous industrial hinterland behind the port, because each is interdependent on the other.<br/>
When we look for the ideal spot where sea traffic ends and overland traffic begins, we find that Swansea's position in economic, physical and commercial terms places it unquestionably in the top ten of the United Kingdom ports. Of all ports on a convergent point between sea and inland transport, none is better placed than the Port of Swansea.<br/>
The present success story of Swansea shows the willingness of all concerned to work with boldness and foresight for a policy adopted to secure a great future for the Port of Swansea. It is natural, therefore, to look for the Government's blessing and to hope that this will be forthcoming. Industrial relations in the port are good, and I say regretfully and sincerely that the only visible worsening agent to that is the Bill which we have been discussing tonight.<br/>
So we come to the bread-and-butter part of our national life and the part

that Swansea plays now and the port's potential, and if I commence with the present position and project the future potential I would say that 1970 was a record year for the port. The total traffic through the port exceeded eight million tons. If 1952 is taken as capacity, with traffic through the port at 11&#x00B7;6 million tons, in 1970, with more than eight million tons, the operation could be said to be 50 per cent. below capacity.<br/>
Yet, without extending the dock estate, there are potentially 12 new berths within the port, and this could provide employment for about 450 men. Vessels of up to 18,000 tons could use these facilities at all times, and with favourable tides vessels of 30,000 tons could use them. Within the dock boundaries there are about 70 acres of land available for marshalling cargo, and a further 35 acres will be available soon, and here I congratulate the British Transport Docks Board on its excellent management of the Port of Swansea.<br/>
I now come to two concepts where I think the potential of the Port of Swansea is something that should be assisted now to provide for the future. The first concept is that of a port of Europe, the so-called Europort. For several years there has been heavy insistence on the development of an east coast port, or ports, as so-called Euroports. It seems to me advisable that, having regard to all the circumstances which I shall mention later, one of these could, with profit to the country, be created in Swansea. If thought is given to the choice of Swansea, it will be seen from a lot of what I shall say latterly that the choice will be well made. Money would require to be spent, but in my view this would be a sound investment for the United Kingdom, Wales and Swansea, and I shall mention an example of how this induces speedy and heavy private capital investment in an area such as I shall describe.<br/>
The establishment of Swansea as a Europort could be done in two or possibly three stages. In stage one, there would be a modernisation programme and usage of the present facilities relating to sea, land and air transport. In stage two, there would be the building of a new dock on a site between the Neath River and the existing dock, the rebuilding of


Swansea airport, connecting up motorways and the rebuilding of the railway system. In stage three, there would be the building of a breakwater across Swan-sea Bay where large ships could be berthed in an artificial harbour.<br/>
Stage one would be an interim measure to accommodate present-day needs and to provide for container and roll-on-roll-off ships. It is in stage two that the speculative planning must be developed. It would be necessary to build a new dock between the Queens Dock and the Neath River for the new ships. Ships of the twenty-first century would require a dock such as this. The length of this dock would be 1,500 feet and the width would be 200 feet. The lock would have sliding casson gates and it would be possible for this dock to take the largest ships. The approach channel of 1,500 feet width and two miles in length would require to be dredged and this channel would be 10 fathoms deep at low water spring tides to enable ships drawing 55 feet to arrive and sail off for a full 24 hours a day.<br/>
The airport would require enlargement to transport away the goods and passengers to the rest of Britain and Europe, and air travel would be an ancillary service. The roadways in stage two would have to be those presently planned, and the railways, with freightliner terminals, would be speeding up transportation overland.<br/>
Next we have to consider the possibility of a Channel Tunnel being constructed. A hovertrain is another possibility. The journey from Swansea to the rest of Europe could become an overnight trip. All these things are realisable. It is amazing how the seeming fantasy of yesterday becomes the reality of today. In relation to the airport, this development would be a rewarding outcome for the great part that the City Council has played in the development up to date. The whole of stage two would require expert planning on a long-term basis to serve our country and the rest of Europe.<br/>
Stage three would be a progress development where big transports from overseas could lie moored in open water. These would be liquid carrier and bulk carrier ships, parent/barge ships, gas ships and similar large vessels.<br/>
If we look at the latitudinal and longitudinal position of Swansea, the city is nearer the Americas than is any other major West European port and certainly any British port. It is on a direct route to the U.S.A. and has deep-water entry from any part of the world. It is interesting to note that Swansea is nearer to New York, Cape Town and Suez than is London, Liverpool or Southampton. When one considers the congestion of Liverpool and London and the fact that recently in Swansea we have been taking overspill dock traffic from there, one sees that the point has stronger emphasis. From the marine angle, a convergent point of sea traffic, Swansea, means that it is the nearest point for continental Europe and for which ships can make.<br/>
In relation to inland transport, where the sea meets the land, the excellence of the geographical position of the port is again revealed. The city is approached by two main arterial road networks from the Midlands, with similar arterial and motorway roads from east and west which give access to the rest of Britain.<br/>
There are those in the House who know that rail communications lead everywhere from Swansea, with fast city-to-city services to London. If we assume that Birmingham is the centre of industrial Britain. Swansea is nearer the centre, give or take a mile, than many other towns. The distance from Swansea to Birmingham is 127 miles. The distance from London to Birmingham is 110 miles; from Southampton to Birmingham it is 128 miles; and from Liverpool to Birmingham it is 90 miles. Swansea is more accessible and nearer in steaming distance than other ports in the Bristol Channel. Ships can speed at 15 knots to Swansea. Bristol is 66 miles further on. Four hours and 24 minutes steaming time could gain another tide either way. Ship expenses are a matter for consideration.<br/>
There is a question of the inclusion or exclusion of Swansea as a maritime industrial development area. But in any case, exclusion is purely academic. In 1969 the then Secretary of State for Economic Affairs referred to the preservation of areas around ports suitable for inclusion in what was termed M.I.D.A.S. The prerequisite here was 5,000 acres of mostly flat land, a favourable hinterland, and a port with deep water access.


Swansea Bay has all these minimum criteria and presents a more favourable case as a maritime industrial development area than do ports in the upper Bristol Channel&#x2014;and certainly much more favourable than Portbury or other developments in that area. With 6,000 acres between Kidwelly Flats and Llanelli, it follows that Swansea and the Swansea Bay area form a good port site suitable for modern facilities. We live in an age of large bulk carriers, and Swansea could he developed with these in mind.<br/>
The advantage in South-West Wales of relatively low-cost land is another factor. Industrial land in or near to large towns costs from &#x00A3;2,500 to &#x00A3;5,000 per acre freeehold. I contrast that with industrial land in the Midlands, which costs &#x00A3;10,000 per acre and upwards, and, as we know, the price in London is even higher&#x2014;even more astronomic.<br/>
Development costs money, but spending must be weighed against the provision of national assets. I think that both the concepts to which I have referred, the Europort and M.I.D.A.S., are developments in the area which would be assets for the nation. I ask the Minister to consider the evidence. The national need must be provided for and, if it were assisted by the Government, Swansea could provide the need for a modern port complex. Today, the port is part of the nationalised Port Authority.<br/>
I come to the economics of the affair. It has been shown in Rotterdam and Antwerp that the creation of new port facilities is a prerequisite for large-scale development. The rapid industrial growth of these Continental ports followed decisions by the respective port authorities in 1947 and 1954 to expand their port facilities. So rapid is the effect of such decisions today that the mere announcement that Rotterdam intends to build a new oil channel costing 150 million guilders has resulted, within six months, in private industrial development decisions involving the total investment of 1,200 million guilders.<br/>
I hope that the Government will consider our part of the country when they come to the choice of site for a new port complex. Swansea has vision and is reaching out for the future. But the city and the port face the future with reality, and I have tried to back them in their

arguments for the Europort and M.I.D.A.S.<br/>
The potential of the port is there. All the arguments are based on reality. With Government interest and support and inclusion in the list of the nation's top 10 ports, Swansea could take her place at the centre of one of the trading crossroads of the world.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Swansea, East (Mr. McBride) has spoken powerfully on behalf of the great port which he helps to represent, and has outlined a most ambitious vision of its possible future. I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss one section of the ports industry which is so important to our country and to South Wales in particular, and I welcome the presence of my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Welsh Office.<br/>
The port of Swansea is one of the group of South Wales ports owned and run successfully by the British Transport Docks Board. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that it is a success story. I believe, too, that it has a bright future, but it is a future which, in my judgment, is founded not so much on the uncosted visions that the lion. Gentleman has outlined as on the concrete achievement of the port's management, its dock workers, and the many private firms which are investing in its future development.<br/>
I do not deny that Swansea has important advantages, but the fact that it is closer, as the hon. Gentleman puts it, to New York, Cape Town and Suez can hardly be counted among those advantages. A few score miles one way or the other make comparatively little difference when one is considering voyages of many thousands or tens of thousands of miles. Therefore, to claim that Swansea has a competitive advantage over Liverpool or London in shipping freight to North America or east of Suez makes no particular commercial sense, since it is virtually the same as claiming that Chelsea and Kensington are nearer to Cardiff than is Westminster. It is a marginal point.<br/>
What matters more than distance is the comparative speed and efficiency and the comparative costs of loading and unloading ships between one port and another. I would guess that a 1 per cent. cost


advantage in, for example, the speed of turning ships around would more than make up for many scores of miles of so-called distance advantage enjoyed by one port over another.<br/>
But I do not want to dampen the hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm, although I noticed that he carefully refrained from putting any costs to his ambitious schemes. My preference is for the sound and sensible policies of my right hon. Friends the Minister for Transport Industries and the Secretary of State for Wales, which are admirably designed to provide Swansea with what it most needs&#x2014;confidence and competitiveness. The confidence is already apparent and it is based not on dreams but on facts.<br/>
Currently, Swansea is handling some eight million tons of cargo per year, including over five million tons of petroleum products, most of which are shipped from the B.P. refinery, and over one million tons of anthracite coke.</p>

<p>I agree that the confidence and the ability are there, but one plans by standing back and seeing that something is needed for the future. That would need to be costed, but if we are to create a new society that would be one of the preliminaries.</p>

<p>I shall come to some of the future plans in a moment. The financial results at Swansea are also better than in most British ports. Its net surpluses have risen over the years to some &#x00A3;72,000 in 1969, and the results for 1970 are expected to be much the same, which is a healthy indication in a year which, due to last summer's dock strike and strikes in other industries surrounding the docks, was not generally a good year for the ports as a whole.<br/>
As the hon. Gentleman said, labour relations are good, and this, too, is a favourable portent for Swansea's future. I gladly pay a tribute here to the contributions of the Port Director and his staff and of the trade unions in the port.<br/>
I understand that the hon. Gentleman made a broadcast today in which he said, among other things, that there were no plans on the part of the Secretary of State for Swansea's future. I must disabuse him of this idea: he could not be more wrong. Take industry, for example. Around Swansea Bay, a great deal of

capital investment has already been put in by the British Steel Corporation, B.P. Chemicals, the Ford Motor Company, International Nickel, A.L.C.O.A. and many other great growth companies. In the port itself, more than &#x00A3;4 million has been invested in capital works in recent years, on such projects&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am glad to have that clarification. Then there is the reconstruction of the West Pier, the Eastern breakwater and the new road facilities. The future investment programme of the British Transport Docks Board provides for a further &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;5 million on the extension of wharves, the renewal of cranes and fork-lift trucks and the modernisation of sheds and workshops over the next few years.<br/>
To put figures to it, in 1971 new investment will amount to &#x00A3;609,000. The projected figures for 1972, 1973 and 1974 are &#x00A3;479,000, &#x00A3;786,000 and &#x00A3;920,000. These are my right hon. Friends' projected plans for the growth of this port. Against this background I was surprised to hear that the hon. Gentleman in his radio broadcast had spoken of "neglect."<br/>
The future plans for Swansea are most encouraging. It would be wrong for me to describe in any detail the progress of confidential commercial negotiations, but I can say that discussions are proceeding between the British Transport Docks Board and the British Steel Corporation with a view to improving and expanding the tin plate exporting business. Petroleum exports, too, are growing nicely. Future prospects look good. The recently inaugurated roll-on-roll-off service to Cork is another success story. I am hopeful that the operators will be attracted to run new services to France and to Spain. Passenger traffic passing through the port has risen from about 4,000 in 1963 to the present figure of over 150,000 passengers a year.<br/>
Road access is a problem at most of our ports, but, thanks in large measure


to the efforts of my right hon. Friends, ambitious plans for further improvements are already in hand. By the end of this year the M.4 will be completed as far as Newport. There are firm plans to extend it to beyond Bridgend. The Pyle by-pass is in the programme, so that by about 1976, looking to the future, virtually the whole of the A.48 between Cardiff and Swansea will be dual carriageway. Meanwhile, by the end of this year the current major bottleneck in the centre of Cardiff will have been relieved by the completion of the Eastern Avenue scheme.<br/>
As regards traffic to the Midlands&#x2014;the hon. Gentleman mentioned Birmingham&#x2014;the last stage of the new Midlands road linking the M.5 and the Ross Spur with the M.4 at Newport is under construction. This means that by next year there will be a dual-carriage road all the way between Birmingham and Newport, and this will link with the A.48. This road has already been completed as far as the Usk. The dualling of parts of the A.465&#x2013;the Heads of the Valleys road&#x2014;is being extended towards Swansea with the construction of the Glyn Neath bypass. A further length of new road is to be provided between Aberdulais and Llandarcy.<br/>
For all these reasons, I hope that the hon. Member will agree that, far from there being neglect or a lack of plans, there is abundant evidence of the Government's care for the future of the port of Swansea and of South Wales generally.<br/>
I am aware that a number of South-Wales Members, including the hon. Gentleman, have expressed misgivings about the effect on the South Wales ports of the Government's decision last November not to withhold approval under Section 9 of the Harbours Act for the Port of Bristol's proposal for a new West Dock. The hon. Member has been frequently on record in criticism of that decision.<br/>
I must tell the hon. Gentleman, because it is relevant to this debate, that this decision was made after the most careful examination of the submissions made by Bristol and of the comments and recommendations made by the National Ports Council, which had considered the area on both sides of the Channel as a

whole and which is the Government's statutory adviser in matters of this kind. The Government were satisfied that the commercial prospects for the proposed new dock at Bristol offered satisfactory expectations that an adequate return would be achieved on the capital invested. Taking into account the cost of the scheme, which was less than that of its two predecessors, and the prospects of increased trade and revenue for the Port of Bristol, there was no reason whatsoever why Section 9 approval should have been withheld. Indeed, it would have been quite wrong for us to prevent Bristol's investing what, after all, is its own money, at its own risk, in its own port development.<br/>
Here let me emphasise to the hon. Gentleman that in this matter of submitting proposals for port development projects there can be no question of Government direction of trade or direction of ports. If any port can produce a good case which satisfies the detailed scrutiny to which it is subjected by the National Ports Council and by my Department, there is no reason for the Government to withhold their approval on the ground that some sort of similar development might be undertaken at another port. I should tell the hon. Gentleman here that, in fact, no other port, and certainly not Swansea, has submitted any such proposals for consideration.<br/>
Therefore, I see no reason why the construction of the West Dock at Bristol, which is a natural development, bearing in mind the decision to close the Bristol City docks over a period and to concentrate dock development nearer the sea, should adversely affect the prospects of the South Wales ports in general or of Swansea in particular.<br/>
The traffic of Bristol, on the one hand, and of the South Wales ports, on the other, are in many respects complementary. Swansea handles mainly oil, coal, iron and steel, tin plate and non-ferreous ores. Bristol's principal cargoes include grain, feedingstuffs, molasses, fertilisers, wood pulp and chemicals, though it handles considerable quantities of petroleum products as well.<br/>
There is no reason I can see why development on both sides of the Bristol Channel should not continue to progress


in a similarly complementary fashion. But it would be wrong, both from the point of view of the ports themselves and from the point of view of the national interest, to attempt to put an artificial brake on healthy competition. Indeed, if our ports of the future are to be prosperous, financially stable and forward-looking, the spur of competition is needed as much in the ports industry as in our industry and commerce as a whole.<br/>
I know that the hon. Gentleman was disappointed when the British Transport Docks Board decided not to oppose Bristol's Private Bill which will give powers to construct the West Dock. I found his reaction&#x2014;I must tell him&#x2014;somewhat surprising. The British Transport Docks Board is the owner of Swansea Docks. He has himself paid tribute to its effective management of it. The British Transport Docks Board, as the custodian and, I believe, the best judge of Swansea Docks' interests and future, having given the most careful thought to the Bristol Bill, came to the conclusion that it would be wrong to

oppose it. Its decision was clear, and, in my view, it was right.<br/>
I remind the hon. Gentleman, also, that the British Transport Docks Board was not alone in thinking that it would be wrong for South Wales' interests to adopt a dog-in-the-manger attitude to the West Dock scheme or to drum up a scare story that somehow it represents a threat to the trade of the Welsh ports. The hon. Gentleman may have read the letter written by Professor Hallett of the University College of Cardiff last November to the <i>Western Mail.</i> He said:
<q>I welcome the decision to allow Bristol Corporation to proceed with the plan, provided it bears the full cost"&#x2014;&#x2014;</q></p>
