<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether he is aware that the continued shortage of cooks, porters, laundry workers, waitresses, wardmaids, office cleaners and housemaids at the London Hospital and other hospitals in the London region threatens to cause the closing of beds for which patients are waiting; and what action he proposes to take.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, I am aware of the shortage of staff in the London hospitals and I am glad to have this opportunity to make a statement on the position.<br/>
During the period of the heavy "flying-bomb" attacks, the London hospitals

evacuated a large number of their patients and their staff demands were much reduced. In the last two months these demands, enlarged by the need to replace excessive wastage, consequent upon the dislocation caused by the bombing, again became urgent. This coincided with the need to provide domestic staff for the hostels for building workers brought into London to repair bomb damaged houses, a measure pressed from all quarters as one demanding the highest priority. The extent of this unexpected drain on our manpower resources is shown by the fact that 3,400 domestic workers have been found for these hostels.<br/>
Even during this exceptionally difficult period the hospitals were not neglected and in the past two months 63 cooks, 756 full-time and 115 part-time domestic workers and 163 orderlies, porters, stokers and maintenance men were placed. I am sending my hon. Friend details of placings in the London Hospital to which be makes specific reference, and the figures show that of 62 domestic vacancies notified, from 23rd August to 7th November, 51 applicants have been submitted and 44 placed. Further demands have since been received. Now that the staffing of the building workers hostels is almost completed, I hope that it will be possible to make further progress in meeting the demands of hospitals which will enjoy first priority for the supply of domestic labour.</p>

<p>The Police Pensions Act, 1921, included a special provision that the application of the Act to the City of London police force should not prejudice any right possessed by any member of the force at the date of the passing of the Act&#x2014;that is the 28th July, 1921.

The section under which this action was taken applies only to the City of London police force; and, as regards other police forces, there is nothing I can usefully add to the reply I gave to my hon.

<p>Yes, Sir, After consultation with the Service Departments and the security authorities, I feel justified in doing away with certain restrictions imposed on aliens when the risk of invasion was imminent. I have revoked, with effect from to-morrow, the Aliens Protected Areas Orders which prohibited aliens from entering or remaining in certain areas without police permission. The prohibition on entry into these areas which has been imposed on certain persons under Defence Regulations 18A and 18B will automatically lapse on repeal of these Orders. I also propose very shortly to revoke the Aliens (Movement Restriction) Orders which impose a curfew and prohibit the use of vehicles without a permit. The majority of aliens have already received exemption from these restrictions but the effect of the new Order will be to remove them from nearly all the remainder. A small number of aliens will remain subject to the special restrictions imposed on enemy aliens by Articles 6A or 9A of the Aliens Order (or both). I still think it advisable to maintain restrictions on these individuals. Those who are subject to Article 9A will therefore still require to obtain a police permit to have a motor vehicle and those subject to Article 6A will also be subject to a curfew.</p>

<p>As I announced on the 6th May, 1943, in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Romford (Mr. Parker) arrangements came into force in

April of last year for an increase in the hours of duty of prison officers, to enable prisoners to be out of their cells for one hour longer on weekdays. As a result, with the exception of the women's prison at Holloway, prisoners are out of their cells for employment and exercise for a minimum of about 7 hours, 20 minutes from Monday to Friday, 3 hours on Saturday, and 3&#x00BD; hours on Sunday, for chapel and exercise. These periods are increased in the cases of those prisoners who attend physical training and educational classes in the evening. In addition, substantial numbers of prisoners take their meals in association. I regret that, until it is possible to make a substantial increase in prison staffs, I can hold out no hope of any general improvement on the present position.</p>

<p>So far as Members who have been given appointments under the Act of Parliament are concerned.

I asked the House for these powers and gave full reasons. I think I have used them with restraint and well within the limits assigned by the House. I am sure there has been great advantage to the public from their use. It is not a practice that one could imagine continuing in normal times. As to the number of Parliamentary Private Secretaries, the House has been well aware of the practice which has grown up over many years, and I do not see that there is the slightest reason to object to it.

<p>It is not possible to look beyond the end of the Japanese war, and my reply relates to the period


between the defeat of Germany and the defeat of Japan. Until Japan has been defeated the war must have first call on our efforts. After the defeat of Germany it will be possible and necessary to turn ever an increasing part of our resources to civilian production. Thus we must make exertions to restore our export trade and to re-equip our industry. The shortage of houses, both permanent and emergency must be grappled with as if it were a war-time measure. Active steps must be taken to relieve the shortage of civilian goods.<br/>
As stated in the White Paper to be published to-day, the existing system of allocating man-power to the Forces and to the various industries will be maintained. Nevertheless, it is intended to mitigate so far as possible the rigidity of the existing controls over labour. Many of the war-time controls over raw materials, industrial capacity, agriculture, food, transport and so forth will likewise be as necessary in this period as they are to-day. In these fields also, relaxations will be possible and will be made whenever circumstances permit and in an orderly manner. Any other course would result in violent disturbances which might well lead to inflation; would be harmful to the economic life of the country; and would make it impossible to ensure that the Nation's resources are devoted to essential needs, and are fairly distributed during periods in which demand will still be without any economic relation to supply.<br/>
It is too early to forecast the stages by which control will be relaxed. But the House can rest assured that the whole matter will be dealt with in a severely practical manner, each case being considered not only on its merits but as part of an organised scheme. It is important in this phase that theoretical, ideological or partisan tendencies either way should be excluded, and the governing consideration in every case should be the public interest.</p>

<p>That does not bear a very strict resemblance to the Question on the Paper. The Minister


at the head of a Department is expected to know all that goes on in his Department, and if he is in any way disturbed by interference which is not from the War Cabinet or from higher authority, his business is to bring it before the War Cabinet, when the issue can be decided. Every Minister, whether in the War Cabinet or not, is entitled to raise such a matter. There is certainly no question of security officers having any authority against the War Cabinet.</p>

<p>On the whole the output of Italian co-operators working in agriculture is better than that of non-co-operators. Non-co-operators are working under the same conditions as applied to all Italian prisoners before they were given an opportunity to volunteer to co-operate and I am not aware that those in South-west Norfolk are without supervision or discipline. It is the responsibility of the employing farmer to provide supervision, except where the War Agricultural Executive Committee is able to supply a foreman. I understand that the majority of Italian non-co-operators in South-west Norfolk are working under military escorts, who are expected to check any idleness and ensure a full and fair daily output of work. Italian non-co-operators


at central camps are already confined to camp when oft duty and are, generally speaking, subject to the same control and disciplinary action as German prisoners.</p>

<li>2. Successful applicants without previous agricultural experience will be placed on carefully chosen farms, market gardens or similar establishments for up to twelve months' practical training. They will be Government trainees, not paid workers, and will receive standard maintenance allowances (including dependants' allowances) from the State during the period of training. Employers providing training will be required to make a contribution to the State for the value of trainees' services in accordance with a scale to be agreed with the industry. Trainees will be accommodated on farms or in lodgings or hostels near their places of training. Provision will be made so far as possible for the wives of married trainees to be lodged with their husbands.</li>

<p>The position is that, under the Pensions Appeal Tribunals Act, 1943, the decisions of the tribunals are final and conclusive, except where the appellant or the Minister is dissatisfied with the decision as being erroneous in point of law and obtains leave of the tribunal or of a judge of the High Court to appeal therefrom. To refer in all cases to this provision which can only apply very exceptionally would, I am afraid, only lead to disappointment. My officers accordingly endeavour to discriminate in dealing with correspondence from unsuccessful applicants; but I am glad of this opportunity of adding to the publicity given to the provision. I might mention that in the large majority of cases appellants are advised by the British Legion or other bodies well aware of the right conferred by the Act in the special circumstances to which it applies.</p>

It was clearly understood that we were to get the Bill on the Statute Book this Session. I would congratulate my right hon. Friend the Minister on the way he has, in one series of the Amendments that have come to us from another place, fulfilled the undertakings given on the Report stage. So far as I have been able to go through the Amendments, he has fulfilled the pledges given earlier to the House. As to the remaining Amendments, I believe that in another place very full consideration has been given to them, and that there are improvements in the administration and machinery of the Bill on which, I think, another place is to be congratulated. So far as I and my hon.

The hon. and gallant Member would have had a case if we were working under the Rule as to the Sittings of the House, but I understand that the Rule has been suspended. We can therefore go on as late as we like.

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
The purpose of this Amendment is to increase from two years to three years the period within which, under Subsection (2) of Clause 2, an order may be submitted for the purchase of land in an area of extensive war damage even though no order has been made under Clause 1 declaring it to be such an area. The provision has had a somewhat eventful and at times rather confused history, and perhaps it would not be wasting time if I briefly explained the position. The main

scheme of the Bill is the declaration by local planning authorities of areas of extensive war damage together with concrete proposals for their reconstruction. When their proposals have been approved the authority may proceed to acquire the land by the expeditious process contained in the Bill. It will be seen that the emphasis is not only upon the power of acquisition; the main idea is that the local planning authority should have an approved plan of reconstruction before these new powers can be exercised by them. A term of five years was given in the Bill, as I introduced it, as the period within which local authorities might apply for these powers. An Amendment was moved to reduce this term to two years, and I resisted it in Committee on the ground that five years was short enough for local planning authorities to exercise what I may call the creative part of their task, to form worthy plans and discharge the planning as apart from the mere landowning function. The Committee agreed with me and the five years remained.<br/>
At the same time the Bill did contain, and I think it was prudent that it should, provisions whereby under Sub-section (2) of Clause 2 powers were given of an emergency nature not conditional upon the formulation of any project for replanning the bombed sites. These emergency powers provided that I could authorise the compulsory purchase of land in certain urgent cases even when there was no project for reconstruction. If the public interest appeared to be prejudiced I could make the order. This power to authorise compulsory purchase in advance of proposals for reconstruction is obviously one to be exercised with considerable discretion, because the whole abject of the Bill is reconstruction.<br/>
It was in these circumstances that I stated during the Committee stage that if I emerged with the main structure of the Bill intact&#x2014;namely, the abolition of references, the new procedure in the Schedules for expediting inquiries and hearings and for the vesting of the fee simple&#x2014;I would be prepared to consider reducing the period for these emergency provisions in Sub-section (2) to two years while retaining the term of five years in the case of applications for power to acquire which are coupled with proposals for reconstruction. My hon. Friends who moved those


Amendments accepted my undertaking and did not oppose or obstruct my reforms of procedure, which are so important a feature of this Bill, and I honoured my undertaking to them on the Report stage by accepting the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Sir J. Mellor), The effect of that Amendment was to reduce the time within which a local authority could apply for these emergency powers from five years to two, though we maintained the five years in the main structure of the Bill. I am not sure whether what I tried to make clear was fully appreciated, but we had a Division, and though I do not want to go into all those matters again, some hon. Members apparently thought I was reducing the period from five years to two years as it affected the whole Bill.<br/>
When the Bill was in another place the matter was re-examined and an Amendment was moved to reduce the term to five years in the case of what I may call these unplanned acquisitions. Debate followed and the consensus of opinion was in favour of three years, and perhaps I may be forgiven if I remind the House that three years is one year more than two and two years less than five. I take all the responsibility for this situation. I attended many of the sittings in another place, but I have duties here and elsewhere, and perhaps I was remiss in not bringing more prominently to the notice of the Government spokesman there the peculiar circumstances of this complicated transaction, the fact that we had divided upon the point, and that two years was inserted in consequence of an undertaking which I had given. I ask for the forbearance of my hon. Friends. I feel sensitive on the point, because I do not wish that there should be anything even remotely like a breach of promise made to hon. Members but that is the position, and I ask the House to bear with me in it.<br/>
Now let me say a word about the merits of the situation. The Amendment has come to us at this stage and I do not advise the House to disagree with the Lords Amendment. After all, the other place is another House of Parliament, and the authorisation of compulsory purchase for these emergency purposes is not solely limited by whatever term of

years is put in the Bill, because hon. Members will see that what limits the grant of these emergency powers are the conditions which must be fulfilled and not the term of years. In other words, the Minister must be satisfied that the acquisition is necessary for the purpose of dealing satisfactorily with the damage, whatever may be decided as to the manner in which the land is to be laid out and used, and that the postponement of acquisition would be prejudicial to the public interest. Those are severe tests and they must apply throughout, whatever the period of time in the Bill. It will be the existence or the absence of these circumstances which will really decide whether an order is to be made or not, and I have always had the view that these circumstances of peculiar urgency are not likely to arise more than two years after the Appointed Day. But if we give another year, and after the 24 months have elapsed an odd case does arise in which the rigorous conditions I have referred to can be fulfilled, then we may come to feel grateful for the existence of a revising Chamber under our Constitution. These are the merits of the case, and I have given my own account of the circumstances in which the existing situation arose, and in all the circumstances I ask the House to agree with the Lords Amendment.</p>

<p>I should like first to thank my right hon. Friend for the very candid way in which he has informed the House of what took place in Committee and upon Report and since the Bill left this House to go to another place. He has told us what happened with the candour which we associate with him and which he has shown throughout the proceedings on this Bill, but I am afraid that I cannot agree that we should agree with the Lords Amendment. We disagree mast strongly&#x2014;I myself and my hon. Friends who were associated with me in moving the Amendment in Committee and again upon Report. We had a very clear undertaking from the Minister on Report. I have always understood that Government responsibility was collective, that what one Minister undertook committed his colleagues. We have been told that upon more than one occasion in the proceedings on this Bill as well as on other Bills. Objection was taken to a Minister being required in the


terms of an Act to consult a colleague because it was said that that would be an infringement of the theory of collective responsibility. I really do not think it is sufficient far my right hon. Friend to say: "Oh, well, in another place the matter was reconsidered and they came to a different conclusion" to relieve himself of his undertaking. In my submission that undertaking still stands, and that being so, instead of inviting this House to agree with the Lords Amendment he should invite us to disagree in order that his undertaking should be fulfilled.<br/>
I am not entitled to discuss what took place in another place, but it may well be that the Minister of Reconstruction took a different view from that of my right hon. Friend. If that was the case, we should have been told so while the matter was before this House. Presumably the two Ministers responsible for the progress of this Bill have been in close touch throughout the proceedings. I want to ask whether the Whips are going to be put on in support of my right hon. Friend's proposition that we should agree with the Lords Amendment. If so, surely a curious situation arises. The Government Whips advised hon. Members to vote in support of two years. Are they to-day going to advise hon. Members to vote against two years? Surely, it is not fair on the Government Whips and, if that sort of thing happens, it is making this House rather ridiculous and giving a certain amount of credence to what I have always regarded as a most unfair suggestion that hon. Members are herded into this Lobby or that at the will of the Whips. That is a thing which I think we ought to dissuade the country from believing, but if, having during the Report stage been marched from five to two, hon. Members are now told by the Government Whips to "about turn," and march from two to three, I say that is making our proceedings rather ridiculous. I do not think it is necessary for me to go into the merits of the matter; they have been fully discussed in both Houses. What I stand on is the undertaking which my right hon. Friend gave us and which was honoured on both sides, and I look to the Government to honour that undertaking to-day and to ask the House not to agree, but to disagree, with the Lords Amendment.</p>

<p>I do not think that the alteration from two years to three will make much practical difference to the operation of the Bill, but it seems to me that what we are being asked to do to-day in this House is a matter of some serious import affecting Members, not only on this side of the House, but on the other side as well. We were given, as my right hon. Friend has said, an undertaking on the terms that we did not move Amendments and that he got his Schedule unaltered. That part of the bargain was fulfilled, and the Minister in this House fulfilled his part of the bargain. As I understood it, the Government were committed to this matter unalterably. Now we are asked to retrace our steps because of an Amendment accepted in another place. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Sir J. Mellor). I would ask the Minister to adhere to his undertaking, an undertaking which was binding on the Government and from which he has not been released. If it be the case that, owing to the pressure of trying to get this Bill through in a hurry before the Session ended, some slip occurred, or there was a breakdown in the usual channels of communications, or something of that sort, if this was an error and steps will be taken to see that it will never occur again, and it must never be treated as a precedent, then I feel we might, on this occasion alone, accede to the Lords Amendment. But unless that is made quite clear, I think we should insist on the undertaking given in this House being honoured.</p>

<p>It must be a question of the utmost moment to this House whether obligations entered into by the Government can be honourably counted upon by the House. What we are now being asked to do by the Minister is to agree with the Lords Amendments which have the effect of going back upon a pledge. I think my right hon. Friend took this matter altogether too lightly. I think it is absolutely essential to that sort of relationship which makes it possible to work things in this House, that it should not he thought that if the Government or a responsible Minister has made a pledge that that pledge will not be honoured. Personally, I do not mind whether it is two or three years, but I do


mind very much that it should be made abundantly clear, if a mistake has been made. The Government should say it is a mistake and should ask the House, in view of the difficulties arising in the passing of the Bill this Session, to forgive them. On that being done, I myself, would support the Lords Amendment.</p>

<p>They were pressed for five years, and just like my right hon. Friend, showed tact and good humour and tried to get the Bill through. From what I heard, the Lord Chancellor at the time, in order to get the Bill through, came to this compromise. As it happens, of course, the compromise goes a certain way to meet my point of view, but I am not taking that line. I say that as this is practically the last day of the Session, I do not think it is unreasonable that the right hon. Gentleman, in order to avoid a bitter controversy between the two Houses, should accept this compromise.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope that the House will not support the Lords Amendment. A specific undertaking was

given in regard to this matter, and I think it is a matter of considerable importance. I will read to the House what my right hon. Friend said when this matter was under discussion. He said:
<q> &#x2026;I undertake, if I emerge from the Committee stage with the powers that I am asking for accelerated procedure and public inquiry, I will introduce on Report an Amendment giving effect to the shorter time."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 4th October, 1944; Vol. 403, C, 1026.]</q>
Following that undertaking&#x2014;and I say this in no spirit of unpleasantness or criticism&#x2014;some of my hon. Friends and myself got together and went through the list of Amendments and decided, then and there, not to press them. We stopped any kind of obstruction taking place, although there is a lot in this Bill which, frankly, we do not like. It was only on the undertaking of my right hon. Friend, as I have said, that we decided not to press these Amendments. I have here eight Amendments which we decided to cut out in the light of the promise given by my right hon. Friend when he accepted, in spirit, the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Tamworth (Sir J. Mellor).<br/>
I, also, was present in another place when this matter was discussed, and, as my right hon. Friend has mentioned what took place there, I also would like to mention it. It was an inadequate discussion; only three or four speeches were made, and then, suddenly, this proposal was accepted and put forward in this form. I think the whole of the Debate on this Bill has been conducted as a Debate of high politics and also without any kind of acrimonious feeling or unkind remarks. I can think of nothing likely to cause more friction than if this quite specific undertaking given by my right hon. Friend is not honoured. We have got 30 pages of Lords Amendments, and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for South West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris) has pointed out, we have to get them through to-day. I am sure we shall all co-operate, but it is creating friction, and if my right hon. Friend after having given this undertaking, which we accepted in letter and in spirit, is not prepared to honour it, now that we have come to the final stages of this Bill, I sincerely hope that this House will not agree to this Amendment which has been sent to us from another place.</p>

<p>I find myself more in sympathy with the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller) than with that of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Penrith (Lieut.-Colonel Dower) who has just spoken. None of the hon. Members who have spoken against the proposal in the Lords Amendment have addressed themselves to the merits of the Amendment. Apparently it is not, in their view, of great importance whether there is a period of two years or three years. The point to which they have addressed themselves has been that of asking the Government to confess that there may have been some slight lack of co-ordination between the Ministers in charge of this Bill in this place and the other place.</p>

<p>I appreciate what has been said by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. He said he hoped the Government would indicate that there had been some slight misunderstanding between the Ministers responsible for the Bill in the two places, but I listened carefully to what the Minister said, and I think he went out of his way to say that he regretted what had happened, and that if it had not been for the exigencies of his office, and if he had been able to spend more time in another place, possibly this would not have happened. I hope, therefore, that hon. Members who are opposed to this Amendment are not going to ask for anything more than what I thought was the very frank admission on the part of the Minister that these things do happen. I would ask hon. Members to bear in mind the constitutional issue here. When I hear an hon. Member of this House say that a complaint is brought, not against the other Chamber of the Legislature but against the Government, I ask myself what exactly the opinion of hon. Members is of their responsibility. It is perfectly in Order, either in this House or the other, to insist upon an Amendment to a Bill, and I think it would be most unfortunate if it went out from this House that we disputed the right of any Chamber of the Legislature to insist on changes being made in a Bill when placed before them by the Government.</p>

<p>I cannot accept the argument of the last speaker, which seems to me entirely beside the point. There is no question here of anyone contesting the right of the other place to fulfil, in the very fullest measure, the functions for which it exists, but this is something quite different. The case here is that we have a very definite pledge given under circumstances which the right hon. Gentleman for South West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris) and the hon. Member for The High Peak (Mr. Molson) must know, as well as I do, constitute a well-understood part of our procedure, namely, that Bills are got through Committee in this House by a process of what is in effect bargaining, not merely with people who are in opposition to particular points, but with others who wish to modify different Clauses and Sub-sections. This process was very well illustrated on the Committee stage of this Bill. It was fully understood that a good deal of opposition would be withdrawn if certain undertakings were given. I myself congratulated my right hon. Friend the Minister for the very skilful way in which, as I thought, he conducted the Bill through Committee. But if we are now to say that we must no longer rely on a pledge given in this House because it is interfering with the privileges of another place, the whole of that procedure falls to the ground. I appreciated the candour of my right hon. Friend, but I hoped that he was going to propose that we should resist the Lords Amendment. That would have been a fitting conclusion. I do not feel very deeply about the merits of the case, and I should regret anything which would prevent this Bill getting on to the Statute Book as quickly as possible; but we ought not to allow a thing of this kind to occur, when a definite pledge has been given and, in response to it, a considerable amount of opposition has been withdrawn.</p>

<p>I do not think my right hon. Friend need unduly humiliate himself, or secure a white sheet for this occasion. But he is himself to blame for having given conflicting pledges on this issue.

<p>No. In the discussions which took place with the local authorities he definitely agreed that the period should be five years, and he put that in the Bill. I can assure my right hon. Friend that there was no misunderstanding about the effect of this provision. We on this side relied on the pledge which he gave, that he would stand by this period of five years. Then my right hon. Friend got himself into the difficulty which faces everybody who gives conflicting pledges. While I do not want him to humiliate himself about this matter, I feel that he has brought the difficulty upon himself. I am not going to enter into the constitutional arguments, although I am bound to say that, as long as there is a Second Chamber, its Members are entitled to have their own ideas.</p>

<p>Has not the Minister a right to consider the arguments put forward in the other Chamber? If the other Chamber is to be tied hand and foot by pledges given in this Chamber, there is no case for having a Second Chamber. The Lords are as much entitled to consider the merits as we are. They have come to the conclusion that three years is a proper period. It is true that they arrived at that conclusion by a process of bargaining, just as we arrived at two years by a process of bargaining in this House. The hon. and learned Member for North Edinburgh (Mr. Erskine-Hill) is, of course, quite alive to the implications of this agreement. He, very wisely, takes the view that, so long as my right hon. Friend is properly humble, this matter should not be pressed, because he realises that the effect of disagreeing with the Lords on this Amendment is that the Bill will be destroyed. There are hon.

<p>I would express agreement with what my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) has said. A point of some constitutional importance arises here. I find myself in disagreement with my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mr. Colegate)&#x2014;I hope he will not mind my saying so; one has to be careful now about expressing disagreement, because one is accused of making charges. The position that the Tory Party has always taken up is that the other place is a live Assembly, which has a right to do as it wishes to do. As I understood the hon. Member for The Wrekin, he contended that, because a bargain had been reached in this House &#x2014;I thought the word "bargain" was unfortunate, but perhaps that was the case&#x2014;between the Government and Tory Members who are not in agreement with the Town and County Planning Bill, the Lords were bound to accept that bargain. That is not so. I would go further, and say that if a Minister has come to an agreement with Members of this House who are normally supporters of the Government but are not supporting them on this occasion, it is not necessarily the duty of a Minister in another place to accept that agreement; he must have regard to the opinions expressed in another place. That is what I think happened in this case. The general effect of this discussion would be to give the impression&#x2014;I hope it is a wrong impression&#x2014;that some Members of the Tory Party wish to detract from what are the undoubted powers and privileges of another place.</p>

<p>I had not intended to speak on this subject, but as some of my hon. Friends have ex-


hausted their right to speak I feel that somebody should make our position clear. I think that the Noble Lord has missed the point of our attack on the Government. We do not in the least complain that another place has passed an Amendment, changing the legislation which we have passed. What we object to is that the Government gave a guarantee, and then accepted an Amendment in another place without making any effort to carry out that guarantee.</p>

<p>I, too, would like to make my position dear. The hon. Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) said that certain hon. Members wished to destroy the Bill. That is the last thing I want to see. The opposition to this Amendment has been inspired by no desire for the destruction of the Bill whatever. I hope that that will be borne in mind by the Noble Lord the Member for Horsham and Worthing (Earl Winterton).</p>

<p>The other point made by the hon. Member for Peckham was based on a complete misinterpretation of what actually occurred. What occurred in another place was that the Government accepted the Amendment without a fight, without a Division. If the other place, in the execution of its duty, had defeated the Government and inserted "three" instead of "two," that would have been a different matter. Our argument is that the Minister, having given an undertaking in this House, has committed the whole of the Government, in whichever House the Ministers concerned happened to sit. That is, I think, a point of some constitutional importance. I do not think it was appreciated by the hon. Member for The High Peak (Mr. Molson) that when a Minister gives an undertaking in this House, that undertaking commits the whole of the Government, and not merely those Ministers who are in this House. That is the gravamen of our charge against the Government. We do not wish to destroy the Bill, or in any way to conflict with the complete rights of the other place to discuss the Bill on its merits. In view of what has happened, I should have thought that the Minister would have come down to this House and have asked us to "disagree with the Lords in

the said Amendment." I personally wish he had done so.</p>

<p>I know that the House does not wish to delay a decision on this question. On the other hand, I fully realise that hon. Members, in all quarters of this House, consider that an important point is involved. I certainly do not accuse any Member of this House of wishing to destroy the Bill. There are, perhaps, three different aspects of the question. The first is merits. About that I do not propose to speak, because, even among those who think that we should disagree with the Lords Amendment on other grounds, the majority think that there is nothing in it on the merits; and I am satisfied that, if necessary, I could prove that to the satisfaction of every Member. I will only say&#x2014;I will come to the pledge later&#x2014;that it would be quite impossible to ask the House to disagree with the Lords Amendment without going into the merits. The second point is the constitutional position. On that I do not wish to say more than that it is quite clear that we cannot, by anything we say in this House, bind those in another place in the actions they take. I fully agree with my hon. Friends who have said that that is not necessarily a defence of the conduct of the Government, if it is found that they did not put the matter rightly in the other place. I am not going to make light of the pledge that was given by my right hon. Friend&#x2014;I am quite certain that when my hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Edinburgh (Mr. Erskine-Hill) examines HANSARD tomorrow he will not come to the conclusion that my right hon. Friend made light of it this morning.<br/>
I must, I am afraid, turn for a moment to the speech of the hon. Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin), which I do not think has facilitated proceedings to-day at all. On the Report stage, when the Minister fulfilled this pledge, the hon. Member for Peckham said that this took him completely by surprise&#x2014;it should not have done anything of the sort&#x2014;and that he must divide the House and vote against the Third Reading and so on. I was quite convinced then that the hon. Member must have forgotten what had taken place and so made this violent attack upon the Minister which has been repeated ever since in organs of the Press.


I thought that the hon. Member was doing it because he had forgotten what had happened. The fact is that, on 4th October, in this House, the Minister did give a pledge in the clearest possible language that, if he got the Bill through in that form with all the new procedure, he would introduce on Report stage precisely the reduction to two years which he subsequently effected, and the argument about five years in Clause 1 is, as the hon. Member perfectly well knows, quite a different subject.<br/>
The pledge was given, and the gravamen of the charge against the Government, considering the constitutional position, is that, that pledge having been given, the Government did not fight as they should have fought in another place to see that no alteration was made. Let us see what the position was. I crave the sympathy of the House, at least, for this&#x2014;that it has not been an entirely simple or short Bill in this House. I think my hon. Friends in all quarters may realise that it was not an absolutely simple Bill in another place. One hon. Member says that there is a great deal in this Bill which many hon. Members in this House do not like. It is quite conceivable that there are things in this Bill which Members of another place did not like. The Bill was piloted through another place, and, when the Amendment was moved, it was to restore the five years. When people talk about accepting the Amendment, many of them speak as if the Amendment put forward had been accepted. That is not what happened.<br/>
In another place, the Amendment to restore five years was resisted by the Government, and, after debate, a suggestion of three years was put forward by a legal member of that Assembly and commanded general assent. I am not clear myself&#x2014;perhaps those with constitutional knowledge greater than mine will answer this&#x2014;that the Government must necessarily insist upon a Division in another place on account of what had happened in this place, but I am sure that what had happened in this place should have been well in the mind of the Minister then in charge and of others. I say it is not entirely easy, because hon. Members know how quickly things move in Committee, but, if there is blame in this matter, I think it has been taken by my right hon.

Friend the Minister, and I think it is only right to say that he may have taken it too generously, because I am not at all sure that, if any Minister is to blame, it is not much more myself, since, at that time, I was in another place and he was not.</p>

<p>Whether or not there is any hon. Member of this House who would have challenged a Division in another place, it would never have occurred to me that was the appropriate way by which I should leave the Government service. I did not bring sufficiently to the notice of the Minister in charge exactly what was the nature of the pledge. I will not assure the House that I had the exact phrase in my mind as I have it now, but I had the general purpose absolutely in mind and remembered that we had insisted upon a shorter period under this Clause, if we got the Schedules for the improved procedure through. Having given this explanation, and having said that, undoubtedly, although each Chamber has its rights, the Government is one, I think the pledge the Minister gave was fully honoured in this place. We could not guarantee what would hapen in another place, and the failure is solely a failure, I think, of the Minister and myself sufficiently to bring to the notice of those in another place what had happened here, and, with that explanation, I hope my hon. Friends will not take too grave a view of our conduct.</p>

During our discussions in this place, the hon.

I promised to consider it, and these words give effect to what was then desired.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the Minister for the very full and entirely satisfactory way in which he has carried out what he said during the Committee stage here.

<p>I also am very glad that the Minister has taken steps to bring into being this Amendment. I have often condemned the position of another place, and have often held that that assembly was of very little use, but on this occasion it has served a purpose. In parts of the country where there have been mining operations, or other kinds of operations, land has been left derelict, or disfigured with slag-heaps which are an eyesore to everybody. This Amendment gives power to the local authority, if they so desire, to take over that land. I accept it, for that reason and also because the price for the land will be such as will take account of its being derelict land. I thank the Minister for keeping in mind the necessity of dealing with this kind of thing.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I cannot add my praise to this chorus. Although I am just as anxious as the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller), there are one or two points upon which I would like an assurance. First, as to the importance of the words:
<q>likely otherwise to remain so for a considerable period.</q>
I give second place to no one in wanting to bring about development, and my only criticism of the Bill is whether it will bring about development, but there are occasions where land does remain undeveloped and which are not the occasions when people are holding out for high prices&#x2014;speculators, who my hon. Friend above the Gangway condemned, as I do also. But there are occasions when restrictions prevent the development of land and when negotiations have to take place so that land will be acquired either for the development of the whole


area or in order to carry out a single development. I want my right hon. Friend to give us an assurance that the words
<q>likely otherwise to remain so for a considerable period,</q>
which I regard as very important, will cover the case where land is to be developed as soon as possible and where, if it happens to be derelict land at the time, the local authority should not get the advantage of that fact in acquiring it under the provisions.</p>

<p>I would like to have a word of explanation from the Minister of the words:
<q>A local planning authority may be authorised in manner aforesaid to purchase compulsorily land in the area of the authority.</q>
I am not thinking of mining areas where you have a disused mine or anything of that kind, or of areas where there has been an aerodrome, I am thinking of the position in my native city of Glasgow, where great tracts of land are derelict. For instance, land belonging to the Duke of Montrose has become derelict and overrun with bracken. Am I to understand that the local authority, either of Dumbartonshire or the city of Glasgow, will be in a position now to get that land if they want it for housing, not at an immense price, but at the value which the Duke of Montrose, for instance, puts on it when he is paying his tax upon it? The city of Glasgow has been exploited time and time again by the Duke of Montrose. It has been laid down that, unless they are prepared to pay a certain sum to him, they will not get the land, which has become derelict and over-run with bracken so that nothing will grow upon it. Will the local authority be able to get that land at the price which, say, the Duke of Montrose puts on the land now and which is below agricultural value?</p>

<p>I also wish to associate myself with the expressions of gratitude from hon. Members opposite. This Amendment will give the local authority powers which, hitherto, they did not possess. My local authority has been placed at a very great disadvantage by not having powers to purchase land in order to execute our town planning. This will afford us a great opportunity. As I stood in the centre of my constituency a few days ago looking North, South, East and West&#x2014;whichever way I looked&#x2014;I saw a patch of water or a large pit-heap that would be required to be taken into account for the purposes of planning.

I would say, in reply to my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Penrith (Lieut.-Colonel Dower) that he may be confusing undeveloped land with derelict land. This is land which has been destroyed practically by industrial processes and it is to deal with that that this new Sub-section has been introduced. It does not deal with the whole question of undeveloped land as such. In reply to the hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood), this Bill does not apply to Scotland, so that it will not affect in any way the relationships of his native city and Scotland, but I have no doubt that he will keep a vigilant eye on my colleague, my right hon.

The next four Amendments are all related and deal with a point which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) previously and I would like to say a few words about them together if that would meet the wishes of the House. The first Amendment is that the authority referred to is the promoting authority, and then there is a drafting Amendment in page 17, line 32, to leave out "that" and insert, "the promoting." In line 34, there is a long Amendment comprising Sub-sections (2) (3) and (4), and finally, another Amendment introducing another Sub-section in line 35. These all run together. They concern the relations of the promoting authority that is arranging for an over-spill area in the area of another authority. There are three points of importance with regard to an over-spill. The first is the manner of lay-out, the second, the rapidity with which you can get on with the job, and the third, the accommodation provided for the people who are to go there. You have not only to allow the authority in whose area the over-spill is placed to have rights but you have to provide rights for the authority that is promoting the over-spill there, the authority from which the people are coming. The general provision is that we hope it will be done by agreement but we have laid down a proviso for introducing variations and modifications in default of agreement.

<p>I only rise to say that my right hon. Friend the Minister has handsomely met the point put to him in the course of the proceedings in this House. The relations between an

authority which wants to enter the area of another authority are always very delicate and require very careful handling and the Minister has taken a good deal of trouble to ensure that provisions are incorporated in the Bill which will be fair to the authority which desires to come into the area of the other authority, and to the other authority as well. It is only right to pay this tribute to my right hon. Friend because I have had occasion to say other things to him.</p>

<p>I do not in any way wish to hinder the progress of the Bill, indeed, it is my intention, I hope, to help its administration and possibly avoid some friction which might arise unless note is taken of this particular matter. Many towns are making their schemes in regard to future planning and it will necessitate, in the case of many of those towns taking in a small portion of public land, very small portions probably, in many cases for the widening of the highway and possibly, on some occasions, for building purposes.<br/>
We all know that land of equal consequence will be substituted if possible, but the difficulty arises not only with my own Corporation, but probably with many Corporations with private Acts of Parliament relating to these public lands. If I might cite the instance which I have in mind, the Corporation of Southampton, perhaps it will be to the point. The public lands of Southampton are regulated under the Southampton Marshlands and Markets Act, and Section 72 definitely prohibits the use of those public lands far any other purpose than as parks, gardens, pleasure grounds, and so on, for the inhabitants of Southampton and for those who come there. The other place have inserted a new Sub-section which I think is intended

to enable the Corporation to obtain an Order from the Minister authorising them to appropriate land which forms part of an open space for the purposes of Part of the Bill which includes development. However, the new Sub-section says this:
<q>&#x2026; including any such land which is specially regulated by any enactment, whether public general or local or private. &#x2026;</q>
The word to which I would draw the attention of the right hon. and learned Gentleman is "regulated." The reason for these words, I believe, is that a general Act of Parliament does not override a local act unless by express provision or by necessary implication. It will be noted that the word "regulated" is used, and I am a little doubtful whether it may be said that Section 72 of the Act of Parliament regarding the Southampton Marsh and Markets regulates the use of public land. What it does is to prohibit the use of those lands except as open spaces, but there is a difference in my opinion between "regulating" and "prohibiting." The Marsh and Markets Act with regard to Southampton common and waste land says:
<q>&#x2026; No part thereof be at any time taken or used for any other purpose than that of the public pleasure.</q>
I do not want to press my Amendment unduly if the right hon. Gentleman will give me an assurance that it is a mere drafting Amendment. I suggest, in order to avoid contention later, that he should assure me there is ample legal cover in the Bill in regard to this matter, because it is important and might lead to a great deal of trouble in the future. I do want the Corporation to have this particular power, and this question applies, probably on account of many private acts of Parliament, to many other corporations which will want to develop their towns after the war.</p>

<p>I rise to support this Amendment because Southampton has had a very severe "blitzing," and it necessitates a very broad plan for the purposes of redevelopment. In order to make Southampton's re-development scheme of the standard we desire Southampton to have, there will have to be some encroachment upon these public lands. The word "regulated" does not seem to us to give the opportunity to carry out the plan already


designed. It is important that Southampton should in no way be restricted from this reasonable course in its redevelopment scheme from this point of view also, that Southampton is the gateway to England and is also the largest passenger port in the British Empire. I put those two points forward to support and strengthen my contention that the word "regulated" should have as wide an interpretation as possible; otherwise we may find that the Southampton Marshlands and Markets Act may restrict the development of the plan which has already been designed.</p>

<p>I only intervene for a moment because, while one realises the importance of Southampton, which is not only a borough but a county, there are other difficulties which I foresee. In Holborn we have Gray's Inn subject to town planning and Lincoln's Inn exempt, and there are many private Acts of Parliament which give power even to individuals, such as the new building erected a few years ago on the Embankment under a separate Act of Parliament. I would invite the Solicitor-General's attention to the fact that, so far as I see it, this Section will not provide for clearing away what will ultimately prove to be an obstruction. We ought to consider whether there are not certain private Acts which should be repealed, and I ask the Solicitor-General to consider whether this Bill is as comprehensive as it ought to be.</p>

<p>May I first deal with the point which concerns the hon. Members who sit for Southampton (Dr. Russell Thomas and Mr. Craven-Ellis)?

<p>I have told my hon.

With regard to the wider point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn (Sir Robert Tasker) I think that that is not a point on the word "regulated," so much as a point on the Amendment.

<p>This Amendment is designed to meet certain difficulties in the way of getting into the hands of local planning authorities, for the purposes of their redevelopment and planning functions under the Bill, open spaces which already belong to them but are in their hands for the purposes of their function relating to open spaces and the like. There are two difficulties. The first is that the Section, without this Amendment, only permits of appropriation in a case in which the land in question is not required for its existing purpose, and it is very difficult to say whether you can ever predicate that of an open space. The second is the special statutory provision, of which I am obliged to my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton (Dr. Russell Thomas) for giving so clear an example, with which I have tried to deal.<br/>
The Amendment aims at removing these difficulties, and it will be noted by the House that it leaves the Minister subject to Parliamentary control. As I said, my hon. Friend the Member for Holborn has raised the question of acquiring the Inns of Court. Apart from my personal interest as one of the Benchers of Grays Inn &#x2014;which I ought to declare to the House as in that sense, I suppose, I am a registered proprietor of that part of his constituency&#x2014;I would suggest to the House that it is rather outside the field of this Amendment which deals with open spaces and the like, but that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has noted his point, and so shall I, and we shall both keep it in mind.</p>

<p>Will this power to purchase land in exchange be exercised rigidly, and only the exact quantity of land allowed in exchange, or will this

This also is to secure an improvement which was suggested when this matter was before the House, I think on the Report stage, and it provides for the advertisement in the "London Gazette" and locally of any proposal of a local planning authority to dispose of, or appropriate, any building which is listed as being of special architectural or historical interest before the Minister gives his decision on the application for his consent, except when the consent is given subject to conditions that will secure that the building is preserved.</p>

This remedies a technical defect in the words as they were.

The situation with which this Amendment deals is one in which the Minister has to consider under Sub-section (3) of Clause 18, whether a person other than the local planning authority is able and willing to carry out certain development for the carrying out of which on land belonging to it the authority is given the Minister's consent. The points he will have to consider will be the terms on which the land is likely to be made available to him and the purpose of the provision as amended is to state what the assumption is taken to be.

The question was raised in another place of the transfer of the powers of the local planning authority to an authorised association, and the direct payment of grants to an association. This Amendment, we hope, avoids difficulties by leaving the responsibility for the exercise of the powers, under the Bill, with the local planning authority, and gives that authority power to make arrangements for actual development to be carried out by an authorised association. I think it will be the general view that that is a more suitable way of dealing with the problem of using an association.</p>

For instance, the Ministry might want eventually to set up a housing association in order to carry out, on a grander scale, the building of houses, and under the Statute it would appear to me that the Government would be deprived of authority to hand over to such an association any powers to take action under this Clause, and that the local authority might have power to obstruct in such a case.

This Amendment meets a promise given to my hon. Friend the Member for Stone

(Sir J. Lamb) when he raised this point at the instance of the County Councils' Association. Its object is to enable the local highway authority to purchase land compulsorily for the construction or improvement of a road which is needed in consequence of the stopping up of a highway under this scheme. It would often be impracticable to stop up a highway which, under the present position, prevents necessary development being carried out unless a new highway is provided to replace it, and it is almost common form that where highways are stopped up under a planning scheme provision ought to be made for a new highway.</p>

I would like to explain the general import of what I may call the Postmaster-General Amendments. I think it would be for the convenience of the House, and then we could probably take this Amendment and the following Amendments together. The effect of the provision of the Bill, as it now stands, is that the Post-master-General retained permanently the right to remove telegraph posts or lines on the stopping up of a highway, under this Clause, and, normally, the Post-master-General was entitled to recover the cost of removal from the local planning authority or the highway authority, as the case may be.


The effect of the Amendments is, first, to require the Postmaster-General to decide within three months whether he exercises his power of removal or abandons the line; secondly, if he does not decide to exercise his power of removal the apparatus vests in the highway authority or planning authority and any obligation under the Telegraphs Act ceases to apply. Thirdly, the costs that the Postmaster-General is entitled to recover are limited to those incurred in the provision of a line in substitution for the old line and any necessary connection. I think the House will agree that the Postmaster-General has not come well out of the amended proposals but that they do justice and ensure practicality between the central Government and the local authority.</p>

<p>The Post Office is, of course, specially treated in the Budget now. It is a self-supporting Department and one has to cost and budget accurately to see whether it is doing that. Similarly the local authority has to keep its accounts and see how it is functioning. It is so serious a point that in the case of the Postmaster-General <i>v.</i> the Corporation of Liverpool in 1923 the local authority and the Postmaster-General fought it so hard that it went right up to the House of Lords to see who would bear the cost.

This has been fully considered and agreed with the Bishop of London and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and its object is to see that Church property,


whether consecrated or unconsecrated, is treated in a proper manner. Without this Clause there would be a serious defect under the Bill and it would be very difficult to deal with the land having regard to a great number of other Statutes. As regards consecrated land, the effect of consecration at common law is to set apart the subject matter <i>ad sacros usus</i> for ever, and any such land or building acquired or appropriated or disposed of under the general powers conferred by the Bill would nevertheless remain impressed with the effects of consecration and its user would continue to be limited.<br/>
The purpose of Sub-section (1) is to remove this restriction upon the use of consecrated land or buildings acquired or appropriated under the general powers. I do not think I need go into the details of the numerous enactments dealing with this property because the effect of the Clause is to deal satisfactorily with consecrated land. Unconsecrated churches and buildings are not commonly sold. Where they are sold the sale is by voluntary agreement and the owner is able to secure such conditions as to demolition or user as will not be repugnant to the religious feeling or the canon law or customs of the Church concerned. Sub-sections (2) and (3) are intended to secure as nearly as possible the sort of restrictions on the use of churches and buildings used for religious worship acquired or appropriated under the Bill, as in the case of a sale by voluntary agreement must by Statute be imposed or would properly be imposed by the owner. I am afraid this subject is highly technical but it has been very fully considered and I think the Amendment meets an object which the whole House would wish should be met.</p>

Open spaces are subject to special statutory regulation and doubt has been expressed whether, in the absence of express provision, an open space could be used freely in connection with a plan of redevelopment, even though its acquisition or appropriation by a local planning authority had been expressly authorised under Clause 13. For planning purposes it is essential that land of this kind should be capable of being freely used, notwithstanding subsisting statutory restrictions, once its acquisition or appropriation has been approved. It would be a fantastic position if the whole process of approval of use for a proper purpose for replanning should be defeated because, notwithstanding the appropriation, there were still a legal restriction on the use intended. Such approval cannot be given, of course,


having regard to the express terms of Clause 13, without Parliamentary sanction unless it is certified that substituted open space has been provided or is unnecessary.

The reason for the decision of a local planning authority on an application for permission to carry out development in the case of war-damaged property out of which the obligation of the authorities to purchase arises may be some requirement of a county council. When the war-damaged building is on the line of a proposed new road the county council would not wish the building to be restored. The association of these bodies represented that it would be better that the county council should acquire direct, and this Amendment makes that provision.</p>

This Amendment was made at the request of the County Councils Association and it enables a county council to contribute towards expenses incurred by a local planning authority under the Clause and to borrow money for the purpose. The reasons are the same as the House has already appreciated which have made it necessary to enable a county council to purchase the land in question in some cases. Where the ground of the decision is interim development which makes a contribution necessary for the purposes of the county council, the local planning authority might very often be unwilling to bear the cost.

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to the Lords Amendment, line 1, leave out "As soon as may be after," and insert "Before."<br/>
The point I wish to put before the House is this. A list has to be compiled of buildings of special or historic importance. It is generally agreed that that should be done, but&#x2014;and there is a very definite but&#x2014;it must be recognised that the moment a building is put on the list, although it may be safeguarded, injurious affection can take place in a certain way. The moment a building is listed no alterations seriously affecting the character of the building can be carried out for two months. If it is, there is a fine of &#x00A3;50 and a possible order for re-instatement,

and reasonable steps have to be taken to maintain it in a good condition. If the building is of special architectural or historic importance, no exception can be taken to that, but if the owner has any doubt that it should be included in the list because, for instance, it is a Victorian or an Elizabethan imitation of a Gothic house, or is not of sufficient historical value, my Amendment is reasonable. This provides that he should be given notice before the building is listed, so that, before the restrictions apply, he will have a chance of saying that it is not a suitable building to be put on the list and have these restrictions applied to it.<br/>
I can give an instance of this. A building which was falling to pieces, and which would have fallen to pieces in spite of the town planning authority, was bought for conversion into a hotel. Had the building been of great historic or architectural importance, I should have been against it being converted into a hotel and the first to lead a riot against such an action being taken. Actually, it was a border-line case. The owner sank all his savings into it, and he will lose every penny if he is prevented from converting it. I suggest that, instead of a building being listed and the owner having to apply for permission to convert it, he should have the opportunity before it is put on the list of saying that it is not a suitable building to be put on the list.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment to the Lords Amendment. <br/>
I do so for the same reasons that my hon. and gallant Friend has put forward, and also for a slightly different reason. In order that the planning authorities can compile the they will presumably acquire some knowledge of the buildings which they are to recommend should be put on the list. Therefore, they will have to carry out inspections of the buildings and take some steps to ascertain whether the properties are worth going on the list. In these circumstances, an owner of property will presumably have some knowledge that his property is likely to get on the list. If he does not wish it, there should be a time within which he can make representations to the Minister. That is one of the objects of the Amendment.</p>

<p>I do not think that my hon. and gallant Friends have clearly in mind the great distinction there is between the effect of placing a building on the list and the effect of making an Order under Section 17 of the Act of 1932, as amended by the Clause which we shall next consider, concerning that building. I know that both my hon. Friends share the enthusiasm which is felt in all quarters of the House for the maintenance of the architectural treasures of this country. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Penrith and Cockermouth (Lieut.-Colonel Dower) said that if something happened he would be the first to lead a riot. One of the objects of this legislation is to avoid the necessity of his leading a riot and to make statutory provision for some other remedy. Let me explain what is the only effect of listing a building. It achieves two things. First, it requires two months' notice to be given to the local planning authority of any proposed demolition, alteration or extension. Secondly, it imposes on the Minister under Clause 17, Sub-section (8), considerable restrictions on what he can allow the local authority to do with such a building, should the authority acquire it.<br/>
These are the two effects of placing a building on the list. It has not the effect which my hon. and gallant Friend assumed, that any permission has to be obtained from the local authority for anything whatever. It does not necessitate the owner's obtaining consent for anything, nor does it authorise anybody to refuse him consent for anything. It does, however, restrict him for two months after he has been given notice from doing any sort of repairs or alterations except certain emergency work. That is the sole disadvantage, if it is a disadvantage, under which he is placed; for two months he cannot do any major alterations. The object of those two months is to give the local planning authority an opportunity to consider whether it is a building about which it would like to make an Order under the 1932 Statute as amended. If it decides that it is a case for making such an Order, the owner may, of course, have all sorts of views about it which must be considered before the Order is confirmed. The actual notice under existing Regulations which the owner gets is 14 days. Under the new Regulations

which we propose to make the notice will be 28 days.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend may say, "Although this may be true, why not accept the Amendment and give notice at an earlier stage?" I think I can give an answer which my hon. and gallant Friend, with his usual fairness, will consider is a proper answer. If we gave an owner notice that the Minister proposed to include a building on the list, most owners would consider it improper to demolish the building the moment they got the notice. But would all? Suppose a multiple shop company had acquired a beautiful Queen Anne building in the main street of one of those towns which the late Gilbert Chesterton referred to as the crown jewels of England, for no other purpose than to pull it down and put up its multiple shop. It receives notice that the building is about to be placed on a list, after which things may happen rather rapidly, and the demolition may be prevented. At the moment, the multiple shop people can, with perfect legality, pull that house down. My hon. and gallant Friend might say&#x2014;</p>

<p>I was coming to that point. It is a technical matter, and I do not think that I should have omitted it if my hon. and gallant Friend had not reminded me. I certainly shall not omit it now, so let me deal with it at once. I assure him that he is wrong. The Emergency Order can be made by the Minister only if the local authority have made a Preservation Order, but the local authority in the case may not have the least intention of making a Preservation Order. The Minister would then have no power to make the Order to which my hon. and gallant Friend referred. The only other thing I think, which he could suggest, holding the views he does on preservation, is that we should give a man notice that we are going to put his house on the list, and should also put in some penal provision, stopping him thereafter from doing any work on it for a period; but that would only enable us to do very clumsily what can now be done quite simply. If we are going to attach penal provisions to his doing anything after we have given him notice, we might


just as well compile the list and then, if good reasons are shown that the house should not be on that list, amend the list. If we did the only thing which would make an Amendment such as my hon. and gallant Friend proposes safe, we should be in no better position that we are with the Clause as it stands.<br/>
I hope I have dealt with all the points that arise. I am confident that when my hon. and gallant Friend realises that the only effect adverse to the owner of placing his house on the list is to impose a delay of two months, during which he can do nothing but emergency work, and that when the time comes for making the Preservation Order, not only does he have every opportunity of objecting but that we are increasing the notice he is to have before the Order is confirmed, he may see his way to withdrawing his Amendment.</p>

The proposed Sub-section (3) is designed, in the interests of the owner, to prevent this power being used in any vexatious way to check alterations in a building which really need not be checked at all. It meets the general desire to insert words into the Clause to make it clear that alterations or extensions of buildings for which the consent of the local authority, or on appeal of the Minister, may be required, and which are to be prohibited in the absence of consent, are only such as would seriously affect the character of the building. The object of the new Sub-section (4) is to make it quite clear that the obligation on the Minister to consider representations from the owner before an Order is made, which is expressly given by Section 17 of the Statute of 1932, will apply to an Order prohibiting the alteration or extension of a building. The effect of Sub-section (4) was, in fact, as a matter of legal construction, already in the Bill; but it is just as well that the owner's rights should be quite clear on the face of the Statute.</p>

<p>I wonder whether I may now ask the Minister a question which I asked him just now. This is a particularly important matter, and the House will be glad to have an assurance. What we have in mind is to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that this Clause, and the preservation one as now amended, give him power not only to list and preserve a particular building of artistic merit but to prevent its being spoiled by undesirable development around.<br/>
Let me take one particular case. Lewes High Street is a place for which my hon. Friend and myself have a great affection. In that street are a number of Queen Anne and early Georgian houses. They are all of that character, but between them there are innocuous early Victorian houses, mellowed by time. They live together in a very happy street. If one of those beautiful Queen Anne houses were listed and preserved, and although it could not be demolished or spoiled, if it had as neighbour instead of the existing old houses a multiple shop on the one side and the fake classical fa&#x00E7;ade of a banking palace on the other side, the value of that house as an example of the period, and the value and beauty of the street, would be ruined, almost as much as if the house itself had been demolished. When I raised these points earlier, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary were very sympathetic and they promised to see whether they could, at a later stage, take powers to effect that sort of preservation.</p>

The proposed Sub-sections&#x2014;and I thank my hon. and gallant Friend for the way in which he has welcomed them&#x2014;limit what it is proper and possible for the Order to contain. It is the Order that we have to look at, to see what the owner can do and what he cannot do. I do not know whether I have made this point quite clear to all hon. Members, but that is the position. The effect of it is that it is only things that seriously affect the character of a building that properly fall within the Order.<br/>
Now let me turn to the point put by the hon. Member for Kennington (Mr. Wilmot) and other hon. Members. The hon. Member gave examples of streets of admirable houses and mentioned one of the best in the country, Lewes High Street, which is the subject of the last chapter of a fascinating book, which I hope everybody will get, by the Director of the National Buildings Record, called "Our Building Inheritance." The book should be in the hands of every local planning authority.</p>

<p>It is not an improper one, I hope. Let me say to my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for North Kensington (Captain Duncan) and the hon. Member for Kennington that there is a great deal for which we must rely on civilised action by local planning authorities. I would just remind them of the Sub-section I mentioned before, Clause 17 (8), in which it is stated:
<q>In exercise of the powers conferred by this Section a local planning authority shall have regard to the desirability of preserving features of special architectural or historic interest.</q>
Those words give direction and guidance to local authorities about what they are to do in this matter.</p>

<p>I thought that, having drawn the attention of the House to this, I had probably reached the bounds of Order. My answer to the hon. Member is that these surroundings can be protected, but mainly by other planning powers, not preservation orders. The authorities can, however, acquire what I might call the immediate surroundings of these buildings. If Members will look at Sub-section (6) of the Clause we are dealing with, they will see that a local authority
<q>may, with the consent of the Minister, acquire by agreement the building and any land comprising or contiguous or adjacent to it which appears to the authority and the Minister to be required for maintaining it or the amenities thereof,</q>
and they can also acquire by compulsion in certain cases. I think the hon. Member will find the answer to his question in Sub-section (6) of Clause 41 which we are now considering.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
This is a small Amendment which deals with the tribunal to consider questions of external elevation and design where there is an operative scheme. Where there is an operative scheme under the Town and Country Planning Acts, 1932 and 1943, the appeal by an aggrieved owner, who wishes to do something to his building to which the planning authority objects, under the scheme can go either to a court of summary jurisdiction or a special tribunal. The present Amendment supplies a third alternative, which the scheme may provide, namely, the Minister. There are I think considerable advantages in that. A court of summary jurisdiction is, by general consent, not a suitable tribunal for these questions. There cannot be a single special tribunal, and a multiplicity of special tribunals would mean that it would become more difficult to work out a code or standard for the guidance of all concerned, and an appeal by agreement to the Minister is now a good deal more popular than that form of tribunal in many cases. The matter, of course, will not be quite outside the control of this House. This is only what a scheme may provide, and of course a scheme has to be laid

before this House. It is an obvious improvement to provide that the appeal may lie to the Minister who is already the person to whom the appeal lies at every stage until there is an operative scheme. He is the tribunal in all appeals on these questions under interim development control, which applies to almost the whole country, and it is proper, I think, that the questions which already come before him under interim development control should also come before him under an operative scheme.</p>

<p>I cannot let this pass without saying this is another instance where appeals are being placed entirely in the hands of the Minister.

I might have every confidence in him if I had not heard some of the remarks about what they wish to do so far as nationalisation of the land is concerned. I would only draw attention to the argument which has often been put forward as to whether one should always have to appeal to the head of the authority with whom one is at loggerheads.

Bill as it left us, three categories of circumstances where the existing use is preserved throughout the period of the war. I need not detail them now. It has occurred to us that one very valid reason is the entry of the person concerned into His Majesty's Services or into some other force or employment of that character.

The purpose of the Amendment is to enable the Metropolitan Boroughs to participate in the huge task of reconstruction which will fall upon London. The L.C.C. remains the planning authority for the whole of its area, but it can, by agreement with the Metropolitan Boroughs, in fact, get them to exercise some of the powers and do some of the work. This Amendment is the result of negotiations that have taken place between the L.C.C. and the Metropolitan Boroughs, discussions which, I am glad to say, were conducted in a spirit of cordiality and resulted in agreement.</p>

<p>I sincerely hope the House will not agree to any such proposal. I hope we have open minds on these Amendments. This is a very serious point. Woolworths, the store which provides things for large numbers of people, or the Co-operative Societies, or Marks and Spencers or anybody else, can occupy the ground floor of their premises and let off all the other floors and still be regarded as owner-occupiers for the purposes of compensation. I hope my right hon. Friend will correct me if

I am wrong, but I am told that that is so. I am also told that if the ground floor is a shop with a considerable number of flats over it they are still regarded as owner-occupiers. Now my right hon. Friend comes along and says that the investor in bricks and mortar must be treated in a different way, and if the shop is an estate office, and the flats above are let, then the owner is not going to be regarded as an owner-occupier. This is a very complicated Bill and I am trying to follow all the arguments. I have read the Debate on this particular point in the other place, which was not very enlightening, and I would ask my right hon. Friend to say that there is not a discrimination in this Lords Amendment against the use of the ground floor premises because they are being used as an estate office, or because some small portion of the building is used as an estate office. If that is not so, I hope the House will not accept this Amendment.</p>

We have not heard of her for a long time in connection with this Bill, as I think the right hon. Gentleman will agree. Does not this Amendment apply equally well to the individual, whether a widow or not, who owns one house, lives in the top half of it and lets the bottom half? She is resident there
<q>wholly or mainly in connection with the management, supervision or control of the building or property as a whole.</q>
It is true that the part in which she lives is her home, but the other part is equally the home of the person who lives there. I should like the assurance that this Amendment does not go beyond the very strict limits for which it is intended.</p>

<p>I am very anxious to meet the points that are causing my hon. Friends anxiety but I should like to be sure that I have them clearly in mind and am not merely shadow fighting with something which is not troubling them. I understand the point of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Penrith (Lieut.-Colonel Dower) is, in the main, concerned with people like Messrs.


Woolworth, or Montague Burton, whose main occupation is the shop and who let off the office premises above for some purpose or another. I would ask my hon. and gallant Friend to look at the words of the Clause. They say:
<q>&#x2026; a person shall not be treated under this paragraph as in occupation of a building or property by virtue of his occupying a part thereof if he occupied it wholly or mainly in connection with the management, supervision or control of the building or property as a whole.</q>
No one can say, and no court that I have ever had anything to do with could, I imagine, say that Messrs. Woolworth or Montague Burton occupied their premises wholly in connection with the management and control of their business. Their occupation would be for the purpose of the shop. Similarly, if I take the example of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Chichester (Lieut.-Commander Joynson-Hicks) of the widow who owns two houses, lives in one and has tenants in the other&#x2014;</p>

<p>If I might return for one moment to the argument of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Penrith there seems to be all the difference in the world to me between Woolworths, who have a big shop and pay big rates in order to run their business, and somebody who reserves in a block of flats a little portion in which he can have an office. Where there is a big building and one firm&#x2014;whose main source of income is the rents from that office building&#x2014;run a little estate agency in that building, they seem to be in a totally different field from Woolworths' and so I must really, with great respect, differ from my hon. and gallant Friend over that.<br/>
With regard to the widow who occupies one half of the building and lets the other half, again I should say that no-one in the world could suggest that she occupies her own dwelling house "wholly or mainly in connection with the management, supervision or control" of the other dwelling house. The possibility of driving a coach and horses through this does not frighten me. I doubt whether my hon. and gallant Friend, with all his skill, could drive a coach or even a pony cart through this one.</p>

<p>I am not very happy about this Amendment. I think it shows every evidence of not having been properly thought out. The Bill lays down that certain classes of property owners should be paid compensation at a certain rate, and another class at a higher rate. This Amendment seeks to ensure that certain occupiers shall not winkle them-


selves out of one class into another. To that extent it is desirable. But I submit that it will have an effect greater than that which is desired. In spreading the net to include those hypothetical winklers, the Amendment includes a number of other perfectly reputable persons, who vacate their premises temporarily, for perfectly legitimate reasons, in the course of their business. This legislation has been so rushed through that it was only this morning that I secured a copy of these Amendments&#x2014;when I went to the Vote Office before, they were not available. Consequently, I do not know how to get round this difficulty. But I am sure my right hon. Friends on the Front Bench should be able to think of a way out. Take the case of a small hotel at a seaside resort. That hotel is open only during the season. When the season is over the hotel closes and the management put in a caretaker. If the local authority wish to secure possession of that hotel for development, all they have to do is to wait until the season is over, and then say "Snap,' and the property is theirs at a lower figure. My right hon. Friend shakes his head, but I am convinced that I am right.</p>

<p>The important thing is to see why the caretaker is there. The caretaker could be there for either of two purposes: to let the premises, in which case the owner is not the occupier, or to look after the premises for the owner, in which case they should be treated as being owner-occupied. I urge my right hon. Friend to look into that matter.</p>

<p>I am not very happy about this either. What does this occupation really mean? I quite understand the case of an owner who, wanting to dispose of his property, takes the furniture out, and leaves a caretaker in the basement to look after the place and show prospective purchasers around. In that

case there may be an argument for the words in the Amendment. But the seaside hotel proprietor leaves the furniture there, with a caretaker, with the object of opening up when the season arrives. The rates are still being paid if the furniture is in the house. If "in occupation" means in rate-paying occupation, I think the Clause is all right; otherwise it wants looking into again.</p>

<p>I am a little disturbed about the remarks which have been made. Reference has been made to seasonal caretakers at boarding-houses, and so on, but there are other cases. For instance, on the Norfolk Broads there are many establishments, apart from boarding-houses and hotels, catering for visitors during the summer months, which for a great part of the year are left in the charge of a caretaker. I would like to see their position safeguarded.</p>

<p>I cannot see how there can be any certainty as to the meaning of this Clause. My right hon. and learned Friend will, I am sure, deal with the point in his lucid and learned way, but the expression "occupation," to which attention has been called, and also the expression "caretaker," struck me as being exceedingly difficult of interpretation, and liable to lead to very great hardship, particularly on the South coast and elsewhere, where so much damage has taken place, among people who are in occupation as caretakers in some form or another, even, it may be, in their own homes.</p>

<p>I very much appreciate that all my hon. Friends desire clarity in this matter. Therefore, I would ask them to spare one moment to look at the portion of the Bill to which this Amendment will apply. It is paragraph (<i>c</i>) of Sub-section (6) of Clause 53, which says:
<q>a person shall be treated as in occupation of a building or property if it is in the occupation of a person in his employment for the purposes of that employment.</q>
That is what we start with. Suppose a farmer has a cottage in the occupation of one of the workers on the farm, in his employment; he is in occupation of that cottage, through his employee. That we all approve of, and want to maintain.


We did not want that provision to be abused, so we inserted these words:
<q>so however that a person shall not be treated under this paragraph&#x2014;</q>
that is, the paragraph which I have read&#x2014;
<q>as in occupation of a building or property by virtue of any occupation thereof by a person employed by him as caretaker of that building or property</q>
The word "occupation" has, in this connection, the sense which it must bear in the context which I have already read out. If we take the example given by one hon. Member, who referred to the seaside hotel which puts in a caretaker for a portion of the year, and I think the hon. Member for North Kensington (Captain Duncan) had in mind the same example, there would be no doubt at all, in my view, that occupation would be by the hotel proprietor or the hotel company, and I cannot see any danger of anyone saying that because, for the winter months, occupation was by a caretaker, for that reason the person was not an owner-occupier. The answer to that would be: "I occupy this building to the full, proper, reasonable, economic extent for which it can be occupied for the purpose of running a seaside hotel." My hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Edinburgh (Mr. Erskine-Hill) was, I think, asking only for a fuller explanation, and I do not think he had in mind any specific point in addition to that with which I have tried to deal.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Penrith (Lieut.-Colonel Dower) seemed to me, if I may say so, to put his finger right on the point. Why is the caretaker there? That is the real test in the matter, and that is the test which is laid down in the Act when it is read, as I have endeavoured to point out to the House, with the context in which it is introduced. Although I fully appreciate that my hon. Friends are anxious that there should be no hardship in these cases, equally, I and my hon. Friends are the last people who would desire anyone with no real occupation to get a benefit because of the position of a caretaker. Therefore, if I may sum it up, we have protected the person who really occupies by a servant, like a farmer and the worker in his cottage, we have protected the person who is in seasonal, but none the less real, occupation as an hotel keeper, and the

only person we have not protected, but deliberately refrain from protecting, is, in the clear words of the Clause,
<q>the person whose only occupation is by virtue of any occupation thereof by a person employed by him as caretaker of that building or property.</q>
I say to my hon. Friend who have doubts about the drafting of the Clause that it will protect the caretaker as occupier of his own premises, as, in some cases, he is given a little flat, but it would not let him in as caretaker of the whole premises because he has that little flat. I hope I have made the matter clear.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. Member opposite should have thought it necessary to bring in matters of that sort, appropriate only to those who seek to gain party capital. I should have thought that both sides of the House were in entire agreement with the objects which it is intended to achieve, that is to say, to stop someone getting the 30 per cent increase by a bogus trick. The hon. Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) raised this point, and I, personally, am very glad that he did so, but I must confess that I feel some doubt still, in spite of what the Solicitor-General has said, whether the drafting of this Clause does not go beyond our common objects and might result in some injustices to people whom no one wants to injure by discriminating against them in comparison with other people. Having heard the Solicitor-General and his objections, it seems to me a matter of doubt whether this Clause and the Amendment achieve the agreed objective. My right hon. and learned Friend says it all depends on the purpose of the caretaking. There is nothing in this Amendment to distinguish


between different kinds of caretaker. What it says is:
<q>That a person shall not be treated &#x2026; as in occupation of a building or property by virtue of any occupation thereof by a person employed by him as caretaker of that building or property.</q>
It seems to me that those words are quite wide enough to cover the case of the South coast hotel, so as to be able to say that an hotel or boarding house for a seasonal period is in occupation by a person employed by the owner as a caretaker and so does not come within this Clause. I would like to ask the Minister to consider this matter further. I think both sides of the House are agreed upon the objective, but I think the Amendment goes a little beyond what is required. Although our opportunities of amending this Amendment are limited to-day by considerations of what might happen if we did, and although, in respect to what the hon. Member for Peckham said, I am not one of those who do not wish to see the Bill on the Statute Book, if the Minister will consider this wording further, and, if necesary, bring in a one-Clause Amending Bill in the light of that reconsideration, I should welcome it. I am not satisfied with it as it stands.</p>

<p>I think the House is very much indebted to the Solicitor-General for his explanation of the Clause, which certainly has been perfectly clear and satisfactory, although some hon. Members, like the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Manningham-Buller), who, if I may respectfully say so, is usually very clearheaded, have not quite appreciated the explanation that has been given.<br/>
After all, when a person is an owner-occupier of premises, it must be a question of fact for the aribitrator to decide, and it is impossible to legislate for every conceivable type of case. I have not the slightest doubt that, if a boarding-house keeper who only occupies for six months of the year claims to be an owner-occupier, the arbitrator, if in his full senses, would accept the fact that she was an owner-occupier. I cannot see that there can be any doubt about it, whether she put a caretaker in or not. Supposing this woman was a boarding-house proprietor who occupied the premises for six months and then left, but did not put in a caretaker. There could be no question at the end that she was the occupier of

the premises. Surely, she does not get into a worse position merely because she puts in a caretaker to look after the premises? No one interpreting this Bill could possibly suggest that, because there is a caretaker looking after the premises, she is worse off and ceases to be an owner-occupier. I think that what those hon.

<p>The purpose of this Subsection is to enlarge the rights of persons who claim to be owner-occupiers. But for this Sub-section a person would be an owner-occupier if he employed somebody else.

This Amendment deals with a paragraph which my hon. Friend the Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) wanted to be inserted to meet the point he raised on the Report Stage, applying it to the <i>bona fide</i> owner-occupier. My hon. Friend suggested doing that by means of a test, and I put forward for consideration the contrary suggestion of making the test <i>bona fide</i> occupation in order to get increased compensation, and on that my hon. Friend let the matter go. This new paragraph is to meet that point and it is a common form provision in its application and has the result of limiting it to owner-occupiers in the way we suggest.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
We had a discussion in this House on this matter and this Amendment gives effect to the general sense of that discussion. The Clause deals with the supplement of compensation in the case of improvement. It formerly contained words limiting the improvements which qualified for the supplement to include an interest in land which
<q>has been improved in the interests of the war effort or under instructions from, or with the licence or permission of, a Government Department.</q>
There was a good deal of question as to why a man who made a pigsty without asking any Government Department for permission should be denied the supplement, whereas someone who had gone to the county war agricultural committtee and done precisely the same job and made exactly the same improvement should receive it. We tried to devise words to prevent any improper improvements getting into this Clause, but did not succeed. On reflection, the control of expenditure on these matters has been so checked during the war that it is very likely that no proper improvements have been made to make us search for a phrase which probably does not exist.</p>

Clause 54 directed the arbitrator, in considering whether to award a supplement in respect of improvements, to have regard, among other things, to any recovery of any of the cost thereafter by reason of increased returns or increased prices in respect of work done on improved land. The purpose of that was to secure that the owner who had put himself into a position to recover

the whole or part of the capital cost of improvements out of the proceeds of the use of the improvements by charging prices which included the limits aimed at, and getting that return in addition to the income return, should not qualify for a supplement. It was pointed out in our discussion on the matter that the existing wording did not sufficiently differentiate between the replacement of capital and reasonable returns. Therefore, we put forward the amended wording in order to meet the point.</p>

<q>(2) The preceding sub-paragraph shall not have effect if between the occurrence of the war damage and the time when the notice to treat is served the land in the hereditament has been brought into a state such as to make it capable of being as beneficially used while remaining in that state as it was immediately before the occurrence of the war damage.</q>
<q>(3) If the land in the hereditament has not been brought into such a state as aforesaid, but there is any material difference either&#x2014;</q>

<q>2.&#x2014;(1) Where by virtue of paragraph 1 of this Schedule the value of the land comprised in a hereditament is to be taken for the purposes of the ascertainment of compensation to be its certified after-damage value (or that value as adjusted), and notices to treat have been served in respect of two or more interests in the whole of that land on the same date or within such period as may be fixed as respects that land under rules, the compensation to be paid for the purchase of each of those interests shall be ascertained in accordance with the following provisions of this paragraph.</q>
<q>(2) The amount representing the value of each of those interests as it would have fallen to be ascertained if this paragraph had not had effect in relation thereto shall be agreed, assessed or determined in accordance with the provisions of sub-paragraphs (3) to (7) of this paragraph, and the compensation to be paid for the purchase of each interest shall be the proportion of the certified after-damage value of the land, or of that value as adjusted, as the case may be, which the amount agreed, assessed or determined in respect of that interest bears to the aggregate of the amounts

agreed, assessed or determined in repect of the several interests:</q>
<q>Provided that if the interests in question do not include all interests subsisting in the land at the date or at the expiration of the period aforesaid, an amount representing the value of any excluded interest, as it would have fallen to be ascertained if that interest had been purchased and this paragraph had not in effect in relation thereto, shall be agreed, assessed or determined in accordance with the said provisions and added to the said aggregate.</q>
<q>(3) If the values of the several interests in question and of any excluded interest are not otherwise agreed, the claimant in respect of each of the interests in question, and the purchasing authority as respects any excluded interest, shall cause an estimate of the value of that interest to be made and transmitted to an officer of the Valuation Office appointed by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue and that office shall, after considering the estimates, take steps in accordance with rules for securing if possible agreement between the claimants, and, if there is any excluded interest, the purchasing authority, as to the value of each interest.</q>
<q>(4) In default of agreement as to the value of any interest the said officer shall make an assessment of the value of that interest.</q>

<q>(6) If any claimant, or, if there is any excluded interest, the purchasing authority is aggrieved by an assessment made by the said officer, the claimant or the authority may in accordance with rules require the value of the interest dealt with by the assessment to be determined by one of the panel of arbitrators appointed under Section one of the said Act of 1919</q>
<q>(7) If in respect of any of the interests in question no claim is duly made within the time prescribed by rules, an independent person skilled in valuation may be appointed in accordance with rules to act for the purposes of sub-paragraphs (3) to (6) of this paragraph in respect of that interest, and those sub-paragraphs shall have effect as if all things done thereunder by the person so appointed had been duly authorised, by all persons concerned in respect of the interest in question, to be done by that person as agent for them.</q>
<q>(8) Where the last preceding sub-paragraph has bad effect as respects any interest and the value thereof has been agreed or assessed under sub-paragraph (3) or (4) of this paragraph, if any person who would have been entitled but for this paragraph to have any question of disputed compensation in relation to that interest referred to arbitration in accordance with the said Act of 1919 shows in accordance with rules that the fact that no claim was made as aforesaid was not attributable to any default on his part, he may in accordance with rules require


the value of that interest to be determined by one of the panel of arbitrators appointed under Section one of the said Act of 1919, and if the compensation on the basis of the value of the interest as so determined is greater or less than the compensation on the basis of the value thereof as agreed or assessed as aforesaid, the difference shall be recoverable by the person entitled to the compensation from the purchasing authority or by the authority from him, as the case may be.</q>
<q>(9) The costs of any arbitration under sub-paragraph (6) or (8) of this paragraph, including any fees charges and expenses of the arbitration or award, shall be in the discretion of the official arbitrator, who may direct to and by whom and in what manner those costs or any part thereof shall be paid, and the official arbitrator may in any case disallow the costs of counsel.</q>
<q>(10) The amount of any costs that an authority are liable to pay by virtue of sub-paragraph (5) of this paragraph, or of any arbitration under sub-paragraph (6) or (8) thereof, shall be determined by reference to scales to be prescribed by the Treasury, and in case of difference as to the amount of any such costs they shall, if payable under sub-paragraph (5) of this paragraph, be taxed in such manner as the Treasury may direct, or, if payable under direction of an official arbitrator, be taxed by him or in such manner as he may direct.</q></p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
The House will no doubt expect a short explanation of this new Schedule. Its purpose is to give effect to quite simple principles in regard to the compulsory purchase of "blitzed" properties as they stand after war damage. The principle of paragraph 1 is to accept the value of a "blitzed" property formed by the War Damage Commission&#x2014;or on appeal from them, by a reference under Section 32 of the War Damage Act&#x2014;for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of a value payment, as conclusive for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of compensation for compulsory purchase of interests in the same property. Our object is, first, to avoid two separate valuations of the same property, both related to a March, 1939,, standard. That will save a substantial amount of valuation at a time, when, as every one appreciates, there will be very high demands on our valuation staff. Our second object is to ensure that an owner who receives a war damage value payment fixed on the basis that his property as it stands after the damage has a certain value, shall not have that property compulsorily purchased for compensation fixed on the basis that it has any greater or less value. That again, we suggest, is correct on the grounds of equity and finance.<br/>
With regard to paragraph 2, the principle is to provide a means of fixing the compensation for several interests in a single "blitzed" property by negotiation instead of by independent valuation of each interest, Under the present compensation law, notice to treat has to be given as to an interest, not as to a property, and if there are say, three interests&#x2014;freehold, lease and sub-lease&#x2014;there must be three notices to treat and three separate sets


of compensation proceedings, although the relevant valuation factors are largely the same. We contemplate that agreement will be arranged, and that the district valuer will act as intermediary to secure that agreement. We contemplate that the district valuer will find it possible to call the owners of the various interests together and discuss with them the appropriate apportionment and settle the exact amount due to each. We hope that compulsion will be unnecessary, except in very few cases, but of course we always have to provide in these circumstances for what we hope is the rare case where compulsion will be necessary. The House will see that paragraph 3 is a machinery provision.<br/>
That is the general scheme. I shall not go through it in detail, but the general points which the House will see in paragraph 1 are these: Sub-section (1) confines it to the whole of the blitzed land. Sub-section (2) excludes cases in which the damage has been, or could have been made good. Sub-section (3) modifies the operation in cases where the premises have been partly dealt with, or there are changes in the legal proceedings.<br/>
With regard to the question of the valuation, again I do not propose to go into it in detail, unless anyone desires information on any point. I will rapidly run through the procedure under paragraph (2) in the same way. I hope it will commend itself to the House. First, the owner submits his claim. He is allowed the cost of a valuer which, I think the House will agree, is fair. If it is not agreed, the district valuer tries to bring the parties together. If there is no settlement, he makes his assessment, and that is binding on the parties unless there is an application to an official arbitrator, in which case it is binding where the official arbitrator issues the final assessment. Any costs of a reference to the official arbitrator are in his discretion. The value of the interests so ascertained are then made the basis of an apportionment of the value of whole property, and the House will see that Sub-sections (7) and (8) deal with a case in which the owner of some purchased interest cannot be brought within the negotiation machinery because he makes no claim. Therefore, we have to have a provision for assigning a value to his interest in order to make the appointment complete, and we provide for a valuer being given to him. I have tried to put the explanation as shortly and as

simply as I can. I hope the House will agree that this procedure will act expeditiously and fairly, and I hope that they will allow the new Schedule.</p>

<p>A few months ago I caused some laughter in the House by giving notice that I was dissatisfied with the answer to a Question put by me to the Secretary of State for War before he actually gave the answer. The reason for that was that I had had considerable correspondence with the Minister of Pensions and the


Secretary of State for War regarding the case of S.S.Q.M.S. Master Baker Williams, R.A.S.C., who had died after 24&#x00BD; years' service, and whose widow was given no war pension. The facts of the case are, briefly, as follow. S.S.Q.M.S. Williams joined the Army in 1919 and served in Gibraltar for three years, Shanghai for two years, Malta for three years and with the B.E.F. in France. On his way back from France, in a hurry, he was bombed while in the "Lancastria" and was in the water for some time with a wound which was affected by oil on the water.<br/>
He recovered, and some time after that, in 1943, he was coming home on leave from one of the South coast areas when he suddenly fell ill in the train. He was removed from the train at Seven-oaks, in a state of coma, and was taken to hospital, where he died. According to the medical evidence he died from cerebral haemorrhage. His widow applied for a pension from the Ministry of Pensions, which was refused. She appealed to the appeal tribunal, which decided that her husband's death was not due to, or hastened by, a wound, injury or disease attributable to war service, nor was it due to, or hastened by, any aggravation of a wound through war service.<br/>
The next thing that happened was that the widow applied to me, and I wrote to the Minister of Pensions. He replied&#x2014;and I have no quarrel with him&#x2014;that in view of the fact that a pension had been refused by him, and that the widow had, in the ordinary course of affairs, applied to the appeal tribunal, and had been refused, he could do nothing more. But, he said, in view of the fact that her husband was a Regular soldier with 24&#x00BD; years' service, he was sending the case to the War Office to see whether a pension could not be given under the Royal Warrant. So the case was passed to the War Office and I was told that I would eventually receive a reply from them. I did, and this is what they said:
<q>In Mr. Henderson's temporary absence I am replying to your letter of 16th August which has been forwarded by Sir Walter Womersley about the case of Mrs. A. C. Williams, widow of S.S.Q.M.S. Williams, who lives at 36, Sirdar Road, Notting Hill, which is in my constituency. The position is that a pension for the widow of a soldier below the substantive rank of W.O. Class 1 is issuable

only if, among other conditions, his death is regarded as attributable to military service other than war service and occurs within seven years of his first removal from duty on account of the wound, injury or disease from which he died. I am afraid that the death of S.S.Q.M.S. Williams is not regarded as in any way attributable to his service before 1939, and that Mrs. Williams is not, therefore, eligible for an award of a pension from the Army authorities.</q>
This widow, who was used to living on an income of about five guineas per week, because her husband was making a compulsory allotment and a considerable voluntary allotment, has now been reduced to living on the National Health Insurance pension, plus help from public assistance. Her actual total income now is &#x00A3;2 7s. 6d. a week, because she is a widow with three children under 14. She is unable to supplement that income by working because her three children are of school age. I think that the State has treated an old servant of 24&#x00BD; years' service in a way which no private employer would dare to do, and my appeal is that if nothing can be done for Mrs. Williams now something ought to be done for such cases in future.<br/>
The first point I want to make to the Secretary of State for War is that something must be done to deal with these cases concerning Regular soldiers of long service, and that in accidents such as this, not attributable to war service, provision ought to be made for their widows and families. The Royal Warrant was referred to in the letter from the War Office. Article 1190 of the Warrant provides that a pension may be given to a warrant officer, Class 1, if death is non-attributable to war service. The yearly rate of pension with compassionate allowance is up to &#x00A3;30 for a widow and up to &#x00A3;10 for each child at the discretion of the authorities. This special rate is given only to warrant officers, Class 1, and it seems to me that Regular soldiers of equal length of service should have their cases considered also. All other ranks except warrant officers, Class 1, come under Article 1196, which I will read:
<q>With the exception of the ordinary pension to widows of warrant officers, Class 1, grants of pensions to widows, children or other dependants of soldiers shall only be made when the soldier's death is directly attributable to service and when it takes place within seven years of the wound or injury from which he died or, in the case of death from disease, within seven years, and the death was not the result of injury or illness due to his own fault or negligence.</q>


It seems to me that the provision for special treatment for warrant officers, Class 1, should be reviewed and the provision for all others serving in the Regular Army who agreed to serve 21 years or more should be looked into again to prevent this sort of thing happening to my constituents. I would ask the Secretary of State to have a special inquiry into these Articles of the Royal Warrant to bring the pension part up to date to deal with this sort of case, so that we can stand up to our constituents and say that in the future we are going to treat the widows of those who die by accident or disease non-attributable to service in the same way as a private employer would.<br/>
I would ask my right hon. Friend to have such an inquiry by an impartial committee as soon as possible&#x2014;before the war ends. We want a Regular Army after the war. No one knows exactly how it will be composed, but on the assumption that it is partially a conscript Army, there will always have to be a nucleus of long-service parsonnel as instructors and N.C.Os., and those men must be treated well. We shall never get a Regular Army unless we pay them better and have better conditions for their pensions and for their widows. It is on this ground, that we ought to look forward to better conditions for the Regular Army after the war, that I have raised the question. I hope, if my right hon. Friend can do nothing for Mrs. Williams, we shall avoid in future having Mrs. Williams' types of cases coming before us again.</p>

<p>I apologise for not having been here when my hon. and gallant Friend commenced his speech. I was at a meeting a good distance away, but I came as quickly as I could. Quartermaster-Sergeant Williams died of cerebral haemorrhage while serving. He had served for 24&#x00BD; years and was in receipt of his full pay. After completing 22 years' service, he had exercised his right to draw full pension in addition. The widow claimed from the Ministry of Pensions, who took the view that death was not due to war service; and when the widow took the case to the Pensions Appeal Tribunal, they decided against her, and she cannot, therefore, get an award from the Ministry of Pensions. My hon. and gallant Friend now thinks that,

although it has been established that death was not connected with service, the War Office should grant a pension on the ground of long service in the Army. The case falls to be dealt with under the Pension Regulations for the Regular Army, and I am afraid there is no shadow of doubt&#x2014;indeed, by quoting the relevant articles of the Royal Warrant my hon. and gallant Friend admits it&#x2014;that the Regulations do not provide for a pension in these circumstances. They are, of course, of long standing, and they were, no doubt, well known to the late Quartermaster-Sergeant. They are also in this respect similar for all three Services.<br/>
The widows of officers or warrant officers of Class 1, or equivalent rank in the other Services, whether serving or retired, who died from non-attributable causes are under certain conditions entitled to pension. The widows of warrant officers, Class 2, and other ranks are not. The origin of the difference of treatment is of long standing, and it has generally been accepted for many years that it was intended as, an inducement to private soldiers to rise to the top of the tree. Some hon. Members may think the distinction anomalous, and even indefensible, but there is the provision. It has always been one of the conditions of service in the Army and, as such, must have been well known to long-service soldiers. It may be that, when the pension regulations come to be comprehensively reviewed to meet post-war conditions, this is one of the respects in which an alteration is desirable, and I will certainly have it noted as a point for consideration in the general review which will have to take place in time for the conditions of service in the post-war Army to be clearly understood in advance, because it is a matter of common knowledge now that the regular Army, at any rate in the ranks below warrant officer, Class I, has to all intents and purposes disappeared, or will have disappeared in a year or so. Most Regular soldiers by then will have completed their engagement.<br/>
That I certainly can and do promise, but I do not see how I can go further than that. Cases of this kind cannot be very frequent, and I cannot say off-hand what repercussions there would be to an amendment to the Regulations, but any proposal for amendment, now in particular, when we are at the climax of the war,


would involve discussion between the three Departments concerned and, the Treasury. This being so, it seems to me it is a matter which should be left until the review takes place in connection with the conditions of service for the post-war Army. I do not say that because I take any pleasure in saying "No," but because I have by now acquired a fairly large experience of trying to legislate for individual hard cases. Of course, the pressure to legislate for hard cases comes from a very praiseworthy motive, namely, that of aiming at complete justice in an imperfect world; but realised perfection is, at any rate on earth, a contradiction in terms. It always used to be said that hard cases make bad law. They certainly can make complicated law and so provide fruitful ground for disputation for lawyers and, it may not be out of place to add, civil servants.<br/>
I have no doubt that the complicated nature of the pay and pensions Regulations about which hon. Members have from time to time so justly complained in this House, and none more so than the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger), is largely due to this attempt to legislate for hard individual cases. I do not want to go further into this aspect as I have said that the Regulations will have to be comprehensively reviewed to provide for the conditions of the post-war Army. When they are reviewed, I hope that they will aim at and achieve simplicity and stability. Otherwise, we are in danger of getting into a position of which I had considerable experience when I was in India. Shortly after I got to India in 1934 I started off on a crusade, and, as the hon. Member for Bassetlaw knows, I started on a similar crusade in the War Office for simplifying the Regulations relating to Government servants. These Regulations were embodied in&#x2014;I think I have the number right&#x2014;15 volumes. Some of these volumes were quite small and some ran into hundreds of printed pages. Two of them ran into well over 1,000 pages. They were all alike in this, that there was scarcely a page which was not smothered in amendment slips. If one suggested reprinting, it was made clear that the volumes would be out of date long before the reprinting was complete.<br/>
Such complexity makes it difficult to administer any system, but it also leads to those who are governed by the Regulations being under constant uncertainty as to where they stand. When all this has been said, we agree with the hon. and gallant Member in sympathising with the widow in this case on falling outside the Regulations. We would all agree, I think, and I certainly do, that we must review these Regulations so as to see that the number of hard cases which can arise in post-war conditions is as few as possible. We would all agree that, subject to that, the Regulations ought to be as simple and as stable as possible and not subject to constant amendment.</p>

<p>We are all interested in cases of this kind and the hon. and gallant Gentleman has done good service in raising the issue. I was pleased with the reply of the right hon. Gentleman, but, having dealt with cases of this kind, I am wondering whether the widow is not entitled to a widow's pension under the Contributory Pensions Act.</p>

<p>The point that has been raised by my hon. and gallant Friend has been, I will not say suitably, but adequately, answered according to the Regulations by the Secretary of State. I do not think that even my hon. and gallant Friend can find any fault with the answer, although he will undoubtedly find fault with the Regulations. I wonder whether my right hon. Friend would be good enough to refer to some of the battles royal, if I may call them such, or, at any rate, some of the agitations that I have been persistently carrying on before him for some time. I think that what emerges from his answer is something of which the House ought to take serious note. My right hon. Friend has been good enough to say that he admits that these Regulations, the Warrants and the terms of service of our post-war Army must be attended to&#x2014;but at some time hence. What I have urged before, and I urge it now with all the earnestness I can command, is that the time should be now and that it should not be left until after the war. As my


right hon. Friend has truly said, the whole of the Regular Army is in process of disappearing, some of them unfortunately by casualties, and others by the expiration of their normal engagements.<br/>
What is the position? When we come into the post-war world with numerous commitments, and not subject, as we were after the last war, to that ten-years' rule of no major war, we shall go into that period with practically no Regular Army. I ask my hon. and gallant Friends opposite, and I ask the Tory Party, who, as the Prime Minister once said, are supposed to be the protectors of our Constitution, what they think of that statement. Will they not urge on the Minister of Defence&#x2014;because it is on a higher level than that of the Secretary of State for War&#x2014;the necessity of getting down now to the recruitment of our post-war defence Forces on which we shall depend?

As I said yesterday, conscription is not the answer to this question.</p>

<p>If I may reply by the leave of the House, may I say, although it is outside the scope of the question raised, that if I gave the impression that this and similar and more important questions of conditions of service are being shoved off till the end of the war, I gave a misleading impression? A great deal of work has been and is being done to formulate proposals for the pay system and other conditions, and that work will go on continuously. All I say is that I do not think that these things will be finally settled except in relation to the recruitment of the post-war Army.</p>
