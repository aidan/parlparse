<p>(<i>standing in the Clerk's place at the Table</i>): I have to acquaint the House that the House has been to the House of Peers, where a Commission under the Great Seal was read. The LORD CHANCELLOR, being one of the Lords Commissioners, delivered His Majesty's Most Gracious Speech to both Houses of Parliament, in pursuance of His Majesty's Commands, as followeth:</p>

<p><b>My Lords and Members of the House of Commons:</b></p>

<p><i>In response to an invitation from the President of the French Republic, the Queen and I paid a visit in July last to Paris. We were profoundly moved by the evident sincerity and spontaneity of the welcome extended to us by the French Government and people. Nothing could more clearly have demonstrated the strength of the bonds which so happily unite our two countries.</i></p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-11-04a.545.8" colnum="545" time="">
<p><i>I have followed with deep anxiety the developments of the grave crisis through which Europe has just passed. Throughout the whole period My Government, in close accord with the French Government, made every endeavour both in Prague and in Berlin to ensure a lasting and peaceful settlement of the problem of the German minority in Czechoslovakia. Their efforts were ably assisted by a mission of investigation and mediation in Czechoslovakia, headed by Viscount Runciman.</i></p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-11-04a.545.9" colnum="545" time="">
<p><i>In view of the increasing gravity of the crisis the Prime Minister on the 14th September decided to fly to Berchtesgaden in order to establish personal contact with the German Chancellor. This initiative was followed on the 22nd September by a further visit by the Prime Minister to Godesberg. At this</i>

<i>stage the prospect of a peaceful settlement seemed almost to have vanished, but at the last moment the Prime Minister made a proposal to the German Chancellor for a Four-Power Conference. Signor Mussolini gave valuable support to the suggestion and on the 29th September the German Chancellor, the French President of the Council, the Head of the Italian Government and the Prime Minister met at Munich and came to an agreement. The settlement thus arrived at was accepted, with a dignity that has earned general admiration, by the Government and people of Czechoslovakia.</i></p>

<p><i>The cause of peace was powerfully aided by the timely action of the President of the United States of America. The desire of all peoples not to be drawn into war with one another is manifest and significant, and everywhere men and women share with Me, I am convinced, a feeling of deep thankfulness that the imminent peril was thus averted. I pray that, with the passing of this peril, a new era may have opened for Europe.</i></p>

<p><i>During this period of anxiety it became necessary to put into force certain measures, including the mobilisation of the Navy, the calling out of a considerable portion of the personnel of the auxiliary Forces and the initiation of certain precautions against air raids. All these arrangements were carried out with admirable promptitude. In every department of national life men and women alike came forward to serve their country. I was proud to observe the calmness and determination displayed by all My people and I thank them for their spirit of service.</i></p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1938-11-04a.546.2" colnum="546" time="">
<p><i>In the spring of this year My Government concluded an Agreement with the Italian Government regulating a number of questions of mutual concern. My Ministers have now decided to bring that Agreement into full operation as soon as possible. They are confident that this decision will still further strengthen the good relations already existing between Italy and this country.</i></p>

<p><i>My Ministers have continued to participate in the work and deliberations of the League of Nations. They have taken the lead at the recent meeting of the Assembly in providing for the explicit recognition of the independent existence of the Covenant of the League, apart from the Treaties of Peace, and in securing a comprehensive and practical review of the obligations devolving on Members there under. It gave Me great pleasure to meet representatives of the Governing Body of the International Labour Organisation, which on the invitation of My Government, held their October meeting in London.</i></p>

<p><i>The civil war in Spain has continued to engage the earnest attention of My Ministers. They have maintained their efforts to make the international policy of non-intervention more effective and they have noted with satisfaction the recent decision of the Spanish Government to repatriate all its foreign combatants and the decision of the Administration at Burgos to dispense with a proportion of those on the other side.</i></p>

<p><i>The cordial co-operation in matters of common interest between My Government and the Government of Egypt has been amply confirmed during the recent anxious months. Certain provisions of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance, the cost of which, owing to the increasing complexity of Military and Air Force requirements, was found likely greatly to exceed the original estimates, have been revised in a Protocol, the text of which has been laid before you. It is My confident hope that this revision will strengthen the sincere friendship between My Government and the Royal Egyptian Government and will expedite the important work of construction of</i>
