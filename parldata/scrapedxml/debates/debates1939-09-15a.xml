<p>The basis on which the free distribution of these shelters is being made may give rise to anomalies in border-line cases, but it is designed to give a generous interpretation of the expressed policy of the Government, to provide shelter free of cost for persons who cannot reasonably be expected to provide it for themselves.

<p>Fairs are not prohibited by any order under the Defence Regulations. They are subject to the Lighting Order, and any exhibition or entertainment in connection with a fair to which the public are admitted on payment is subject to the restrictions contained in the Public Entertainments Order. I have been anxious not to impose any further restrictions on fairs, but when a fair ground includes a portion of a main highway it may prove desirable&#x2014;owing to war time traffic conditions&#x2014;for the fair to be abandoned or transferred to some other site.

<p>As the reply is somewhat long, I will circulate it, if I may, in the Official Report. It contains, however, important guidance to those who wish to offer their services.

<p>I have been asked to reply. The answer to the first part of the Question is in the affirmative. The Board acts under the instructions of the Ministry in this matter, and its staff is being reinforced by the Ministry. The Board charges the producers the usual fees for the censorship of films for this country; in the case of films for export, where each individual copy has to be examined, a fee is charged for each reel censored. Drawback is allowed where imported films are censored before re-export. The censorship of films for showing in this country is voluntary, but no films may be exported without being censored. It is consequently in the interests of all film producers, including producers of news reels, sub-standard and all other types, to submit their films for security censorship.</p>

impose severe restrictions on speed. If any person drives at a speed which is dangerous in all the circumstances, he can be convicted of dangerous driving, and I should prefer to rely on these provisions rather than upon a reduced general limit of speed.</p>

<q> Provided that before making an order under this Sub-section the Minister shall refer a draft of the order proposed to be made to a committee appointed by him, consisting of a chairman and equal numbers of members representing, respectively, organisations of workers and organisations of employers which appear to him to be concerned; and the Minister may pay to the chairman of any such Committee as aforesaid such remuneration as the Minister may, with the approval of the Treasury, determine.</q>
This Amendment, which stands in the name of the Leader of the Opposition and other Members, is the main Amendment to the Bill. It is the Amendment which the Minister kindly consented to accept some 10 days ago. It has now been put into its final form, and I wish to say that we very much appreciate the way in which the Minister has responded to the natural request for assurances by Members on this side in particular and, I am sure,

by many Members on the other side, too. It is now proposed that the Minister shall refer any Draft Order which he proposes to issue to a Committee appointed by him consisting of a chairman and equal numbers of members representing respectively organisations of workers and organisations of employers which appear to him to be concerned. The employers' organisations are in existence, and the workmen's organisations are in existence in the form of trade unions, and they are accustomed to meet regularly to discuss matters concerning their industries, but in this particular regard the Minister is making an innovation. He will refer to the Committee any Order which he proposes to bring in and that is a very valuable innovation, because it will ensure that any possible grievances may be anticipated, and as all the relevant information will be open to the Committee the Minister will then draft his Order with a full knowledge of the facts gleaned in as impartial a way as possible. There is another part of the Amendment which declares that the Minister may pay to the chairman of such a committee such remuneration as may be determined, with the approval of the Treasury. The Minister may require to appoint a chairman who is not a salaried person, a quite independent person who will act in an independent way on this Committee, and I wish to say that I hope the Minister will not oppose this proposal.</p>

<p>I cordially support this Amendment, which makes the Bill very much better than otherwise would be the case, but there is one question about which I am not clear. The position is perfectly satisfactory in so far as there are trade union and employers' organisations throughout industry, but, unfortunately, there are cases where the workers are not organised in any union. I greatly deplore that they are not in any union. It will appear from the wording of the Bill that in such cases the workers' points of view will have no opportunity of being considered, and I would ask the Minister whether it is contemplated that in a case of that kind representatives of the workers concerned will be appointed, to include members of the unions to which those workers might belong if they choose and to which, in all probability, they will belong after effective service has been rendered to them in this way. If that cannot be


done, does the Minister select persons who may be taken in a sense as the representatives of those workers so that their case may be considered? It is possible that there are employers who are not organised, but I am concerned now only with the workers. I am sure that the Minister will appreciate that there is a point to be met and I should be very glad if he would indicate in what manner it is proposed to deal with it.</p>

<p>The issue is not whether the men concerned belong to the union or not, but the order which it is proposed to make.

<p>I know, but the right hon.

He can appeal against that. But an em-ploy&#x00E9;cannot appeal against dismissal by the employer. I realise from my own trade union experience that you do not want too much legislation in these matters. The employ&#x00E9;will have the protection of his trade union. I would remind the right hon. Gentleman that the trade unions' power against employers is ultimately that of invoking the right to strike. That is a power which we are anxious not to invoke in the present circumstances.

<p>There is one point that I wish to raise. It refers to the position of the Press, particularly the local Press in the country, in regard to the acceptance of advertisements. Sub-section 1 (<i>a</i>) says that an employer shall not "publish any advertisement." It is quite clear that if he publishes a notice on a factory gate the Press is not concerned, but if he publishes an advertisement in the local paper the Press may be liable. The local Press at the moment are having great difficulties in getting paper and are suffering through the loss of advertisements, and if they have, in addition, to search the columns of the "Ministry of Labour Gazette" in order to see what forms of labour are covered by regulation, it seems


unfair. I hope that my right hon. Friend, if he cannot amend the Bill in another place to cover this point, will give some assurance that the Press will not be held liable, at any rate for what they do inadvertently.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."
This Clause is introduced to provide for the continuation of the well-established custom of the regulation of the entry into employment by the trade unions and the employers. Many trade unions have made that provision, which has proved highly satisfactory, and they are anxious to retain it. It is one of the conditions of our support of this Bill that this provision should be made plain. The employers have no objection to it, and I do not think that this House would have any objection to the continuation of a practice which makes for peace and efficiency in the manning and staffing of various industries. I understand that a very small proportion of the bulk of employed labour in this country will come under this arrangement, but it is deemed to be valuable in the cases where it applies. I am moving this new Clause with the consent, I understand, of organised labour and of employers.</p>

<p>I believe that there will not only be no objection to this Clause, but that it is generally desirable that such a provision should be continued. I take it that it will cover all the arrangements which have been working satisfactorily for some time past. I suppose it does not preclude the practice, which has grown up, and which is beneficial in some directions, of employment exchanges working on lists supplied by employers, and sometimes even by trade unions. These lists will enable a short cut to be taken with great convenience to the men who will be employed.</p>

<p>Although it does not relate directly to this Bill, I hope that in the special circumstances I shall be allowed to raise a point arising out of a remark made by the hon. Member for East Woolwich (Mr. Hicks) yesterday, with which I am in complete agreement. I refer to the tendency at the present time among the new group of officials to be bureaucratic, standoffish and almost unapproachable. I, like almost every Member of this House, have had contact with employment exchanges, and I have found the officials sympathetic and easily accessible, but I am sorry to say that I am not finding anything like that now, but rather a tendency to be met by a refusal at the hands of people who really have no right to adopt such an attitude.


I am not making any general charge, but 1 would like the Minister to do what the Postmaster-General does, namely, to ask his officials to be less officious. I know that many of them are overworked and under a great strain, and I am prepared to make allowances for that, but the Minister should see to it that, in their new-found posts, officials should not regard themselves as little fellows "drest in a little brief authority" and refuse access.</p>

<p>I support what the hon. Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) has said. Our lives are now becoming controlled and regulated to a degree of which we had not previously dreamed. This Bill involves an enormous amount of control of the lives of our people, and I press upon the Minister that very great care should be taken and exercised in the choice of officials. I know that they have a lot of work to do, and that a good deal of it will be new work. There will be misfits and mistakes and a great deal of interference. Workmen resent outsiders coming in and trying to put them in their place. A great deal of this control is very necessary, but I hope the Minister will bear in mind that, when new officials are appointed under a scheme of this kind, they shall be men who are experienced as far as possible in the kind of work they will have to do. I hope that he will pay some attention to their personal nature and to the methods of approach in the appointment of inspectors and all the rest of these bureaucrats.</p>

I trust that the Minister will&#x2014;in fact, I am sure he will&#x2014;pay attention to the words that have been uttered by hon.

<p>I readily respond, and I am sorry that the hon. Member for Gorbals (Mr. Buchanan) has noted any change. I shall do all in my power, and I am sure that the headquarter's staff of the Ministry of Labour will do all in their power, to see this sort of thing does not occur. I will look at it myself and try and make it very clear that there ought not to be any change in attitude. Hon. Members were very good to say that officials were working under extraordinary stress. They have had during the last year two additional pieces of work placed upon their shoulders, and I think the House will admit that they have done the work with great devotion and skill. Members of Parliament sometimes get irritable.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is without cause and sometimes without sufficient cause, which is not quite the same thing. I can assure hon. Members that it will be my endeavour to see that this work is administered in such a way that those who have to carry out this difficult job will not act as men "drest in a little brief authority," but, as they have always done, as officials who regard themselves as servants of the public and, more than that, as friends and public advisers of those who come within the ambit of their work.<br/>
I may add that there is no likelihood of the appointment of a number of new officials. It has been arranged, as I explained on the First Reading of the Bill, that, subject to any enlargement of staff that may be necessary later, we shall use the present inspectors who have a knowledge of work under the Mines Act, the Trade Boards Act, the Insurance Act and the Factories Act, and who are accustomed to deal with employers and workmen in their various spheres. If and when the times comes that the new orders become so many that we have to add to the staff, I give the assurance that I will bear fully in mind, in the appointments made, the points that have been raised to-day.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that what we are attempting to do to-day is to raise a general rather than an individual complaint. While we have addressed our remarks to


the Minister of Labour, they are intended to cover a somewhat wider field. There has grown up in the last few weeks a very great deal of irritability at what is happening, and it is causing the inevitable reaction. I hope, therefore, that what has been said by my hon. Friends will be very carefully noted not only by the Ministry of Labour but by other Government Departments. We know in this House how Ministers in the last fortnight have had a particularly easy time in one respect. All that they have had to do has been to stand at the Box and mumble: "abacadabra, we are in a state of war, and this must be done." Then all tongues are silent. I am not saying that there is a tendency on the part of Ministers to abuse the position, but I am afraid it is true of officials outside that they expect private citizens to bear burdens which are sometimes quite unreasonable, and to answer criticisms merely by appealing to the national emergency. That can easily be abused. Therefore, I hope that we shall not have a lot of petty irritations created which may give rise to serious trouble.<br/>
Our experience very often is that an industrial dispute is not really caused by the incident that starts it. The incident

is symbolical of a large number of petty incidents that have gone before, the atmosphere becomes inflamed and embittered, and it is impossible for people to look rationally at the particular incident that has caused the dispute. I hope that the newly-born officials will realise that not merely have they to carry out their duties, but that they have to carry them out in a proper way in their relations with those with whom they come into contact. I hope that these little homilies will be taken seriously to heart by those who are "drest in a little brief authority," otherwise they may call down upon themselves cyclones of wrath which they may not be able to meet.</p>
