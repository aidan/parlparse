<p>A shortage of meat occurred in the districts referred to during the week ended 18th January owing to the very severe weather conditions then prevailing which seriously delayed transport of imported meat from the cold stores. During the following week deliveries to the butchers were up to requirements, but part of them arrived too late in the week for cutting up and sale to customers. The butchers, however, knowing that the meat was on its way, took orders for it which they were unable to deliver until the following Sunday or Monday. Steps are taken to ensure that every district receives its due allocation of meat and every effort is made to anticipate difficulties which arise through severe weather. As to bacon, my Noble Friend is not aware of any shortage on the ration in the Cannock area. But in a few isolated cases delivery to retail shops has been delayed owing to inclement weather conditions. Cheese is, at present, in short supply, but there is no evidence that the relative rate of distribution in the Cannock area has been less than in other parts of the country.</p>

<p>Since Eire is in the sterling area, funds may be remitted there freely through the ordinary banking channels, and it has been decided that no useful purpose is served by restricting this particular method of taking money. As regards remittances out of Eire, an exchange control essentially similar to our own has been imposed, and is exercised, by the Government of Eire.</p>

<p>As was pointed out in reply to a Question by the hon. Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) on 22nd August last, it cannot be assumed, without full knowledge of the facts, that cases which are apparently similar are in fact comparable. It is the duty of the court to decide, having regard to the circumstances of each individual case&#x2014;which may differ widely&#x2014;what penalty is adequate for the purpose of deterring both the offender before the court and other people from committing offences of this type. The amount of the penalty will also depend on the means of the offender, which, so far as it is known, the court is bound to take into consideration. Having regard to the danger arising from black-out offences, my right hon. Friend regrets that he cannot accept the view that a first offence should necessarily be met by a warning without regard to the circumstances.</p>

<p>In your issue of January 22 you published the report made by the Boothby Select Committee, and now that the debate in the House of Commons has terminated we are asked by Mr. Weininger, for whom we act as solicitors, to refer to one of their conclusions which personally and seriously affects our client's character. The conclusion is that in which it is stated that our client promised to pay Mr. Boothby a considerable sum of money in return for services to be rendered by way of political speeches and pressure upon Ministers and Treasury officials. This, were it true, would be an odious as well as a serious charge. Mr. Weininger has, however, no means of dealing with it other than through us and, as we trust we may expect, through the publicity which the <i>Times</i> always affords in a proper case.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-05a.951.7" colnum="951" time="">
<p>Mr. Weininger's answer is that there is absolutely no foundation for any such conclusion. He gave evidence at length before the Committee and at no time, nor by any question addressed to him, was it suggested that such a bargain existed. We would recall that in the first instance our client, who had known Mr. Boothby for some years, approached him in a purely business capacity as a member of a well known and reputable financial house in the City. Mr. Boothby was to try to negotiate with the Czech Government the release of the Weininger family assets blocked in Prague. With the entry of Germany into CzechoSlovakia this became impossible, and the agreement between Mr. Weininger and Mr. Boothby came to an end. Thereafter the position of Mr. Boothby's personal finances became exceedingly acute and there followed the promise by Mr. Weininger to assist him to the whole extent of his personal fortune. This promise arose out of the undoubtedly deep and true friendship between the two men and was unclouded by any base suggestion of services to be rendered.</p>

<p>You, Mr. Speaker, and the House will appreciate that that letter was written for publication in order to challenge, on behalf of Mr. Weininger, the existence of any facts for one of the principal findings of the Select Committee. In support of this challenge, there is a carefully prepared and concise statement of the story originally put before the Select Committee by Mr. Weininger and by the hon. Member for East Aberdeen (Mr. Boothby). That was the story which the Select Committee investigated and which they were unable to accept by reason of the existence of other evidence, contemporary and otherwise, which drove the Committee to find other and quite different facts. The facts so found by the Committee and the other evidence on which those facts were found were fully set out in the Report of the Select Committee, which was published on 21st January last and was approved by this House by the Resolution of 28th January last. None the less, in this letter, which is dated 30th January, and was published on 31st January, the writers repeat the Weininger version of the story, and continue:
<q>Those are the facts as we know them.</q>
And they ask that they should be recorded through the medium of the "Times." I respectfully suggest that for a responsible firm of solicitors to write a letter for publication in a newspaper directly challenging the existence of facts for the findings of a Select Committee of this House after the Report of the Committee has been approved by the unanimous Resolution of this House, to support the challenge by the statement that the facts are as they know them, and to put forward the version which has been given in evidence and not accepted by the Select Committee, is a very serious matter. It clearly is intended to make the public believe, by the repetition of this partial statement, that there was no foundation for one of the principal conclusions formed by the Committee and approved by this House. It reflects, I submit, both on the manner in which the Committee fulfilled the task entrusted to it and the propriety of the approval by this House of the Report of the Select Committee. I respectfully suggest that it raises a <i>prima facie</i> case of breach of Privilege, and I would request your Ruling on it.</p>

It has come to my knowledge through a most reliable channel that a letter offering an apology to this House for the matters complained of is in preparation by those concerned.

<p>I rise only to say this for myself, personally. I think this thing has been laboured and raised wrongly. The whole thing would have been better left dead. The Committee's evidence was accepted.

<p>I beg to move, in page 16, line 33, to leave out Sub-section (5).<br/>
This Amendment stands on the Order Paper in the name of the hon. Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams) and other hon. Members. My hon. Friend who was to have moved this Amendment has asked me to convey to you, Sir Dennis, and the Members of the Committee his apologies for his inability to be present, because he is engaged on the very laudable work of launching a War Weapons Week in his constituency. Subsection (5), which this Amendment seeks to remove from the Bill, provides that the provisions of Clause 19 shall apply only in those cases where the net annual value of the property is &#x00A3;100 or less. I submit that any such limitation of the provisions of the Clause is illogical, and the effect of the Amendment, if carried, would be to extend to all mortgagees regardless of the value of the property the obligations which are placed upon the limited class to which the Sub-section refers.<br/>
I am aware that yesterday there was considerable discussion on this general question, and I owe the Committee an apology for not having been in my place during that discussion. But I hope it will be forgiven to a comparatively new Member that he did not realise that, on a Clause which was concerned solely with persons who were to receive compensation, a discussion would take place on the related but, I submit, entirely distinct question of the persons from whom contributions should be exacted. I shall try not to cover too much of the ground which was covered yesterday, but I feel that I must ask the Committee to examine in relation to this Sub-section some of the arguments which have been adduced in support of the exemption of mortgagees from any obligation to contribute.<br/>
The first argument is what I may call the sanctity of contracts argument. It is argued that to exact from the mortgagee a contribution under this Measure, would be to strike at the sanctity of the contract between the mortgagee and the mortgagor. Considerable argument was put forward in support of that view by various hon. Members. I should be the last, having regard to my own political convictions and the constituency which I have the honour to represent, to seek to do anything which would impair confidence in mortgages and similar investments, but I submit that this argument is academic rather than real in the circumstances of to-day. I am not a lawyer, but I have often heard it laid down by judges and other lawyers as a sound principle of law that it is not sufficient to consider merely the terms of a contract but that one must, on occasion, go behind the actual letter of the contract and examine what is in the minds of the contracting parties. I think there is no doubt about what was in the minds of the parties to a mortgage contract. The mortgagee considered that he was entitled to rely on the personal undertaking of the mortgagor, the property being, so to speak, his collateral security. It was the responsibility of the mortgagee to take such steps as he considered necessary to protect that collateral security in his own interests against the hazards to which it might be exposed. If he failed to do so and disaster followed, then, so to speak, his blood must be on his own head.<br/>
That was accepted by the mortgagor as the position. But the hazards to which this Bill relates are of quite an exceptional character. They certainly could not have been in the mind of either party at the time the mortgage contract was made. Therefore, I suggest that to impose on the mortgagee a responsibility for making contributions does not, in that sense, strike at the sanctity of the contract. Moreover, this Clause as it now stands, with this Sub-section included, is to me utterly illogical. If it is proper and right to exact from the mortgagee a contribution when the annual value is &#x00A3;100 or less, how can it become a crime to exact a similar contribution when the annual value reaches &#x00A3;101? I suggest that this is an illogical distinction and an illogical limitation and, if we are to rely on a general argument of that character, it must be all or nothing.<br/>
There is the second argument that the mortgagee is not, in fact, interested. That also begins, apparently, when the annual value exceeds &#x00A3;100. The hon. Member for Walsall (Sir G. Schuster) pressed that argument very strongly, and in support of his contention that this was the position, he said that never in his long experience had he come across a case of a mortgagor being successful with his property and going back to the mortgagee and offering him an increased rate of interest or a share of the property. If I may follow that argument, I would say that in my own much more limited experience I have never heard of a case of a banker who went to his client and said that he was so pleased with his bargain and so confident of the security of the client's personal undertaking, that he would hand him back the deeds of the property which, in a moment of unwarranted suspicion, he had asked him to deposit. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (Mr. Bellenger) yesterday, in a speech which, I think, many Members of the Committee will deplore, suggested that the mortgagor in fact left the mortgagee wittingly to rely solely on the property. I think he did less than justice, particularly to the small house-property owner. The phenomenal success of the building societies is evidence that a very large part of the property owners who con tract mortgage obliga-

tions take a much higher view of their responsibilities than was suggested. But we cannot be blind to the fact that a disaster such as this Bill contemplates might, at any moment, make the mortgagor, however eager to carry out his obligations, completely unable to do so and it cannot be denied that in such circumstances this Measure would be of very substantial benefit to the mortgagee. On that, the general ground, it seems that he ought to pay. In any case I cannot, as I say, understand the logic of calling for a contribution from the mortgagee when the annual value is less than &#x00A3;100 and not doing so when the value exceeds that amount.<br/>
Finally, there is the argument of practicability. If there is the will, there is the way, and suggestions have been made by various hon. Members of ways in which to meet this general question. I conclude with one small general point. The Chancellor has told us that this Bill may involve expenditure by the Government of very large sums and that he may have to come back to Parliament to ask for substantial increases in the sums which are contemplated under it. I suggest that if those greater demands have to be met, the broader the back on which the load can be placed the better. Here is a field for exacting contributions, a field of people who, as it seems to me, might justly be called upon to contribute. For those reasons I hope the Chancellor of the Exchequer will consider this Amendment.</p>

<p>Before the Debate continues, may I say that I allowed the hon. Member to go to considerable lengths as he was moving an Amendment, but the Committee will recollect that the whole question of this limitation of the mortgages concerned was very fully discussed yesterday on Clause 10. It is true that the question arises in two different forms, one with regard to the contributions and the other with regard to the capital value of the mortgages, but I am sure that I may, without endeavouring to exercise undue authority, rely on the Committee not to discuss the principle over again. We must treat that as having already been decided, and, strictly speaking, subject to a reply from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I think that this Amendment ought to be put to the Committee without further Debate.</p>

It is true that certain figures are set out in the Clause, &#x00A3;100 in one case and &#x00A3;250 in another, but I am not wedded to those figures. Amendments are put forward suggesting other figures. I propose, with the assent of the Committee, to take the matter into consideration with a view to meeting what I understand to be the wishes of the Committee that the amount should be increased. I will very gladly do this. I hope to have an opportunity during the next few days of seeing whether we can get agreement upon the figures.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 17, line 3, to leave out Sub-section (6).<br/>
I will not repeat the arguments which have already been advanced in regard to this matter, but another small point arises on this Sub-section. It seems to differentiate unfairly between two kinds of case. The first is the case of a man who, not being very prudent, perhaps, entered into the obligation of house ownership on the strength of a mortgage from a building society. He gets relief, but there is no relief for a man who, with his own money, built a house and subsequently entered into a mortgage. I hope that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will consider the point.</p>

<p>This is an extremely important Clause, and we ought to have a word about the principle of it from the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We object to the Clause because it is full of inconsistencies and illogicalities, which are very difficult to follow. There are three principal points. One is that a mortgagee shall make a contribution, and the limits of one-half and three-quarters are very difficult to approve. There seems no pressing reason why those particular proportions should have been put in rather than any other. I still adhere to the suggestion I made that the mortgagee should contribute in accordance with the proportion which the amount advanced on the relevant date bears to the value of the property on the relevant date. That would do away with the jumps about which we have heard in the course of the debate.<br/>
The second inconsistency is the limit which was discussed by the hon. Member for the Abbey Division (Sir H. Webbe) a few moments ago. There again, it is extremely difficult to see why limits should be placed on the nature of the property which has to be considered contributory property. I should have thought that in all these matters the object of the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be to obtain the largest possible income from the fund, but all these limits are placed in the way. There is the case of small commercial property which may be just as important to the individuals concerned as other property, but which does not obtain any contribution from the mortgagee. It seems an illogical and inconsistent procedure. I can see no reason why, if I had a mortgage on my office, I should not be entitled to a contribution from the mortgagee, just as if I had a mortgage on my house. We all understood the overriding principle to be


that the burden should be shared, but the burden is not being shared, in that respect. The individual who happens to be the owner of a particular type of property is legislated against in these proposals. I gather that the Chancellor will do his best to include all classes of property in the Bill, but all mortgagees should contribute in proportion to the advance they have made. That seems logical, and any other proposal lands us in considerable difficulty.<br/>
I have some sympathy with what was said by the hon. Member for the Abbey Division. We are in a war, and many people in the country now have to draw on their capital if they happen to be in a line of business which obtains no benefit, or even suffers loss, by reason of the war. I see no logic in this contributory provision being limited to the case of the acquisition of property. I may have, for no particular reason of my own, acquired a property; why should I not be able to go to a building society or to some other institution and obtain an advance? That institution would know why I was asking for that advance and that they would have to make a contribution. Provided they knew that, they could make some provision by way of additional interest, and some portion of the additional burden would be borne by the mortgagor. The whole Clause is very illogical, and I hope that the Chancellor of the Exchequer will see his way to alter it. I hope it will be altered, at any rate in respect to the half and the three-quarters, which I gather may now be the case. The nature of the contributory properties should be altered. I should like them not to be limited to residential properties but to be extended to commercial properties as well. There is also the question whether it is right to limit contributions to cases where the mortgage has been taken up merely to acquire property, or whether a person is not entitled to obtain a contribution from the mortgagee. I hope these considerations will be borne in mind by the Chancellor before the Report stage.</p>

<p>I would like to tell the Chancellor that a great many of my hon. Friends and I are still not satisfied with the position of the owner-occupier, and I hope that before this Bill becomes

law something will have been done to safeguard that particular interest. Most of the discussion has been concerned with the unfairness as between the mortgagee and the mortgagor, but there is also the unfairness as between one mortgagee and another mortgagee, because one has to pay and the other has not to pay. I would suggest respectfully to the Chancellor that he should take into consideration the suggestion which I made at the end of the Debate on the last Sitting Day, which would put all mortgagees on the same basis of fairness so far as concerns the contributions to the State for this purpose. The Chancellor could levy upon them, according to the mortgage and independent of the annual value of the property, a sum according to the capital borrowed. I recommended one shilling for every &#x00A3;10 borrowed. Assuming one had a &#x00A3;1,000 house, then there would be a &#x00A3;50 assessment. I recognise that that may be excessive. It could be a smaller sum than one shilling for every &#x00A3;10 borrowed. Every person deducting from the mortgage would be able to do it without entering into any mathematical calculation. There would be no complaint between mortgagees. There would be a <i>pro rata</i> basis to a large extent, so far as the mortgagor is concerned, and it would eliminate a great number of the difficulties which are bound to accrue to the Chancellor when this Bill becomes law.</p>

<p>When this Bill was first introduced my voice was that of one crying in the wilderness. Every other hon. Member praised the Bill and I singled out for comment this one question dealing with the mortgagee and mortgagor. Now I have changed my point of view. I am not now at all interested in whether the mortgagee is made a contributor or not. In fact, on the whole, I think that I would rather he was not made a contributor for this reason, that if he does not contribute he is in nothing like the same strong moral position as he would be if he did contribute. I am far more concerned with what the position will be after the war as between the mortgagee and the mortgagor who has suffered. At the present moment the mortgagee is being protected without making any contribution. The mortgagor is making all the contributions.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has made an independent contribution as he so often does. I make no comment upon the moral side of the matter. If I may say so respectfully all my hon. Friends have quite rightly urged these points to me. They have not wasted time, because this is an important Clause. But I must stand by the general principles which I have enunciated to the Committee. It is quite true that the Treasury and the Chancellor are naturally interested in getting all the contributions they can, and my only observation is that the Committee may be assured that it has only been the most formidable obstacles and objections which have made me put that consideration on one side. However, in the light of the Debate on the last Sitting day, I will consider certain points which were raised by my hon. Friends in all quarters of the Committee, for instance, points with regard to the question of amounts in this Clause. I am also impressed by the criticisms about the March, 1939, aspect of this matter. Therefore, within the limitations which I have mentioned, I will consider those points.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 17, to leave out lines 14 to 17.<br/>
Clause 20 provides that the contributions already dealt with in the preceding Clause are payable irrespective of any contracts which may be made between the parties for making different arrangements; that is to say, you cannot contract out of the arrangements which are set out in Clause 19. But it then goes on to say:
<q>Nothing in this Section shall he construed as prohibiting the making or carrying out of any agreement expressly varying the ultimate incidence of instalments of contributions as between the parties to the agreement.</q>

The first party says, "You cannot contract out," and it makes a proviso which enables you to contract out. This proviso will act oppressively against the small man. Obviously, the only man who has an interest in contracting out is the mortgagee or the ground landlord or any other person who is making a contribution. The direct contributor will have no interest in contracting out at all. Pressure will be put upon him to make him enter into a fresh agreement for the purpose of enabling persons who have to make contributions to avoid making them. I can imagine what would happen in the case of mortgages. A mortgagor may be in default in making a payment. The mortgagee would come along and say, "I will give you time to pay, providing you enter into a fresh agreement under which I have no longer to make a contribution under this Act." The mortgagor, if he cannot find the money, will be compelled to make an arrangement of that sort. That happened under the Rent Restrictions Act. Landlords compelled tenants to enter into fresh agreements under which they were able to avoid the restrictions of the Act, and I am afraid that the same thing will happen here. It will only be of benefit to the person who is making the contribution and not to a direct contributor. I hope the Chancellor will see his way to leave out that proviso and prevent contracting out.</p>

<p>I think my hon. Friend may not quite appreciate the purpose of the first part of this Clause, which is to prevent covenants already in leases or mortgages from being construed, as they might otherwise be, as being applicable to the contribution. For instance, a covenant according to which one party or the other is responsible for outgoings might, apart from the first part of this Clause, be construed as meaning that the party concerned cannot recover from the other party what under the Bill he ought to be entitled to recover, namely, a part of the contribution. I think everyone agrees that we must deal with that position. Having dealt with it, however, I think hon. Members will also agree that there must be a provision under which parties can come to an agreement. The object of the last four lines is to enable agreements to be made on difficult questions which may arise in cases where it may be


to the mutual interest of the parties to do so. Many of the difficulties which were discussed yesterday, for example the exact amount of the value, would in normal cases be settled by such agreement without the necessity for the dispute being taken before the Commissioners.<br/>
I quite appreciate that, as my hon. Friend has said, there is a possible danger that people may be forced to agree to an adverse bargain because of the difficult position in which they are placed, and might give up advantages which the Bill intends them to have. That is a thing which my right hon. Friend would certainly like to provide against as far as possible, but it would be very difficult to provide against it altogether, and I cannot say whether it will be possible to do so by some provision in this Bill. It would be quite wrong not to give parties power to agree in many cases in which that procedure for the settlement of a dispute would be eminently suitable, but my right hon. Friend will consider whether he can make provision in this Clause which will provide a safeguard as far as possible against what my hon. Friend has in mind.</p>

<p>In this connection might I make a suggestion to the Attorney-General? I understand that where a similar situation might arise under the Workmen's Compensation Act, namely, one in which a man who is receiving compensation has pressure brought to bear on him to accept a sum in complete settlement, any agreement which may be arrived at must be submitted to a court for registration. That puts a check on any abuse of a privilege which is extended by the Act. In this case, too, if you took power to compel such agreements to be registered with the Commission, a check would be put upon abuse and some sort of control over such agreements would be given to the Commission. The very fact that the power existed would in itself be a deterrent.</p>

There are four Amendments to Clause 22 on the Paper designed to make clear a point on which there seems to have been some doubt. The effect of these Amendments is to make it plain that the assessment on which contributions will be based is not affected by subsequent changes in the assessment after the expiration of the risk period. If instalments were being paid over five years and if the assessment went up in the third year, that would not affect the position of the contribution, which is thrown back on the highest assessment during the risk period. If during the risk period the assessment changes and becomes higher, then of course the contribution is on the highest assessment during the risk period.</p>

<p>I beg to move in page 18, line 40, to leave out from "annum," to the end of the Clause, and to add "such interest shall be subject to assessment to Income Tax."<br/>
If the Amendment is unnecessary then I have misunderstood the Clause. As I understand the Clause, it provides that contributions should be paid in advance less Income Tax at standard rate. I understand it is the idea of the Chancellor that he can borrow the contributions, as it were, at 2&#x00BD; per cent. If anyone then sends a contribution, Income Tax can be deducted from the contribution. This seems an extraordinarily untidy way of doing things. Income Tax at the standard rate is paid only by a very small fraction of property-owners. One does not pay Income Tax at 8s. 6d. until one has &#x00A3;3,500 a year; and as soon as one's income has passed that figure, one pays a great deal more than 8s. 6d. The vast majority of Income Tax payers who pay in advance will have to pay at a much higher rate under this provision than they should do, while the wealthier people will get off more easily than they should. Also, I am advised that this provision will be extremely difficult to administer. There are various fluctuating factors: the rate of contributions is not fixed, and the rate of Income Tax is not fixed. Finally, the amount of trouble which this proposal, if widely availed of, would throw upon the Board of Inland Revenue is colossal. I, therefore, propose that any allowance of 2&#x00BD; per cent. shall be charged for tax as if it were income in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>Following the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benson), I venture to hope that many of the more wealthy owners will take advantage of this Clause. The Exchequer now is hardly the rich institution that it was in pre-war times, and there may be cases in which some of the smaller property-owners will not be able to pay their contributions in time. I hope that the vast majority of the great property owners will play their part, in order to make the fund as solvent as possible.</p>

<p>This very innocent-looking Clause is extremely important. It imports into the operation of this Act all the powers which the Treasury and the Income Tax Commissioners have, in order to obtain payment of contributions from the persons concerned. I was shown yesterday a demand from the Commissioners of Inland Revenue for &#x00A3;11,000 or &#x00A3;12,000 which has been made upon perhaps 200 or 300 occupants of flats in one big block. Presumably, the owners of the property had been unable to pay the Income Tax on that property, and the Commissioners were, therefore, demanding the payment of rent to them, instead of to the owners of the property, from each of the 200 or 300 occupants of the flats in these premises. That is one example of the very many powers which we are authorising the Commissioners of Inland Revenue to operate by Subsection (2) of Clause 26. Regulations may be made to apply, with modifications, to any of the enactments relating to the assessment and collection of Income Tax and provide for the assessment and collection of these contributions. It is a very wide power indeed, and I merely call the attention of the Committee to it because it reinforces a good deal of what has been said as to the necessity, wherever possible, of obtaining contributions from mortgagees. All cases where these enactments are brought into operation will be cases in which the owner of the property is, himself, unable to make the contribution. If those contributions could be obtained in whole or in part from mortgagees in appropriate cases, it would be much less likely that


these enactments would have to be brought into force. I do not doubt that they are necessary in the last resort, but I hope that there will not be many occasions on which they will have to be used, as they give the widest possible powers to the Treasury in this matter. This is one of the things which should be kept in mind.</p>

<p>I would like to draw the attention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to Sub-section (3) under which, as my hon. Friend said, very wide powers are given to the Commissioners to go to all sorts of people and get information. The right hon. Gentleman moved an Amendment to that Clause which he described as a drafting Amendment. The Committee, which is working at great pressure, let it go, but is it really a drafting Amendment? At the end of Sub-section (3) there is a provision for pains and penalties in case this information is not given, and we know exactly where we are. Under the Income Tax Acts a person suffers the penalties which are laid down if the information is not given. I should think that that is something more than drafting.</p>

<p>It is merely a drafting Amendment in this sense, that line 5 of Sub-section (3) applies as to default and so on to Income Tax penalties, whereas if the hon. Member goes on further he will see that Sub-sections (4) and (5) give what ought to be the penalties. The right hon. Gentleman wished to take it out in reference to Income Tax penalties and to leave mistakes or omissions to be dealt with, or punished, if that is the right word, by the provisions in Sub-sections (4) and (5), which are much less than the Income Tax penalties, which may run up to three times the tax.</p>

<p>They will follow the ordinary procedure adopted by the Commissioners and will be made known in the usual way. I would like to make one observation on the speech of my hon.

and gallant Friend. He was very ingenious in bringing in the point about reinforcing the question about mortgagees. I have noted that. The only observation that I wish to make is that, provided the Commissioners act reasonably, as they have always done, and as I believe they will do, I shall have all the necessary powers. The Committee will realise that, where a contribution has failed to be obtained, the burden is to be shared by all of us. Therefore, one does not want people to escape, and they ought not to escape, and that is why they should be asked in this way.</p>

This Clause deals with property held for charitable purposes, and the first Amendment that I move is mainly of a drafting character. I would like to say a word about this Clause because of the common misunderstanding there is about it. I understand that the Clause has been read as carrying a meaning at variance with the Government's intentions in the following respect. It has been read as meaning that in order to fall within Sub-section (4) which makes special provision as to payments made to charity land the


land must fall within Sub-section (1) and be a contributory property. This is contrary to the intention. For example, buildings used for religious purposes are not contributory properties. The other Amendments are of a drafting nature.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 21, line 38, after "applies," to insert "or for ecclesiastical purposes."<br/>
The Amendment which I now propose is not an attempt to extend the intention

of the Government in this Bill but to make clear that ecclesiastical purposes are included in charitable purposes, as we all believe has been the intention of the Government. The reason for doubt about it is this: In a number of Acts of Parliament, including the Settled Lands Act, there was a differentiation between charitable objects and ecclesiastical objects and it might, therefore, be held in the absence of these words that ecclesiastical purposes were not included.</p>

<p>I would like to support the Amendment moved by my right hon. and gallant Friend. For many weeks past the Chancellor has given very careful consideration to the issues raised in this particular Clause and I believe he has received representations from various ecclesiastical authorities and Churches, who are profoundly concerned with the implications of this Clause if it should stay in the Bill and become part of the Act. Some of my hon. Friends and I are particularly anxious about certain interests in the Catholic Church which are affected by this Clause. There are certain orders of the Catholic Church which do not teach or do any of the various practical works associated with many religious organisations and I would be particularly glad if the Chancellor would give an assurance that the interests of those communities will be protected. It may, perhaps, save time if my right hon. Friend makes some general statement which will cover many of the issues raised in the subsequent Amendments to the Clause. We are, naturally, anxious to protect the charitable purposes for which the various religious organisations stand and do not wish to avoid any responsibility which, in ordinary circumstances, every religious body should take in the interests of the nation. Finally, I would like to say how much those of us who have been associated with conferences on this very delicate subject do appreciate the courtesy and consideration extended to us by the Chancellor and the Treasury in relation to this particular Clause.</p>

<p>I think so. I propose to accept this Amendment, but I will examine the matter in the light of what the hon. Member has said. I think it might be convenient if I made a general statement now, because I promised the religious communities that I would say something in the Committee on the lines of the assurances I gave to them. This matter is of great importance to the religious communities and the religious life of the country. In looking at the matter from the point of view of property held for charitable purposes, we had to give consideration to very many questions and to decide whether we would ask charities and churches to make the ordinary contributions under the Bill and follow the usual procedure with regard to claims. We felt, in the first place, that apart from another consideration which I will mention later, we should be following the desires of the Committee and of the country if we did not endeavour to exact contributions from churches and charitable bodies. The cost of this will not fall upon property owners under the provisions of the Bill, but will be borne by the State. We felt that, amid all the

evil which has been done, we should at any rate seek to restore, as far as we could, and in suitable cases and in proper places, the churches that have been destroyed in considerable numbers throughout the country. That was our main object. We would not allow the enemy, if he could&#x2014;not that I think he could&#x2014; to defeat the religious purposes of these communities throughout the country. Another practical reason for our action is that in many such cases it is impossible to apply the exact terms of the provisions of the Bill with regard to value. That was a subsidiary, but none the less substantial, reason for our taking the course we have taken.</p>

<p>I will refer to them a little later. My hon. Friend the Member for Moseley (Sir P. Hannon) headed a deputation to me from his own community, and I have seen representatives of all the Christian bodies in the country. Moreover, they have all met together under the chairmanship of the Bishop of London. They have a common interest in this matter, and they have considered it together. They have assured me that the main principles of this Bill, and particularly the Clauses which affect them, are warmly welcomed by them, and they have said that they appreciate the good will which the Government have shown in this Measure, and which I am sure will be endorsed by the Committee. The only matter they have raised with me&#x2014;an important and substantial matter as far as their interests are concerned&#x2014;is the question whether the fact that they make no contributions under the Bill will mean that compensation payable under the Bill to charitable and ecclesiastical bodies will be reduced or postponed on that account. I have given the Government's assurance that that is not the intention and that that will not be the case. There are, of course, a number of cases where the physical character of the property renders unsuitable the normal basis laid down in the Bill for the assessment of compensation, and, having regard to the purposes of the bodies in question, a measure of flexibility as to the manner and the amount paid to them should be available in their own interest. Obviously, it is desirable to make some provision of that sort; but I


want to assure the Committee and those who are concerned that there is no question, for instance, of giving first consideration to claims made in respect of contributory properties and postponing the claims in respect of those who do not contribute. There is no intention of that sort.</p>

<p>It may not be a matter for regulation, but I will certainly see that there is such a direction. What we should have to have regard to would be the national interest. It might very well be that in certain cases homes would have to be restored first, but there is no question of a differentiation between the people who make contributions and those who do not. We desire to give equal consideration to all cases in the national interest, and that, of course, will be governed by the general conditions of the Bill. It is true that, inasmuch as contributions are not being paid and inasmuch as there is considerable difficulty with regard to values and valuations, the amount of payment is left free for settlement by the Commission.<br/>
If one wanted to criticise this Clause&#x2014;as I think, improperly&#x2014;one could say, "Everyone is left at the mercy of the Commission." I think that is inevitable when contributions are not being made, and when one has regard to the character of the buildings for which compensation has to be paid. But I would emphasise, and give the assurance, that it is the intention&#x2014;and I am sure it will be carried out by the Commission, for otherwise we would not get a reasonable administration of the Bill&#x2014;in all these cases, and particularly in regard to churches, that there should be full consultation with the respective committees or representatives of those whose property may be affected in this way. Obviously, the Commission, in dealing with a question of compensation for the loss of churches, will have to get into very close consultation with the representative of the bodies affected. For instance, in the case of one of our City churches which has unhappily gone, and which meant so much to us from an historical point of view, it might very well be that, seeing that unhappily the historic

side can never be restored, the advice which the Commission will receive from the responsible authorities will be that they do not want the church rebuilt in that particular place, and that the compensation available can be better utilised elsewhere, in places where there is a larger population. Good might, in fact, come out of evil, for such a church might very well be restored in the middle of a community where it would do much more good from the practical and Christian point of view than it would in the City of London, attended at it might be by very few people on weekdays and Sundays. All these considerations will have to be borne in mind and the Commission will have to be guided and advised by the responsible authorities. My hon. Friends who are interested in this matter, and in the churches themselves, can rely upon the very closest consultation. Our object, and the object of this Clause and, I am sure, of the Commission when it is appointed, is to use the compensation to the very best possible advantage and in accordance with their desires and wishes. Obviously the Commission will have to look to them as to the particular arrangements and the way with which the matter is to be dealt.<br/>
I have also been asked whether this Clause will include manses, dwellings of clergymen of the Church of England and other denominations. The answer is that so long as they are held on trust and are not, of course, the property of individual ministers, then they will be covered by this Clause. In other words, so long as they are used in connection with religious purposes and not as individual property of an individual, it is our intention to cover them by this Clause. My hon. Friend the Member for Moseley, on behalf of the Catholics, wanted to know whether the property of the Catholic Order is covered. I think he may take it, so far as the wording already contained in the Bill is concerned, that we believe that that is so; but I will examine that point again&#x2014;of course, it is a matter of importance to the Catholic Church. There is another Amendment on the Order Paper which we can also dispose of. It is an Amendment to page 21, line 40, after "only," to insert:
<q>and that whether or not such use involves the carrying on of a trade, or where the whole or that part thereof, as the case may be, is unoccupied.</q>


As regards the first part of that Amendment, we have the true doctrine of this Clause laid down by the Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge University (Mr. Pickthorn), in page 21, to leave out lines 39 to 43&#x2014;that is to say, the benefits of this Clause can only be given in respect of land used in connection with charitable purposes covered by the Clause. I am afraid my hon. Friend's Amendment is too wide, since it may cover the case of a factory run on commercial lines the profits of which were used to provide revenue for the charity. I do not think that is my hon. Friend's intention, but that may be the meaning of his Amendment, and it would be contrary to the whole purpose of the Clause. On the other hand, a workshop which incidentally produced certain profits, but the main purpose of which was to provide technical training in connection with an educational charity, would be covered by the other Amendment to which I have referred. As regards the second part, charitable property which is temporarily directed to other purposes by reason of the war is covered by the Amendment which I shall move in page 22, line 3. I think that will be satisfactory to my hon. Friend. Then my hon. Friend the Member for Moseley has another Amendment providing that
<q>where the main purpose for which land is used is a charitable purpose to which this Section applies the use of that land for any purpose which, although not such a charitable purpose, is ancillary to the said main purpose shall not deprive the owner of the proprietary interest in the land of the benefit of this Section.</q>
This again is too wide. It would seem to cover, for instance, the case of a home farm which exists mainly to supply farm products to a charitable institution and there is no reason why they should not be treated like other agricultural properties. But there are other agricultural properties which again will be covered by the Amendment in page 21, to leave out lines 39 to 43&#x2014;such as properties used in connection with charitable purposes, holdings and other places for training children in agriculture. He may be content with the assurance I have given him in that connection.<br/>
Then there is the Amendment, in page 22, line 10, which seeks to include the words, "for holidays and for con-

valescence." The word "holiday" is far too wide. In so far as the charity exists for providing holidays for the poor, it will already be covered by Sub-section (2, <i>a</i>), and it is unnecessary to provide further than that. In so far as they exist for private holidays for other classes of the community, that would not appear to be a case which I could reasonably accept within the ambit of this Clause. The Amendment standing in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Wallsend (Miss Ward), which I propose to accept, would cover the point my hon. Friend has raised.<br/>
There is another Amendment, the object of which is not clear: In page 22, line 11, after "religion," to insert:
<q>or the practice of observance thereof.</q>
Perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for Moseley will speak to me about that. We have used the term "advancement of religion" which, I am informed, has been consistently used since the time of Queen Elizabeth, and there seems to be no reason for departing from that traditional form. However, perhaps he will have a word with me on that point. Another Amendment to which I wish to refer is that to page 22, line 18, after "hereditament," to insert:
<q>not being a hereditament used for the purposes of the advancement of education, science or research.</q>
The effect of this Amendment would be to give educational charities the right to the compensation payable under the earlier Clauses of the Bill while retaining their contributions at one-third. I cannot go as far as that. I think my hon. Friend must be content with the provision I have made, although I would add that I have had no representations on the subject. The only other Amendment to which I need refer is, in page 22, line 12, at the end, to insert:
<q>other purposes beneficial to the public:</q>
<q>Provided that where an educational establishment is not conducted for profit, or where the profits, if any, are held and used for any of the charitable purposes to which this Suction applies, the fact that fees are charged or that a profit is made shall not exclude the owner of the proprietary interest in the land from the benefit of this section.</q>
I shall be glad to have any representations made to me so far as those educational establishments are concerned which are not conducted for a profit, and see whether in fact they are covered by the Bill. As regards the second part of it, I am advised that the proviso is unnecessary.


It has long been held that an educational charity does not cease to be a charity merely because fees are charged. That, therefore, is unnecessary. Subject to any observations that any hon. Members desire to make, I suggest that, after my explanation, they should leave the matter in this way, that I will examine the Amendments again, some of which have only just appeared for the first time, mid see whether on the whole, having regard to the main objects which I have pointed out, any further amendments are necessary or not to carry out anything that ought to have been done and may have been omitted.</p>

<p>Aged miners' homes are covered by the Clause in so far as they are for the benefit of persons who are either not well off or suffer from any disability.

In so far as they come within the definition to which I have referred, they will be covered by the Bill.</p>

<p>I should like the right hon. Gentleman to give a little more consideration to this aspect of it. While it is true that in our movement we may have some men who have been injured or who are suffering from poverty, yet it would be very difficult indeed to separate and distinguish one as against the other. I do not think it would need much elaboration to show that this is a charity in the pure sense of the word. Persons can only enter the homes after they have reached a certain age, the age of retirement. The funds are entirely made up of subscriptions from working miners and generous friends who are kindly disposed towards the relief of miners in their declining years. The governors do not receive a penny in rent. Some of the inmates may be suffering as a result of injury during working life and others,

maybe, on account of circumstances over which they have had no control, such as low wages or ill-health. At the same time there are others who are probably not poor, but under the rules of the organisation are entitled to retire into the home on reaching a certain age. I will ask the right hon. Gentleman to consider this again and bring all three classes into the same category.</p>

<p>I do not wish to be controversial, but there were one or two things in the right hon. Gentleman's speech which I do not think ought to be passed without some question. He said there was no risk that charities, because they were not contributory, would find their claims reduced or postponed. I hope his use of the word "claims" was inadvertent, because the essence of the Clause, from the point of view of educational charities, is that they have no claims at all, since the compensation can be paid, not only in what amount the Commission decides, but also to what receiver the Commission may choose, and there is no specific person who has any right to claim. There is a distinction there between religious and educational bodies. He pointed out that in general there would be no contribution, but he did not point out that under the educational part of the Clause there would be one-third contributions. That makes a distinction between the two. I am not quite sure that I would not have wished to be allowed to pay the whole contribution, but it is a distinction on which we ought to have a word from the Treasury Bench.<br/>
Closely connected with that there is another distinction between educational and ecclesiastical charities. The War Damage Commission is not compelled to consult the individual owner of a church. Where churches are too thick on the ground and some are blown up, there is something to be said for building a new church somewhere else. It does not apply in the same respect to educational charities where it is often their contiguity to each other which gives them their value. There is another distinction. I do not suppose anybody would suggest that there is a possible risk that if an Anglican church in the City were blown up the Commission would pay compensation to a Roman Catholic church in South Lancashire. As the Bill stands


however&#x2014;I do not suggest it is the intention&#x2014;if an educational establishment in one place is blown up the compensation might be given to some different sort of educational establishment in some other place.<br/>
There is no right of appeal in these cases in the way that the ordinary contributors have, but could it not be made clear that in cases where there is a one-third contribution the person, incorporated or otherwise, making the contribution must be consulted. The person making the contribution cannot be a claimant, but I do not want there to be any risk, if, for instance, a college were blown up, that the university, or even the whole body of universities, is to be consulted. Where there is a continuing body which has owned property for generations or centuries and which is making contributions, and where that continuing living body suffers damage to its buildings, it seems not unreasonable that, although it cannot have a right to be a claimant, it should have a right to be consulted. If I am told that that will be done under the words of the Bill I am willing to accept that interpretation, but it does not seem clear on the face of it. My right hon. Friend said something which, if it is right, is disquieting. As far as I could follow him, he said he could not go so far as to say that an educational charity might be allowed to pay the full contribution and thereupon have an expectation of full compensation. If that is what he meant it seems to be in contradiction of what he said earlier, that he wished it to be clearly understood that the bodies coming under this Clause would not run any risk of financial loss from coming under the Clause. I understand that my Amendment&#x2014;in page 21, leave out lines 39 to 43, and insert.&#x2014;
<q>(<i>b</i>) that the land, as distinct from rents and profits thereof, is used in any manner (including use in a manner involving the beneficial occupation of the land by any person) for or in connection with the carrying out of the purposes for which that interest is held, and not otherwise"&#x2014;</q>
is to be accepted. I will not, therefore, detain the Committee by explaining it. I have another Amendment in page 22, line 4, at the end, insert,&#x2014;
<q>(2) If and so long as land normally used, as mentioned in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of Sub-section (1) of this Section is temporarily diverted from

such use by reason of circumstances arising from war, the land shall be deemed for the purpose of this Section to be used as it is normally used.</q>
I understand that the official Amendment&#x2014;in page 22, line 43, at the end, insert,&#x2014;
<q>(5) If and so long as land normally used as mentioned in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of Sub-section (1) of this Section is temporarily diverted from such use by reason of circumstances arising from war, the land shall be deemed for the purposes of this Section to be used as it is normally used"&#x2014;</q>
is to the same effect and is to be accepted. I will not, therefore, trouble the Committee with mine. I should like your guidance, Colonel Clifton Brown, whether I should say a word now on my two later Amendments to this Clause.</p>

<p>I would like to support what the hon. Member has said in regard to the position of educational charities which will make a contribution of one-third. I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to give an assurance that he will consider making some modification to make it sure that the charity which contributes shall be consulted. That is not asking very much. It still leaves the immense power of decision in the hands of the Commission. The least that these bodies ought to expect the Act to provide is that they should have the fullest opportunity of putting their case to the Commission. In so far as they make a substantial contribution they are in a different position from other charities.</p>

<p>I would like to refer to a set of important organisations connected with the agricultural interest which is not covered by the Bill. I refer to the village institutes or clubs. They are public institutions and are frequently the only means of any indoor social life in the villages. They are not likely to make big calls on the Exchequer in this matter. Nearly all of them are purely charitable institutions and many are facing difficulties owing to the men being called up. I do not think they are covered by paragraph (<i>d</i>), although they take some part in education in that they are available for lectures and are useful for the general purposes of the community. There is a tremendous drive to


get people back into agriculture and these institutions form one of the means of keeping people in the country. I would ask the Government to see that these organisations are brought under the Bill as they, in fact, nearly are, because they are of vital importance to the agricultural community.</p>

<p>I wish to put another aspect of this question with regard to bodies for the advancement of religion. I take it that Sub-section (4, <i>a</i>) gives the Commission or the Government a certain amount of control on what replaces the building in the public interest and the interests of town planning and general amenities. I have in mind the case of a church where the Corporation of Edinburgh gave land at the junction of Princes Street and Lothian Road on which to build a church. When it became a bottle-neck for traffic and a danger to pedestrians and the town wanted back a slight strip of land from the church, the church claimed some thousands of pounds an acre for it. No one would think of destroying a church that was in such a position, but if by chance a church which is a block in the traffic were removed by a bomb, the Government would have the power to say in the interests of town planning that the church should not be replaced in the middle of the traffic. While everyone sympathises with the statement of the Chancellor as to the generous treatment that will be offered to the bodies fulfilling this function, I would like an assurance that consideration will be given to the public interest and town planning and that religious bodies will be generous in their negotiations with the Commission where it is a question of rebuilding in a place where it would be a danger to the public.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends and I have several Amendments on the Order Paper dealing with schools. Naturally we wish to curtail discussion on the Bill as much as possible, and we should not move them if we could feel satisfied that the statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer covered the objects we have in view. In referring to voluntary schools the Chancellor of the Exchequer used the words "no contribution," but the Bill speaks of a contribution of one-third for educational purposes. I should like to

know whether a voluntary school will be in the position of making no contribution but will be able to receive full payment for damage done.</p>

<p>I can answer that point at once. The present position under the law is that non-provided public elementary schools are statutorily exempt from rates. Therefore they cannot make a contribution on a rate assessment, and therefore they will not be making a contribution.</p>

<p>As I understand the present position&#x2014;it is a legal point, and I may be wrong&#x2014;non-provided public elementary schools are statutorily exempt from rates under Section 167 of the Act of 1921, and therefore there will be neither a Schedule A nor a rating valuation in respect of the buildings, and so, under Clause 14, they cannot be contributory properties, because Clause 14 says that contributory properties are those which fall either in the first or the second of those two categories.</p>

<p>I am much obliged for that explanation, which will meet my first point. I understand they will not be liable to pay a contribution but that payments can be received by them. I should like to be sure that the Chancellor's statement covers my further Amendment dealing with schools which are the property of a local authority. Here I am speaking for the County Councils' Association. We all know the liability which rests upon a local authority to replace schools which have been demolished if the denominational body does not see fit or is not in a position to replace them, but as the denominational body will be fully insured&#x2014;if I may introduce the word "insurance"&#x2014;I think the liability to replace the schools is removed from the local authority, and that will obviate the necessity of moving my Amendment. If I am given an assurance that full compensation for damage done to voluntary schools removes the liability upon local authorities to provide another school I shall feel that both my points have been covered.</p>

<p>There are three small points which I wish to mention, because if I get


satisfactory explanations it may obviate my moving Amendments. First, what is the position of public schools like Eton and Harrow? My second point deals with housing associations, that is, charitable organisations which exist to build houses for the working classes. It is not at all clear whether they come under Clause 29. I have put down an Amendment referring to those who make provision for housing the working classes. That Amendment is far wider than the case I am putting forward, because it would cover anyone who is providing houses for the working classes, whether a charitable organisation or not. I do not propose to move that Amendment, because it is wider than the point I am now putting, but I should like to have an assurance that the Chancellor's statement does cover the case of housing associations which are genuinely providing houses for the working classes at low rents and without profit to themselves.<br/>
There is another Amendment which I am moving at the request of the London County Council. Apparently they do not want to enjoy the blessings of this Clause. Apparently they fear the Greeks and the gifts they bring. They want to be allowed to pay full contributions even though, strictly speaking, they may come within the terms of this Clause, in respect of places for the treatment of sickness, disease or injury, the advancement of education, elementary schools, etc. They want to be assured that as a local authority they are not regarded as a charity, and they will pay the ordinary contribution with a view to getting the ordinary benefits.</p>

<p>I must apologise for speaking a second time, but as it is expected that the Government will reply to all the points raised in the various Amendments it may be well for me to put a very important point which was only touched upon by the Chancellor in his general statement. I understood that he was unwilling to consider giving an option to educational bodies to take their place with all other property owners, paying the same contributions and receiving the same benefits. It seems to me that it is most desirable that he should reconsider that attitude, from the national point of view and the point of view of the educational institutions concerned.

It is surely to the advantage of the insurance fund that it should be as large as possible, and if it were increased by a substantial contribution from a number of educational institutions availing themselves of this option that would be to the general good. Among education authorities there is real anxiety in a number of cases, lest the conditions which may be imposed upon them by the Commissioners may seriously interfere with the objects they have in view, and in any case some of them would much prefer to pay the larger sum and have the right to the same compensation as other property owners. The Chancellor has been so friendly in his attitude and has shown himself so desirous of doing justice to all the bodies concerned that we can have no doubt about his personal intentions, but he pointed out that the wording of the Clause gives absolute authority to the Commission, and we have to consider not merely his speech but the wording of the Clause. We cannot wonder that education authorities should feel some anxiety when they know that they are going to pay a one-third contribution and in return have no absolute right to anything, though the Commissioners may, if they think fit, give a payment
<q>of such amount, to such person and subject to such conditions, as they may in their discretion determine after consultation with such persons or bodies as appear to them to he appropriate.</q>
It surely is not right that an education authority should be compelled by Act of Parliament to make what would be in many cases a substantial contribution, and have, in return, no right whatever, even to consultation. I would therefore plead that the Government should consider giving the option to all such authorities of making full payments and receiving the same rights under the Bill as other property owners.</p>

<p>Having taken some interest in Clause 29 from a very early stage, I wish to make two points in connection with it. Clearly, the Churches are putting themselves entirely, for practical purposes, in the hands of future Governments and of the Commission, as it may hereafter be constituted. The Churches are acting wisely in this matter, because it is, perhaps, especially the duty of the Churches to be rich in faith, and in this case they clearly must have a reasonable faith in the good sense


of future Administrations. The second point is like that which was admirably made by the hon. Member for the Combined English Universities (Mr. E. Harvey) as to the relation between public interest and the replacement of Churches, and so on, in future. I am sure, from discussions which I have had in connection with the Clause, that it would be the view of the Churches that the business of the Commission would have regard to the kind of public interest to which my hon. Friend has referred. The Churches would themselves think that that was the duty of the Commission, and I am sure they would all collaborate most anxiously to satisfy the obvious public needs in that respect.</p>

<p>I wish to ask a question with regard to schools. What is the basis of computation for determining what the schools shall receive? How are one-third, one-half or three-quarters to be arrived at? Again, with regard to charitable institutions, there does not seem any method of calculating the amount of reimbursement. The Clause is too comprehensive, and there should be some sort of definition. It extends to all kinds of charities and even to a charity in which I am interested for the benefit of ex-Service men. I do not know where the Chancellor will begin and where he will end, and I should be glad if my right hon. Friend would explain.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-02-05a.1005.1" hansard_membership_id="2977" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13794" speakername="Captain Crookshank" colnum="1005" time="">
<p>This form of Debate is very convenient for hon. Members, to speak upon their own Amendments, but it is difficult for me to try and pick up exactly what everybody is talking about. I do not pretend to be able to answer every question put to me, but there are certain aspects of the general question which I may be able to review. We have had suggestions as to whether or not various charities should be brought within the Clause, such as homes for aged miners, village institutes and the British Legion. In one form or another hon. Members think of those institutions coming within the definition of charities, but we have to look at what the Bill says. The Bill describes what charitable purposes are, and they are set out in paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) of Sub-section (2) of the Clause.<br/>
I do not think that, by any stretch of imagination, the British Legion, as such, could come under the Clause, and I do not suppose it really wants to. The same is true of village institutes, as such. They could not possibly come under the present definition. My hon. Friend the Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams) was right in saying that they perform a very useful service in the life of the community. He said there was some educational work, as they were open for one or two lectures a week. That is not what most of us think of when we talk of educational establishments. The only answer is that there is not room in the statutory definition for the village institutes, as such, and they would fall within or without the Clause according to the circumstances of each particular case. If a village institute were solely concerned with advancing education, it would come into the definition, but if it were used also for entertainments, ping-pong and other things, it would not.<br/>
On the question of miners' welfare cottages and aged miners' homes, I would again point out, if my recollection of former years' intensive application to the problems of the mining industry is right, that there is not just one form of aged miners' home. This is a general term. Most of the homes are probably run under some trust arrangement, or in conjunction with some organisation or trade union. One home might come within the definition or might not. One group might be largely devoted to relieving the poverty of aged miners, and another group, I could imagine, would be devoted more to the treatment of physical sickness. There might be a home in which single miners lived. We have to look at the circumstances of each case. However, the point having been raised, I will look into it further.<br/>
Another hon. Gentleman asked about the position of public schools. I think he really asked the question in a humorous way. I think he realises that such schools would be paying at the reduced rate. Whatever else you can say about the advancement of education, this is the object of the public schools, although they might fail in that object. This is another matter, but that is their purpose.</p>

<p>I am afraid that in some cases it is patently obvious, and I will leave it at that. At any rate, the advancement of education is the purpose for which the public schools exist, and that is within the definition of a charitable purpose. There may be some educational establishments which do not come within that definition. There may be schools of the type run as a business by an individual for purely financial purposes, and with the advancement of education as the means by which he hopes to get a good financial result. In that case, one would have to look into the circumstances and see whether the school did or did not fall within the definition.<br/>
Some hon. Members have put the point of view of local education authorities. The non-provided schools are not subject to one or other of the forms of ratings referred to in the Bill and which would make them contributory properties. Therefore, the position is that they are not contributory properties. I thought that had already been made clear, but that does not prevent them from being the recipients of compensation. The whole question of compensation runs through the Bill. There are two plans, the cost-of-works plan and the value plan.</p>

<p>Might I interrupt the right hon. and gallant Gentleman, because I want to make this clear. If they do not receive the full value, can you still leave upon the local education authority the onus of providing the full value?</p>

<p>I think it would be much simpler if we dealt with these points <i>seriatim.</i> The non-provided school does not contribute. After consultation with everybody concerned as to what the War Damage Commission ought to do if the managers of the non-provided schools cannot rebuild, it may fall upon the local authority to rebuild, but that is surely one of the considerations which the War Damage Commission would have to bear in mind when consulting the persons and bodies which seemed appropriate, having regard to the nature of the purposes for which that interest was held. I think my hon. Friend's point is covered, but if he is not satisfied he can talk to me again, and I can consider it further.<br/>
The hon. Gentlemen who spoke on behalf of Cambridge University (Mr.

Pickthorn) and the Combined English Universities (Mr. Harvey) have referred to the point that while an educational establishment may have to pay a contribution, yet it is not mandatory in the Bill that, before deciding whether to pay cost-of-works or value payments, the War Damage Commission should consult them, although they are contributors. I think that is the point they made. I cannot imagine a War Damage Commission, with the authority that it will have and with its important responsibilities, and having been told in the Bill that they must consult such people as they think appropriate, not thinking that the first appropriate person to consult was the person who made the contribution. It seems to me to be thinking of the War Damage Commission as a collection of nitwits. However, if the point that such a safeguard is necessary is really pressed, I am sure that my right hon. Friend will look into it and see whether it is worth putting it into the Bill.</p>

<p>It is not so obvious as my right hon. and gallant Friend seems to think.</p>

<p>I think I dealt with the question about the local education authorities, which was raised by the hon. Member for Holborn (Sir R. Tasker). He also pointed out that some of these establishments were paying a lower rate and others were not paving a contribution at all, and he asked how the War Damage Commission would assess the basis of the compensation. I am afraid that he has not been as careful a student of the Bill as some of us have had to be. The contribution is no basis at all for the compensation. The compensation which is going to be paid is in the form of either a cost-of-works payment or a value payment based upon entirely different considerations. The contribution paid by anyone has no relation at all to the compensation to be paid.<br/>
The last question&#x2014;and I think I have answered everything that has been asked&#x2014;was by the hon. Member opposite, who asked whether, in deciding whether or not to rebuild a church, the Commission would in their discretion take into account various town planning considerations. I think that was the gist of his question. I would answer the question in this way.


Under this Clause it is true that the War Damage Commission is given the discretion, after consulting with the parties concerned, of deciding how much compensation is to be given. But then, of course, earlier on we envisaged the fact that the Commission would have some general directions over the whole field with regard to town planning, and it would, therefore, be for the Commission in their discretion to decide at any given point which one of the two would be the overriding consideration. They might say, "This building for certain reasons has got to be put here, and your town-planning arrangements must conform with that fact," or they might say, "The town planning in this area is such that you cannot put that building there," and in that case town-planning considerations would have to have paramount effect. In each case they would have those two problems to weigh up, and, within the best of human possibilities, would do the right thing.</p>

<q>(2) Nursery schools, wholly or mainly supported by charity and approved by local authorities, shall have their liability under this Clause reduced to nil.</q>
Like the hon. Member for Cambridge University (Mr. Pickthorn), I wish to explain this Amendment. Many local authorities have not yet been able to establish nursery schools and have accordingly given permission to voluntary bodies to experiment in certain districts in the establishment of nursery schools. These have been of enormous value from a social and from a health point of view, and are in every way to be encouraged. I am placed in a certain difficulty by what the Financial Secretary has said, for I cannot say whether these schools are exempted from rates or not. To take one example, there is a nursery school in one of the worst parts of Edinburgh in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. Pethick-Lawrence), which, although it was at first impossible to get children to go to it in any numbers, has reached the point where there is a waiting list of 80 names, and mothers are registering their children for the nursery school as soon as they are born, just as I understand horses are registered for the Derby when they are born. The fact that that is done shows the tragic need for this nursery-school movement, and anything which is going to discourage them will have a serious reflection on a very important experimental feature of the educational system. Until local authorities are able to establish their own nursery schools in sufficient numbers, I would respectfully ask the Chancellor to accept this Amendment, and agree that such nursery schools as are defined here should be exempted.</p>

<p>The answer to that is the answer which I am going to make to this Amendment. Unless my hon. Friend can bring further evidence to support his proposal, I cannot accept his Amendment at the present time, because it is very difficult to see why I should pick out nursery schools for more favourable treatment than other educational charities. If I were to do so, I know what would happen: I should receive many applications in regard to similar institutions. Therefore, unless

my hon. Friend can put forward some particular reason, I cannot accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 22, line 6, to leave out from "purposes," to the end of line 12, and to insert:
<q>in respect of which exemption from Income Tax would be granted under the Income Tax Acts, 1918 to 1940.</q>
This rather widens the scope of the exemption provisions. The only definition of "charitable purpose" that we have is contained in the Income Tax Acts. There have been quite a number of decisions based upon that definition, and I thought that here was an opportunity for the Chancellor to explain why he has narrowed down the definition contained in those Acts. May I point out one or two things in regard to it? I have put this Amendment down chiefly at the instigation of the National Institute for the Blind. Where do they come in under this definition? Not under relief of poverty; they might come in under the relief and the treatment of sickness, disease or injury, physical or mental, particularly in so far as treatment is concerned. Then there is the other provision, namely, the advancement of education, science or research. They do a very great deal of work in helping and educating blind people, but beyond that they do something else; they help to establish them in business and look after them for a considerable time, and it seems to me that the definition now included in the Bill is much too narrow. What applies to the National Institute for the Blind also applies to the deaf and infirm. I have put down this Amendment for the purpose of


getting some statement from the Chancellor. I do not press him at this moment, but will he consider it between now and the Report stage, when we may have to discuss the matter more fully?</p>

<p>I think this Amendment goes much too far. My hon. and learned Friend is not quite right in saying that the definition contained in the Income Tax Acts is the only definition, but the Income Tax Acts do, of course, give special exemptions for bodies which are held to be charitable. Some trusts have been held to be charitable which might surprise one. Thus, a society for the propagation of Socialism was once held to be a good charitable trust, although it has not yet been held that a society for the promotion of Conservatism is also a charity. The building of bridges and all sorts of things have been brought in as valid charities, which clearly would have no right to be included in the exemptions under this Bill. As far as the blind are concerned, or any special institution which either now or later people feel would normally be intended to be covered but which has not been covered by this Bill, we shall be glad to consider them.</p>

The object of the Amendment is to make it quite clear that local authorities concerned with the various matters referred to in the Clause are not to be treated as charities, but are to be permitted to pay the full contributions, and to get the full benefits.

<q>(6) For the purpose of giving effect to any directions given by the Treasury under Section eight of this Act, the Commission shall have power, where war damage occurs to a hereditament which satisfies the conditions specified in Sub-section (1) of this Section, and which is held for the advancement of education, science, or research, and where it is in the national interest on the ground of the purpose for which the property is occupied, or of the historic or artistic interest of the buildings damaged that the war damage should be made good, to make a payment of

the reasonable cost of the work in a style and with materials appropriate to the surroundings of the buildings and to the purpose. This Sub-section shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in Sub-section (5) of Section twenty-nine.</q>
This is an empowering Sub-section, not binding the Treasury or the Commission in any way. It merely gives them power to make a rebuilding payment when otherwise there would have been a value payment, and to draw rather special attention to questions of style, material and so on. There are many arguments which might be put for this Amendment, but I do not wish to delay the Committee. The Amendment is of rather less importance now than it was when I put it down. In view of what the Attorney-General said on Clause 4 about the necessity of treating as a unit the whole of a building, or even of a group of buildings, which were interdependent, the chance of any educational institution receiving value payments instead of rebuilding payments is not very great. But that does not make it unreasonable for me to move the Amendment, and I hope that the Chancellor will go some way in meeting me.</p>

<p>This, of course, enables the Commission to take the steps that my hon. Friend would desire, but, in fact, they have the power at this moment. I would ask my hon.

I said in my statement a short time ago that the Commission will have the fullest regard, as it is my intention that they should, in all proper cases for the purposes of the charity concerned. They will certainly have regard to that matter, and I can also undertake, as I said before, that there shall be full consultation between the Commission and such persons or bodies as appear to them appropriate having regard to the purposes and nature of any such cases of this kind. Therefore, I think we can say that the power is already given to the Commission and that they will have regard to this particular matter which my hon. Friend has in mind and that there will be consultation. In these circumstances, I suggest that the Amendment should be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Before the Clause is put to the Committee, may I say on behalf of those who are profoundly concerned with the provisions of this Clause in relation to churches, schools and various institutions and with the advancement of religion, how profoundly grateful we are to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for the statement he has made this afternoon on the various Amendments submitted on the Paper? I cannot recall any instance in this House in which a Chancellor of the Exchequer has been so accessible or kindly and sympathetic with practical help and suggestions for the amendment of a complicated law as has

the present Chancellor of the Exchequer. In particular, he received the deputations on this delicate and very often baffling subject of our schools and churches with the greatest kindness and consideration.<br/>
I apologise to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for having put upon the Paper to-day a whole series of Amendments of which he should have had much longer notice. He said that he would take into consideration, in his own peculiar, genial and kindly way, the substance of the Amendments that I placed on the Paper this morning and would see how far he could go in meeting the principles involved in those Amendments. But, speaking generally on the Clause, I think, in this particular instance, in the application of this very delicate, difficult and embarrassing measure of war damage compensation, and contributions from all kinds of property owners in this country, the Chancellor of the Exchequer has had a very generous and kindly point of view in regard to the Christian Churches. I am certain that the whole community desires the continuity of the influence of the Christian Churches in this country, and that they will readily acknowledge the attitude which the Chancellor has taken up.<br/>
I am sure that the whole nation and, indeed, that part of the world which is fighting for Christian civilisation will acknowledge the contribution which the Chancellor is making in this Bill. For my own part of the Christian Church, I think I can say, on behalf of my co-religionists, that nothing will more redound to the credit of the Chancellor than the attitude he has taken to secure the continuity of the Christian point of view.</p>

I take it that the various Amendments on this one subject will be discussed on the first Amendment. I have been asked to move this series of Amendments on behalf of the Conjoint Conference of Public Utility Associations, representatives of gas and electricity companies and water interests. My hon. Friend the Member for North Tottenham (Mr. R. C. Morrison) represents the Metropolitan Water Board. The object of these Amendments is fairly clear. It is to take out of this Bill, with one exception, these public utility undertakings and reserve them for a later Measure which is promised in the Memorandum attached to this Bill, in which it says:
<q>These will be the subject of further legislation which, after consultation with the undertakings concerned, will shortly be brought before Parliament and in which provision will be made for the payment of contribution on the basis of compensation.</q>
The Conference of Public Utility Associations feel it would be best to have a future Measure on public utility associations in one complete whole instead of part of it being dealt with in this Bill and part of it being dealt with at a later stage. My Amendments deal with the public utility undertakings included in the Conjoint Conference. I understand that one of my hon. Friends will move an Amendment on behalf of other undertakings not included in the conference, but which I dare say take a similar line. There is one provision which obviously could not be deleted from the Clause, and that concerns the question of immediate compensation for damage. With that exception, it would seem better to leave out the other matters. Particularly is that the

case as regards public utility undertakings being assessed for contributory value. In Clause 14, contributory value is defined as being either the assessment under Schedule A&#x2014;and public utility undertakings are not assessed under Schedule A&#x2014;or the net annual valuation under the Rating and Valuation Acts. For that purpose, there is an assessment on the basis of receipts and profits, which obviously would not enable the public utility undertakings to come under the Bill. I think I have said enough regarding this Amendment. I know that my right hon. Friend has been in close touch with the conference in order to try to get an agreement, and I am sure that what is intended on both sides is to get the most workable Measure.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend's purpose in moving this Amendment is to exclude certain public utility undertakings from the Clause, but if this were done, it would have a very odd effect, for some things would be quite haphazardly left out and some things would be left in. For instance, railways would be left in, but light railways, tramways and trolley vehicles would be taken out; gas, electricity and hydraulic power would be taken but, and canals, inland navigation and lighthouses would be left in. The result would be that the different categories would be treated differently. That is a very bad idea. Surely, all public utility undertakings ought to be dealt with in the same way. I do not see why in this connection gas should be treated differently from the equally valuable undertakings of canals and inland navigation. It is highly important that this Clause should be in the Bill, because otherwise no cost-of-works payments could be made ahead of the determination of Parliament about contributions and compensation generally. These public utility undertakings want a safeguard now, because they are liable to great damage.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Gentleman has an Amendment on the Order Paper dealing with that subject.

<p>I think it would be better to deal with it now. These associations are in favour of the preservation of Sub-section (4) paragraph (<i>b</i>), which allows for compensation. In a way they are local authorities, but they are not under the Ministry of Health but under the Ministry of Agriculture. There has always been a certain amount of difficulty about that. Perhaps I may give an instance where it would be found difficult under this Clause. There is the question of sea walls. Some of the catchment boards are responsible for the repair of some hundreds of miles of sea walls. They are not owners or occupiers. I mention that as one case to show that special consideration would be necessary. We have found in the past, when the Chancellor of the Exchequer was Minister of Health, that he was very kind to us when we were in difficulties. Owing to the special circumstances of the catchment boards and their responsibilities, we hope they will be taken into consultation in any Amendment to this Bill which may be proposed. I have mentioned one difficulty we can foresee, and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will look into the point between now and the Report stage.</p>

<p>I do not know whether this would be the proper time to ask a question on the Clause generally. There may be public utility undertakings controlling hotels in a town. There may be the case in one

town of a hotel being controlled by the railway which is exempt from any insurance premium, whereas a privately owned hotel would have to pay the insurance premium. In the latter case it seems to me that they would be carrying on business under very different conditions. I want to ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether public-utility-controlled hotels are to be exempted from the payment of insurance premium.</p>

<p>That is a special point. I do not know what the position of railways would be here, but we will look into the point which the hon. Member has raised. As regards drainage authorities, the effect of the hon. and gallant Member's Amendment would be to take them out of public utility undertakers. Perhaps that is what he wants. They would not be assessed for Schedule A or rates, and they would not become contributory property in the definition, but would still be liable to receive compensation either for cost-of-works or value payment. I cannot believe that the Committee would want to leave authorities in that preferential position, particularly in view of the fact that in the nature of the case they are liable to suffer damage. I am sure he really does not mean to say on behalf of drainage authorities that they should pay no contribution and get all the benefits.</p>

<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) in the application of Section four of this Act to the computation of the amount of the payment the depreciation in the value of the hereditament caused by the war damage shall be taken to be the amount by which the value of the hereditament in the state in which it was immediately after the occurrence of the damage is less than its value in the state in which it was immediately before the time of taking possession of the requisitioned land;</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) no sum shall be payable under paragraph (<i>b</i>) of Sub-section (1) of Section two of the Compensation (Defence) Act, 1939 (which provides for payment of compensation for damage, other than wear and tear or damage caused by war operations, <ob/>ring to requisitioned land during the period of requisition), in respect of damage occurring to the hereditament."</li>
</ol></q>
It is necessary to make it clear that the provision of the Clause in respect to value payments should apply only where the damage occurs during the period when the land has remained requisitioned. Para-

graph (<i>b</i>) of the Amendment is needed to meet the case where damage has resulted from the occupation of the premises and a claim under Section 2 (1, <i>b</i>) of the Compensation (Defence) Act has thus arisen. If a house is totally destroyed by a bomb and the owner becomes entitled to a value payment, he clearly ought not to get a cost-of-works payment as well.</p>

<p>Certainly the Crown has officials, but in spite of that I feel there would be difficulty in getting an appropriate sanction if this were made an obligation.

<p>Yes, there might be cases in which it was of importance, for a period at any rate, that no one should know of the damage that had been done.

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman will be aware that it is not only the Crown that is requisitioning property. Local authorities have the power to requisition, and they are not in the same position as the Crown. His answer covered the Crown but not local authorities, nor could he give an undertaking on their behalf, but something ought to be done about their position. Another point is that nobody ought to be penalised if in the circumstances indicated he has not put in a claim within the proper period. I hope that point will be looked into.</p>

<p>In regard to payment for requisitioned property, some provision is proposed in Part II of the Bill that the Crown should pay the premiums on requisitioned property. I do not see why that cannot apply here. Property is requisitioned, and the premiums have to be paid by the owner. The Government have not been very generous in the matter of compensation for requisitioned property. If the owner has to pay the premiums for war damage insurance in respect of requisitioned property there will be a very heavy burden upon him. When the Government requisition properties, the properties often become military targets, and there again the owners must pay the premiums under the Bill, but they cannot recover the premiums from the Government. In the ordinary way, the Crown pays the premiums for insurances, but there is no provision in the Bill for the payment of premiums in that way. The owner cannot recover the premiums from the Crown.<br/>
In the nature of things, the leases of requisitioned properties are very short The owners cannot reoccupy the premises at very short notice, but all the time they must pay the premiums. I hope that the Chancellor of the Exchequer can make provision in the Clause whereby a tenant


or owner of requisitioned premises may recover from the Crown the premiums which they have had to pay on the properties. I trust that the Chancellor will give the matter very close consideration.</p>

<p>I have had personal experience of requisitioned properties.

I know others that were requisitioned six months ago, and although some were not worth &#x00A3;20 nevertheless about &#x00A3;200 has already been spent upon inspections by various Departments. The matter goes from Department to Department, and there is no settlement. Owing to the very slow method of settlement, the owners of the properties will have to pay the insurance premiums, and will possibly not get them back from the Crown for years.</p>

<p>Expediting payment for requisitioned buildings is not the direct responsibility of my right hon. Friend, but is a question for the Departments concerned.

<p>I can say that the Departments are trying to press on with payment. This matter has nothing to do with the Bill.

The position will stand as in the Bill.</p>

It would appear that unless an Amendment to this effect were included in the Bill the contributions of coal mines under this Bill would have to be borne partly by the coal miners, because in the ascertainment if that were allowed as an expense then of course the whole cost would be shared by the coal miners. A case may be argued that certain other people should contribute, but I think it is not the intention of the Chancellor that any set of workers should be singled out for a special liability in this connection which is not specifically mentioned in the Bill, and that there can be no intention of the miners being asked to bear a share of the contribution for the protection of the coal mines against war damage any more than any other worker in industry.

<p>Perhaps the hon. Member is not quite aware of the latest development with regard to this Amendment.


I understand that it has been the subject of discussion by my hon. Friend the Secretary for Mines with the Miners' Association and the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. This, apparently, is what has emerged. Both the Association and the Federation consider that, as wage settlements are subjects of negotiation, it would be a mistake to have one element in the negotiation a statutory obligation. One can see the importance of that point. In consequence, the Miners' Association are ready to give an assurance that it is not their intention that payments to be made under the Act should be regarded as expenses to be taken into account for purposes of the ascertainment of wages, and, on the other hand, the Miners' Federation of Great Britain are agreeable to accepting that assurance. That being so, and in view of the undesirability of putting in a statutory requirement, I think that meets the case which the hon. Gentleman's friends have in mind.</p>

This Amendment and the following Amendments are all to enable the Commissioners of Crown Lands to pay the contributions which they will have to make out of capital. It is, of course, the general

intention of the Bill that these contributions are to be regarded as payments out of capital, but in the case of the Commissioners of Crown Lands it is necessary to give statutory authority to that effect.</p>

This Amendment calls for a very short explanation. The Ecclesiastical Com-Missioners and Queen Anne's Bounty hold a very large number of capital sums in trust for what are generally known as ecclesiastical corporations The trusts are very strict and there is a doubt as to whether it would be legal, without these words or some other statutory sanction, for capital contributions to be paid out of these funds. This Amendment, if agreed to, will enable the Ecclesiastical Commissioners and the Governors of


Queen Anne's Bounty to make payment out of these capital sums in respect of contributions under this Bill.</p>

<p>It is, apparently, proposed that all payments should be made out of moneys provided by Parliament and that all contributions received should be paid into the Exchequer. According to the next Clause separate accounts are to be provided each year, and laid before Parliament. Is that the usual course with regard to separate funds of this kind? I do not want it to be suggested at some future time that Post Office Savings Bank deposits may be used for the general purposes of the Exchequer. Are the Road Fund receipts paid into a separate fund or into the general fund of the Exchequer?</p>

<p>We considered how this should be done, and whether, in fact, a separate fund was necessary. We wanted to avoid a separate fund if possible, and we came to the conclusion that we might do it by means of these two Clauses. Clause 36 directs that all payments in respect of war damage and payment of

interest on value payments should be paid out of voted money, and that all sums received by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue should be paid to the Exchequer. That is the usual form of Clause, and it creates the necessary machinery for the payment of the money in the way I have indicated. As a result, the House will be able to discuss the activities of the Commission on the usual Supply Days, which is another advantage. Clause 38 lays down exactly what the Treasury will have to lay before Parliament each year. There will be a statement, showing the payments made by the Commission, the amount collected by the Inland Revenue in contribution, and the proceeds from disposal of salvaged material. This statement will give the annual income and expenditure under the scheme. In course of time, it will show how far contributions have met the cost of compensation; and any revisions in regard to contributions made by the Treasury under Clause 16 will have to be justified. It is to be noted that the statement is one of actual receipts and payments, not of liabilities and assets. During the war, at any rate, the amount of payments, we hope, will be small compared with the payments accruing, although, of course, one cannot say how much. The form of statement will be separate, so as to show contributions received, compensation paid, and also details in connection with charities and other cases where special circumstances exist. Subject to any exigencies of the war, Parliament will be able to see the whole of the expenditure, and will have opportunities for discussion.</p>

<p>Much as one appreciates the need for discussion, I think it equally important that the House should understand that the moneys will not be available for the general purposes of the Exchequer. What is not desired under this Bill is that the Treasury should make a profit out of the premiums. My right hon. Friend is a very clever parliamentarian and it is extremely important that we should have an opportunity of discussing these matters. It is equally, if


not more, important that we should not allow the Treasury to lose its rights in the general fund of the Exchequer, and then to find that, while people can go on making contributions, when it comes to a final reckoning, the premiums collected have in fact been absorbed. May I have an assurance from my right hon. Friend that, though he thinks it is an advantage not to have separate funds, in the mixing up of the Fund, he will see that there is no diminution in the moneys available, and that when the fund comes to an end the Treasury will not have authority to take possession of the balance?</p>

satisfactory, some such extension as is suggested here is required.

I move the Amendment on behalf of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Ashford (Mr. Spells). Paragraph (<i>c</i>) excludes from the meaning of "land" all crops and trees, although some trees are included whose value for shelter or amenity purposes is greater than their value for selling. It is the peculiar fact that woodlands are excluded from this part of the Bill. If the Bill passes as it is drawn, land will have an entirely different interpretation under Part 1 from the interpretation which it will have under Part 2. I hope my right hon.

<p>The effect of this Amendment is that it is intended to bring in under Part 1 of the Bill all crops and trees. That is our reading of it. Such an arrangement will result in the farmer and agriculturist getting almost unwarranted good value for his contribution. The contribution is fixed at 6d. where the land consists of open land and is not likely to suffer damage through bombing. It is difficult to see how one can justify claims arising in respect of a field of ripe corn or a plantation of timber where the damage may, in fact, run into a very considerable sum. This type of property, crops and trees grown for timber, will be covered by the business scheme under Part 2 of the Bill and I suggest that is a more equitable basis than the one proposed, which would hardly be fair to other contributors.</p>

<p>I would like to draw the Chancellor's attention to an anomaly that occurs as regards my own property. I have a hedgerow of trees and a young plantation which has been bombed. I am not saying that for these trees we should

I move this Motion in order that, before proceeding to a discussion of the Amendments to Clause 42, I may ask a question of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We have made very good progress with the Bill and have reached the end of the first Part.

<p>I beg to move, in page 31, line 45, after "business," to insert:
<q>which expression in this part of the Act shall include any trade, profession, employment or vocation.</q>
It is thought by the medical profession, for whom I speak, that it would be best to use the interpretation of the word "business" which is used in the Income Tax Act. In that sense, therefore, I have put down the expression:
<q>shall include any trade, profession, employment or vocation.</q>
It is possible that some other Amendment may be preferred, but I am chiefly concerned to include in "profession" medical men. I understand that it has been said in the Memorandum to this Bill that the word "business" does include the professions; but there is nothing in the Bill to say so, and the medical men do not like to trust simply to a statement of that sort. I have been in correspondence on the subject, and all that I have had has been an explanation saying that it is included. However, I think it ought to be definitely stated, and I hope, if my Amendment is not allowed, that the matter will he looked into.</p>

<p>I am advised that the word "business" covers the professions, and that it would be dangerous from the legal point of view to insert here the words proposed. There is something to be said, I think, for making clear to the ordinary

reader the extent to which the word "business" applies. I do not know whether that can be done, but I will look into it.</p>

<p>On a point of Order. Perhaps I may be allowed to explain. On the Second Reading I was informed that if the amount which was received as insurance was all absorbed by the first casualty, then it would be necessary for a person to insure for a second period.

<p>I beg to move, in page 32, line 20, at the end, to insert:
<q>but not in any case to exceed five shillings per centum.</q>
There is no premium mentioned in the Bill at all, but in the Memorandum it is stated that the premium will be 30s. per cent. That is a prohibitive premium for business concerns, and certainly for household furniture. The business man will not be able to help himself. If this


goes through, he will have to pay, but I wonder how many contributors the Board of Trade expect to get under the private scheme at a premium of &#x00A3;1 10s per cent. I suppose they will get those who have already been bombed, but I wonder how many more at that sort of premium, except the worst possible risks. I have no doubt that the premium of 30s. was fixed with that in mind, realising that only the worst risks would come in. I do not suppose for a moment that my Amendment will be accepted. No one would be more pleased than I to find that the right hon. Gentleman was prepared to bind himself to a maximum premium of 5s. per cent. The principle of voluntary insurance of private chattels forces a high premium upon those who are insured, but, whether the principle of compulsory insurance is accepted or not, everyone, including the right hon. Gentleman, will admit that he cannot possibly maintain a premium of 30s., and there will have to be a substantial reduction if you are going to meet the difficulties of the ordinary man and woman in vulnerable areas whose homes are liable to be destroyed, who are a little better off than those entitled to get compensation automatically but who cannot afford to pay a premium of this sort. I hope that my Amendment will have the effect of securing some statement from the right hon. Gentleman as to his intentions, not necessarily under a compulsory insurance scheme, because that is a matter which ought to be discussed in a fuller Committee on another day, but as to the amount of premium he proposes to charge. I hope that he will be able to tell us that it will not be 30s. per cent. whether the scheme is compulsory or voluntary.</p>

<p>I would like to support the remarks of my hon. Friend. The Amendment is not put down in any expectation that 5s. will be a practical proposition. It is put down to challenge the proposition of 30s. per cent. In the case of small houses many people would be surprised to know that their furniture had mounted in value to &#x00A3;100. Even in

the poorest houses it could not be replaced for much less, yet the owner in such a case will be called upon to pay 30s. if he wishes to insure under this scheme. If the value of the furniture is &#x00A3;200, which is not extravagant, it means &#x00A3;3, and that is a big contribution to ask from a person in a poor position. Going up the scale, it becomes a burden, which I am sure is not the intention of the Government.<br/>
The practical point is that if it is decided that the scheme shall be compulsory, the premium of 30s will not be necessary, for a larger number of contributions will be brought in and there will be no justification for having it on the higher basis than the other part of the scheme. There is no reason why property should get insurance for 2s. and a high premium is charged for the chattels. The amount of the premium will probably be a guess, but there is no reason why the guess should be in favour of the property owners as against the people who have furniture to insure. If the Bill remains as it is and it is not to be compulsory, the difficulty will be to make the premium such as to induce the smaller contributors to come in. If the amount is made prohibitive, the bad lives will insure themselves, and many of the good lives, such as people in the country areas who do not expect to be bombed and people in residential parts of the country which are supposed to be safety areas, will take the chance and stay out of insurance. From the point of view of inducing the maximum number of people to come in, the contribution will have to be reduced, and I hope the Government will reduce the 30s. to an amount more appropriate to the circumstances.</p>

<p>I hope the Government will seriously consider whether a lower figure than 30s. is not possible, because as the hon. Member for East Stirling (Mr. Woodburn) has said, it will place a heavy burden on a householder in respect of furniture, and also place a heavy burden on businesses in respect of their plant and machinery. I have had representations made to me by the industry with which I am connected that it lays a heavy burden upon them and they have asked me to ventilate the point here. Nobody denies that the premiums must be adequate to cover the


risk, but we should be grateful if the Government would indicate to us in what way their estimate of the risk has been arrived at. If it was a very clever guess we think that perhaps they have taken too severe a picture of the future. I hope there may be some elucidation of that point.</p>

<p>The question of the 30s. premium for chattels raises the whole question whether the scheme is to be compulsory or not, and I should not like to go too deeply into that aspect of the matter, because if it is a voluntary scheme, most of the objections which the hon. Member for East Stirling (Mr. Woodburn) put forward will not then arise; and incidentally I should point out that the poorer householders will come under the free compensation scheme. To attempt to answer that particular point about chattels would raise the whole question of whether the scheme is to be compulsory, and I can only turn my attention to the 30s. premium as it applies to businesses. That figure is based upon the very serious nature of the risk, and is not a guess, but is based upon experiences in the last three months as projected into the future. On that experience we think it may lead to a very heavy burden on the Exchequer. I do not think it would be possible to consider any lower premium. Though it may be regarded as a burden on businesses, I think it is one which will have to be borne</p>

<p>The President of the Board of Trade has entirely failed to answer the very valid point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for East Stirling (Mr. Woodburn) that for a voluntary scheme 30s. is an unsound figure. A lower premium would be a better proposition financially from the Government point of view. When it was suggested that a compulsory scheme would bring in more chattels, the President of the Board of Trade shook his head. Does he really think that with the present premium he will obtain wide insurance in comparatively safe areas? People in London, Birmingham and Coventry will insure, but people in Scotland, in the Lake District and elsewhere will not insure. I am not at all certain that 5s. per cent. would not be a sounder proposition than 30s. If we retain the 30s., the Government will make a heavy loss. They might make a heavy loss if it were reduced to 5s., but by reducing the figure they would bring in good risks,

whereas the 30s. premium secures only the worst risks, and that point the President of the Board of Trade entirely failed to deal with.</p>

<p>I think this is the proper time for me to raise a matter on behalf of those who lost their property and personal belongings upon their evacuation from the Channel Islands, when those Islands were abandoned. I am a member of the Railway Clerks' Association, and I have information that about 50 of the members of that organisation who were evacuated from the Channel Islands are seriously concerned about the absence of any provision for registering claims for compensation in respect of the properties and possessions which they were forced to leave behind. I wish to


know whether the schemes we are considering will allow of provision being made for the losses that they have encountered?<br/>
The position in which they were put should excite the sympathy of this Committee. The Channel Islands were abandoned because of the exigencies of war, and the loss which the inhabitants have suffered is as definitely loss by enemy action as is any loss that can come by bombing or in other ways. I hope that the passage of the Bill will provide an opportunity for doing even-handed justive to people who have been so badly affected. I ask the President of the Board of Trade whether he can give us now, or at a later stage, some indication of the position that they occupy in respect of compensation.</p>

<p>May I put forward a case in connection with local authorities? I do not know whether the right hon. Gentleman's reply applies only to businesses run by local authorities. I want to put this particular position to him. Let us take a large authority like the London County Council. They have large stores of goods of all sorts in their various hospitals, institutions, schools and so on. In the case of the London County Council, the total value of their stock at any one moment might be as large as &#x00A3;15,000,000. Strictly speaking, in respect of many of their services it is doubtful whether they are carrying on a business. They are not carrying on a business in connection with their public assistance institutions or hospitals. Therefore it may well be that on a strict reading of this Clause they would be excluded, although my right hon. Friend has assured me on my Amendment that they are covered. I want it to be abundantly clear that they are covered somewhere, somehow, in respect of these enormous stocks which they are compelled to carry for the purpose of their undertaking. They are not in a position to insure in respect of furniture, because although they have a good deal of furniture there is at present a maximum of &#x00A3;1,500. But apart altogether from that, a vast proportion of their stocks are not in the form of furniture at all and could not be covered anyway under the private chattels scheme. I should accordingly he glad if it could be made clear that a local authority such as the London County Council in possession of stocks of furniture of all sorts for the purposes of its undertakings will come within this part of the Bill.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to what was said by my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Sir A. Maitland) when he spoke about the distinction between the stocks held by a local authority for use in connection with those of its functions which form a kind of business and what it holds for its other functions, such as art galleries and so on. Possibly this is the appropriate moment&#x2014;and I apologise if it is not&#x2014;for me to inquire about the insurance of chattels belonging to charities under Clause 29, because presumably what are regarded as charities under one Part of the Bill may be regarded as businesses under another Part. It is quite clear that if they are


not able to be assured in some way of some sort of reimbursement, they will run the risk of being put entirely out of business. It is equally clear, if they must contemplate paying the full premium on everything they have, that that also will put them out of business. I should like to ask whether, as in the not incomparable case of municipalities, it will not be possible to give us this right, so that we may insure those of our goods which are replaceable and without which our functions could not be recommenced, and not have to pay premiums on those parts of our chattels which in any case are not replaceable and which we should not for a moment think ought to be replaced?</p>

<p>As I have said, I am advised that it is unnecessary to include any words to this effect, though it is being considered whether that should be done on the Report stage. There are really two points. In the ordinary sense of the word, local authorities carrying on business would be regarded as business concerns. It is a very different question in regard to their picture galleries, and what would apply to them in this case should apply to universities as well. Although they might be regarded as carrying on business, it might be intolerable if they had to pay a premium of the full amount on a valuable collection of pictures. Under Clause 45 the Board has power to exempt from compulsory insurance, and it is that Clause which we propose to invoke when deciding to what extent these particular things fall under the scheme. I can promise that in regard to works of art we shall deal with them in consultation with the local authorities, universities and so on which are concerned.<br/>
With regard to the Channel Islands, the Bill does not apply, and I think that hon. Members will agree that, as in this Bill payment of a premium is involved, the whole matter of compensation&#x2014;which, I am sure, will have everybody's sympathy&#x2014;should really come under an entirely different Measure. I can see great difficulties in attempting to impose the pay-

ment of a premium on people who have carried on business in the Channel Islands. I do not think their case really falls within the framework of this Bill.</p>

<p>The answer given by the President of the Board of Trade on the position of local authorities is highly unsatisfactory. The Amendment which my hon. Friend moved just now was in order to make it clear that all the activities of a local authority would, for the whole of this Bill, be treated as a business. It was understood when my hon. Friend withdrew his Amendment that that was the interpretation placed upon the Measure, and that, therefore, his Amendment was unnecessary. Now, the President of the Board of Trade has drawn a distinction between different activities of a local authority. I understand that he suggests that such things as the supply of electricity are businesses; but about that we have never had any real doubt, because they are assessed as businesses, and everybody regards them as such. But there are a hundred other things which local authorities do which are not regarded as businesses. Does the President consider, for instance, that the relief of the poor is covered by the provision in this Bill in respect of businesses? Are an art gallery, a museum, a library, or a cemetery businesses? I beg the President of the Board of Trade to take this matter seriously. It affects hundreds of local authorities, and involves chattels running into millions of pounds in value, all of which are at stake. The local authorities are not being treated fairly.</p>

<p>I am rather glad that the Amendment to which the hon. Gentleman has referred was not carried. Under Clause 29, public utilities, broadly speaking, are left out of this Bill.

<p>I agree; but you must be careful what you mean by chattels. The London County Council, broadly speaking, is not a public utility, except


that it owns a lot of sewers, which are maintained by means of rates, and are not hired out. Local authorities which are public utilities are in a different position. Any local authority which runs an electricity undertaking owns a great deal of plant. Do you want to bring such authorities under these schemes? Is it desirable that they should be? They are to be dealt with in a separate Bill. Are you going to split up the Fulham Borough electricity undertaking; and put some of it, possibly, under Part I of this Bill, some more of it under Part II of this Bill, and the rest of it under the new Bill which is to be brought in? You will, in that way, have confusion worse confounded. My own view is that public utility undertakings ought to be outside this Bill, except to a limited extent, pending the new Measure. There is power under Clause 30 to make certain grants on account. Otherwise, we shall get into a most difficult situation. The public utility under the local authority may be charged a small amount under Schedule A, and a lot more, because it is rated, not on an annual valuation based on the occupation of property, but on a valuation based upon its profits. Finally, you are going to have the showroom and contents under a separate scheme. I ask hon. Gentlemen who sit on the London County Council, which, comparatively speaking, runs no public utilities, where they would get if they pursued their point sufficiently far. The art galleries have their importance, but in relation to the great issue, they are small. Municipalities in this country probably own &#x00A3;1,000,000,000 worth of utilities, and the art galleries, and the rest are very small in regard to the major issues, and therefore I hope that my hon. Friends will be careful.</p>

<p>I would like to say to the President of the Board of Trade how greatly disappointed I was with the reply in connection with the point that I put as to Channel Island evacuees. He has said that their position does not come within the four corners of the Bill. One wonders why people in that position have not the opportunity to come in, and why some measure of justice is not done to them. The action that was taken very suddenly was on the initiative of this country, and by the Government of which the right hon. Gentleman is a Member,

and these people, because of that action, are left without any redress at all. That action took away from them the opportunity that they might have had if they had followed the example of this House through their own Legislature to make such provision. They are left high and dry in a very serious position indeed. They are British subjects who have been abandoned, one might almost say, by the British Government. That is a serious statement to make, and it calls for action to be taken on their behalf. I would have liked the right hon. Gentleman to have shown sufficient sympathy with their plight and to have been able to say that he and his Government will take into consideration the position in which these people find themselves, with the idea of finding some means of meeting their plight in the way we are endeavouring to meet it for the citizens of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>While I do not go perhaps quite as far in suggesting that the President of the Board of Trade might be definite about this Clause, I think that there is a moral debt placed upon the Committee. I think we would have liked to see something done for these unfortunate people, who are worse off than any other subjects of the Crown within the United Kingdom. As it is technically in order to raise the matter on this Clause, I would make the strongest possible appeal to my right hon. Friend to use all the influence he possesses with his colleagues in the Government to see whether, at an early date, some announcement cannot be made as to how these people are to be dealt with. If not, we shall have to press the matter very strongly at Question Time.</p>

<p>I would like to support my Noble Friend. The position of these Channel Islanders is deplorable. While the President of the Board of Trade cannot go into the position of the Channel Islanders at the moment, I would support the suggestion made by my hon. Friends opposite that some statement should be made by His Majesty's Government in the very near future as to the policy they will adopt in relation to these people, and what can be done to relieve them in the situation in which they find themselves. They are our subjects and have been in an outpost of the Empire for years, and it is a sad reflection that during the whole


of this time since they were seized by the enemy, no real effort should have been made by His Majesty's Government to help them.</p>

<p>I have lived in the Isle of Sark, which is one of the most delightful of places for a temporary abode, and it is sad to think that these people, whose loyalty and devotion are so strong and everlasting, should now be left to their fate. I quite understand that the Financial Secretary cannot bring them within the scope of this Bill, but surely the Government ought to make some statement to the country about these people, who are in the grip of the most detested enemy ever known to mankind.</p>

<p>I would not like anything that I have said to be construed as meaning that I lack sympathy for the Channel Islanders. But the point is that we are dealing with an insurance Bill, and it seems inappropriate to bring the Channel Islands within the framework of this Measure. Indeed, they cannot be brought in, but I will make known to my colleagues the views which have been expressed.<br/>
As regards the point raised about picture galleries, I think the hon. Gentleman opposite did me an injustice when he said that I was not perfectly clear in my mind in saying that the Clause as now drafted brings all activities of local

authorities in as businesses. Under Clause 45 the Board of Trade have the right to examine, in consultation with these local authorities, any part of their activities in regard to which there are objections to compulsion, and if the burden of compulsory insurance of works of art is too great, machinery exists by which that particular class of activity can be excluded from the operation of the Bill.</p>

We have made remarkable progress to-day and have now reached a very important Clause which we cannot possibly hope to finish in the few minutes left at our disposal. I think, therefore, that it would be far better to leave it until the next Sitting Day.</p>
