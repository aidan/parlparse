<p>My right hon. and learned Friend meets Mr. Lineker regularly at meetings of the group of ten training and enterprise council chairmen. This group of regional representatives of all of the TECs considers the full range of TEC activities, including support for small firms. My right hon. and learned Friend expects to chair the next group meeting in mid-November.</p>

<p>When my right hon. and learned Friend meets representatives of Norfolk and Waveney TEC he will be told that the TEC regards the youth training scheme as an important priority. Does my hon. Friend agree that every youngster who wants to take a place on YTS should have the opportunity to do so? Does he also agree that, particularly in today's climate, it is crucial that TECs work closely with the enterprise agencies to help small firms? Will he applaud the Norfolk and Waveney TEC's decision to contract out to the enterprise agencies the enterprise allowance scheme?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is correct. The TECs, my hon. Friend's in particular, the Department of Employment and the Government give total and absolute priority to youth training, and it is through the TECs and their excellent work that that guarantee is being delivered. We are giving young people the training that they need.<br/>
My hon. Friend also makes an important point about enterprise. TECs are a major part of the Government's continuing effort to encourage enterprise at all levels, particularly small firms which are a strong aspect of my hon. Friend's constituency. They make a decision based on local needs on how much work to give to enterprise agencies. I pay tribute to the work of the enterprise agencies and the TECs and, in particular, the work of my hon. Friend. I am sure that he keeps in the closest touch with his TEC to ensure that it does everything possible for the local community.</p>

<p>When my hon. Friend meets the chairman of Norfolk and Waveney TEC will he take the opportunity to discuss with him business people's attitudes towards training? Does he agree that it is

important that business people and industrialists now set up training initiatives, particularly in engineering, to avoid future skill shortages before the problem arises?</p>

<p>Yes. It will be well known to my hon. Friend that the great bulk of training has been, is and will continue to be done in the private sector by employers. However, the TECs have, as one of their main tasks, to identify training needs in each locality and to work with doneemployers to identify how that can best be done, so bringing together the efforts of the Government through TECs and the private sector to deliver the best possible quality of training. That is done, and the new investors in people initiative, launched by my right hon. and learned Friend just a few days ago, is yet another important step in emphasising the importance in the private sector of a continuing training effort, and that will continue to be the case.</p>

<p>Will not the proposals contained in the Green Paper continue the excellent work of the Government's previous trade union legislation and give more power and influence to individual citizens and individual trade union members?

<p>I am looking forward to the Opposition's representations in response to the Green Paper. There is still time for those representations to be received and I assume that the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman will be rushing away from questions this afternoon to put the finishing touches to his representations.<br/>
My hon. Friend is right on his last point. There may no longer be room for communists in Warsaw, Prague or East Berlin. They may have been ejected from the Kremlin, but there will always be a welcome for them at Transport house.</p>

<p>Will the Minister answer this question? During the past few weeks, there have been statements that Britain has the lowest strike record for 30 years.

<p>As a result of the laws passed by the Government, we have the lowest number of strikes for about 60 years. Is the hon.

<p>Will the Secretary of State tell the House about the representation received from Conservative trade unionists?

<p>Unemployment in the United Kingdom on a seasonally adjusted basis rose by 35,700 between August and September to 2,461,000. No one should underestimate the human difficulties that lie behind the

<p>I am not surprised that the Minister did not venture to give a figure. Is not it true that employment in the United Kingdom as a whole is down by almost 1 million compared with June 1979, that in Wales there are 116,000 fewer jobs for men and that overall there are 70,000 fewer jobs in the economy?

<p>I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman's facts are wrong. Since 1979 there has been an overall increase of about 800,000 in the number of men and women in work. If we take as our starting point the end of the last recession, there has been an increase in Wales of 167,000. That is a 17 per cent. increase, which is well above the United Kingdom average.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. Part-time jobs are important. It is sometimes suggested that people with part-time jobs would prefer full-time jobs.

<p>Everyone must have sympathy with the hon. Gentleman's constituent and those who find themselves in similar circumstances, but I hope that the hon.

<p>Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that those who are rightly worried about unemployment should treat strictures from Opposition Members with some caution?

<p>Does the Secretary of State accept that there has been a significant change in the pattern of unemployment during the past two or three years?

<p>These matters are constantly kept under review, but I doubt whether the hon.

<p>Is my right hon. and learned Friend aware that in constituencies such as mine, unemployment is significantly lower than it was at the time of the last election?

<p>Does not the Minister's admission that some three quarters of a million people are counted twice in the employment figures&#x2014;as well as trainees who are counted as though they were in full-time professional jobs, and part-timers who are counted as though they were full-timers&#x2014;prove that the Government's much-parroted claims about employment levels constitute a monumental lie? Instead of running away from the rigorous examination of his policies carried out in a television studio, and instead of attacking the BBC, should not the Secretary of State try something new? Should he not adopt a novel&#x2014;novel in his case, that is&#x2014;approach to the employment figures, and tell the truth?</p>

<p>If the rather over-the-top strictures that the hon. Gentleman has tried to apply to the Government were remotely true, they would also be true of what was done by his party when it was in government. The House should be aware that the method of counting used in this instance is exactly the same as it has been for 20 years&#x2014;since 1971, if not earlier. I did not hear any of the hon. Gentleman's colleagues make the same point when their party was in office.<br/>
When an employer-based survey method is used, as it has been in this instance, the sort of counting that I mentioned earlier will be adopted. Let me give another example. The same counting method is used in France, a country often held up by Opposition Members as a socialist ideal. Presumably, any strictures that the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) applies to us will also apply to that country.</p>

<p>Given the dismissive way in which the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) referred to part-time jobs a moment ago, will my hon.

That means that 94 per cent. of people in part-time work who were looking for such work, have found it and are happy in it.</p>

<p>Indeed. My hon. Friend makes an important point, which echoes the point made so forcefully by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (Mr. Bevan).<br/>
Opposition Members deliberately avoid the fact that the bulk of people in part-time jobs choose, and want, to work part-time. It is a matter of choice. I know that choice is anathema to Opposition Members, but Conservative Members rather want to defend choice wherever that is possible, in every aspect of Government policy. If Opposition Members do not like that, they should stand up and say so.</p>

Will they also tell us why&#x2014;most worrying of all&#x2014;in a year in which unemployment rose by 800,000 in Europe, 700,000 of those people were unemployed in Britain?

<p>The hon. Gentleman has outdone even his dismal record for selective quotation.<br/>

<p>I can indeed confirm that people with disabilities will be given preferential access to the employment action programme, and that they will not need a qualifying period of unemployment. Indeed, people with disabilities have generally been given higher priority on the Government's training schemes for some months now and, for the first time, have been part of the aim group.<br/>

<p>The question is about employment action. That is securely funded. Places will be provided in the way that I have suggested.

<p>Very little surprises me about the Opposition, but it is noteworthy that, despite the fact that they claim to care for unemployed people, they resist almost every initiative that is designed to help unemployed people.

<p>The 30,000 places referred to by the Secretary of State pale into insignificance when compared with the rise of 230,000 unemployed since he announced employment action. When the Under-Secretary of State gave a written answer to the Chairman of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Leighton) in June highlighting the differences between employment action and the old community programme, he omitted two very important distinctions &#x2014;the difference in funding and the difference in the number of places available.

<p>The hon. Gentleman totally fails to take into account the range of opportunities that are now available to help unemployed people&#x2014;opportunities that were not available when the community programme was in existence. There was no employment training then, nor the range of ways in which we now help unemployed people through the Employment Service. This year we shall be helping 840,000 unemployed people, over and above the help that we give to every unemployed person when he or she comes into the job centre to sign on. That is what the hon. Gentleman has to take into account if he is to make a fair comparison.</p>

The second is that many of those jobs would slide into the black economy, with a loss of rights for the women concerned in terms of the protection of health and safety at work, much of which is Conservative legislation.

<p>My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State has no immediate plans to visit the area. There were 3,851 unemployed claimants in the Crewe and Nantwich constituency in September 1991, which is more than 33 per cent. fewer than in September 1983, when unemployment was at its peak in the constituency.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that my constituency has one of the most rapidly rising unemployment rates and that, despite the desperate need for rolling stock, firms of the quality of British Rail Engineering Ltd. cannot fill their order books? Rolls-Royce Ltd., which has a history of providing high-quality engineering, shut down at extremely short notice without any indication that this would be the last layoff between now and Christmas.

<p>I can well understand the hon. Lady's concern about the extent of the job losses that her constituents have experienced. That concern is widely shared, not least among my colleagues and myself. She asked for hope. Between April and September 1991, almost 80 per cent. of the 1,700 restart interviewees in the Crewe area found either jobs, training or other positive outcomes. Job clubs in Crewe have helped 98 people into jobs since April, and the South and East Cheshire TEC&#x2014; one of the most dynamic and successful TECs&#x2014;is fully operational in her area. It is well understood by Conservative Members that 50 per cent. of people who unfortunately lose their jobs, including in the hon. Lady's constituency, find themselves back in employment within three months. That is something positive for people to look for. We shall do all that we can to help them to do just that.</p>

<p>The sheriff principal of North Strathclyde published this morning his determination following the fatal accident inquiry that he conducted after the terrible accident on 22 November last year involving the fishing vessel Antares and the submarine HMS Trenchant, which was on a submarine commander's training course. We are now studying this very detailed determination.<br/>
The sheriff principal concludes that Antares sank as a direct result of HMS Trenchant snagging her fishing gear, and that this led to the tragic deaths of the four crew members of the Antares. This conclusion is similar to that of the Royal Navy's own board of inquiry. We have already expressed our very deep regret at this awful loss of life and I do so again. I understand what an irreplaceable loss this was to the families of the four men and indeed to the whole community of Carradale.<br/>
The sheriff principal concludes that the accident was caused by human error on board HMS Trenchant. The Royal Navy will consider whether disciplinary action is right once the Crown Office has decided whether to take any further action. The House will understand that I cannot comment further on this point.<br/>
We attach very high priority to the safety of fishing vessels in the vicinity of dived submarines and we recognise that fishermen are very anxious after the loss of the Antares. In the light of this tragic accident, we have already made a number of changes to training and procedures, showing our determination to ensure that submarine operations conducted in the Clyde are as safe as possible.<br/>
We are now giving urgent consideration to all the recommendations made in the sheriff principal's detailed report. His most urgent recommendation is that a 3,000 yd mandatory separation zone should be established around fishing vessels. I can tell the House that, in view of our wish to take every measure we can to improve the safety of shipping, we are with immediate effect increasing from 2,000 to 3,000 yd the distance by which dived submarines should be separated from vessels which are fishing&#x2014;navigation and shipping constraints permitting. Instructions have already been sent out to this effect and will apply throughout United Kingdom waters. We shall consider the sheriff principal's other recommendations as quickly as we can.<br/>
I note that the sheriff principal commented that the need for submarines to train for their operational role is not in question. We must ensure that our submariners are properly trained to operate in coastal waters so that they can operate effectively in wartime. Those who serve in our submarines value good relations with the fishing community and share to the full our sense of grief at the loss in this tragic accident. We believe, however, that the needs of the Royal Navy and the interests of fishing communities can be accommodated, and we are determined to achieve this.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for his statement. I join him in expressing the sympathy of the whole House for the bereaved families who, once again, have been brought face to face with the tragedy that confronted the community of Carradale.<br/>
Opposition Members recognise the importance of the training of submariners. They must live alongside fishermen who, with the greatest respect to the Royal Navy, have lived in the area a good deal longer than the Navy has. We recognise also that the timely response in extending the area from 2,000 to 3,000 yd will be welcomed and that it will assist in ensuring greater safety.<br/>
What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that the tactic, which is widely alleged by fishermen, of submariners using fishing craft as camouflage when they are diving does not happen again? In the light of the sheriff's statement and the statement of the Royal Navy board concerning the procedural and personal failings that took place, will he guarantee to take whatever disciplinary steps are felt appropriate by the Crown Office? Will the Minister take the necessary steps to ensure that the United States and Soviet navies, which also use those waters for whatever purposes, are made aware of the new regulations and of the need to ensure that the safety of our fishermen is just as important as the training of our submariners?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his remarks. I am grateful also that he understands the importance of training. We recognise that we must do everything possible to give confidence to local fishing communities. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we do not use fishing boats for camouflage. One of the things that we have done since the accident is to get far better communications with the Clyde Fishermen's Association. It now has notification of our submarine movements. Our intention is to explore every avenue to improve those communications and relations.<br/>
I assure the hon. Gentleman that, if the decision of the Crown Office is not to take legal action, we will consider carefully what disciplinary action we have to take. We have to await the outcome of the Crown Office's consideration. I assure the hon. Gentleman that those measures will apply to all our submarines. We are determined that safety should be a priority in the Clyde area.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) is ill today; otherwise, she would deal with this matter, which involves the loss of life of some of her constituents. I add my condolences to those that have already been expressed.<br/>
The advance notice that I now understand is in place for the Clyde Fishermen's Association is welcome, together with the Minister's statement that the zone is to be extended to 3,000 yd. Given that, last week, he was able to announce a significant reduction in low flying, will he undertake to consider whether there is an opportunity significantly to reduce the number of training exercises which need to be done, particularly in areas where there is considerable fishing activity?<br/>
Although human error has been identified in this case, much concern has been expressed in the House and outside, even before the loss of the Antares, that such events were happening. Trawlers were having their nets snagged by diving submarines. Will the Minister examine whether human error has been at fault and whether, in


part, that has been brought about by a system that leads to that human error&#x2014;in fact, it is a system operated by the Ministry of Defence&#x2014;rather than put the blame on one or two individuals?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman recognises that it is important to spread the training. One of the recommendations of the report is that we should look at relocating training to other coastal areas in the United Kingdom. We will obviously give that matter considerable thought.<br/>
In answer to the point about general safety and notification, we have sent a list of all our submarine movements to the fishermen. We talk to them carefully about what we are planning to do and shall see whether we can extend that practice even further.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend will be aware that nothing that we say today can in any way reduce the pain and loss that the families concerned are experiencing or can bring back those men, so surely the important thing is to recognise that there are real lessons to be learned and that those lessons must be put into practice. The submariners and the fishermen recognise that they must live and work together in the same waters and, as the Clyde Fishermen's Association has clearly demonstrated, they ask simply for an arrangement that makes it safe for the fishermen to carry out their duties while the submarines are also safe, and allowed to do what they have to do if they are to be up to the job that is required of them in time of war.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend makes a good point. He might be interested to know that, in 1990, the Ministry of Defence started to produce a publication entitled "Fishing Vessel Avoidance: Flotilla Guidance" which is continually updated and seeks to instruct submariners about how to look out for fishing and other vessels. We shall continue to update it. As part of his training, each submariner now spends a day on a fishing vessel so that he can be fully up to date with fishing equipment and methods.</p>

<p>The House should note that meaningful dialogue took place between the Clyde fishermen and the MOD only after that tragic accident. Given that the limit of 2,000 yd between submarines and fishing vessels was in force at the time of the accident, is the Minister aware that, after 2 am on 22 November, HMS Trenchant moved towards the fishing vessel, and that the fishing vessel had capsized before 2.18 am? Therefore, the accident happened despite that rule being in force.<br/>
What assurance, therefore, can the Minister give us now that the new procedures will stop what is commonly referred to in the Clyde as "snuggling up" by the submarines, so that their noises are obliterated by those of the fishing vessels? Does the Minister agree with the sheriff principal's report that submarine warfare training in the Clyde is incompatible with fishing activities?</p>

<p>Many of those matters were mentioned in the report. There is no question of submarines "snuggling up" to fishing vessels. There has always been a principle of separation and, as the hon. Gentleman knows, we have now extended that separation to 3,000 yd. That was a quick response to the report, which we were glad to make.<br/>
On the night of the incident, HMS Trenchant surfaced carefully and as quickly as she could. She spent two hours searching and then, having convinced herself of the position with all the details at her command, returned to her exercises. That matter is dealt with in the report. We must consider whether that was the right practice and how we can revise our operations should such an unfortunate occurrence happen again. Obviously, that matter is given detailed consideration in the report.</p>

<p>Does the Minister accept that a policy that allows submarine exercises in fishing waters is inherently dangerous, and that whatever the catalogue of human errors that were immediately responsible for the tragedy, that policy cost the lives of four fishermen? Why does the Minister seek to misrepresent the views of the sheriff principal who, far from conceding operational reasons for exercises in fishing waters, said exactly the opposite&#x2014;that no evidence was led to justify that? Furthermore, will the Minister now institute an instant ban on submarine activity in Scotland's fishing waters?</p>

<p>Aspersions like that do no service to the seriousness of this matter. We must address these matters with the utmost care. The basic principle is that our submariners are highly skilled, dedicated people, who ply a difficult operation with considerable courage. If they are to be effective in war, it is essential that they can practise in coastal areas. As I have said, we try to give as much warning as possible to fishing vessels and to give them information about all our movements. As I have said, however, the important principle is that such training is absolutely essential if we are to have an effective submarine force.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware how welcome it is to hear a Minister from the Ministry of Defence facing up to the responsibilities accepted by the MOD? As one who has been to sea in both conventional and nuclear vessels, I know how difficult it is, using even the most modern sonars, to note where nets are. Often those are large drift nets on fishing boats which are drifting. What is being done to investigate the use of sonar reflectors on such nets and other matters instituted by the MOD before the sheriff principal's report so that the possibility of such tragic accidents is reduced in future?</p>

Why can the hon. Gentleman not accept that recommendation now?

Does the Minister realise that people in fishing communities around the country are certain that, if a blind bit of notice had been taken of the many similar incidents reported to the Ministry of Defence over the years, and if the Ministry had reacted sensitively and sensibly to those reports instead of arrogantly ignoring all the points put to it, the tragedy could not have happened?<br/>
In the light of that truly horrific background of neglect when matters had been brought to the Government's

attention, do the Secretary of State and the Minister not agree that it is now incumbent upon the Ministry of Defence to show some humility and to accept in full and without delay Sheriff Principal Hay's recommendations on the Clyde and to extend exactly the same principle to other coastal waters around Britain?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has not been listening. I stated categorically the measures that we have taken since the tragic accident, and they are not insignificant. I have also announced an extension of the separation distance from 2,000 to 3,000 yd. We have had the report for only a day or two, and because of safety considerations, our action has been speedy. I do not accept what the hon. Gentleman says.<br/>
In addition, I have said that we shall study the report in great depth and introduce any further necessary measures.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend will know that there is a great deal of naval activity around my constituency, which emanates from the submarines which exercise from Portland. There is also a large fishing fleet. I hope that the Ministry will in no way look for scapegoats among the crew of the nuclear submarine. I had the privilege of seeing some of those very personnel in action, and I can vouch for their professionalism.<br/>
Perhaps we should devote the absolute maximum effort, as we did in the Gulf war, to finding a suitable way for submarines to detect nets, because there will always be problems where fisherman and submarines are together. Portland has a wonderful Admiralty research establishment, and I am sure that, if it were given the task of tackling that problem, it would do so with vigour.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his tribute to the dedication of submariners. On the wider national scene, we consult the fishing industry safety committee, which has a national interest in this matter.

We value good relationships with fishing organisations and wish to ensure that both naval training and fishing can live in harmony.</p>

<p>The Minister mentioned notification agreements.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, about prorogation. I put down a number of written questions which have not been answered, except by way of the usual rubric from Ministers that "I will provide an answer at some time in the future." On prorogation, everything before the House, except statutory intruments, falls. May I have your assurance that you will deprecate the action of any Minister who seeks to avoid answering questions by failing to produce a written answer before the time of prorogation? I put down questions several days in advance of the written priority limit and, like other Members, I have been given holding answers and told that substantive answers will be given at some future stage. As we are close to prorogation, it is important that Standing Orders under which Ministers are required to answer are followed.</p>

<p>I am most grateful for that opportunity. I have the second largest fishing community in the south-west. I also have large naval establishments in my constituency. In August, we lost a fishing vessel out to sea with the loss of all the crew.

This is the only opportunity that I have to raise in the House the possibility that the fishing vessel, the entire crew of which was lost, was hit by a naval vessel. This the first and only opportunity for me to ask that question.<br/>
How can I obtain from the Minister a survey of the area on 11 August to find out which naval vessel was in the area, whether it be a British, European or Soviet ship? Otherwise, the loss of the ship and its crew may never be explained. I need the opportunity to raise that point.</p>

<p>I beg to move,<br/>
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to give a company's directors standing authority to allot equity share capital to lending bankers to discharge indebtedness; to protect a lender in such circumstances from the shadow director provisions of company law and insolvency law; and for connected purposes.</q>
There has been considerable controversy in recent months about the alleged behaviour of the banks in respect of the method of interest charging, and account charging, for individual and corporate borrowers. Indeed, I raised the matter myself in the House in a debate on the Finance Bill on 30 April 1991. Subsequently, the Government carried out an inquiry, and no direct allegations against the banks were upheld; nevertheless, there was considerable disquiet among many private and corporate borrowers.<br/>
It is true that many companies have been highly geared. It is justifiable to make criticisms of directors who have allowed their companies to borrow more than they should have done, in commercial terms. However, bankers were often not prudent in what they encouraged companies to borrow, often on terms that left the companies exposed when the recession came upon them.<br/>
Many directors of companies into which receivers have gone, at the instigation of the bank as secured creditor, have complained to me that by acting precipitately the bank lost any opportunity to enable the company to recover and therefore to provide the bank with the opportunity to recover the full value of its loans. In many cases, banks, having put in receivers, recovered less than they had originally expected to do through this secured charge.<br/>
Under this government, record numbers of new companies have been created in a climate attractive to entrepreneurs over the last 12 years as a whole. Net creation, as opposed to collapse, of companies is still positive. There are still more companies being created than there are going under. Yet, bearing in mind this background, total business failures, including receiverships, were up 71 per cent. to 33,532 in the first nine months of 1991, the largest increase in 11 years. The percentage of collapses to active companies as a ratio could rise to 2 per cent.<br/>
It is widely accepted that receiverships increase in number when a recession is ending, as banks begin to see hope that they can recover their loans against improving asset prices, rather than assuming that, if the company itself recovers its position, will also improve&#x2014;which is the stance I should prefer them to take. Dun and Bradstreet has been quoted as saying:
<q>business failures continued to rise sharply for two years after the first signs of a recovery in 1981.</q>
In those circumstances, the Opposition cannot say this time that this recession is continuing if the number of receiverships now paradoxically goes up.<br/>
To quote the late Sir Kenneth Cork on banks acting too quickly, he said not long ago that the banks should
<q>try to support their customers, to many of whom they lent too much money anyhow, through difficult times in the hope of saving the business. I get the impression they are not doing that and are pulling up the carpet much too quickly.</q>
Banks seem still to prefer putting in a receiver to the more constructive procedure provided by the Insolvency Act

1986, which is to put in administrators. I am sad that the banks have not taken up the administration route, which is a much more constructive route, enabling there to be a package of measures that could rescue the core of the business.<br/>
The figures on administration are not very encouraging. Between January and March of this year, the last figures available to me, there were 64 administrative appointees in Great Britain. If we take the 12 months to March 1991, there were only 237 for the whole country. I am delighted that the Minister for Corporate Affairs is on the Treasury Bench. I know that he takes a particular interest in encouraging this modest version of what the Americans have in chapter 11, which enables the reconstruction of a company to take place in a protected atmosphere against creditors.<br/>
The Bill's proposals, which I believe are important, are several. They would provide directors with standing authority to allot equity for debt. Far-sighted boards have already obtained the permission of their shareholders to do that, but often it is not those companies that are in difficulties and under pressure, if times have become difficult. Any reconstruction will need subsequent shareholder approval because of the second company law directive, which has been on the statute book for a very long time. Yet at least in those circumstances shareholders can be offered some hope, whereas if they are merely told that the receiver has gone in, it implies that there will be little left for them, as ordinary shareholders. That is an important point. If banks consider, when they are completing their investigation of a company, that substituting that company's debt for equity is appropriate, there is a chance of rescuing the company and, in the long run, of benefiting the overall position of the bank.<br/>
By making the process more transparent, pressure could be brought on banks to consider equity swaps more favourably. That could be a particular factor during a period of administration. Banks should be encouraged to use the procedure for putting in an administrator rather than a receiver. That would enable a much more organised discussion to take place on the reorganisation of the company's balance sheet and prospects.<br/>
It is important that banks are seen to play a constructive part in any reorganisation, because many potential new equity investors would be reluctant to put new equity money into a company if it were used merely to bail out the banks' existing lending. Therefore, it is not credible to believe that new equity investors would invest in a company that would then repay its existing borrowing.<br/>
Equity injection, as an alternative, has other merits. Insolvency procedures are expensive and often badly reduce the value of the charge that the company has on fixed assets. As we all appreciate, insolvency proceedings are also expensive in human costs. If a receiver goes into a company, that has a dramatic impact on the employees and the owners.<br/>
My Bill would tighten the shadow director provisions, so that banks would have a clearer understanding of the risks that they take during a reorganisation. That is important, because in many cases banks have said to me that they perceive that the risks of becoming involved in a debt equity swap are too great because of the risk of being deemed to be shadow directors. It is theoretically possible in law for a bank to be regarded as a shadow director. If


it is involved in the potential of taking equity in a company, it is much more concerned that that might actually happen.<br/>
Under section 251 of the Insolvency Act 1986, a shadow director is defined as
<q>a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the company are accustomed to act".</q>
In normal circumstances, a bank providing advice to a company would merely be regarded as providing advice on a professional basis. In the event of a reconstruction, where the bank is intimately involved in the running of the company as well as the reorganisation of its affairs, it is possible for it to be thought that the bank is actually running the company. If that were to be the case, the bank would feel extremely exposed unless the laws on shadow directorships were clarified in respect of bankers. That is what I want. I want greater clarity in the laws as they would apply if a bank were actively to consider taking what would inevitably be a substantial equity stake in a company as an alternative to putting that company into receivership.<br/>
It must be realised that the shadow director provisions under the Companies Acts and the Insolvency Acts are severe. Although I do not in any way wish to give banks permission to indulge in wrongful trading&#x2014;to use a definition in the 1986 Act&#x2014;I want further clarification to limit the liabilities that would be faced by banks in the event that a reconstruction properly entered into nevertheless ultimately failed.<br/>
Although an equity for debt swap would affect a bank's capital ratios, the Bank of England must already be taking a close interest in the provisions that banks now have on the loans outstanding to companies. The National Westminster bank made recent provisions of &#x00A3;902 million for bad debts to United Kingdom private and corporate

customers. Therefore, receiverships can be a double blow for banks&#x2014;not only do they lose value in terms of their loans to companies, but they lose value if the owner-shareholders are put into personal financial difficulty.<br/>
Although the banks should not emulate the German banks, serious considerations are involved. The object of the Bill is to put pressure on the banks to consider debt equity swaps, to encourage directors to negotiate these with banks, to promote the use of administration, and to give reasonable comfort to bankers that they will not automatically run foul of the tough shadow director provisions.<br/>
We have a climate that is favourable to companies and we want to avoid the direction and regulation that another Labour Government would introduce. We all have an interest in ensuring that banks fulfil their responsibilities to companies.</p>

<p>I beg to move amendment (c) to the Lords amendment, in line 7, at end add&#x2014;
<q>'In the exercise of this power the Secretary of State shall be guided by the duty imposed on him under the old law of encouraging British exports'.</q>
Amendment (c) is important because at issue is the extent to which the Government will be obliged to take into account the need to promote and encourage British exports when considering whether to provide reinsurance facilities. The 1978 law used the expression "encouraging British exports". The Opposition believe that that commitment should be at the forefront of the Secretary of State's mind when he decides to what extent reinsurance should be provided.<br/>
Amendment (c) would strengthen the hand of a future Secretary of State, especially if other Departments, such as the Treasury, which has a reputation for cost-cutting in export promotion, take a negative view of the reinsurance facility. The amendment would allow the Secretary of State to tell the rest of the Government and the Treasury that he is obliged to encourage British exports. It repeats an obligation under the old law, which operated satisfactorily until the Government decided to repeal it with this ill-thought-out Bill.<br/>
The encouragement of exports is vital. Unfortunately, under the Bill, the service to British exporters&#x2014;a service that is inferior to that enjoyed by our competitors&#x2014;is likely to suffer. The Government's purpose is simply to cut costs and to reduce the extent of services that are available to exporters.<br/>
I imagine that the Minister will say that we should be well aware from previous debates, especially the debate on clause I, that the word "encouraging" was felt to be more restrictive than facilitative. However, I do not believe that that argument applies to this amendment.<br/>
This part of the Bill deals with the reinsurance facility. We say that, whenever the Government decide to provide top-up or national interest reinsurance, they should be motivated by the consideration of encouraging exports. We therefore believe that the Minister's objection to the word "exports" does not hold good.<br/>
Amendment (c) would retain the spirit of the old law, which exporters believe served them well, and by accepting it the Government would send exporters a welcome signal

at a particularly difficult time for them. We have been made aware today of the extent of the Confederation of British Industry's criticisms of the Government's industrial and manufacturing policy, and it is true that manufacturing industry relies particularly on the services of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. If the Government accept our modest amendment, it would at least give some reassurance to industry that some of their difficulties are being taken into account.<br/>
This month's trade statistics, which were issued today, show that there is an alarming manufacturing deficit. The manufacturing companies that use the ECGD's services see the ECGD as an important weapon to reduce that trade deficit, but they are worried that, under present proposals, it will not be available to the same extent as it was in the past.<br/>
Amendment (c) would give exporters the impression that we will be active in some of the new markets in which we need to be involved, especially those of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Exporters have repeatedly given me the impression that British industry is falling behind because it is not getting the Government support that is available to many of our competitors. They have been worried about the lack of ECGD cover for the Soviet Union and the countries of eastern Europe. If amendment (c) is accepted, exporters will be encouraged by the thought that some of the difficulties under which they have been labouring in trying to export to those new markets will perhaps be overcome.<br/>
Amendment (c) would send out the right message to those many exporters who fear that, if the Bill is passed in its present form, we will be at a disadvantage compared with our major competitors, especially in the European Community. Widespread concern was expressed in the other place about the lack of a level playing field in terms of export support and promotion.<br/>
When the Government introduced the Bill in the other place, only the Minister spoke in favour&#x2014;all other speakers on the Government and Opposition sides expressed either reservations or outright hostility. They included various captains of industry, two former Cabinet Ministers and two former Trade Ministers who had had specific responsibility for export credit, including the previous Minister for Trade, Lord Trefgarne, the predecessor of the hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury). That shows the extent of the concern.<br/>
Last week, Lord Trefgarne said in the other place that he was worried that our exporters using the services of the preferred purchaser, the Dutch company NCM, would be at a disadvantage compared with Dutch exporters using the same service. Lord Trefgarne was perturbed at the fact that, throughout the discussions last week and this week in the other place, he did not obtain a satisfactory answer from the Government spokesman. That shows how worried people are about whether this part of the Bill will provide for comparable services for exporters throughout the European Community. The Opposition will continue to monitor events closely in the coming months, because we want to ensure that our exporters who use the services of the new purchaser of the ECGD will have available to them the same services as are available to Dutch competitors and exporters in other parts of the European Community.<br/>
If amendment (c) is accepted, exporters will be reassured about the way in which the Government will operate this reinsurance facility. That facility has two


parts, one of which is the top-up facility. The Government hope&#x2014;they have not yet provided any proof&#x2014;that within three years that facility can be taken over entirely by the private sector.<br/>
Although there is no time scale in the Bill, I understand that the Government are sticking to their foolish belief that somehow, by magic, the private sector can absorb the reinsurance facility within three years. There is much concern that the Government are proposing to apply arbitrary limits to the amount of reinsurance under the top-up scheme over the next three years, and that is also something to which I should like the Minister to respond.<br/>
Exporters are worried that the Government's policy will effectively cap the amount of top-up support provided in the next three years, and that the amount of support will progressively be reduced. The Government still insist that, at the end of three years, they expect that facility to be taken over by the private sector, no matter what the economic circumstances, the trade deficit and the position of our major exporters may be at that time. I should like the Minister to comment on that.<br/>
We are also worried about the Government's intention about the national interest reinsurance facility to which the clause refers. We want to know how the Government propose to define that facility&#x2014;how widely or how narrowly.<br/>
Many exporters are rightly worried that there are many markets for which they will be unable to obtain such support in future. That fear was expressed well in another place and has also been expressed to me only this week by many exporters and exporting associations. The Minister has a duty to them and to us to say how he proposes to operate the national interest reinsurance facility in the future. Will it be operated in a way that encourages British exporters or will cost be the only consideration?<br/>
The Bill contains no timetable for either the top-up scheme or for the national interest reinsurance provision. Therefore, there is no guarantee that they may not cease after the three years, which, I understand, is still the Government's policy on the top-up facility.<br/>
I hope that I have outlined some of our main concerns and those of the exporting community. Our point of view has been widely supported in industry, and if the Minister cannot give us the necessary reassurance and is unwilling to accept the amendments, industry's concerns about the legislation will continue in the weeks and months ahead. The amendment would partially rectify our worries about the measure, and would go some way to allaying exporters' fears. We hope that the Government are willing to accept it.</p>

<p>I fear that the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) will he disappointed, because I cannot recommend the amendment to the House. Indeed, I shall go further and say that it would be unhelpful, not only in terms of this excellent Bill but to Britain's exporters.<br/>
One reason for opposing the amendment is factual. There is no duty in the Bill&#x2014;nor was there in the Act that the Bill replaces&#x2014;for the Secretary of State to encourage trade. There is no duty&#x2014;I stress that word, which is the word used in the amendment.<br/>
In the Bill and in the Act, the Secretary of State is given permissive powers to encourage trade and to facilitate supplies. There would be serious doubts about how to determine in legal terms whether a duty to encourage had

been discharged, and I foresee great problems in the courts if that issue were to be brought before them. So, the first but substantial reason for rejecting the amendment is that, under both pieces of legislation, the Secretary of State is given only permissive powers.<br/>
The hon. Lady reminded us that we debated the issue at some length not only in Committee, but on Report. The matter also came up in another place. On each occasion, we pointed out that the word "encourage" was open to some challenge and threw doubt on what the total powers were. It seems logical to say that one cannot encourage something that has already happened. One can make it easier for it to take place. One can facilitate an export by providing all sorts of things, such as transport and insurance, but one can scarcely encourage it if it has already taken place.<br/>
The old words of "encouraging exports" were less helpful to British exporters than the new formula that we have used, which refers to "facilitating the supply". The new formula allows the ECGD to give assistance where it is currently statutorily debarred from doing so.<br/>
4.30 pm<br/>
The same objection, which we went through in Committee and in another place, holds in the context of reinsurance. Reinsurance is not there as an end in itself; it is there to facilitate exports. One may try to encourage exports, but how does one encourage something that has already happened? It is clear that the word "facilitating", which we have used, is a far better word. Unlike the hon. Lady, we do not want to restrict the help that the ECGD can give British exporters. It would be extremely difficult to determine whether it was practical to have a duty to "encourage".<br/>
I want to confirm that the competitive position of British exporters is one of many aspects that the Government will take into account when determining the national interest case for providing reinsurance. Trade and diplomatic aspects need to be considered as well. ECGD's primary objective will remain helping British exporters by giving export credit and investment insurance. I hope that that is apparent from everything that we have said about this excellent Bill throughout the proceedings.</p>

<p>I am well aware of the case to which my hon. Friend refers and of the energetic steps that he has taken to help his constituency company to obtain what would be a valuable order. I am sure that he is also aware of the particular difficulties associated with that market. I remind him that ECGD cover for short-term credit is available for exports to Iran. Medium-term cover is under review. The review is taking account of significant export opportunities such as the one to which my hon. Friend referred. The review also needs to take account of political developments, some of which have been helpful recently.<br/>
I cannot tell my hon. Friend when the review will be completed or what the outcome will be, but I can tell him that I am reasonably optimistic that we shall reach a


conclusion in the very near future. I will bear in mind what my hon. Friend has said about the export opportunity for the company in his constituency.<br/>
I am sure that the House will recall that lengthy debates took place in Committee and on Report about the provision of reinsurance support by the Government for the new company after privatisation. On Report, the House decided not to agree to certain amendments, partly on the ground that they gave rise to significant legal and technical difficulties.<br/>
The debate continued in another place, and the issues arose again. In response to the further debate and to the suggestions put forward, parliamentary draftsmen were able to draw up new amendments which meet the concerns expressed in both Houses while avoiding the legal and technical difficulties inherent in the previous amendments that we rejected and which were tabled in another place.<br/>
Lords amendment No. 1 imposes a permanent&#x2014;I stress "permanent"&#x2014;obligation on the Secretary of State to determine from time to time whether a national interest case exists for him to use his general enabling powers under clause 1 to provide reinsurance to insurers who provide direct insurance for the same classes of risk as those in respect of which the Secretary of State himself might otherwise directly provide under the provisions of clause 1.<br/>
The new obligation that the amendment would introduce into the Bill is widely drawn and therefore relates to all types of reinsurance, including reinsurance of the kind to be provided under the so-called transitional top-up national interest facilities to which the hon. Member for Gateshead referred and which the Government are committed to providing to the privatised insurance services group. The amendment imposes no restriction on who may be the recipient of the reinsurance.<br/>
The amendment reflects the desire expressed in both Houses for the ministerial assurances given at various stages to be reflected in the Bill, while at the same time avoiding the pitfall that had arisen in the context of other similar amendments considered in both Houses.</p>

<p>I had intended to come to that point later, but perhaps I may do so now.<br/>
The hon. Lady refers to the top-up facility, which, as she knows, has been debated at some considerable length. Since the announcement in 1989 of the decision to privatise the insurance services part of ECGD, there has been continual work on the issue of reinsurance, because we recognise that it is an important part of the total package. The Government have recognised throughout that, at the outset, there might be a small shortfall&#x2014;I emphasise "small"&#x2014;between the company's full requirements for reinsurance and what the market could provide.<br/>
That was foreshadowed in the statement made on 18 December 1989 by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. My right hon. Friend announced the Government's decision on privatization

and referred to the need for a continuing reinsurance link between the ECGD and the privatised insurance services. We said that that top-up reinsurance facility would exist for three years, and it would be looked at in the light of requirements and in the light of the take-up in the market.<br/>
We have discussed the issue on a number of occasions, and I have been able to assure the House and the hon. Member for Gateshead that the market's response to the request for reinsurance has been positive. That is a tribute not only to the capacity of the market but to the ability of the ECGD and its advisers to obtain reinsurance.<br/>

<p>I was saying that the top-up facility was due to continue for up to three years, in the light of the requirements&#x2014;in the light of the gap between what the market provides and what the company needs. As I have just said, the market has shown a great willingness to take the reinsurance requirement, and that is why we are confident that, within that period, there will no longer be a need.<br/>
The second type of reinsurance relates to the high-risk &#x2014;</p>

<p>I understand the market to be helpful at the moment, but none of us can forecast what the market will be in a year or 18 months. Will my hon. Friend therefore clarify two points&#x2014;first, that the sum is not a capped sum, and, secondly, whether the requirement is that it "shall" be phased out within three years or that it "may" be phased out within three years?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="828407" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1991-10-22a.816.3" hansard_membership_id="7399" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20362" speakername="Mr. Sainsbury" colnum="816" time="16:15:00">
<p>I have given a commitment several times that the requirement would be met for up to three years. At the moment, the expectation is that it will not even be needed for all that time, because of the market's response. While I appreciate what my hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) says about not being entirely certain about markets, there is a fair predictability about the behaviour of markets and reinsurance markets to a portfolio risk which does not differ greatly in its overall make-up or size. The reaction of many experts confirms that, as the market becomes more familiar with the quality of portfolio risks presented to it, the spread of risks and the quality of management of the insurance services group, so it will be more ready to absorb the cover that is required.<br/>
Even before the company exists&#x2014;and given that element of uncertainty&#x2014;it is remarkable that the market has shown itself willing to undertake to provide so much reinsurance that there is only a very small gap between what the market is prepared to take and the total requirement.<br/>
There is no time limit on the other form of reinsurance, which is now called the national interest reinsurance facility. There may be some confusion here. When I refer to the ECGD in this context, I mean the continuing ECGD &#x2014;that part of the ECGD that exists at the moment and which will continue in existence as part of the


Government. The ECGD will provide 100 per cent. reinsurance to the new company on the small handful of higher risk countries. That facility will not be time-limited.<br/>
In order to meet concerns expressed by hon. Members that the facility might be withdrawn prematurely, I assured the House that the requirement for the facility would be kept under close review, and that it was the Government's intention that, subject to it performing satisfactorily as an ECGD trading facility, it would continue for as long as the Government considered it essential to meet the reasonable needs of exporters. Lords amendment No. I deals with that point.<br/>
Lords amendment No. 1 also imposes a permanent obligation on the Secretary of State to determine from time to time whether a national interest case exists for him to use his general enabling powers under clause 1 to provide reinsurance to insurers. As that is permanent, the reinsurance arrangements that we have announced will ensure that, in the aftermath of privatisation, there is no sudden or sharp reduction in the level of facilities available to our exporters.<br/>
Lords amendment No. 1 will ensure that the need for that kind of reinsurance will be kept under permanent review. The amendment makes even better what was already an excellent Bill. It will ensure that our exporters, as the first beneficiaries of the privatisation, will receive a service from the new company and from the continuing ECGD which will be better matched to their immediate and future needs and better placed to meet the challenges and opportunities of exporting in the single European market and throughout the 1990s. I commend the Lords amendment to the House and urge it to reject the imperfectly drafted, but I believe well intentioned, amendment to it, tabled by the hon. Member for Gateshead, East.</p>

<p>I support the amendment to the Lords amendment and I want to participate in the debate because a company called Cross Europe in my constituency has a problem. Cross Europe is part of an American-based multinational company called Cross and Trecker. Having seen what has happened at Cross Europe and having listened to the Minister today, I believe that the Government stand accused of stunning complacency. When exporters around the country face terrific difficulties with the schemes, to claim that everything in the garden is rosy and is getting better does not reflect the experience of Cross Europe. I have seen press reports which confirm that that company's experiences are not unique.<br/>
I will give the facts about. Cross Europe because I am sure that that will prove the case for the amendment to the Lords amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin). Cross Europe won an order in the summer of 1990 to supply equipment for differential case and axle tubes&#x2014;in effect, machine tools &#x2014;for the new Moskawitch engine programme to be supplied by a company called Ishevsk. Cross Europe won that contract in the face of extremely effective competition from Germany and Italy and it obtained a very successful &#x00A3;5 million order.<br/>
There was subsequently some discussion about the method of payment for the scheme. Between August and

December, the contract was negotiated and submitted to Midland Montagu and ECGD for inclusion under line of credit and approval respectively.<br/>
Therefore, the method of payment had been agreed in December. The company planned the order into its work programme, and the negotiated contract was signed on 19 December 1990. In January 1991, after the company had geared up for the order, it was told that there was to be a review of the ECGD coverage with the USSR in general and that special contracts, Cross Europe's included, were to be pulled out for special treatment.<br/>
Between January and February, there were frequent contacts between Midland Montagu and ECGD, and Cross Europe and ECGD. The company was told that the issue would be resolved by March 1991, but it was not. In May 1991, Cross Europe contacted me. The company was anxious not to create any publicity. It simply wanted to unsnarl the red tape and get on with the order which, by that time, it was manufacturing.<br/>
I wrote to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 31 May 1991. I will not quote the whole of that letter, but two paragraphs are important. In one, I wrote:
<q>As I understand it, Ricardo, based in Brighton and Lamb, based in Mildenhall, have subsequently taken steps to fulfil their contracts through sister companies in Canada and Germany, since they were able to get the necessary export guarantee schemes there. However, Cross Europe have actually already started work on the project within the UK and, therefore, are seriously exposed if they are not allowed the necessary export guarantee cover in the very near future.</q>
In the other paragraph, I wrote:
<q>Since all of the original five companies"&#x2014;</q>
the companies that were caught up in the review&#x2014;
<q>have taken their business elsewhere and I have no knowledge of the other two, it is quite possible that Cross Europe are the only company remaining with this difficulty. In any event, even if the other two are still in the same situation, allowing for both of them having contracts to the value of say &#x00A3;10 million each, the amount of risk to which ECGD will be exposed would in terms of its total operations be very small indeed.</q>
On 28 June, the Minister for Trade was kind enough to reply to my letter. The final paragraph of his letter reveals all about the Government's attitude to these problems. He wrote:
<q>I regret" &#x2014;</q>
we have all heard those words before &#x2014;
<q>that I cannot say how long the review will take or pre-judge its outcome. I can assure you, however, that we will complete it as soon as we reasonably can. I shall ensure that you are informed of the decision. In the meantime, I would suggest that the company contact David Wyatt (Head of ECGD's East European Projects Branch"&#x2014;</q><br/>
it gives the telephone number &#x2014;
<q>in order to keep abreast of developments.</q>
I have heard no more. Cross Europe is certainly in weekly contact and sometimes more than weekly contact with ECGD, as was suggested by the Minister, but the Minister appears to have washed his hands of the matter &#x2014;so much so that, in September of this year, Mr. Normal J. Ryker, the vice-chairman and chief executive officer of Cross and Trecker Corporation, wrote to the Prime Minister. As far as I know, there has been no response to the letter.<br/>
If I may read just one paragraph of Mr. Ryker's letter to the Prime Minister, it will even further illuminate the House in respect of the inactivity of that Government Department in its dealings with exports. Mr. Ryker says:
<q>The machine tool industry in general and our UK Subsidiary has suffered through a depression for an extended period of time and the financial position of the UK branch


would deteriorate substantially with far reaching consequences both for our British workers and in other areas of the company if the delay would continue beyond the aforementioned shipment date. The machinery in question is specially designed for the customer and cannot be utilised for other customers and only a small percentage of material would be available for salvage.</q>
Therefore, &#x00A3;5 million-worth of equipment, which was built by the company in good faith on the basis of an order and understandings with the Midland bank and unaware that a review was about to take place, is standing crated up on the shop floor of Cross Europe in my constituency, and the Minister sits on the Government Front Bench as though there is nothing wrong with the export credits guarantee scheme. He sits there with smug complacency, pretending that there is no problem.<br/>
I followed up that letter by writing to the Prime Minister on 10 October. I still have not had a reply from the Prime Minister. I have long since given up any belief that any contact that I could possibly have with the Department of Trade and Industry, which seems to be almost detached from exports and encouraging industry, would produce anything. The company has made that decision and it is dealing directly with the Prime Minister, who himself does not seem able to reply to that letter. I have even taken to writing directly to the Prime Minister.<br/>
That &#x00A3;5 million of equipment was made in good faith, is now ready to be exported, and awaits the necessary agreement from the ECGD and the intervention of the Government for which Mr. Ryker asks. I should imagine that Mr. Ryker is no great supporter of the Labour party, as he is a serious American industrialist. He and his managers in my constituency say that that inactivity does not happen in Germany, France, or the United States, but it is happening in this country. The bottom line is that nearly 200 jobs in my constituency are now at risk because of that inactivity. That company was opened in Knowsley in 1970, interestingly enough by Lord Wilson of Rievaulx, who was then the constituency Member. That company may end up closing down because the Government have left it financially exposed.<br/>
When I became involved in May last year, the company had already been told that the review would be completed in March of that year. That date had passed. We still have not had a decision from the Government's review of the Export Credits Guarantee Department and its dealings with the Soviet Union. How much longer is that inactivity and complacency to continue? We are supposed to be an exporting nation. Why are we constantly losing manufacturing capacity? It is because of the incompetence and bungling of the Government in export orders and manufacturing. Let us support the amendment and let us start encouraging exports, which is what the amendment would do.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House. I am sure that the whole House sympathises with the position in which Cross Europe finds itself, but I hope that nobody sympathises with the synthetic indignation and allegations of the hon. Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth). I should have thought that even those who do not make a great habit of reading the newspapers or even of watching television would have noticed that there are problems connected with the Soviet Union for which any exporter and any export credit agency must have regard.</p>

<p>I conceded precisely that point in a letter to the Secretary of State, to which the Minister of State replied, and I also conceded it in a recent letter to the Prime Minister. Everybody worldwide recognises the serious problem. France, Germany and the United States are still successfully trading and guaranteeing trade with eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.

<p>I can appreciate that perhaps the hon. Gentleman does not understand the nature of export credit insurance. Export credit insurance for short terms has been available for the USSR, and it is available not only for the USSR but for all the countries of central Europe. The hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) spoke as though it was not so available. That is an important point. Medium-term cover is available for Hungary and Czechoslovakia.<br/>
We are talking about the Export Credits Guarantee Department; it has nothing to do with privatisation, and nor has the case to which the hon. Member for Knowsley, North referred. The hon. Gentleman is seeking medium-term cover which would be provided by the continuing ECGD&#x2014;still a Government Department. We are not concerned with privatisation.<br/>
If the hon. Lady is suggesting that that Department should provide cover, regardless of the risk, regardless of its exposure in a particular market, and regardless of political developments&#x2014;I do not know whether the hon. Member for Knowsley, North has noticed that there is a continuing difficulty in the Soviet Union&#x2014;I am not surprised that the review of the wisdom of continuing cover is still continuing, because &#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall not give way again to the hon. Member for Knowsley, North. The hon. Member for Gateshead, East wants to intervene. I shall let the hon. Lady have her chance first.<br/>

<p>Does the Minister agree that it is absurd that we did more trade with the old Soviet regime than we are doing with the new, reforming Soviet regime? Will he confirm that we have effectively been off medium-term cover for the Soviet Union for more than a year and that that differentiates us from most other developed countries?</p>

<p>The hon. Lady will find that nearly every country is now off medium-term cover for the Soviet Union in view of the disturbed state of the economy and the lack of clarity of the economic arrangements, for instance, between the Ukraine republic, the Russian republic and the central authority. That must be reflected in the ECGD's decisions on cover. I stress that short-term cover has been available and is still available to all the countries of central Europe.<br/>
The hon. Member for Knowsley, North suggested that we were saying that everything in the garden was lovely, and then went on to suggest that, quite to the contrary, everything was a total disaster. Such allegations come


frequently not only from the Opposition Front Bench but from all parts of the Opposition&#x2014;for example, that Britain's manufacturing is a total disaster and is doing very badly.<br/>
That is more than surprising when we consider the facts. In August of this year, output was 17 per cent. higher than the average level for 1980, export volume was up by two thirds, and productivity was 60 per cent. higher. The most recent figures, which were announced this day, show that manufacturing exports, a matter about which the Opposition are expressing much concern, in the last quarter are 7&#x00B7;5 per cent. up on the same period last year.<br/>
I congratulate British manufacturing exporters on that achievement, because they have succeeded in increasing exports by that significant amount against a background of difficult world trading conditions. Instead of knocking our exporters and our manufacturing, the Opposition should recognise and praise achievements. I am sorry about Cross Europe, but I hope that even the hon. Member for Knowsley, North will understand that it is because the situation in the Soviet Union is so uncertain that we have to keep our medium-term credit provisions under review.</p>

<p>We are now considering the last Act of the overspill period of the fourth year of this Parliament, so I should like to take the opportunity of telling the Minister how frustrating he is to deal with. He is frustrating for us as an Opposition and exceedingly frustrating for those in British industry. He has done nothing more this afternoon than to repeat his performances in Committee when, every day, he wrote a PhD in hair-splitting and nit-picking.

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for allowing me to intervene briefly, because the Minister would not do so. As I want to raise a point that he did not answer, perhaps my hon. Friend could press it for me. Cross Europe signed an agreement to provide the Soviet Union with equipment in December 1990. The ECGD review, with which Cross Europe is now caught up, did not start until January 1991. That is an important point, which has not been answered.</p>

<p>I cannot do better than say that I am sure that Cross Europe's frustrations when dealing with the Government's lack of support for industry and its exports to critical markets is repeated across the country. That experience is not restricted to that one outstanding machine tool company in my hon. Friend's constituency. There are hundreds of similar examples. Indeed, much of what the Prime Minister was talking about at the G7 meeting&#x2014;about increasing exports to the Soviet Union, providing it with model farms, model food distribution systems and even food this winter&#x2014;may be vitiated by the DTI's lack of action and decision making.<br/>
The hon. Member for Hove (Mr. Sainsbury) is one of the Ministers who is responsible for not doing anything. The DTI has not been able to decide how much backing British industry needs in those critical markets. He was unable to answer his hon. Friend the Member for Bolton,

North-East (Mr. Thurnham) who asked him about the Beloit Walmsley's proposed paper mill contract with Iran. We have not had any decisions or replies except for: "We are carrying out a review. Hang on, we'll come to a decision in perhaps a month or two and we hope that the contract will still be available then."<br/>
That is a classic example of what is wrong with the DTI's non-involvement in the process of providing support for British exports, and that is what has made this such a depressing Bill for the Opposition as well as for British industry. We have had to become the defenders of British industry's interests in this House, because Ministers&#x2014;</p>

<p>Although we are used to quite a lot of inaccuracy from the hon.

<p>Speaking as a former DTI civil servant, I can well appreciate that people who are trying to do a good job to support British exports actually do so, despite an extraordinary lack of ministerial involvement. Ministers need not listen to me on this point, and I do not ask them to accept my word for it&#x2014;they will never accept that I am an objective guide. All they need do is read the headline on page 1 of today's <i>Financial Times</i> and consider what the Confederation of British Industry has said. Now that I have found my spectacles, I shall read the direct quote to the Minister. Speaking on behalf of the CBI working party on manufacturing industry, Sir Colin Chandler, the managing director of Vickers, said:
<q>We need a powerful voice sitting around the cabinet table speaking up for industry.</q>
Is that supposed to be a vote of confidence in the current regime at the DTI from Britain's major exporters as represented on the CBI's three-person working party by the heads of Vickers, Vauxhall Motors and British Aerospace? Only rarely at the end of a Session have British industry's large-scale exporters and those at the cutting edge of technology expressed such a lack of confidence in the DTI. That does not happen at the end of every Parliament, but it has been happening regularly during the past six months. When presenting their annual reports, the chairmen of our large firms have begun to express a degree of disillusionment with this Government. That happened with British Aerospace and Pilkington, and it has now happened with the CBI working party that represents the other heavyweights.<br/>
When the other place discussed the amendments, the Government were isolated. They did not have a single friend. That is why we have taken great pleasure in attempting to fortify the Lords amendments by tabling our amendments which seek to take the process a little further than the Government were willing to do when they were


finally forced to table amendments to try to reconcile the views of the two Houses, and that is why we are discussing these provisions now. We are trying to ascertain how we can carry the process forward. The Government tried simply to buy off the opposition in the other House. We know that the Government are trying to climb down, so we are seeking to give effect to what the other House would have liked to do. We want to express our firm commitment to and to encourage our British exporters.<br/>
One senior captain of British industry, who would be most embarrassed if I were to name him, attended a recent private meeting with Labour Members at which he said, "What the present Government do not understand is the difference between support for British industry and intervention on behalf of British industry." British industry needs support, but it is not getting it. It does not want to return to old-fashioned interventionism, but it does want the same degree of support that is given to French and German industry by their Governments and to Japanese industry by its Ministry of International Trade and Industry. British industry has been left with a lot of half-baked Thatcherite claptrap at the Department of Trade and Industry, and we have seen more of it this afternoon.<br/>
Although I am pleased to be speaking as the House considers the final Act of this Session, I speak also with some regret, because I have a strong constituency interest in the Bill. More than 700 people work for the ECGD in Cardiff. Most of them will find that their work is to be privatised, although some will remain civil servants and will work in a sort of halfway house, continuing to provide a service for the ECGD which itself will be privatised and given into the ownership of NCM, the Dutch exporting insurance combine, which appears to be the favoured tenderer for taking over most of the ECGD's Cardiff operations.<br/>
We are not happy about that, but I am sure that the Secretary of State for Wales will claim it as a major success for his drive to bring foreign investment into Wales. The simple fact is that no British companies were interested in taking over the ECGD's insurance services group, and when some foreign bidders dropped out, the only realistic bid remaining was from NCM. It is a highly professional organisation, but I do not know whether it is the best organisation to handle the reinsurance of Britain's exports. We must bear in mind the fact that we are talking about the United Kingdom's national interest, not the Dutch national interest.<br/>
The Government's hypocrisy goes even further. I should like to draw the House's attention to what the Secretary of State said in his much-praised speech to the Conservative party conference. I must admit to enjoying reading it. The <i>Financial Times</i> of 11 October reported:
<q>Stating an intention to 'intervene for British industry abroad' Mr. Lilley nonetheless said he did not believe in intervening at home.</q>
Which category does export credits reinsurance fall into? Is that intervening for British industry abroad, in which the Secretary of State does believe, or is it intervening in British industry at home? The constituents of my hon. Friend the Member for Knowsley, North (Mr. Howarth) might have a word or two to say about that.<br/>
The Secretary of State's speech was much praised. I am told that it was praised because it contained self-deprecating jokes or, to paraphrase Churchill on Attlee, because he is a self-deprecating little man with much to be self-deprecating about.<br/>
The CBI report shows how extraordinarily remote the Government have become from what used to be thought their natural constituency in industry. It is their natural constituency no more.<br/>
That is why we shall press the amendment to a vote this afternoon. We must ensure that British exports are encouraged. The Minister has made an extraordinarily nit-picking attempt to counter that argument today, repeating more than half a dozen times what he said in Committee. The Minister's claims will have no effect at all in the face of the way in which British industry will view the Bill without our fortifying amendments.<br/>
I hope that I can persuade the Government to add this amendment to the climb-downs from original Thatcherism that we have already seen with the poll tax and, more lately, with the Secretary of State for Health's opposition to tax relief on private health insurance for the over-60s. Let the Government make that three by accepting this amendment, so that the message can go out to British industry that the Government have at last started to see the light, that non-intervention does not always work and that they should be doing for British industry what the German, Japanese and French Governments do for their industry.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You will recall that there has been some controversy in the last day or two over an invitation by the North-West regional health authority to Conservative Members to briefings on how to minimise political damage in the marginal constituencies in the north-west. It has been said that Labour Members from the north-west were also invited. The chief executive of the North-west regional health authority said on the radio at 5 o'clock that north-west Labour Members of Parliament have not responded to letters. That is a downright outrageous lie.</p>

<p>I beg to move amendment (e) to the Lords amendment, in line 4, at end add
<q>'and shall be obliged to consult the Council in the exercise of his duty under that subsection if so requested by the Council'.</q>
The amendment strengthens the Lords amendment and places on the Secretary of State an obligation to consult the Export Guarantees Advisory Council if the council so requests. That is in addition to the Secretary of State's obligation under the Lords amendment.<br/>
Our amendment would allow the Export Guarantees Advisory Council to institute consultation rather than simply waiting for the Secretary of State to begin consultation with the council. We tabled the amendment because we felt that exporters might be worried that their views would be ignored by the Government.<br/>
There have been plenty of examples during the passage of the Bill and in recent industrial and economic legislation of exporters being ignored. Our amendment strengthens

the Lords amendment. We feel that it is useful because the Export Guarantees Advisory Council may well wish the Secretary of State to look again at certain moments at the extent of reinsurance that the Government are willing to provide. Our amendment would enable such consultation to take place at a time deemed appropriate by the council and not only at the moment judged appropriate by the Secretary of State.<br/>
5.30 pm<br/>
We should have liked to widen the Lords amendment to include consultation with representatives of the British exporting community, including organisations such as the British Exporters Association, the Institute of Export and so on. But unfortunately, that is not possible under the terms of the Lords amendment, which refers specifically to the Export Guarantees Advisory Council.<br/>
Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to comment on whether he envisages a formal consultation process with exporters in general and with their representative trade associations. In other words, in exercising his authority under this part of the Bill, does the Minister feel that it would be advisable to consult not only the EGAC but as wide a range as possible of representatives from the exporting and industrial community?<br/>
The reason why we are so keen to strengthen the role of the Export Guarantees Advisory Council is that there is a great need for a watchdog role in this privatisation. In other privatisations, some sort of watchdog authority has been set up, even though its powers may have been disappointing to many of us who believe in strong regulation in the public and the consumers' interest.<br/>
However, the Bill creates what amounts to a private monopoly. We are used to the Government privatising and creating private monopolies. Some sort of regulatory function needs to be strengthened in this privatisation so that exporters and exporting companies, the consumers of the privatised company's services, have an opportunity fully to express their view, especially on the role of the Secretary of State in providing a reinsurance facility to the newly privatised ECGD.<br/>
I stress that the Government are effectively creating a private monopoly. The Minister may say that other export credit insurers may well provide services to the British exporting community. Those exporters include exporting outfits in other European countries which may come to Britain and try to gain business. But perhaps the Minister is not aware of the difficulties that one such company, Hermes, the German export credit insurer, has had in the British market. Those difficulties reinforce our view that the Government have created a private monopoly which other companies will find difficult to challenge.<br/>
I have in front of me a letter that Hermes sent to various people involved in exporting in Britain. It explains that, over several months, Hermes was interested in offering credit insurance to the United Kingdom market, but that, unfortunately, the enormous increase in the number of insolvencies in our economy in recent months meant that it was simply not viable to operate in Britain as it had hopes to do.<br/>
In the letter, Hermes refers to
<q>the adverse economical situation of a vast variety of United Kingdom companies".</q>
That has forced it to examine its current policy portfolio as well as its underwriting practices. That makes it clear


that, while in theory there may be competitors for NCM &#x2014;the new privatised company to which the Government have sold part of the ECGD&#x2014;in practice, especially in the current economic climate, it is unlikely that there will be much in the way of competition. Therefore, the Government have effectively created a private monopoly.<br/>
For that reason, our amendment, which strengthens the role of the Export Guarantees Advisory Council, is important, because it will provide the only watchdog element in the process which could stand up for the customers of this new private monopoly. We are understandably attached to the ideas behind amendment (e) and we hope that the Government will look sympathetically on them.<br/>
We are also worried about what may happen if the new company which takes over the ECGD finds itself in financial difficulties or is tempted to sell out to some other purchaser after a certain period. In such circumstances, it is important that the EGAC should have a watchdog role and that it should be able to oblige the Government to consult it, in addition to responding to the Secretary of State's invitation to meet him to discuss the export situation. It is vital for the EGAC to be fully involved in the process.<br/>
The amendment will also provide one way of overcoming the rather secretive approach of the Department of Trade and Industry to many export insurance activities. If the advisory council is involved, at least that will open out beyond the DTI and via the council into the wider exporting community the debate on how far to provide reinsurance.<br/>
Amendment (e) is modest in the sense that, although it strengthens what the Government propose, it still refers merely to consultation. Obviously, that still does not tie a Secretary of State down, but at least it would mean that those who will he considerably affected by the Secretary of State's exercise of this power will have the chance to make their feelings known. That is why we feel that the amendment is important. We hope that the Government will look sympathetically on it.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady said that we were creating a private monopoly. I hope that she listened carefully enough during our earlier proceedings to recognise that the Insurance Services Group of ECGD, which is being privatised, is not a monopoly now and certainly will not be after privatisation. It is the general expectation of exporters that the level of competition in the market is likely to increase after 1992.<br/>
Interestingly, the hon. Lady referred to the letter from Hermes. The difficulties which that insurance provider has experienced in the British market are solely connected with domestic business and are not connected with export credit insurance. As the hon. Lady knows, the new company will be able to offer insurance in domestic sales after privatisation and therefore will provide a still better service to British exporters. ISG is not a monopoly now and certainly will not be after privatisation. The general expectation is that there will be increased competition. Competition will come not only from other insurers but through exporters using other methods such as forfaiting.<br/>
The hon. Lady referred to her amendment to Lords amendment No. 2 as modest. I find it not so much modest as puzzling. Perhaps I can best demonstrate my

puzzlement by reading to the House the text of the Bill as it would appear if we accepted the Opposition amendment as well as the Lords amendment. It would read:
<q>In exercising his duty under section 11(2) of this Act, the Secretary of State shall consult the Export Guarantees Advisory Council and shall be obliged to consult the council in the exercise of his duty under that subsection, if so requested by the council.</q>
I do not understand how he shall be required to consult the EGAC and then be obliged also to consult it if he is requested to do so by the council.<br/>
The amendment seems not so much modest as unnecessary. For that reason, amendment (e), which the hon. Lady said was modest and a strengthening of the Lords amendment&#x2014;I take that to mean that she approves of Lords amendment No. 2&#x2014;would not have any such effect. Indeed, it would have no consequence at all. The advisory council need not be asked for consultation, because the amendment already says:
<q>the Secretary of State shall consult".</q>
I therefore feel that amendment (e) is redundant.<br/>
As for Lords amendment No. 2, I commend it to the House.<br/>
Like Lords amendment No. I, the amendment is related to the question of the reinsurance support that will be available from the ECGD after the privatisation of the Insurance Services Group. It forms part of the response that we gave to the desire expressed in both Houses for the Government's commitment on the reinsurance to appear on the face of the Bill. It also reflects the call for the Government to consult widely when conducting any future review of that support. We have undertaken to consult exporters generally about matters affecting them.<br/>
Lords amendment No. 2 is extremely straightforward. It simply requires the Secretary of State, when fulfilling his duty under new clause 11(1)(a) to determine the national interest case for providing reinsurance&#x2014;which we have just discussed&#x2014;to consult the advisory council. Although the amendment imposes a separate obligation on the Secretary of State, it is inextricably linked with the obligation imposed by new clause 11(1)(a) and is not entirely free-standing.<br/>
The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, before reaching a conclusion on the need for ECGD reinsurance, the Secretary of State will have had the benefit of advice from the highly respected advisory council. The council's advice is an important resource, which we must use wisely. We must not overlook the fact that membership is honorary and that all the council's members have heavy responsibilities to discharge in industry and the City. We must avoid overburdening them. The Bill places no constraint on the demand for their time; indeed, it introduces some new calls that might be made on that time.<br/>
In practice, the ECGD will call on the council's services when it can be expected to make the most helpful contribution, while avoiding converting the council into a kind of supervisory board&#x2014;let alone the watchdog suggested by the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin). I am happy to commend that arrangement to the House. I feel that the requirement for the Secretary of State to consult a valuable body of advisers will strengthen the Bill, and will make it even more helpful to the interests of British exporters.</p>

<p>I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said. Although we approve of Lords amendment


No. 2, which is an improvement on the previous wording in the Bill, I do not agree with the Minister that our amendment is redundant. We believe that it strengthens the text of the Lords amendment: it gives the advisory council an opportunity to oblige the Secretary of State to consult it at a stage that it&#x2014;the council&#x2014;considers appropriate.<br/>
It is really a question of timing. It is possible that the council will have been consulted by the Secretary of State about the provision of reinsurance in certain circumstances, but that the council itself will then deem that those circumstances have changed, and will wish to make further official representations to the Minister. Our amendment would give the council that statutory right; the Lords amendment does not.<br/>
We are convinced that our amendment strengthens the existing wording of the Bill. Given the need to make progress, however, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move amendment (f) to the Lords amendment, in line 4, at end add
<q>'particularly with regard to the principles in accordance with which the Secretary of State shall determine whether any reinsurance may be provided under that section'.</q>
I am sorry that, for various reasons, some of my hon. Friends who&#x2014;along with me&#x2014;tabled the amendment are not present.<br/>
The problem with Lords amendment No. 2 is that there is still an element of "We shall consult if we feel like it." The guiding principle is that the Secretary of State will consult, but only if he considers it right to do so. There is no provision for the advisory council to express dissatisfaction formally with the way in which things are going.<br/>
Clause 13(2) states:
<q>There shall continue to be an Export Guarantees Advisory Council.</q>
That is a good guarantee, but subsection (3) goes on:
<q>The function of the Council shall be to give advice to the Secretary of State, at his request".</q>
If the Secretary of State does not request that advice, the council cannot give it.<br/>
That is not a very good recipe for any kind of exercise of independence or incisiveness by the council. It will not work if matters on the trade front continue to deteriorate, and the level playing field that British exporters are always asking for seems to be tilted further and further away from them because of Government timidity, inactivity and inertia&#x2014;and all the other qualities that the CBI has cited to describe the Government's approach to long-term support for manufacturing industry. The front pages of today's <i>Times and Financial Times</i> highlight what has been said in a document that is bound to feature extensively for the next six months, or longer, in the run-up to the people's final verdict on 12 disastrous years of the Government's stewardship&#x2014;if it can be called that&#x2014;of trade and industry.<br/>
We want to get away from the "when I feel like it" approach that the Secretary of State is reserving for himself. He is setting up a body that is supposed to act as a sounding board, providing a second opinion and guidance from those in the appropriate field to prevent

him from becoming even more isolated than he is now from the people on the chalk face of exporting. That body, however, cannot move unless he allows it to do so. He can say, "Well, chaps"&#x2014;and perhaps there will be a statutory lady&#x2014;"how do you think I am doing? Is it going OK?" If the members of the council reply, "It is not going too badly, Minister; perhaps you should ask us again next year", that will be the way in which matters will continue.<br/>
If, however, the council's members feel that he is going seriously wrong, rumours will reach the Secretary of State, who will say, "I will make absolutely sure that I do not ask them. If I do not ask them, they cannot tell me, and then no adverse report will be made." There will then be no possibility of the matter coming before the House, and no possibility that hon. Members will be told that the advisory council is not at all happy with the way in which the Secretary of State is handling his responsibilities for the provision of reinsurance for the new company.<br/>
Our amendment would ensure that the Secretary of State was required to consult the advisory council about the criteria that will determine whether Government reinsurance for the privatised ISG&#x2014;reinsurance of a top-up, "national interest" variety&#x2014;is to continue, or whether it should be eased off gradually. In the latter event, it must be established whether it is being eased off in a way that disadvantages those involved in exporting, in export finance or in export insurance.<br/>
Without the amendment, the Government will determine their criteria without the possibility of challenge, unless they choose benevolently to submit themselves to possible criticism from the council. That is not good enough, simply because the Government have been unwilling to lay out the criteria for top-up insurance. They have therefore earned considerable mistrust, as is evident from today's CBI report.<br/>
A two-way relationship is needed, with the Secretary of State being able to consult the advisory council and the advisory council being able to consult the Secretary of State. It must not be a one-way street, for that would confirm all the worst aspects of the deterioration in relationships between the DTI and trade and industry. We want to make sure that the advisory council can come back at the Government if it thinks that things are going the wrong way. The Government will then have to respond constructively to the council's criticisms and will be able to steer the DTI back on to the right course so that industry does not feel that it has been let down. It has been let down in the past and it is being let down at present. It may be let down in the future by the DTI without our amendment. That would be insupportable, if we are to recover our position as a major trading nation.</p>

<p>As we heard to our delight on many occasions during the Committee proceedings on the Bill, the hon. Member for Cardiff, West (Mr. Morgan) has once again been carried away by the exuberance of his own verbosity. I fear that he was carried so far away that he forgot what it was that he was putting to the House by way of an amendment.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that consultation was a two-way street. My impression&#x2014;I suspect that it is widely supported in the House&#x2014;is that the Secretary of State is responsible for his decisions and is answerable to the House for them. I do not therefore see how the Export Guarantees Advisory Council could consult the Secretary of State. It is not the responsible body. As I explained


when we discussed the previous amendment, its role is to give advice from its great knowledge and background experience of exporting to the Secretary of State, who is the person with the responsibility, who has to take the decisions and who is answerable to the House.</p>

<p>The point that I made was that, without our amendment, it will be a one-way street. The Secretary of State needs to consult the council only when he feels like it. That is hardly a healthy relationship. There is no possibility of the council approaching the Secretary of State and saying, "We wish to be consulted, because things are going wrong and we want you to put them right."<br/>
As the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry will seek to avoid embarrassment when things are going wrong, he will avoid consulting the council. The council will then have to remain silent. The council will be of no value, except when things are going well, when it does not need to be consulted. What is the Minister's answer?</p>

<p>I was pointing out that it is the Secretary of State who has responsibility and who is answerable to the House. The hon. Gentleman's amendment refers to consultation
<q>particularly with regard to the principles in accordance with which the Secretary of State shall determine whether any reinsurance may be provided under that section.</q>
We are discussing a Lords amendment&#x2014;with which the hon. Member for Gateshead, East (Ms. Quin) says the Opposition agree&#x2014;which places an obligation on the Secretary of State to consult the Export Guarantees Advisory Council. He will consult, when appropriate, on a broad range of issues. I have no doubt that the council will make the Secretary of State aware of its views on any matter of which it believes he ought to be aware. Moreover, the council consists of individuals with considerable experience of industry, banking, financial services and exporting. As people in senior positions, they will have other opportunities to make their views known, perhaps through other organisations.<br/>
We shall continue, as we do now, to consult widely and to listen carefully to the views of industry, in particular to the views of exporters. It is not practicable for the Secretary of State to be asked to delegate to another organisation the determination of the principles on which he will base his decisions. He will have to take into account a wide range of issues. The role of the advisory council is, as it has always been, to assist the Secretary of State by bringing its financial and commercial knowledge to bear upon the ECGD's business.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman referred to setting up a body. I remind him that the Export Guarantees Advisory Council has been in existence for a long time. Its members have always been appointed from industry and financial services. As I said before, we do not want to overburden them. They will be consulted, as required by the previous amendment. They will have every opportunity to put forward their views on all relevant issues. Their advice will continue to be of value to the Secretary of State.<br/>
The Secretary of State will continue, as he does now, to support the work of British exporters, not only in the ways to which I have referred but through the continuing work of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. In addition to the 2,000 staff to whom I have referred, he will have the services of all the excellent and experienced staff of that department. British exporters will continue to have the services of the ECGD, and also the services provided by a privatised Insurance Services Group, based in Cardiff, which is known for its expertise and skill and for the excellent service that it now provides for British exporters. As the hon. Gentleman well knows, as a result of privatisation it will be able to provide a still better and a more flexible and responsive service to help British exporters to continue to achieve the excellent results that they have already achieved, as announced today, but which seldom, if ever, are praised from the Opposition Front Bench.</p>

<p>It is a refreshing change for an Adjournment debate to be held as early as this. Whenever I have had an Adjournment debate in the past, it has been in the early hours of the morning.<br/>
The subject that I want to raise is the second runway at Manchester airport which is causing great concern in my constituency. Ever since I was elected as Member of Parliament for Altrincham and Sale I have supported Manchester airport, for a variety of reasons. It is of great value to the north-west region. The airport is also the largest single employer in my constituency. If anything drastic were to happen at the airport and employment there were to drop, it would have a devastating effect on my constituents.<br/>
In particular, I have supported over the years more scheduled international flights. I could never understand why passengers from the north of England had to take the shuttle down to London and change aeroplanes in order to get to their final destination. I have always felt that, as long as airlines were prepared to fly passengers direct, and provided that there was sufficient demand, this was nonsense. I encouraged more scheduled flights because they fly during the day at more civilised times, unlike charter flights, which often take place during the night and cause residents in the area to complain.<br/>
Recently, the airport published its development strategy to the year 2005. To say that that has caused a stir in the area around the airport would be a classic understatement. It has caused a great deal of concern.<br/>
Protest groups have been formed, protest meetings have taken place and countless letters of protest have been written. People have written to me blaming not only the Government, but the Conservative party, for the problems. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will disabuse them of that false notion. The airport is controlled not by the Government, but by a board that consists of three professionals, nine councillors from Manchester city council, and one councillor from each of the nine district councils that made up the former Greater Manchester council. Of all those councillors, only one is a Conservative.<br/>
I regret the personal attacks that have been made on the airport's chief executive, Mr. Gil Thompson. He does not make the decisions; as chief executive he carries out the decisions made by the board. People have a right to put their case fairly and squarely, but to descend to personal abuse is unforgivable.<br/>
The development strategy to the year 2005 proposes the construction of a second runway by 1998. Three options have been suggested. Some people suggest that the reason for there being three options is to cause dissent in the area and to pit one group against another. That is not true. Three options were suggested because this is a consultative period and the board feels that it must put forward options that it thinks might be viable. I am most concerned about option 2&#x2014;the option that is causing the greatest anxiety in my area &#x2014;because the runway would be sited close to a built-up area.</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman knows, Manchester airport is in my constituency. Over the years, he and I have participated in debates about the future of the airport. As he said, this is a consultation period, and it will last for some time yet. It is essential that all points of view are fully stated and considered. It may not be decided to proceed with any of the options, but if it is decided to proceed with any one of them, there will have to be a planning application and a public inquiry. We must make it clear to people that we are at the very beginning of a long consultation period.<br/>
As I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, there is a great deal of concern about the threat of privatisation of the airport. It is felt that if that were to happen, environmental factors would go through the window and the airport could be controlled from Tokyo, Wall street or the City of London, and that local influence and authority would disappear. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman appreciates that concern.</p>

<p>I agree with the first part of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks, but if I had known that he intended to talk about privatisation, I might not have given way to him.<br/>
The airport tries to maintain a good neighbour policy, and any complaints that I have taken to it on behalf of constituents have been sympathetically treated. The airport operates a series of policies in an effort to help those who are adversely affected. It has a noise insulation grant scheme, it imposes fines on noisy aircraft, it has installed equipment to monitor whether aircraft keep to flight paths, and it will begin to fine aircraft that do not. After its efforts last year, the airport was awarded the north-west "Golden Lear' award because it was the business doing the most to limit the environmental impact of its operations in the north-west. The airport has quite a good record.<br/>
The argument that is now raging is whether a second runway at Manchester is essential. First, it is argued that a second runway is needed because of maintenance or disruption to the existing runway. Secondly, the airport is claiming that future demand in the area will require a second runway and it has produced figures to substantiate its claim. However, at protest meetings and in the letters that the right hon. Gentleman and I have received, Gatwick is always cited as an example of an airport that has only one runway, yet still manages to cope with more passengers and more aircraft movements than Manchester.<br/>
Some figures supplied by a local resident compare the numbers of passenger and aircraft movements for Manchester and for Gatwick. For the year ending 31 December 1990, Manchester handled 10&#x00B7;8 million passengers, while Gatwick handled 21 million. It is estimated that, by the year 2000, Manchester will handle 22 million and Gatwick 30 million. For that same year, Manchester handled 123,000 aircraft movements, while Gatwick handled 189,000. It is estimated that, by 1995, Manchester will handle 172,000 and Gatwick 200,000.<br/>
People say that Gatwick, which does more business than Manchester, manages with a single runway&#x2014;so why the need for a second runway at Manchester? That fact has had a great impact on people who oppose a second runway. The other constant theme in the letters that I have received is that people feel that the issue should be dealt with as a regional problem. They believe that a regional


study should be undertaken to identify where passenger traffic originates&#x2014;in the whole of the north of England, not just in the Manchester area&#x2014;in the hope that some traffic could be diverted for the mutual benefit of the north of England as a whole. I hope that the idea of a regional survey will be considered in conjunction with the continuing consideration of runway capacity in the south-east. It is vital, in the national interest, to ensure that maximum use is made of regional airports, consistent with the demand that they can attract.<br/>
Another point that needs clarifying is whether there should be greater co-operation between the airports of Manchester and Liverpool. Again, one of the themes running through the letters of constituents is that, if more jobs are to be created, it might be more sensible to create them in Liverpool where they are more greatly needed. On the other hand, Manchester airport has published research carried out by the Henley centre, which claims:
<q>We are able to give an unequivocal response. From a carrier perspective, a passenger perspective and for the economic good of the region as a whole, it would be better to develop a second runway at Manchester, rather than redevelop Speke as a major international airport.</q>
We therefore have two conflicting views, to which I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will give some thought.<br/>
The problem appears to relate to how near people live to the airport. Those who live a fair distance away are in favour of more development because that would mean more jobs and greater prosperity in the area. Those who live close to the airports or under the flight path do not have quite the same enthusiasm for expansion. My constituents have written to me expressing concern about the increase in pollution and noise that a second runway would generate, even with double glazing. I am told that, when the weather is hot and they need to open their windows to get some cool air in the evening, the noise makes that unpleasant for them. When people sit in their gardens talking, they have to stop because they cannot be heard above the noise of passing aircraft.<br/>
My constituents are concerned about the environmental damage that would occur in Bollin valley. They are worried about the congestion on local roads that would be caused by the additional cars that would be used in the area and they are especially concerned about the effects on the already overcrowded M56.<br/>
I wish to mention one novel suggestion passed to me &#x2014;that everyone who uses Manchester airport should pay &#x00A3;1 tax. The money collected&#x2014;this year, it would have amounted to about &#x00A3;11 million&#x2014;could be placed in a separate fund and used to bring about improvements for those who suffer nuisance from the activities of the airport.<br/>
I should be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister could give some idea of the procedures that will be followed. That point was made by the right hon. Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris). I can only assume that he must have read the end of my speech because he used almost the same words that I shall use.<br/>
As I understand it, the airport board will either say before Christmas that there will not be a second runway or it will advance a preferred option. If it does the latter, it will have to make a planning application to the relevant local authority. I am told that that would most likely be made at the end of 1993. The Secretary of State would call in the application and a public inquiry with an independent inspector would he held in 1994 and 1995.<br/>
That process is essential, because it will allow objectors to put their case publicly and will ensure that their arguments are fairly considered before a final decision is taken.<br/>
I hope that the airport will give my constituents a lovely Christmas present. I have always supported the airport, but plans for expansion must take into account the concerns of local residents. There is no way in which I could support growth at any price.</p>

<p>I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale (Sir F. Montgomery) on securing a second Adjournment debate on Manchester airport within a short period. As we are talking about one of the top 20 airports in the world, the time is well spent. I confirm the point that he made about the airport not being controlled by the Government&#x2014;far from it, as he made clear.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Manchester, Wythenshawe (Mr. Morris), in whose constituency the airport is located, made a valid point about the overall context and importance of the airport. I am sorry that he diverted into the realms of privatisation. If any privatisation proposals are made, we shall debate them in more detail on a later occasion. I should prefer not to debate them now, as I am pressed for time, but our experience of companies that have been privatised is that there has been no dereliction of duty.<br/>
One of the objectives that the Government had in mind when the largest local authority airports were reconstructed as companies under the Airports Act 1986 was that they should think and plan ahead as businesses. That involves them in considering the financing of airport activities, but as important is the preparation of strategies for the development of their airports so that the public can be consulted and so that the environmental implications can be considered in good time.<br/>
Manchester was in the forefront of creating an airport company and it has been in the lead in preparing development strategies and in public involvement. Its existing strategy, prepared in 1987, covers the period to 1995. The airport company has now published a draft of the fourth development strategy that will cover the period to 2005. It is right that the company should set out its proposals and the rationale for them. Although we recognise that the options that the draft contains may cause severe concerns to some of the people living near the airport, others will be encouraged by the prospect of the greater opportunities that these proposals represent.<br/>
The airport is well known as a major source of employment for the region. There are more than 150 companies at the airport, employing almost 10,000 people. An additional 15,000 jobs in the region are dependent on the airport.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman says that it is more than 10,000. It is certainly a vibrant part of Manchester.<br/>
I said only last week in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Thurnham) that passenger numbers at the airport had increased from 3&#x00B7;4 million in 1979 to more than 10 million in 1990. For


several years in succession, Manchester has been Europe's fastest expanding airport. The airport company forecasts that passenger numbers will increase to 16 million in 1995, to 22 million in the year 2000 and beyond that.<br/>
Translating such figures into requirements for terminal and runway capacity is not as straightforward as it may seem because of the uncertainties about aircraft sizes, the mix between schedule and charter traffic and the amount of hub traffic that is expected, but Manchester forecasts that demand during the morning peak period in 1995 will be equivalent to about 60 aircraft movements per hour, compared with the existing capacity of between 41 or 42 movements.<br/>
In the short term, it may be possible to constrain demand by measures such as pricing and liaison on airline schedules. The airport company plans to carry out work to the runway and to the taxiway system to maximise the capacity of the existing runways, but it is concerned that, by the time that passengers levels reach about 18 million, which they are expected to reach in the late 1990s, it will have to turn traffic away because of the shortage of peak-time slots. That is the background to the airport company's proposal to construct a second runway.<br/>
I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale about the need for local people to be able to use their own local airport. I wish that we could think of another name for regional airports. It is unfair to describe Manchester, Birmingham or other airports as regional airports&#x2014;they are major airports. Manchester is the third largest airport in the United Kingdom and it is wrong to describe it as a regional airport.<br/>
We received a report from the CAA on airport capacity &#x2014;document CAP 570. We have established a broadly based working group to take forward and to build on the CAA's advice in CAP 570. In considering the south-east area's capacity, it will take full account of the important contributions that regional airports can make to meeting overall growth in demand. The group is testing the CAA's findings that although traffic at regional airports will continue to grow strongly, development at these airports would not provide an effective substitute for additional capacity in the south-east. Indeed, the report stated that we would need to look for a new runway in the south-east by 2005. We are taking advice on the problem in the south-east.<br/>
The working group has established a sub-group specifically to consider those important regional issues. It is chaired by a representative of the Joint Airports Committee of Local Authorities, which is making a substantial and valuable contribution to the group's work. I look forward to learning the results of its studies.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale mentioned Liverpool. I have no doubt that there is room for development at Liverpool airport, but its owner&#x2014;British Aerospace&#x2014;must decide whether to seek an accommodation with Manchester. It cannot be ignored, however, that by some margin Manchester is the third biggest airport in the United Kingdom. It is a substantial regional airport which provides a wide range of international services for the business traveller and holidaymaker, covering about 140 destinations. It will want to pursue the development in a way that seems most appropriate to its commercial operations.<br/>
Accordingly, Manchester is formulating its own plans to meet the demand being generated within its catchment area. Twenty million people and 60 per cent. of the United Kingdom's manufacturing industry are located within two hours drive of the airport. The CAA's advice in CAP 570 contains traffic projections for Manchester that are broadly comparable to those that the airport company has recently produced. Moreover, the CAA concluded there would be a need for a new runway to serve the north-west and, prima facie, a site in the Manchester area was indicated. The airport company's evaluation of potential runway options has been carried out in conjunction with the CAA to ensure a robust analysis compatible with national air traffic planning. An initial study by the company shows that a second runway could be integrated into the air traffic system both regionally and nationally.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale will not expect detailed views from me today on the three areas of search for a second runway contained in the draft development strategy. The airport company has rightly set out the options and invited comments on them. It has also given an undertaking that it will announce its preferred option before Christmas. I join my hon. Friend in hoping that there will be no slippage in that announcement. We are all aware of the uncertainty that proposed major developments have caused. Therefore, the sooner that uncertainty is ended the better. The undertaking is important to end the uncertainty that the possibility of large-scale airport development inevitably creates.<br/>
Some of this uncertainty relates to the differing noise effects which local residents may suffer directly from the various options. There is also more general concern about aircraft noise as an environmental issue, together with concern about landscape and air and water quality. Manchester airport lies in attractive open countryside, within the green belt and close to residential communities. At the same time, its development is closely related to our aviation liberalisation policies and to our achievements since 1979 in regenerating the economy of the north-west. The airport company recognises that it has a particularly difficult task in balancing the claims of development and the environment.<br/>
Noise abatement measures are generally the responsibility of the owners or operators of airports. We believe that these local matters are best discussed and resolved locally, but we expect owners or operators to reduce the disturbance caused by their operations so far as is practicable and reasonable. We also believe that Manchester airport is taking its environmental responsibilities seriously&#x2014;for example, its noise and track-keeping system and its contribution to research on sleep disturbance.<br/>
One cannot completely overcome noise problems, but the airport company is doing what it can reasonably be expected to do to mitigate the effects. That can be achieved without recourse to new taxation. My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale would not wish us to follow through that suggestion which his constituents may have made, but I accept the specific points that have been made about people using the airport and the impact on the locality. This matter can best be addressed by the airport, without introducing new taxation. New taxation would set a precedent for other airports, which I am not sure we would welcome.<br/>
The Government, too, are playing an active role in reducing aircraft noise. The United Kingdom played a


major part last year in securing worldwide agreement within the International Civil Aviation Organisation to ban the older, noisier, chapter 2 types of aircraft between 1995 and the year 2002. A European Community directive on the subject will be incorporated into United Kingdom legislation. On current forecasts, the phasing out of noisier jets will improve the noise environment around airports, even with projected increases in traffic.<br/>
Noise will, of course, be one of the factors covered in the environmental impact assessment which will accompany the airport's planning application for its preferred choice of runway site. It hopes to reach that stage by 1993. Consideration of the issues would then be a matter for the planning system in the normal way. My hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale and the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe said that they would campaign vigorously to have applications called in. Whether an application should be called in is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the environment to determine in the circumstances that exist at the time. The Government's general approach is not to interfere with the jurisdiction of local planning authorities unless that is necessary.<br/>
In general, cases are called in only if planning issues of more than local importance are involved&#x2014;for example, those that have wide effects beyond the immediate locality, those that give rise to substantial regional or national controversy, those that may conflict with national policy on important matters and those where the interests of national security of foreign Governments may be involved. There is a fairly wide definition. I am sure that it would not be beyond the ability of my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale to make a strong case for consideration by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State.<br/>
There are no easy solutions in building a runway. In many debates, hon. Members on both sides of the House have agreed with the need for additional runway capacity. However, there are always differences over where that extra capacity should be. One of the most memorable of those occasions occurred when the House debated the findings of CAP 570. My hon. Friends said that a new runway was essential, but they then explained why it should not be at the airport closest to their constituencies. It is a difficult decision and we face great difficulties in dealing with applications.<br/>
We have no control over the airport. As my hon. Friend the Member for Altrincham and Sale pointed out, the company is controlled by local councillors in the main and by three executive officers. I am sorry to hear about personal attacks on Gil Thompson, whom I respect and to

whom I have listened. I am disturbed to hear of personal attacks on someone who is doing a professional job. It is unfortunate if such things happen and would not serve any purpose.<br/>
Over the past 10 years, through the Government's liberalisation policies, the tremendous growth in regional airports has brought tremendous benefits to the people living in those areas. They do not necessarily have to travel to the south-east to get a flight. The important changes that have occurred have been generally welcomed, because those airports have provided new hubs for business. In 1979, just over 3 million passengers used Manchester airport, the number has grown to more than 10 million. Many people are directly employed by the airport.</p>
