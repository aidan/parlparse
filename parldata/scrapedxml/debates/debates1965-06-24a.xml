<p>The maritime authorities in South Wales are continuously improving the sewage disposal arrangements. Since the war they have spent over &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;5 million on schemes involving new or improved outfalls, and they are now considering further schemes estimated to cost about &#x00A3;14 million. The authorities have in general shown themselves fully alive to their responsibilities for avoiding nuisance and my right hon. Friend is continuing to watch the position closely.</p>

<p>I am well aware of my hon. Friend's keen interest in this important matter, but, as he knows, the Heads of the Valleys Road Scheme is now nearing completion and my right hon.

<p>Yes, Sir. As my hon. Friend is aware the Welsh Planning Board has already submitted to my

<p>I have asked the consultants to consider this area in the first place because, on the advice of the Welsh Planning Board, an up-to-date urban centre developed here would be well placed in relation to other parts of Mid-Wales, including other towns where the Development Commissioners are accelerating the provision of small factories, and because of the road and rail facilities which already exist along the Severn Valley.</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that it is a widely held view that if there is a new town in the area the further west it is the better? If it is in the eastern part of mid-Wales it will inevitably draw population from the west and will add to the depopulation of the rural areas.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Member aware that there is a widespread feeling amongst local education authorities that the whole of the mini-minor works allocation off ration should be restored to them?

<p>Of course, I am aware and have been made very well aware of the way in which local authorities value the mini-minor allocation, but I have explained several times in the House that this had to be removed in the sense that allowance had to be made for it out of minor works as a whole. This reduced the amount for allocation. This principle applies to any concession, however small, and it would have to be allowed for from the total minor works allocation. It is a call on resources and therefore reduces the amount avavilable for other urgent works.</p>

<p>I have been studying very carefully in recent months various possibilities of relaxing restrictions. The difficulty is that any kind of work like this makes a demand on resources. If it is a modest piece of work, it is a modest demand, but it is still a demand. To free it in this way, to reduce the total allocation in this way, would create unfairness between one authority and another. All authorities have a great deal of work to do under this heading.</p>

<p>I am advised that many authorities organise their labour force in such a way that they are fully employed in the winter.

<p>I understand that the dates of the trade holidays for Leicester and Leicestershire were fixed after certain of the examination timetables were settled by the responsible examining authorities.

<p>I am grateful to the Minister of State for that detailed reply. Is he aware that the London University G.C.E.

I believe that that was the right way to go about it, because had we chosen the alternative suggested by my hon. Friend, it would have taken a great deal longer and would have required legislation. I believe that the course we have taken is by far the quickest method of trying to cure what is unsatisfactory in the situation. As to what may come out of this, I envisage that a national accrediting committee or body will be set up, and that the chairman and at least half the members should be appointed by me so that the independent members appointed by the Secretary of State will be in the majority on that body.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that on the basis of the previous Written Answer to me, which was of a similar type to the Answer which my hon. Friend has just given, he gave information to show that approximately only one in five of the children in the City of Newcastle are receiving the benefits of a grammar school education? Would he agree that there is no evidence to show that children in Newcastle are less intelligent than children in other cities which have a higher percentage of children attending grammar schools? Bearing this in mind, would my hon. Friend support


the actions of the L.E.A. in doing away with this outmoded system of the 11-plus segregation which is undermining the educational potential of children in that city?</p>

<p>To answer the first part of my hon. Friend's supplementary question, the information in the Answer which I will circulate will be in similar terms to the Answer to the previous Question to which my hon. Friend referred. My only difficulty was that the wording of the two Questions were slightly different. To answer his general point, I of course accept that children in Newcastle-upon-Tyne should be regarded as intelligent on average as children elsewhere. The difference between the number of children who are getting a grammar school education in different parts of the country is one of the examples of the absurdity of segregating children at the age of 11.</p>

<p>While admitting that this is really a very narrow Question, would the right hon. Gentleman not agree that it would be desirable to have more push in this direction, not only to take account of teachers who are just retiring but also of teachers who have retired for three or four years and who might be susceptible to such a direct approach, which might enable them to fill, say, a particular science vacancy? Would the Minister not agree that an approach of this sort might help to mitigate the problem?</p>

<p>I will consider the question whether any additional push on our part would be helpful. In general, local authorities are now fully seized of the seriousness of the teacher shortage problem. A great deal of pushing has been done by my Department in recent months and I am sure that the great majority of authorities now know the serious position they have on their hands.</p>

<p>The question of full pay, pensions and so on was raised in the debate on 30th April, when I said, as I have said on other occasions, that I have a great deal of sympathy with the teachers' case here.

<p>No, Sir. As my hon.

I believe that this can be done most effectively within the local education authority system under arrangements providing for proper academic freedom.</p>

<p>We are doing the preparatory work and are about to set up a study group on the whole question of advanced work, in particular in the regional colleges and the whole technical college sphere, as well as to consider whether any changes are needed in the general structure.

<p>Would the right hon.

Would he not further agree that one gets a little fed up with a great deal of comment in the Press and elsewhere suggesting that no higher educational institution can be of national standing if it remains within the ambit of a local education authority? Would the Minister not agree that this is not true and make it plain that such views are not held by the overwhelming majority of hon. Members on either side of this House?</p>

<p>I agree most strongly with the latter point made by the right hon. Gentleman. Anybody who has had the pleasure, as I have had in recent months, of going around and looking at both the technical colleges and colleges of education must get the incredibly strong impression of the enormous vigour, energy and experience which local authorities have put into the higher education system. Like the right hon. Gentleman, I feel strongly that it is

not only important that we have a considerable sector of higher education under local control but that local authorities should maintain a considerable stake in higher education.</p>

<p>I am entirely in favour of adopting the best practice which is most suitable for the mid-20th century, but I should not like to go into more detail at the moment, if my hon.

<p>The hon. Member may have forgotten the very long exchanges we had on this at Question time on 9th February in which I stated our policy. This was the basis on which I spoke in Germany on my visit, both to the German Government and to the German Press. We hope to make further progress on this matter as part of proposals for arms control in that area. We have not changed our policy at all on this matter, but the hon.

<p>Clearly this is a very difficult matter. Can the Prime Minister say whether the Minister for

Disarmament is following up the plan for placing observers in the N.A.T.O. and Warsaw Pact areas, which always seemed the most likely preliminary to some thinning out of forces on either side?</p>

<p>Yes, indeed, he has and we hope to go further on the matter of arms control and some agreed withdrawal on both sides of the Iron Curtain of conventional troops, quite apart from the nuclear situation.

<p>I said in the House once, as I said in Bonn, and I am sure we all agree, that any progress towards German reunification and many of the other things to which the Germans attach so much importance, as we do, must depend on a detente in Europe.

<p>I do not want to ask the right hon.

<p>I am glad the right hon. Gentleman raised that question. The Russian reply is in terms that they have no responsibility for the fighting; they are not parties to the fighting and they believe it is a question of the Mission having discussions with the countries directly concerned. Of course, there are three involved and there is the Vietcong as well.<br/>
As far as Co-chairmen are concerned, it was the view of most of us at the Prime Ministers' Conference that we want to be able to establish the conditions in which, first, a conference can be held and, secondly, we hope a cease-fire can be organised. Certainly I agree, and most of my colleagues agree, that the right machinery for convening that conference would be the Co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference. This has a continuing responsibility, and we were very anxious as early as February or March, when Mr. Gromyko was here, to activate the two Co-chairmen into calling a conference themselves. This did not prove possible. I do not think we can stand aside. We believe there is agreement between the two Co-chairmen, and this is one of the most important reasons compelling us to take the action now.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend about this.

Members want to titter about the fact that this multi-racial Commonwealth, representing all points of view and alignments except Communist ones, inevitably has different views about responsibility for the situation in Vietnam. So far from being a weakness, this is a strength because a mission undertaken on behalf of the whole Commonwealth, aligned to no particular interpretation of the fighting in Vietnam, can be a very powerful force for securing mediation, particularly at a time when tragically it is not possible for the United Nations itself to intervene.</p>

Friend that the use of the Geneva Conference might be a more hopeful means of bringing about a negotiation, the Leader of

the Opposition having described that proposal a few months ago, when it was made by some of my hon. Friends and myself, as a cowardly proposal? May it not be, having changed his mind so remarkably, that there is something in the idea after all?</p>

<p>I think these issues are far too important to be made the subject of exchanges across the House. I think it has been the wish of all of us to secure the activation of the Co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, and all we have been doing&#x2014;we have been working very hard on this as a Government&#x2014;is to see how that can be achieved. The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that at the end of the day this should be convened by the Co-chairmen. I have some little doubt about his speech yesterday when he referred to the Laos situation. As he knows, it took two years to get that settled in more favourable circumstances than we face today in Vietnam. I am sure that he and the House will agree that the dangers arising from the situation in Vietnam are so urgent that we had to make this highly unconventional approach, or any other approach that lies to hand, to try to get the parties together.</p>

<p>I agree with the Prime Minister as long as from now on he will make the necessary preparations&#x2014;because one has to prepare these matters behind the scenes very carefullyx2014;before any real conference can take place on this kind of matter.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree with the right hon. Gentleman. But we have been in the closest touch with the Soviet Government for many months now, and I am sorry to say that up to now this has not proved productive. Those preparations were going on all the time. The problem was how to get people to come round a table, and this is what we are trying to do. I agree that it was an unconventional approach. I think that when the right hon. Gentleman ponders about this he will realise that any other approach would not have been possible. There are so many difficulties that if we had given prior notice of this in certain countries or if there had been a lot of informal soundings in advance, I believe that certain things


would have started up which would have made it still more difficult to get this Mission established.</p>

<p>Does the Prime Minister realise that very many people in this country and, I believe, throughout the world will rejoice that the Mission intends to pursue its task, and will he represent to those who may be concerned that any persons in China or elsewhere who seek to question the fact that the Mission will be acting in good faith and in the interests of humanity as a whole will only call in question their own good faith and will lose in the estimation of those who have tried to make good and friendly relations with them?</p>

<p>I thank my right hon Friend. I made clear last Thursday evening that I did not underrate the enormous difficulties&#x2014;none of us does&#x2014;and if we are disappointed&#x2014;I hope we shall not be&#x2014;in terms of an immediate mission going out to the capitals concerned, we have decided that we shall stay in being to take advantage of a more favourable change in the climate or tide at any time and we shall be prepared to go. Certainly there is a widespread realisation now that the problem in South Vietnam, with all its dangers, will not be solved by military means alone. Those who think purely in terms of victory are, I think, facing a very difficult situation and there must be a move of people round the conference table. I know that this is realised in some parts of the world. I hope it will be realised by everyone who has any responsibility for the continuation of the fighting.</p>

<p>Can my right hon. Friend say when we are to have a debate on Vietnam, and particularly on Motion No. 260 on the Order Paper on preconditions for peace in Vietnam, which puts forward constructive proposals for peace there.<br/>
[<i>That this House, desirous of helping the Vietnamese people to secure the peace with independence, sovereign equality, security and justice which along with other formerly dependent nations, they were promised in Article 2 of the United Nations Charter and which was specifically pledged to Vietnam in the Final Declaration of the 1954 Geneva Conference, to which Her Majejsty's Government adhered, calls upon Her Majesty's Government to endorse and act upon the following proposals as essential pre-conditions to the success of any peace initiative, based, as U Thant has repeatedly said it must be and as the main parties have already agreed, on the essential principles of the Geneva Agreements on Vietnam, namely, a re-affirmation of the British Government's support for the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity; and essential unity; of the State of Vietnam as one nation in fact and law;</i>

<i>the official recognition by Her Majesty's Government of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, formed in September, 1945, as a stable, independent govenment, constituted in accordance with the principles and practice of international law, and entitled to enter into official relations with the representatives of other sovereign states and to adhere to valid international agreements; the immediate establishment of full reciprocal diplomatic relations between Her Majesty's Government and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on the understanding that the de facto authority of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam extends at present from the frontier with China and Laos to the military demarcation line on the 17th parallel; the suspension of British recognition of any governmental authority south of the 17th parallel until such time as a new government has been formed with the participation of the South Vietnam Liberation Front and other popularly-based political forces; the withdrawal by Great Britain and the other members of the Commonwealth of any assistance (direct or indirect, military or political or diplomatic) to any regime in South Vietnam which is not clearly based on popular support; and the cessation of the landing of United States and other foreign forces in Vietnam and complete cessation of United States or other foreign air or naval attacks against any part of Vietnam.</i>]<br/>
and also on Motion No. 264,<br/>
[<i>That this House congratulates the Leader of the Opposition on his frankness in publicly admitting that his long opposition to the recall of the 1954 Geneva Conference to deal with the problems of Vietnam was misconceived and has failed ignominiously to check the revolt of the Vietnamese people against the violation of the Geneva Agreements and of the Final Declaration by the Great Powers, to cement the Anglo-American alliance, or to divide the Communist alliance.</i>]<br/>

[<i>That this House is of the opinon that immediate action should be taken to bring Parliamentary procedure and the conduct of Government into line with modern developments; takes note that the protracted consideration of the Finance Bill and the subsequent all-night sittings which this has created, together with the archaic procedure which prevented for three hours the Prime Minister, on Thursday, 17th June, from making a statement of international importance, are two recent examples of the failure of the present system; and considers that it is useless for the Government, Opposition and Members of Parliament to call for the modernisation of Great Britain and the streamlining of trade unions and industry whilst themselves trying to carry on under a system which was evolved over 700 years and much of which has not yet reached the twentieth century; that this House therefore calls for immediate action to improve this and regards the protracted deliberations in the Committee of Procedure as not sufficiently speedy or drastic to meet modern demands; and urges that the following proposals should be dealt with as a matter of urgency: that the House should now meet in the morning on Tuesday. Wednesday and Thursday, and that the Parliamentary timetable should be revised accordingly to exclude any sittings later than 10 p.m., but that Standing Committees should continue to meet at their present times; that all major Bills should be taken upstairs in Committee and not on the Floor of the House; that Specialist Committees charged with the consideration of both legislation and broad administration of policy should immediately be introduced on an experimental basis; that the voting procedure is archaic and time-wasting and should be urgently reviewed and a method utilising modern techniques should be introduced, in order to make unnecessary the transport of sick Members to the Lobbies; that all speeches should be subject to a time limit extendable at the will of the House; that facilities in the House</i>


<i>of Commons for Members are far below the required standard to carry out their duties efficiently; and that until it is possible in the long term to provide a new seat of Government designed for this purpose there should be very urgent steps taken to provide Members with separate office accommodation, hostel accommodation and far greater research facilities.</i>]</p>

<p>Yes, Sir; I have given this further consideration. As I said last Thursday, there are many precedents for a casting vote being given when there is a dead heat on business normally.

<p>Reverting to matters to be put before the Select Committee on Procedure, may I ask the Leader of the House whether his attention has been drawn to Motion No. 255, with reference to proceedings on the Highlands and Islands Development (Scotland) Bill? As I recollect, the right hon. Gentleman was present in the Chamber on that occasion, and I am sure that he will agree that the situation was extremely unfortunate.<br/>
The Prime Minister was here, seeking to make a statement, and this adversely affected the debate. This is the sort of thing which might happen next week. The same kind of situation might arise at any time. Will the right hon. Gentleman say whether this matter is definitely being referred to the Select Committee of Procedure?<br/>
[<i>That this House regrets that there was no adequate procedure to enable the Prime Minister to intervene during the Report stage of the Highlands and Islands Development (Scotland) Bill for the purpose of making a statement of national importance concerning Vietnam and calls on Her Majesty's Government to refer this matter to the Committee on Procedure; and further regrets that those honourable Members who entered the Chamber to hear the Prime Minister's statement and remained in anticipation of it, while not infringing the strict rules of procedure, should by their attitude of manifest disinterest have adversely affected the conduct of the debate on the Highlands and Islands Development (Scotland) Bill.</i>]</p>

<p>I have looked at this point. I think that there is a case for discussion to take place probably through the usual channels in the first place about a new Standing Order which would permit a Prime Minister to make a statement at any time on an urgent matter of international or national importance without interrupting a debate.<br/>
This is not the first occasion when this sort of thing has happened, and I do not for a moment suggest that the Clerks of the House who would have advised Mr. Speaker at the time were at fault.

<p>May I put this point to the Leader of the House? He will recall that, recently, in a case which indirectly concerned myself and which an hon.

<p>The right hon. Gentleman will recall that the matter he referred to arose out of a Report of the Committee of Privileges following a complaint of privilege, a very different

matter. If any Government could be asked to supply time when any Member felt that he had been injured by an early-day Motion, we should never get away from it and we should discuss precious little else.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am the hon. Member referred to in the Motion tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Carlton (Sir K.

<p>I suppose that if he asks my permission and submitted it, an hon. Member in this situation might make a personal statement&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] It might be so. I am not committing myself one way or the other, but since the hon. Member was asking whether that was the only remedy, I had to include it. On the other hand, it is only fair to point out that the personal statement would have to be of a non-controversial character. That might create difficulty.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Is it not the case that when a hostile Motion, early day or of any other type, appears on the Order Paper, and an hon. Member disagrees with its terms, it is a relatively simple matter for him to table an Amendment to it?</p>

<p>Further to the point of order, Mr. Speaker. I know that the Leader of the House will understand the importance of this point. Does he appreciate that it is a false point to say that the original question was connected with a matter of privilege? That matter of privilege had been disposed of by the Chair.<br/>
It was after that that the Leader of the House, because his hon. Friend thought that there was an attack upon him, thought it right to provide a small amount&#x2014;two or three hours&#x2014;of Government time. If he will do that for an hon.

Member who is to move the first of this last series of new Clauses, as this is the last Committee day on the Finance Bill, with its long sittings and its many Amendments, I think that both sides of the Committee would like me to commend the servants of the House for their very faithful service during the long Committee stage of the Bill, especially the OFFICIAL REPORTERS, for dealing and coping with highly complex debates.<br/>
Above all, I would wish to commend the printers, who, night by night, have had to cope with the Notice Paper.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The purpose of the Clause is to give some relief, a very small relief, to people who voluntarily save, on a basis rather similar to those who quite involuntarily reach advanced years, and also on a similar basis to the so-called earned income relief. It is couched in very modest terms. I have already received one letter from a correspondent in Edinburgh who complains about the niggardly


nature of my Clause and comments that he assumes that I must mean &#x00A3;450 instead of &#x00A3;45. I can only conclude that in Edinburgh they are much more concerned with the thrifty than perhaps we are here.<br/>
Nevertheless, the Clause is deliberately couched in modest terms as a start in what we think is the right direction. We have borne in mind the terror of the Government lest any benefit should be given to rich men by including in the Clause an anti-tycoon proviso to exclude people whose total taxable income is more than &#x00A3;3,000. We have in mind the need to assuage the suspicions of the Financial Secretary who suspects that there is a Surtax-payer lurking behind the skirts of every small man. We hope that that aspect will not be an objection to the Clause by the Government as it has so often been an objection before.<br/>
The Clause is designed as an initial symbol that thrift and savings are desirable and, indeed, necessary qualities in our country today. It is designed to help the many people who are not necessarily in pension schemes, people who desire to help themselves and provide for their future, and who do not, unlike those in pension schemes, get any tax relief at the moment. It is not only intended to be a small but immediate relief to them; it is intended as a symbol to encourage people who do not save to believe that it is worth their while to do so, and to show them that the Government think that people who save should be encouraged rather than condemned for doing so.<br/>
The fundamental principles underlying the Clause are these. First, if we are to expand without inflation, the savings of our people as a whole are absolutely vital and must come from the broad mass of the community. Secondly, we believe that it is socially desirable to spread wealth and encourage people to prepare for their old age without blind reliance upon State or other pension schemes.<br/>
Furthermore, the Clause is intended to repair some of the damage which has been done to these concepts by the Bill so far. Investment and unit trusts, which are very much the small man's medium of savings, have been dealt very serious blows in the Bill; investment clubs have been neglected entirely. I have tried at a number of stages in the Bill to relieve

the damage which has been done and to soften some of the blows, but I regret to say that my efforts have proved completely abortive.<br/>
The new Clause is my very last hope of salvaging something out of the wreckage of savings that the Bill has created. I pin my faith upon the protestations of belief in the small investor and the small man which has been made by a number of members of the Government, most notably by the Chief Secretary, who, I know, holds these views very sincerely, and by a number of his supporters, most vocally by the hon. Member for Manchester, Cheetham (Mr. Harold Lever). There are many others who tacitly support these views.<br/>
I pin my faith on this Clause because encouragement to people to save is not intended merely as a hedge against inflation, laudable though that may be. It goes deep into the roots of our economic structure. It is deeply concerned with ideas of freedom, individual responsibility and independence. There are very many people in this country who regard it as their duty independently, on their own, to provide for their future and their old age. This is something which should not be condemned. It is a sturdy independence which should be encouraged by the Government, and the Government should be seen to be encouraging it. That is the purpose of the Clause.<br/>
In addition, the Clause could have a profound effect upon our incomes policy as a whole. I want to draw the attention of the Committee in general and the Government, in particular, to what has just happened in Germany. They have recently passed what they call "A 312 Mark Law." Under that law 25 million wage-earners will earn full tax relief on &#x00A3;28 per annum, provided that the sum is invested over five years. The idea behind this move is to break the wage-price inflationary spiral, which is entirely in keeping with our own ideas of an incomes policy.<br/>
To give an example, the German building workers have recently negotiated a new agreement in which employers and employees each contribute to an investment fund which after 40 years will provide an investment fund for each individual worker of about &#x00A3;4,000. I am pleased to see the First Secretary present, because some of these remarks


are intended for him and to give him some ideas for his incomes policy. This scheme is a check upon inflation by channelling some of the extra earnings back into production rather than into the purchase of consumer goods.<br/>
What is happening in Germany is something which I commend not only to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but to the First Secretary. It will cost the Germans a great deal of money&#x2014;&#x00A3;400 million per annum. They think that it is worth it. I do not believe that my new Clause would cost an enormous sum of money, but I certainly think it a worth-while proposal. Will the Chief Secretary tell us how much it will cost the Treasury? I do not believe that it will be much. It is a logical progression with the idea of giving encouragement to investment and savings&#x2014;a progression which starts with the idea of welfare for all, moves on, as our society becomes more prosperous, to houses for all, and then moves on now and in the future to shares for all.<br/>
The Government must make up their mind whether they want wealth to be concentrated entirely in the hands of the State or whether they accept that we are still primarily a free capitalist society. If they accept the latter, and if they want to make the free enterprise society a success, they must realise that the savings and investment of the people form an integral part of that system. I very much hope that the Government will accept the Clause. Some of the figures are rather arbitrary, but if the Government do not like the wording of the Clause I hope that at least they will undertake to bring forward a proposal along these lines on Report.<br/>
Unless they can offer some promise of incentive for people to save, a slight softening of the blows which have been inflicted upon the saver by the Finance Bill, some relief for the thrifty, some encouragement towards wider share ownership, not only are the Government in danger of putting our economic future in jeopardy, not only will they fail to bring relief to many worthy, needy and very responsible members of our community, but they may be losing a great opportunity to ensure that we remain competitive and free in the modern world. I move the Clause as a very small chink

of light to lead us towards the end of our economic tunnel.</p>

<p>I should like briefly to support my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Grant) in this new Clause. I hope that it will command the sympathy of the Chief Secretary for the point which I have in mind, which is that it would encourage the small saver and particularly the industrial worker who&#x2014;I do not want to make a political point&#x2014;in recent years has been better able to put a little aside to make himself independent and to stimulate the old virtue of thrift and independence. As the Chief Secretary is aware, there has been a changing pattern. In years gone by those who were able to save usually chose the method of the Post Office or National Savings Certificates&#x2014;in the City of Birmingham we added the Municipal Bank to that&#x2014;and they received encouragement because the first &#x00A3;l5 of investment income was free of tax through the Post Office or the Municipal Bank. I want to see the same principle extended to those who are looking for shares, mostly unit trusts, as a means of saving.<br/>
There has been considerable progress in this direction. The working man feels that he does not understand the Stock Exchange, or equities, but he can understand unit trusts; he feels that they will be safe for his savings. I know from my own experience that a number of Birmingham people have put their first savings into that kind of venture; indeed, the first shares that I myself ever bought were unit shares, and I have commended this method of saving to other people as a way of beginning to save in a modest way.<br/>
It is for these reasons that I should like to see this impetus towards investment, which adds in a modest way to the prosperity of our country, given encouragement by allowing this small amount of income to be free of Income Tax. The average unit trust investment is about &#x00A3;300, so that the income from this amount would come within the bracket suggested in the Clause. Because I want to see this good habit encouraged, I hope that the Chief Secretary will look sympathetically on the Clause.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1967.0" hansard_membership_id="4823" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15273" speakername="Mr. Ian Gilmour" colnum="1967" time="">
<p>I should like to support the new Clause which was so compellingly moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Grant) and cogently supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Dame Edith Pitt). Quite apart from all the other reasons for saving, it is important to try to channel the savings of the wage earning man into industry. This happens in America, and I am sure that the Chief Secretary envies the strength of the capital market in America even if he does not envy them the capitalist system there. No one could say that our capital market was particularly strong at present. Indeed, there would be a strong case for this new Clause in any year.<br/>
A proposal to this effect was put forward before the General Election by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr. Peter Walker) and myself in a pamphlet of which I need not remind the Chief Secretary, because he gave an extremely misleading quotation from it earlier in this Parliament. I therefore need not draw his attention to it again beyond pointing out that the idea proposed in the Clause has not been dreamed up while we are in opposition. It was put forward when the Conservative Party were in power, and it was also, like this Clause, put forward very modestly.<br/>
The need for the Clause has been very greatly increased by the economic situation over the last few months, and particularly by the Finance Bill. I do not know whether we are in a situation of inflationary-deflation or whether it should be called deflationary-inflation, but it is plain to some extent that we are getting the worst of both worlds. We have a credit squeeze, shortage of capital and rising prices, and there is an increasingly great need for savings and capital. The Government the other day had to offer 6&#x00BD; per cent. I am sure that the First Secretary wants to do anything he can to encourage increased savings. As my hon. Friend pointed out, this is not a proposal in respect of which the Government's obsession with tax avoidance could give them an excuse for rejecting it, because it has a built-in ceiling and, therefore, the tax avoidance mania which the Treasury Bench have shown on the Bill needs no outlet on this Clause.<br/>
The Chief Secretary knows the American example where the first 100

dollars investment income is tax-free. The Government have been a bit reluctant to follow the Americans' example when it leads to lower taxation. They have been inclined to follow their example only when it leads to higher taxation. On this occasion they could well change their ideas and follow what happens in America.<br/>
Savings have greatly prospered under Conservative Governments. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Cold-field (Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd) said in an earlier debate, the <i>Financial Times</i> now appears on the factory floor. This is a way in which we can see that it appears there more often. This is a test of the Government's intentions. They have protested that their intentions are good towards private enterprise and saving. If they are, I urge them to accept the new Clause. If they are not, I urge them to do their best to conceal their intentions, also by accepting this Clause.</p>

<p>I strongly support the new Clause. I should like to tell the Committee of the experience which I have derived as president of the Birmingham and District Wider Share Ownership Association. Our officers are giving lectures in a considerable number of factories in the Midlands and are finding that very great interest is being shown by industrial workers in the simple exposition of investment practice for new investors. Also, evening classes on the same subject run by local authorities have been extraordinarily popular.<br/>
I have consulted the officers and committee of the organisation to which I have referred. They are strongly in favour of the new Clause, and I should like to explain why. The effect of the Clause is to allow the first &#x00A3;10 of income from an investment&#x2014;this excludes people earning over &#x00A3;3,000 a year&#x2014;to be free of tax. It is interesting to realise what this would mean in capital terms. If people invested in a share yielding 5 per cent., &#x00A3;200 of savings would be involved. If they invested in a share which had greater capital appreciation prospects and a lower yield&#x2014;say 3 per cent.&#x2014;savings in the neighbourhood of &#x00A3;300 would be involved.<br/>
Can the industrial workers in the Midlands, with whom, like my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston


(Dame Edith Pitt), I am primarily concerned, afford to make this kind of investment? The doctrine not only of the Birmingham branch, but of the National Wider Share Ownership Association is that the first savings should be either in the Post Office, or, as in the case of the Midlands, in the Birmingham Muncipal Bank, which also has a concession about the first &#x00A3;15 of earnings being tax free. We regard this as the sheet-anchor of somebody who should be able to call immediately on liquid resources. When this has been done, there should be investment in equity shares. This is wise for the individual, and it has certain economic and social advantages.<br/>
I wish to address myself to the question whether the industrial worker can afford not only to put his first savings in the Post Office or in the Birmingham Municipal Bank, but to go on and invest in equity shares. I admit that in the Midlands wages in engineering are about &#x00A3;1 a week higher than those in the rest of the country. We are probably the pace setters in industrial wages and, we hope, productivity and this new kind of investment. Therefore, what we can achieve in the Midlands is particularly important, because we hope that later it will be copied by the rest of the country.<br/>
Many wages in Birmingham are between &#x00A3;15 and &#x00A3;20 a week, but a tremendous number of men earn between &#x00A3;20 and &#x00A3;25. A substantial number earn between &#x00A3;25 and &#x00A3;30. I do not want to be misunderstood on this point, but a considerable number of men in industry in the Midlands earn between &#x00A3;30 and &#x00A3;40. I have taken pains, during the last few days, to inquire about this matter. I know that polishers in anodised aluminium who are working on window trims, and so on, for motor cars, admittedly with heavy overtime and long hours, are earning &#x00A3;40 a week.<br/>
I am not suggesting that enormous numbers of people in Birmingham are earning this, but I assert without fear of contradiction that there are some earning &#x00A3;40 a week, which is about &#x00A3;2,000 a year. I have inquired what proportion of workers engaged, for example, in the preparation of aluminium components for motor cars are earning this amount. In a works of about 150 workpeople of which I know, there are six polishers

earning this sort of money. The Committee can form its own impression from this fact.<br/>
Are these people, who clearly can afford to invest, doing so? The answer, broadly, is, "No". They have been brought up in a working class tradition. In the past it has not been the habit of the working class, as my hon. Friend the Member for Edgbaston says with all her experience, to invest in equity shares. It was thought that this was only for the rich or the middle classes. Also, it is so much simpler for them to go in for other forms of saving, particularly in the Post Office or the building societies. This is where the concession is extremely important. People know that, because of the concession made in respect of Post Office savings, the first &#x00A3;15 in interest means that they have &#x00A3;15 to their credit. As a result of the arrangements which have been made between building societies and the Revenue, people know that, whatever the interest on building society deposits, perhaps 4 per cent., they will get it and that they do not have to indulge in complicated man&#x0153;uvres to claim back tax.<br/>
Therefore, it is very important, in our view&#x2014;and I feel sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Edgbaston, with her great knowledge of working-class psychology, would agree with this&#x2014;that we should give this concession and let it be known that Parliament wishes to encourage this type of investment, just as it let it be known in 1956 when the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the concession in respect of Post Office Savings that that was something which Parliament wished to encourage.<br/>
But we would need the Revenue's co-operation in a way which is possible. Once the investor had established with the inspector of taxes that he had investment income, the deduction should be made automatically under P.A.Y.E. and should be confirmed by submitting dividend vouchers at the end of the year. The Revenue, I hope, would be willing to assume that he retained the income throughout the year, but if he did not and failed to notify the sale, the Revenue could always reclaim its tax in succeeding P.A.Y.E. instalments.<br/>
I have consulted distinguished firms of accountants on this matter and they feel, from their knowledge of the way in


which the P.A.Y.E. system works, that it would be possible for the Revenue to do this. The Chief Secretary will, I am sure, realise that this is something of considerable importance. We feel that it would simplify the initial investment by industrial workers in equity shares. Every working man, as he becomes more prosperous and as he has, in the American phrase, sufficient discretionary income to engage in this form of saving, has to make a personal breakthrough from the old habits of thrift and to add this new method of saving to his way of life. That is why it is very important that Parliament should encourage it and the Revenue should co-operate in establishing a system which makes it simple for him. The last thing such a man is is a financier. He is a practical man with his hands who has some savings and does not want to engage in complicated arrangements for reclaiming tax.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
Under the Clause, instead of his being in a position where if he got, say, &#x00A3;5 on investment income, tax would be deducted at the standard rate and he would have to make a reclaim. He would, for the first &#x00A3;200 or &#x00A3;300 of savings, get &#x00A3;10 with the minimum of complications. This system could economically be of considerable importance to the country, because it can be seen from the figures I have quoted that the sums involved in these wage rates can become considerable as a source of savings. The Revenue could help by giving us more figures as to the numbers of people receiving different ranges of income. I believe, indeed, that it already produces a certain number of such figures.<br/>
If the Government agreed to do this they would be doing something of considerable importance in the context of our social and economic development. Since the war, particularly during the years of great prosperity under the Conservative Government, we have been seeing the working class assuming middle-class habits and, in effect, becoming middle class. I remember being laughed at soon after the war by Socialists when I suggested that washing machines would be in every home within a few years. We have long got far beyond that. We have cars, Continental holidays and home ownership, and what is proposed now in

this Clause is a further example of the process.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, Central (Mr. Ian Gilmour) referred to what is taking place in America. According to the American correspondent of <i>The Times,</i> there are 20 million shareholders in the United States, a threefold increase in the last 10 years. We have also heard about developments in Germany. Perhaps it hurts us a little to feel that the Germans should be in advance of us in this, but we must remember that the idea of social insurance itself came from Germany, where it was introduced by Bismarck towards the end of his life, and we have developed it here. It was not a specifically English idea in origin and we should not be too proud to look at the experience of other nations.<br/>
I hope that the Government will accept the Clause.</p>

<p>I am pleased to support my right hon. and hon. Friends who are associated with the Wider Share Ownership movement. I am not directly associated with it, but I am convinced of its valuable work. I hope that the new Clause will receive very careful consideration. It has been rightly said that the financial effect involved would be small, but it should not be regarded as a token Amendment, for it is much more than that. It is a step forward in principle of very great importance.<br/>
It might not be inappropriate for me to say that this provides the opportunity for the Government to make clear to the Committee and to those outside interested in savings their attitude towards small savers and small investors. When we discussed Clauses 34 and 63 we were, unfortunately, unable really to achieve anything, certainly for investment trusts, and now it must be admitted that we have achieved very little for the small investor.<br/>
I hope, Dr. King, that you will not think it improper or inappropriate, for it is relevant, if I refer to the unfortunate misunderstanding between the Chief Secretary and me on the question of the Government's attitude towards savings. I think that the right hon. Gentleman will agree with me that it arose largely from the fact that I said I had written a letter to him and he said that he had not received it. Naturally, just as he said that


his arrangements for dealing with correspondence are highly efficient, I like to think that my arrangements, although not of an official character, are also extremely efficient and perhaps some hon. Members will know why I have a rather personal feeling about that.<br/>
The Chief Secretary has sent me now a most courteous letter in which he says he has discovered that my letter was sent, was passed to the Inland Revenue and, owing to great pressure of correspondence in that Department, took several days to reach its destination. Had he received the letter earlier, he would have had notice of the points I intended to raise and much of the misunderstanding, I believe, would have been removed. I also believe that, at the time, he had an unfortunate impression of the effect of what I had said. However, on reading HANSARD he was able to see that there was no hard feeling on my part.<br/>
I hope and believe, therefore, that it may be possible for the right hon. Gentleman and me to continue the friendly relations we have always had and that this will assist in making clear that my chief interest in this matter is to help the small investor who, I believe, can make a very important contribution to the future of the country.</p>

<p>We have spent many days and long nights discussing details of highly complicated legislation recently and it is appropriate than on this last day we should have a chance to discuss this very important proposal. I warmly support the new Clause. A great deal has been said, from this side of the Committee, about the encouragement of savings and every one on both sides wishes to encourage them. Therefore, we hope that the right hon. Gentleman, in half-term holiday mood, may feel that he can accept this Clause.<br/>
As I understand, this would give relief not only to those intending to save, but also to those who have already saved and who are perhaps living in retirement on a fixed income. I support the Clause strongly because, if there is one group of persons who, in an age of ever-increasing prosperity, have found their real income declining, it is those relying on fixed incomes.<br/>
In earlier times, when we had less of the Welfare State, many people saved to

make provision for their retirement but now find that the fixed incomes from their investments are buying less and less. These are the real victims of inflation. Any relief that can be given from Income Tax should be given to them. A very large number of people in my constituency write to me about the problems of inflation and particularly about rising rates. It is extremely difficult for them to face the last years of their lives in hardship as their real income steadily declines.<br/>
I also urge support of the Clause because, some time ago, we failed in our attempt to get through a Private Member's Bill to assist old age non-pensioners. The Government did not see fit to enable that Bill to come before the House. I know a number of people, over 80 and living on very small fixed incomes from investments, who have no relief. Many of them supported the Labour Party in the expectation of receiving an incomes guarantee. As far as one can see, it is probable that the incomes guarantee scheme will not, in fact, be introduced until 1967. Therefore, there is again a strong reason for the Committee to support the new Clause.<br/>
Finally, with the introduction of the Corporation Tax, it has become clear that people who live on investment income from companies that make most or some of their profits overseas will find that those companies will have to reduce their dividends. That will result in very real hardship to some people living on fixed incomes on whose behalf I now speak. If they are to suffer, the least the Government can do is to introduce some compensating measure that will do something to offset the effect of the Corporation Tax on this group.<br/>
It has been said that the Government must take stronger action against' people living on big investment incomes. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Grant) has been very careful to ensure that the provisions of the new Clause do not cover those people&#x2014;though the Chief Secretary might reasonably say that the limit in the new clause is set too high. In this case, if he liked to reduce the limit while accepting the new Clause, we would still be grateful. In the Clause we have excluded from relief those living on large investment incomes. We seek some compensation for those on small


investment incomes who are now suffering more than any other group in the community.</p>

<p>I hope that it will be thought convenient that I should now reply, having regard to the great deal of business which, I gather, it is the desire of both sides to get through in the course of the day.<br/>
First, Dr. King, may I associate myself with your remarks about the assistance the Committee has received from those who have all the dreary labour of listening to what has been said and none of the fun of participating in it. We recognise the tremendous help they have been to us, and we are very happy that you should have thought fit to start the proceedings with a word of tribute and appreciation.<br/>
On a personal note, I am also most grateful to the right hon. and learned Member for Chertsey (Sir L. Heald) for his courteous remarks and for the obvious sympathy with which he made them. I assure him that if there was any misunderstanding, it is completely removed. The right hon. and learned Gentleman was, as he knows, the Member of Parliament for the constituency in which I lived. I did not then disclose to him which way I voted, and I do not propose to do so now, so as to avoid raising the temperature.<br/>
The debate has partly referred to what I might call "hard cases"&#x2014;the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) referred particularly to them. Therefore, perhaps I might start by describing very shortly the three ways in which hard cases in this field are already dealt with. First, there is age relief. That deals with the investment income of people who are over 65, and gives to them, within limits, the earned income relief that is proposed in this new Clause. Then we have the small income relief. That deals with people below 65 years of age, and provides that where their income is not above certain limits they, again, get earned income relief on investment income. We therefore have two cases in which, already, earned income relief is granted on investment income&#x2014;for those below 65 where the total amount is small,

and for those above 65, again within limits.<br/>
Further, we have an age exemption relief which gives complete exemption for taxpayers over 65 who have small incomes. They do not pay any tax at all provided that their income does not exceed certain figures. Those figures are being increased by the Bill, so that a married couple over 65 years of age with an income of &#x00A3;12 a week will be completely exempt. Therefore, I suggest that, on the ground of hardship the situation is, by and large, reasonably met.<br/>
4.45 p.m.<br/>
The hon. Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Grant) moved the Clause more in terms of saving, and many speakers have concentrated on that aspect. That being so, perhaps I may be allowed to repeat what I have said many times&#x2014;many times from that side of the Committee as a back bencher and, perhaps more relevantly, from this side in my present capacity.<br/>
Savings are to be encouraged in every possible way&#x2014;large savings, small savings. Every additional pound that an individual saves is a direct contribution, may be, to the building of a hospital, or to something else to which the individual concerned does not realise he is contributing. But, by his saving, he is making that possible. If the taxpayer wishes us to contribute more in overseas aid, then, apart from the exchange problem, the very fact of his saving makes that possible.<br/>
So there is every possible inducement to encourage people to save, both from the point of view of Government policy and from my own view. Speaking personally&#x2014;this is not a Government remark, but a personal one&#x2014;I think that saving is in every sense encouraging to the character of the individual, and wholly to be recommended from whatever point of view one looks at it. So there is no doubt where we stand about encouraging saving.<br/>
The question that arises is: what is the best method of encouraging small savings? Is the method proposed in the Clause the appropriate one? I must say that that method suffers from a very considerable defect. It rests on a blurring of the distinction between earned income and unearned income. It does not deal


with any question of hardship, as with the three cases I have dealt with&#x2014;old age, the person who was ill, and, therefore, could not earn income, but had to rely only on unearned income, or the person who, after pensionable age, did not have a pension because, for some reason or other, was not able to earn it during the period of ordinary livelihood and, therefore, had to rely on unearned income only.<br/>
The Clause does not deal with any of those cases, but opens the door very wide, and says that every moderate saver, every person with a moderate amount of investment income&#x2014;the amount referred to is about &#x00A3;1,000&#x2014;should have a benefit in the form of earned income relief. I do not take the view that this is a method of encouraging saving. There are many methods&#x2014;the Government have announced some, and others are under consideration&#x2014;but I do not think that this is the right way to encourage savings.<br/>
I find it very difficult to see why this burden of taxation&#x2014;small, admittedly; the Clause would cost about &#x00A3;10 million&#x2014;should to that extent be removed broadly from the shoulders of those who do not earn to those who have earned income. For those main reasons, and without going into the subject at greater length, I cannot recommend the Committee to accept the Clause.</p>

<p>I think that what I have to say is very much in order. Having heard the Chief Secretary's reply, I do not hesitate to say that if I still lived in

his constituency I would work very hard to get rid of him.<br/>
The general lack of detailed argument in the right hon. Gentleman's reply showed how very thin his case was. One has noticed during our Committee proceedings that if the right hon. Gentleman is on a weak point he endeavours to repeat the opposite to his point with great passion and sincerity. If we point out that the Corporation Tax is complicated, we are told that it is simple. If we point out that the Government do nothing about savings, the right hon. Gentleman points out his desire to help savings, and then says why he will not help in that direction today. This has been typical of the right hon. Gentleman's method of arguing this afternoon.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Grant) produced very cogent economic and social arguments for the acceptance of the Clause, economic arguments, further developed by my hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, Central (Mr. Ian Gilmour), as to the importance of a healthy and vigorous capital market in this country. The one way in which we shall substantially improve the capital market in this country is to harness the considerable incomes of the great majority of the people into that capital market. There are many problems and tasks before those concerned with the operation of channelling this money into savings. There is obviously the task of simplifying the procedures and there is also the task of persuading people to go in for new forms of savings.<br/>
The main difficulty for the present small saver going into most equity investments is the Income Tax deducted at the source. In future, there will also be the application of Corporation Tax. For this reason, there is a hesitancy on the part of those on lower rates of tax to go in for this kind of saving, and because of this very fact there is some justification for certain taxation incentives being given to them.<br/>
There is also the very strong argument for encouraging savings because of the present inflationary tendencies in the economy. Only this week, the Government have announced in a Written Answer that since they have been in office the purchasing value of the &#x00A3; has gone down from &#x00A3;1 to 19s. 2d., an indication of the strong inflationary pressures


which currently exist. A very topical illustration of the need to take money out in savings is the announcement only within the last 48 hours that there is not to be an increase in London Transport's fares.<br/>
There has been an increase in wages, so that much more money is to be put into the economy to increase demand. It would be very fine for the Government if that increase in demand resulting from the considerable wage increases now taking place were to be diverted into savings. I am sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be delighted if that were the case. If the Government want to encourage savings to a greater level, they have to do something about it and not just exhort people to save without some distinct incentive.<br/>
What we are asking for is not a revolutionary or outstandingly new principle. This is a method which is used in many countries where the capitalist system, the free enterprise system, exists. Many hon. Members will be aware that in the United States, for example, the first 100 dollars of income from investments is tax-free, and that is 100 dollars for the man and 100 dollars for his wife, which can be put together so that the total relief for the family is 200 dollars tax-free income from investments.<br/>
Any person connected with the investment industry in the United States will agree that one of the reasons why the United States has been so successful about providing the colossal volume of capital needed for its expanding economy is that it has been able to attract into industry the savings of the great mass of the people in the United States. To a large extent this has been done by distinct and considerable tax incentives for the wage earner. By supporting the Clause we would be taking a considerable step forward in giving that direct encouragement.<br/>
There is also the social aspect of the Clause, dealt with by my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Dame Edith Pitt) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd) and particularly emphasised by my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), who, as we know, has a

considerable population in his constituency living on fixed incomes and who is well aware of the problems. I do not think that my hon. Friend will be particularly satisfied with the response of the Chief Secretary, who took the view that there was no longer any real problem for these people. Any of us who know the plight of people on fixed incomes and living in retirement will know that there is still a real problem.<br/>
This Bill itself will go a considerable way to decreasing the incomes of these people because of the very nature of the Corporation Tax with its disincentive to distribution, which will mean that overall the level of dividends will be decreased. These people are dependent on the level of dividends.</p>

<p>Supposing that were true, as it may well be in many cases, is not this the very thing the hon. Gentleman wants&#x2014;the encouragement of corporate savings?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1980.1" hansard_membership_id="2341" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30685" speakername="Mr. Walker" colnum="1980" time="">
<p>If the Chief Secretary is now arguing that the way to encourage savings in future is to stop companies from distributing to shareholders, he will have a shock, because if the Government embark on the policy of attaining their savings, or largely doing so, not through people contributing part of their earning power to industry, but by the Government insisting through their taxation policies that those who invest should never receive proper rewards for their investments, there will be a great fall and not an increase in savings.<br/>
I am rather surprised that the Chief Secretary should suggest&#x2014;and perhaps this is the key to his complacency on this issue&#x2014;that the Government no longer want to encourage individuals to invest, but will insist that savings should be made within companies because of the impact of the Corporation Tax. That is a very dangerous policy to adopt and it will end in a great deal of difficulty for the whole free enterprise system.</p>

<p>I interrupt for a second time only because of the importance of what is said from the Dispatch Box and to make it perfectly clear that the Government are most anxious for every individual saver and for every corporate saver and for every saver of every possible kind to save more.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1981.0" hansard_membership_id="2341" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30685" speakername="Mr. Walker" colnum="1981" time="">
<p>This is a repeat performance by the Chief Secretary. Every time he makes a remark saying that he is to do nothing for the individual saver he says, "May repeat that I love individual savers?". A few moments ago he clearly made the point&#x2014;and the Committee heard it&#x2014;that the real way which the Government have in mind to encourage savings is out of corporate savings. He agreed that the people in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing would have lower incomes in future as a result of the Corporation Tax and that these people would either be discouraged from saving, or would suffer from lower incomes as a result.<br/>
What we are saying is that if in his endeavour to encourage corporate savings the Chief Secretary is lowering the incomes of the constituents of my hon. Friend, it is not unreasonable for him to accept the Clause to make some amends for the lowering of their incomes.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. Gentleman accepted the case when my right hon. Friend pointed out that the very small investment income holder did not pay any tax now?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1981.2" hansard_membership_id="2341" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30685" speakername="Mr. Walker" colnum="1981" time="">
<p>At no stage did I deny that. What I am saying&#x2014;and I know that the hon. Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett), with his considerable knowledge of these affairs, is well aware of it&#x2014;is that there are many people, particularly in constituencies like Worthing, who, although they get relief from the present Income Tax position, will, nevertheless, as a result of the Bill, have their incomes reduced because of the lower distribution of dividends, and the Clause would make some amends for that. That is beyond denial. If their incomes are over a certain level, they will obtain certain relief from the Clause.<br/>
There is the social aspect, mentioned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Edgbaston, of the importance of getting a wider spread of participation in industry, a kind of sense of ownership. Perhaps because for so long the political battle in this country has been between the advocates of the Socialist system and the advocates of the free enterprise system, those of us who want to see this spread of ownership throughout the country are constantly having to overcome basic

prejudices against profit and capital. It has been said that the difference between capital and savings is that if another man has a bank account that is capital, whereas if one has a bank account oneself, that is savings. It is time for a difference in the basic attitude.<br/>
If hon. Members opposite now recognise that whether they or we are in power the free enterprise sector of industry is of paramount importance, they must see that the taxation system encourages the maximum spread of ownership of British industry. They are not doing that now and still their prejudices are coming forward.<br/>
Earlier this afternoon we heard of further delays in the nationalisation of steel, as we had expected. A much better social way of obtaining the true participation in ownership of British industry is to encourage wider share ownership. This is a much better theme and one which our people would respond to far more than the Government's outdated proposals and nationalisation.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
During the course of the Bill there have been a series of blows to savings. We have had blows to the unit trusts investment, to the investment trust movement and to the life assurance method of saving. The cost of this new Clause is about &#x00A3;10 million, the Chief Secretary says. The cost of the increased savings taken directly from the policy holders of life assurance will be &#x00A3;23&#x00BD; million, so that in accepting the Clause the Chief Secretary would be making only small amends for the damage that he and his colleagues have done throughout the various stages of this Bill.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Bexley (Mr. Edward Heath) said during the Second Reading debate on this Bill, when condemning the fact that it did very little to help our existing economic problems, that the Bill had done nothing to stimulate competition and nothing to stimulate savings. We hoped that after the long debates that have taken place during the Committee stage, this Clause would at least give some opportunity to the Government to repent and make amends for the real damage that they have done to savings. Unfortunately, they have not taken the opportunity and I certainly hope my hon. Friends will divide the Committee.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1983.0" hansard_membership_id="5164" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31030" speakername="Mr. R. Gresham Cooke" colnum="1983" time="">
<p>Before we part with this Clause I would like to say something to the Chief Secretary which would apply particularly if he happened to be here another year. I have put down a new Clause to allow the first &#x00A3;15 of investment income to be free of tax and if it has been selected we will have a debate. My right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd) put down a new Clause about contractual savings and this year my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Grant) has taken up the banner and I hope that he will be successful this year and not 40 years on.<br/>
I had hoped that this year we would get much further because of the impetus given by Germany. Germany has always been very progressive in these matters of social security, such as helping the worker and the saver. Their scheme which, I believe, is called the 312 Mark Law, is worthy of serious study by Treasury officials.<br/>
I hope that within the Treasury there is no jealousy towards industrial savings. The Treasury helps savings in the Post Office by allowing &#x00A3;15 free of tax, the building societies by giving a lower rate of tax than the standard rate, but there is no assistance whatever given to this type of industrial savings. There are 10 million people in industry, many of them earning very good wages and becoming more and more interested in putting money back into industry, and the Treasury ought to do more to assist the man on the workshop floor.<br/>
I was rather sorry to hear the Chief Secretary talk about this new Clause as a blurring between earned and unearned income. Does that really matter? The interest we are talking about comes from saving from earned income on which the taxpayers have no tax incentive and I hope that next year the Treasury will see that these industrial savings are put on the same basis as building societies and Post Office savings and receive a tax incentive.</p>

<p>I sympathise with the idea behind the Clause to encourage new savings, but I cannot help feeling that its sponsors and the hon. and right hon. Members who have spoken in favour

of it are under a very serious misapprehension if they think that it will help.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd), in his speech, made it clear that it would complicate rather than simplify the matter. The major point he made was that the reasons why people were not investing in this way was largely because they received the interest net rather than gross as they do in the Post Office Savings Bank, the Trustees Savings Bank and so on.<br/>
I would have thought if we were to spend &#x00A3;10 million or some such figure by way of assistance to encourage savings we might consider giving the &#x00A3;10 million as a form of assistance to the unit trust movement in order to allow them to pay interest gross where required, as happens in the case of some finance companies whereby interest can be paid either gross or net. We could allow unit trusts to pay interest gross and give some allowance to the unit trust themselves as a contribution towards the additional administrative expenses in which they would be involved.<br/>
This would enable them to reclaim the tax to pay small unit trust owners the interest gross. I think that something along these lines would be a much greater form of encouragement to the small saver in particular, for he would then be able to see clearly the return he is obtaining, in the same way as applies when he invests in the Post Office or Trustee Savings Bank.</p>

<p>We are somewhat disappointed at the Chief Secretary's answer to the new Clause. I do not doubt his sincerity when he says the Government want to see more saving, but, as our Front Bench spokesman has already pointed out, their promise and performance do not always match in these matters.<br/>
I am becoming increasingly worried because I hear it said so often now by hon. Members on the Government side, perhaps in circles a little more to the left of the Chief Secretary, that what is aimed at is a state where people do not have any savings at all and that when they reach retirement they ought not to have any savings. Instead, they ought to draw a pension which would


enable them to live an adequate life. I hope that this is not Government policy, but I hear that view expressed so often that I think it is a trend in Labour Party circles.<br/>
It is a disappointment that we have not had this very modest concession made today. My information is that savings are falling, and have been falling, since the Labour Government came into office. There may be a variety of reasons for this, and I may be wrong, but the same thing happened when a Labour Government were last in office. Everything should be done to increase savings.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Grant) is to be congratulated on bringing this matter forward today. I hope that even if we have not had a concession on this occasion we shall perhaps get it on another. It is not too late for the Chief Secretary to give further consideration to this matter between now and Report.</p>

<p>The Chief Secretary expressed an undivided authoritative Revenue opinion about the principle involved in this Clause when he condemned it by saying that it blurred the distinction between earned and unearned income. In a Select Committee of this House in 1906, which was the origin of the distinction adopted by later Chancellors of the Exchequer between unearned and earned income and what was called in those days permanent and precarious income, which</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1986.0" colnum="1986" time="">
<p>was another definition, the Chairman of the Select Committee said:
<q>There is no short and sharp distinction</q>
between the two classes at one point. Sir Henry Primrose, then Chairman of the Board of Inland Revenue, said, with all the authority of his position:
<q>I have indicated that my opinion is against charging a higher rate upon the income that is derived from savings as long as those savings are in the hands of those persons which have made the savings.</q></p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1986.1" colnum="1986" time="">
<p>This may not be a popular view with recent Chancellors of the Exchequer, but it is a reasonable view which comes from somebody in high authority. I believe that there is no person whose savings are more nearly in his hands than the industrial worker who saves in the manner we are contemplating in this Clause. Therefore, I think that the Chief Secretary must accept the view that some blurring between the two has something to commend it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
I move the Clause with every confidence that it will be acceptable to the Government, for at some time or another almost every Government spokesman, not to mention numbers of my hon. and right hon. Friends, have stressed the need for better management in business and industry and better salesmanship of British products, especially abroad. The Clause has been tabled with the objective of providing yet one more incentive and form of assistance to those concerned to enable them to make use of the opportunities which are becoming increasingly available for education in salesmanship or business management.<br/>
In the words of the Labour Party's 1964 General Election manifesto:
<q>Skill, talent and brain power are our most important national resources.</q>
It is the task of management to ensure that these resources are used to the fullest extent and organised to the best advantage, and it is the task of salesmanship then to sell the products of industry. Yet for many years these most demanding tasks were considered to be almost amateur arts. The great advances in technology in recent years have made it obvious that there is a growing need for specialised training, and that it is no longer enough to leave the manager or salesman haphazardly to learn his job within the narrow confines of the experience of one firm.<br/>
If this view is acceptable to the Committee it will agree that the new Clause will provide yet one more means of assisting and encouraging individuals to make use of the facilities for management training which are now available. Only this afternoon, at Question Time, the Secretary of State for Education and Science told us of the progress which is being

made with business schools for those in the top flight of business training, but at all levels throughout the country an increasing number of courses are becoming available for management training.<br/>
The United States has always taken the lead in this matter. Until recent years Britain has lagged far behind, but now successful efforts are being made to make up lost ground. The need for management and salesmanship training has been realised, and the opportunity has been provided. It must now be the aim of government to ensure that the opportunity is used to the fullest extent and to best advantage.<br/>
The new Clause will help towards this end. It has even more relevance than might be thought at first sight, because it is generally agreed that management training is not a once-and-for-all-time experience. It can be divided into three separate but main stages&#x2014;a post-graduate course of one type or another; a course of general management, perhaps ten years later, and a further course, some years after that, when an individual is entering the flights of top management. At each of these stages expense will be incurred and will have to be borne by the indivdual or his employer, whether it be an individual employer or a company.<br/>
In many cases the bigger and more progressive companies will make arrangements either to train their staff themselves or to finance their mangement training. But this will not always occur. Some companies&#x2014;perhaps the small ones&#x2014;will be unwilling to undertake such an expense and other companies, of which there are still quite a few, regrettably, do not yet appreciate the need for training. In these cases the individual has to take the initiative himself, and if he desires to improve his knowledge he must bear the cost.<br/>
At all three stages of training this can bear harshly upon him. The demand upon his pocket can even be so great as to dissuade him from his intention. This is particularly so at the stage of middle management training, because there is more likelihood of this occurring at about the age of 30, just when an individual may be classified as a young man, and when he is already bearing the high expenses involved in setting up house or in rearing a young family. He may be prepared to make short-term sacrifices for


his future good, but the pressures and demands upon him and upon his pocket may be such as to remove any possibility of making such sacrifices.<br/>
The new Clause could be just enough of an aid to tip the balance in favour of a decision to carry on with his training. I sincerely hope so, because if a man should decide against involving himself in the cost of training not only will he be doing himself a disservice; his potential will be lost. Not only will his ability at middle management level be severely curtailed; the likelihood of his having any chance of reaching the top flight of management may be rendered impossible.<br/>
The acceptance of the Clause could be of lasting and significant benefit to industry. Its direct cost cannot be very great, but in any case the advantages would far outweigh any tax loss. The best management and salesmanship in this country compare favourably with those of any other country, but there is far too big a gap between the best and the average, and anything which can be done to decrease that gap should be encouraged as an essential part of Government policy.<br/>
The Clause may go some way towards doing this, and if it is successful in encouraging the better use of the opportunities and facilities which are now available it may be considered a very important addition to the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1991.0" hansard_membership_id="3990" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31315" speakername="Captain Walter Elliot" colnum="1991" time="">
<p>I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to accept the Clause. It will undoubtedly encourage people to carry out this training. They are largely young people, many of whom do this work mainly in the evening. It is extremely hard work and, therefore, encouragement is all the more necessary. I know that it is hard work, because I have done it myself.<br/>
I do not want to bore the Committee with stories of what I have done, but I should like to describe what is entailed. The mention in the Clause of the period of one year, I must confess, causes me to give a hollow laugh. In my case, it took three years, working in the evenings. It may surprise the Committee, but I pride myself on being one of the most recent graduates in the House, if not the most recent. I took an economics degree

and, for three years, I attended in the evenings. I was considerably the oldest, but there was a small bunch of young men who attended night after night. Some fell by the wayside, but I always said that if ever I could do anything to encourage those young people to train themselves I would do so.<br/>
5.30 p.m.<br/>
I assure the Financial Secretary that this entails grinding hard work, which should have all the encouragement possible. I should like to extend the Clause to cover other facets of higher training. It cannot possibly cover my new Clause, but, perhaps, business administration means such things as economics. Perhaps that could be considered. In any case, anyone willing to spend his time in preparing himself for advancement at this time in our economic life ought to be encouraged. Too small a proportion of those available do this. Many people are prepared to soldier on in a set job without doing anything to prepare themselves for higher positions.<br/>
I believe that we should do all we can to push those who are willing. I hope that we shall not get from the Treasury any of the dreary arguments which we have had in the past&#x2014;for example, that, after taxation, it is up to the individual to decide what he does with the money which is left. I believe that, as a principle, that has been exploded. It should not be applied to education and training. I hope that the Financial Secretary will give this suggestion the most sympathetic consideration. From my own experiences, I know how necessary it is, and how valuable this concession will be to those young people who are prepared to make the effort to get themselves trained.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1992.0" hansard_membership_id="10257" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21854" speakername="Mr. Dennis Walters" colnum="1992" time="">
<p>I should like to support the Clause. It is a very mild Clause, because of the relatively small amount of money involved, but, on the other hand, I believe that the advantages which would result from the inducement proposed would be considerably greater that the sum of &#x00A3;150 might lead one to expect. As my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) pointed out, this would apply basically to people in full time employment who are anxious to improve their business education in their own time. There would be no abuse, because the Clause provides that Ministerial approval


must be given and that the expenditure must be incurred on goods and services which are relevant to a particular institution.<br/>
It is generally agreed that education in business should be encouraged and helped. This Clause is a way to provide such help, which could be important but which would not cost a great deal of money. Education in business needs to be promoted much more specifically. There have been reports&#x2014;for instance, from the Institute of Personnel Management and the British Institute of Management&#x2014;which have pointed to deficiencies in our management training and to the fact that it may have proceeded at times in too haphazard a fashion. They have also drawn attention to the extent to which other countries have gone ahead of us. My hon. Friend the Member for Devizes referred to the United States, which is an example which we all know, but it applies also to European countries, particularly Germany.<br/>
Good salesmanship is important to exports. This has been proved time and time again. Better training is extremely important to industry. The Clause could help both of these and would cost very little. I think that it should be accepted.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1993.0" hansard_membership_id="7898" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29860" speakername="Mr. Ian Lloyd" colnum="1993" time="">
<p>I endorse the plea made to the Financial Secretary on behalf of this new Clause. It is all too easy for us&#x2014;preoccupied as we are with the great magnitude of national economic problems&#x2014;to reach the conclusion that the solution to these problems lies in this Chamber. Needless to say, the decisions which we take and the lead which we give are of over-riding importance, but we should not forget that there are between 150,000 and 200,000 important centres of decision elsewhere in the country. The decisions made there by British industry, whether private or public, are vital to our future. It is the quality of these decisions which has to be considerably improved if we are to rise out of our national economic malaise.<br/>
We must do everything we can here to encourage business education and the training of management. We must encourage people to take advantage of opportunities which they might not have had before, whether by financial means or otherwise. I had the privilege in 1947 of visiting the Harvard Business

School in the United States, which is now regarded as the most important business school in the world. There are about nine other such schools in the United States which they regard as being in the top class. We have made great progress by establishing two such schools in Britain which will be coming into operation shortly. The Administrative Staff College, which I attended some years ago, has been setting a lead in this way.<br/>
We have a great deal more to do and there is no limit to the encouragement which we can give. Last July, I visited a number of Japanese shipyards. One of the things which struck me most forcibly was the number of young men on the receiving teams in those shipyards who had had an American education from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They spoke fine English, they were on the ball, they knew what they were talking about and they were familiar with modern industrial problems. I should like to see in Britain a similar obvious ratio of highly trained people.<br/>
All political parties nowadays are on the side of the angels. We all proclaim, in our election manifestoes and party literature, that we are for modernisation. But today the acid test is not whether a party or a Government is "for" modernisation, which it is all too easy to proclaim, but whether a Government or party achieves modernisation. This Clause is small in terms of cost, but considerable in terms of importance. The Government could accept it to prove their sincerity of purpose in this matter.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1994.0" hansard_membership_id="8529" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17660" speakername="The Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Mr. Niall MacDermot)" colnum="1994" time="">
<p>Hon. Gentlemen opposite who have supported the new Clause have said that its acceptance would help the cause to which we are all dedicated; to improve the standard of our management and salesmanship as part of the whole process of modernisation.<br/>
When one is asking for a special favour from the tax law it is not sufficient to establish that the cause one is arguing has, in itself, a laudable purpose. There are many other laudable purposes which will ask for the same kind of concession&#x2014;that is, unless there is something exceptional about the one being sought.<br/>
I congratulate the hon. and gallant Member for Carshalton (Captain W. Elliot) on having obtained a degree in economics. I am envious of him. He based his argument on the wide principle that because this money is being spent for education and training it should qualify for tax relief. That would be a wide principle, if accepted, with very wide implications, including, presumably, the payment of all school fees at private schools. That is not something which we could accept.<br/>
When one is considering the kind of courses which are in existence in management and salesmanship at business schools of one kind and another it is fair to point out that the majority of people who take those courses do so because they are sent there by the firm or business which employs them. It is that business which pays the fees and expenses of the course. In the usual case the firm itself will be able to treat that as an expense for tax purposes, so that would not fall within the provision of the new Clause.<br/>
The new Clause deals with the individual who holds an office or employment whereby he is taxable under Schedule E and who would himself be paying for the course he is attending. He would, under the new Clause, be allowed to make a deduction for the expense involved. It is provided in the new Clause that the course should be approved by the "appropriate Minister"&#x2014;and I suppose that that would be the Minister of Education&#x2014;although there might be some difficulty in drawing the dividing line between which courses should or should not be approved.<br/>
The real difficulty in accepting the new Clause is this. How is one to distinguish between a host of other types of training for which at least as good a case could be made out? All those who study science and technology could say that they make as great, if not greater, a contribution to the cause of modernisation as those who are doing courses in salesmanship. Teachers who wish to attend refresher courses could surely put forward at least as strong a case. There are many other spheres in which people attend either post-graduate or refresher courses at later stages in their careers. It occurs in accountancy, electronics, law and

many branches of engineering. Many professional men, such as surgeons and physicians, do the same.<br/>
If we were to accept the principle of the new Clause it would be bound to lead to a general tax relief for the cost of training courses which were voluntarily undertaken by employees. Apart from this difficulty, it would make a major breach in our tax principles. The whole basis of the expenses law in relation to Schedule E&#x2014;the expenses rule&#x2014;is that they must be incurred in the performance of the duties of the office or employment. There is a whole line of cases establishing clearly that expenses of this kind, where an employee is training himself or undertaking further training to improve his ability to do his work, are expenses incurred in preparing himself to be able to perform his duties rather than being in performance of his duties.<br/>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
This may sound legalistic, but there is a clear distinction underlying it. It may be a distinction which does not appeal to hon. Gentlemen opposite, but we could not change it without making a major change in our tax law. One cannot make an exception in one narrow sphere like this if one is to keep that structure of principle which, as I have argued to the Committee a number of times, is essential to any proper system of taxation. If the principle is wrong, let that be argued and let us consider how we should change it.<br/>
What we are concerned with here is whether a particular case which has been made out is so important that it justifies an exception from our accepted principles of taxation and whether, if we made it, we should be able to follow the line without extending it to a much wider area. That is apart from the fact that the cost of such a wide change could not be contemplated at present. Without detracting from the importance of these courses, I must advise the Committee that it would not be proper, in the circumstances, to accept the new Clause.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1996.0" hansard_membership_id="1544" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12701" speakername="Sir Edward Boyle" colnum="1996" time="">
<p>I was rather disappointed with the hon. and learned Gentleman's reply and later in my remarks I will deal with the principles he mentioned.<br/>
When he said at the start that he felt unable to accept a proposal that the cost


of private education should rank for tax relief, I was a little reminded by that understatement of the remark in one of Swift's works describing a woman who had been run over by a carriage&#x2014;"You would hardly believe how much it changed her appearance for the worse." Likewise, the hon. and learned Gentleman's comment must be one of the best understatements during our proceedings.<br/>
The new Clause recognises, as my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Charles Morrison) pointed out, the very great importance of courses in business management and salesmanship and the fact that there is a notable difference at present between the treatment of business firms and the individual. As the Financial Secretary confirmed, business firms can get allowances if their employees attend these courses at their expense. The new Clause would ensure that those who wish to take such courses at their own expense would not be penalised.<br/>
It may not always be realised just how wide today is the range of courses available for management training. There has been a considerable expansion in recent years and while I will not weary the Committee by dealing at great length with the progress which has been made, it should bear this in mind. In management studies alone, at the apex, as it were, there is the new diploma in management studies which was launched in the autumn of 1961 and which already has over 3,000 students enrolled and studying for the diploma. This is a post-graduate or post-qualification diploma, because students must possess a university degree, a Dip. Tech., a professional qualification or a higher national certificate.<br/>
Apart from management studies, the technical colleges now offer a wide range of management courses at other levels, ranging from courses leading to recognised qualifications in foremanship and supervision, to those for the more specialised qualifications, in works, personnel, or office management. The latest figures I have, for 1963&#x2013;64, show that there are about 12,500 students following courses of this kind and that, in addition, there are a large number of ad hoc courses, including many for senior managers, which are attended by many thousands of students each session.<br/>
Besides these courses which are available in management training there are, as my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, Langstone (Mr. Ian Lloyd) pointed out, courses leading to qualifications in business studies. He mentioned, at the apex again, the two new business schools which are being set up. But we also have the Dip. Tech. course and other technological courses at the technical colleges, all of which include the preliminary study of industrial organisation. And there is an expanding provision for general business education in England and Wales, leading to Higher National Certificates and Diplomas in Business Studies. So whether one looks at business studies or management studies, undoubtedly today the total number of courses available is very much greater than it was some years ago.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1998.0" hansard_membership_id="8529" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17660" speakername="Mr. MacDermot" colnum="1998" time="">
<p>I am sure the right hon. Member would be the first to agree that all these courses to which he has referred are very heavily subsidised out of public funds. Although payment may be made, it is nothing like the full economic cost.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.1998.1" hansard_membership_id="1544" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12701" speakername="Sir E. Boyle" colnum="1998" time="">
<p>There is this very much wider provision of courses today. It seems to me that on economic grounds, from the point of view of making the maximum use of this provision as well as from that of the gain to the country, it is clearly important to have our fiscal system such that it encourages the full utilisation of these courses for which provision is made.<br/>
Regrettably, one cannot deny that the support from industry for quite a number of these courses is still not so high as it should be. There is no doubt at all that today, whereas industry certainly gives better support than it did before in many aspects of technical education, none the less, I am sure&#x2014;this was something I was always told when I was in the Department of Education and Science&#x2014;that support from industry for these courses is still relatively limited. That is why it is extremely important to encourage and assist young executives to take the initiative even if their companies will not or cannot help in this way.<br/>
In his objections to this proposal the Financial Secretary made three points. First, he said that there would be difficulties in trying to define which courses


should qualify. One recognises that, but it is a point which constantly arises even now where technical education is concerned. We have 1&#x00BE; million students in technical colleges. Sorting out the various courses and deciding which qualify under which head, is a problem which is already familiar.<br/>
Secondly, in regard to Schedule E I was interested to hear the Financial Secretary make the point that expenses can be claimed only if the course is in pursuance of one's work and not as a means of training and qualifying for a particular occupation. Looking ahead I am quite certain that, sooner or later, this sharp distinction will not go on proving tenable. As my hon. Friend the Member for Devizes pointed out, management is not something which one can study once and for all. There is the question of middle management training as well. Also when visiting a technical college of standing I am always impressed by those I meet who are not merely doing a job in industry but having all the time to keep in touch with developments in the technical college at which they did their training. To an increasing extent training and qualifying are not things which one can do once for all at the start of one's career.<br/>
The third difficulty mentioned by the Financial Secretary was that of deciding where one should draw the line and make</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.2000.0" colnum="2000" time="">
<p>a distinction as compared with other types of training. But this is another point to which the Committee and the Government will sooner or later have to address themselves more. Our present distinction between the treatment of a company and of an individual cannot be maintained indefinitely, bearing in mind the very great importance of these training courses to the nation and the fact that we still have not as much direct encouragement and help given by industry as we could wish.</p>

<p>For all these reasons my hon. Friends who have supported this Clause have clearly been concerned with a point of real substance. While we recognise the difficulties which the Financial Secretary pointed out, this matter is of such importance that it will have to be considered seriously in future. I think that my hon. Friends would be fully justified in voting for this new Clause in order to draw attention to the importance which we attach to it. We attach great importance both of the issue of management studies itself and to certain principles which we believe will have to be examined much more seriously by the Government for the future.</p>

<p>Where, in the case of a person dying after the 6th day of April 1965, estate duty is payable on the death of one of the parties to a marriage, the payment of such estate duty may, at the option of the surviving party to the marriage, be postponed subject to the following provisions and conditions, namely&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) the payment of estate duty may be postponed in relation only to freehold or

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
I hope the Financial Secretary has come with a large and comprehensive brief clearly marked that he should accept this proposed new Clause. This is a matter which is not concerned with improving the taxation system as such. It is not concerned with technical matters of taxation. This Clause is concerned with making an improvement in the system of levying Estate Duty, a system which at present causes very great hardship to quite a number of people. I hope to show how this is so, and I hope also that the Financial Secretary will be moved by the appeal which I shall make.<br/>
I will start by explaining in outline what the Clause will do. Briefly, the idea is this. When one partner of a marriage dies and the other partner is left, it will be open under this Clause for the surviving partner to elect, in writing to the Commissioners, to postpone payment of Estate Duty on the freehold value of the home in which the two partners were living. In other words, the payment of Estate Duty on the home of the two people, one of whom has died, can be postponed until the second partner dies. The option will be exercisable within three months in writing and not thereafter, and the duty payable on the value of the home will have to be paid in full when the second partner eventually dies. Under this Clause there will also be no interest payable during the life of the second party to the marriage.<br/>
That, briefly, is what I intend the Clause to do, and I say straight away that if there is any fault in drafting which prevents it from achieving that purpose I shall be only too happy, if the Financial Secretary feels it advisable, to accept or consider any improvements to the drafting.<br/>
Now I come to the purpose of introducing the Clause. We hear a lot of arguments in favour of measures of one sort

or another on the basis of sympathy and compassion for people who are put in difficult positions. I want to be absolutely open and frank about this and say that that is precisely the reason why I am moving this new Clause. I feel that people are suffering hardship now because of the way in which Estate Duty operates in these circumstances.<br/>
I must confess that Estate Duty is not a duty which in itself entirely commends itself to me. Personally, I much prefer the idea of an inheritance tax, because I think it operates much more fairly in that it recognises the means of the recipient and not the means of the donor. However, it would be out of order to go into that subject now, and it is no part of my argument that Estate Duty as such is a bad thing. But we should recognse that by its very nature Estate Duty operates at a time when people find circumstances most distressing, at a most difficult and complicated time in their lives. For that reason, if for no other, we all ought to look very sympathetically at any proposal which alleviates people's distress in these circumstances.<br/>
When one partner of a marriage dies&#x2014;and in the majority of cases both partners will by that time be fairly advanced in years&#x2014;it is obvious that the other party is in a very difficult position personally. Obviously that person is highly distressed and is suddenly faced with many problems. I remember being told some years ago by somebody on the death of a close relative that the thing which impressed him most about this experience was the vast number of problems with which a surviving partner has to deal&#x2014;problems which have never arisen before. This is aggravated by the trouble which besets such people in connection with the assessment of Estate Duty.<br/>
It is probably common ground that one of the greatest worries of such a time is having to pay the Estate duty, having all one's possessions valued, having people go through the property, and so on, and, of course, this comes at a time when the surviving partner is feeling very upset. Probably the most difficult problems of all are centred on the home in which the married couple have been living. Many hon. Members will know this from their correspondence. Incidentally, if I had not been strongly in favour of the new


Clause before it was tabled, I should certainly have been convinced afterwards. I should never have believed the amount of support I have received for the Clause, both oral and written, since it was tabled.<br/>
Very often, by the nature of things, an elderly married couple will be living in the home where they have been nearly all their lives or, at least, for a great number of years, and it will probably have become too big for them or in other ways a problem. The problem is greatly exacerbated the moment one partner dies. If the house was too big, it becomes that much bigger. If it was difficult to run, it is that much more difficult to run. In the circumstances, many reasons arise for the surviving partner to leave the home, because it is too big, because it is too far removed from other relatives who can help, or simply because the expense of running it is too great.<br/>
Paradoxically, when a move is made essential in this way, it often leads to even more expense than was incurred previously. All hon. Members know that, as soon as one moves house, an infinite number of other expenses seem to arise. Here is an extract from one letter which I have received which demonstrates this point and shows how difficult life can be. It is from a man who wrote to say that he and his brother are faced with this problem, their father having died and left their elderly mother living in a house which was really too big. It is not by any means a big house but it is too big for one old lady. He says:
<q>We know very well, of course, that we ought to force our mother to leave her home and move into a flat which would be more within her means, but I am quite sure that to do this would give her great distress and possibly hasten her end. I am determined that somehow we shall find the money to keep the home going until she eventually dies.</q>
Many hon. Members will know of similar cases. We ought, if possible, to do something to make things easier for people in such circumstances. Exemption of the value of the home from immediate payment of Estate Duty will afford that bit of extra financial help which can turn the scale and make it unnecessary for the surviving old partner to move to a new home.<br/>
The benefit can be considerable. As an example, I take an estate worth &#x00A3;20,000 for Estate Duty purposes, which, for anyone who owns a home or has ever

run even the smallest of businesses, is by no means out of the normal run. The house is valued at only &#x00A3;5,000&#x2014;quite a reasonable house in my part of the country, though I know that in this area that amount of money would not buy much of a house&#x2014;and if Estate Duty payable on that house were remitted until the death of the second partner &#x00A3;600 would be saved. For my second example I take a larger estate of &#x00A3;50,000, and in this case duty payable on a home valued at &#x00A3;10,000 could be as much as &#x00A3;3,100. Clearly, there is need for such a provision as I propose, which would be of considerable benefit to the surviving partner.<br/>
6.15 p.m.<br/>
I come now to the loss to the Exchequer, which always looms so large when we discuss tax changes of this kind. The loss in this case would be extremely small. We do not suggest that the duty should not be paid; we suggest merely that it be deferred. Admittedly, interest might have been charged in other circumstances, but it would be quite inappropriate to charge interest to the surviving partner for what might be quite a number of years. The value of the interest to the Exchequer would not be of great significance. It would certainly not be significant compared with the help given to the recipients of the concession.<br/>
There are precedents for the deferment of Estate Duty in certain circumstances. I understand that woodlands, although they are assessed with an estate at the time of death, are subject to a provision which makes it possible to postpone payment of the duty on the actual timber until such time as the timber is felled and realised. There is also facility for postponing payment of duty on agricultural land for a certain time. If we are looking for a precedent for bringing in only the home, we have in recent weeks established the principle that the home is something which should be exempt from the Capital Gains Tax, and we have done this because, of course, the home is used by the whole family and is of great importance to everyone in it.<br/>
We ought to do anything we can, however small, to help older people. For years we have heard about their difficulties. In this country now, we are moving slowly, too slowly, many of us


would say, towards doing better for our old people, but they have recently suffered considerable extra difficulties. There have already been references to the fact that dividends are likely to produce less money in the months following the passage of this Bill. Old people who require home help have to pay more for it because of the abolition of exemption from National Insurance contributions in respect of home helps. Rising rates are a particularly heavy burden on old people who cannot vary their income. Old people are the most sensitive of all to rises in the cost of living, and we all know about the rises which have recently occurred and are likely to occur.<br/>
I emphasise that the reason behind the Clause is sympathy, sympathy for people who deserve consideration from both sides of the Committee. I very much hope that the interests of neatness in our financial legislation, the possibility of a small loss to the Exchequer, and the old feeling in this country that we always resist change whenever we can will be swept aside and not be used as a reason to resist a measure which could give very great relief, relief disproportionate to the amount which it might seem on paper, to the old people who certainly need it.</p>

<p>I support the Clause and the case presented by the hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger). Not the least of my reasons is that I was impressed by his conversion, expressed in an aside, to the Liberal Party's policy on an inheritance tax. I hope that in a future Finance Bill we shall abolish Estate Duty altogether and replace it by an inheritance tax. In the meantime, however, I welcome any measure of reform to remove the hardship which Estate Duty undoubtedly causes. Clearly, there is a case for removing the hardship which is borne by the surviving partner of a marriage.<br/>
It seems to be a convincing argument, particularly as the Clause, as worded, is proposing not the abolition of a certain income to the Treasury but merely its postponement. Also, the Clause makes clear that if after the death of one partner the survivor decides to sell the house the Estate Duty will then become payable. An important point is

that no one will have finance reasons forcing them to sell their property immediately on the death of the partner, thus bringing additional distress. Therefore, on social grounds the principle of the Clause should be accepted by the Government.<br/>
The drafting of the Clause may not be acceptable, including the definition of the various properties, which might have to be clarified in relation to Scottish law on the holding of property, but I hope that the principle will be accepted.</p>

<p>I support my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger). The Clause is humane. It will be kind to people just at the moment when they need kindness most. I was moved by the speech of my hon. Friend, and I noticed that the Financial Secretary was, too. I hope that the Government will show how humane they can be. We all agree that the rates of Estate Duty are extremely harsh. I speak with first-hand knowledge as a solicitor dealing with people at the time when they lose relatives, and I echo everything that my hon. Friend said.<br/>
The first advantage of the Clause is that it will cost very little. The Financial Secretary will no doubt tell us exactly how much. Compared with the figures that we have been discussing in the last few weeks, it is a very small amount. It is the loss of interest over a certain period.<br/>
The Clause is even more necessary in view of the Capital Gains Tax provision. I give an example of a typical case, that of a small businessman. Let us say he starts this year with &#x00A3;1,000 in cash and decides to buy his house on mortgage with an endowment scheme. Let us say that the business is successful over the next 10 years and he builds it up to a value of &#x00A3;15,000. He has a wife and family. Then he is killed in a motor accident. What will be the position of his estate in terms of Capital Gains Tax and Estate Duty?<br/>
First, unfortunately, the estate will have to pay &#x00A3;3,000 in Capital Gains Tax because it will be a disposal on death. There would have been a capital gain of &#x00A3;9,000 for assessment. About one-third of it will be taken by way of capital gain. The business will have to be sold. Let us say it fetches &#x00A3;15,000. Out of that the &#x00A3;3,000 will be paid, and we shall have an estate


of &#x00A3;12,000 cash. The endowment policy will pay off the mortgage. Let us say that the house is then worth &#x00A3;6,000. That is a small estate especially when we are now thinking in terms of 10 years ahead. So there will be a total estate of about &#x00A3;18,000. The rate of duty at present&#x2014;we do not know what it will be in 1970&#x2014;is 12 per cent. Therefore, out of the cash another &#x00A3;1,400 has to be used for Estate Duty, and the amount on the house is &#x00A3;700. Altogether, therefore, the estate has to pay &#x00A3;5,000 in Capital Gains Tax and Estate Duty combined.<br/>
If the Clause were accepted, the &#x00A3;700 payable in respect of the dwelling-house could be postponed. That would have the effect of reducing the Estate Duty by a third. It would have been &#x00A3;2,100; now it will be &#x00A3;1,400. So the widow will be saved about &#x00A3;1 a week, on the basis of &#x00A3;700 invested at 6 to 6&#x00BD; per cent., and that will be in circumstances in which she will need every help that she can get. This seems to be an overwhelming case. The Government need not worry, because upon the house there will be a charge of &#x00A3;700, and they will get their money anyhow, although they may have to wait a little for it.<br/>
My hon. Friend says that there are precedents for this. I am glad to hear that. Even if there were no precedents, I am sure that that would not stop the Financial Secretary helping us. The Government claim again and again that they are humane and interested in people's personal problems. Here is the test. Let them show that they are humane. Let them accept the Clause.</p>

<p>Having been responsible this week for moving a number of highly technical and arid Amendments which have found the Financial Secretary's heart as stony as one might expect for that type of Amendment, it gives me pleasure to support my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) in this Clause, which embodies in principle what I had hoped to succeed in obtaining with my Deferment of Estate Duty Bill which was seventh in the Ballot and has not been reached and is not likely to be reached.<br/>
This proposal is very humane for reasons which must be apparent. I am concerned that the Clause should be accep-

ted and that the Financial Secretary should not turn it down purely on financial grounds, saying that the State cannot afford either now or in the foreseeable future a very large loss of duty. The loss of duty would not be much in terms of the current figures in our total national Budget.<br/>
The total number of estates subject to duty in the year 1963&#x2013;64 was 316,000, of which 154,224 were the estates of surviving women. Of the total number, roughly 60,000 bore duty, and of those&#x2014;they are all estates over &#x00A3;5,000&#x2013;26,400 were the estates of surviving women. The total capital value of these estates was about &#x00A3;1,100 million, but the segment of the total capital value which applied to freehold and leasehold residential property was only &#x00A3;175 million, or 15 per cent. of all estates over &#x00A3;5,000.<br/>
The net receipt of all duty was &#x00A3;312 million, roughly &#x00A3;1,075 per estate, if all estates, including those exempted, are taken into consideration, and no less than &#x00A3;5,000 per estate if only those estates bearing duty are taken into consideration. This sets the spectrum in which the problem has to be considered.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry) pointed out, the rates are rather penal. In the estates which just come into the duty bracket, &#x00A3;5,000 to &#x00A3;6,000, 1 per cent. can be ignored, because a charge of &#x00A3;50 or &#x00A3;60 is created on an estate of that size. When one reaches the figure of &#x00A3;8,000 to &#x00A3;10,000, which is by no means the vast sum nowadays that it might have been considered to be before the First World War, or even the Second World War, the 4 per cent. rate produces a duty of &#x00A3;320 to &#x00A3;400.<br/>
When we reach the level of estate given in the example by my hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham, &#x00A3;18,000 to &#x00A3;20,000, we reach duty levels of &#x00A3;2,160 to &#x00A3;2,400. This represents a real burden on what is, by common consent, a modest estate. One might suggest that at current levels of inflation practically all estates will be in this modest bracket by 1985. Thus, we do not have to look far forward to a situation where the average price of an average house will be &#x00A3;6,000 to &#x00A3;7,000, and those houses will be very much embraced by these proposals.<br/>
I shall not weary the Committee any more with statistics, but I end by reminding hon. Members who may have read it of the distinguished book by the late President Kennedy, "Profiles in Courage", in which he quotes an incident in a quarrel between two distinguished United States senators&#x2014;the late Senator Benton and the late Senator Calhoun.<br/>
6.30 p.m.<br/>
The two Senators conducted a lifelong quarrel with great virulence, much to the delight and amusement of the American public. When Senator Benton lay on his death bed, Senator Calhoun suddenly stopped the quarrel and someone asked him why, because the quarrel was very well known. His reply was most relevant to this Clause. It was:
<q>When God Almighty lays His hand on a man, Sir, I take mine off, Sir.</q>
In the United Kingdom&#x2014;and not alone here&#x2014;when God Almighty lays his hand upon a man, that is the moment that the Inland Revenue chooses, with the full blessing of the State, to lay its hands on his wife. This is an uncivilised practice and its removal is something that a great many citizens, at every level of income, would be prepared to pay more tax in another direction in order to secure, knowing that they were postponing the date for the collection of this duty.<br/>
It would be only a relatively short period of five to seven years&#x2014;the average difference in the life spans of men and women&#x2014;after which the duty would automatically start coming back to the coffers of the State. That is all we ask. It is a matter of timing, of postponement. It would entail a loss of revenue, but I am sure that the country would be prepared to make it up in other ways.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) and the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) made it clear that they do not view with any great favour our Estate Duty law and much of the hardship they say results from it. They followed through, quite logically, with an attack upon the system. I have a lot of sympathy with what they say and as a party we are committed to reform and to tax reform. Nevertheless, the Committee may feel that we have bitten

off quite sufficient in the present Bill without tackling Estate Duty law as well.<br/>
No doubt, in the full course of time, in the years ahead, my right hon. Friend will turn his constructive mind to these problems, but, meanwhile, we have to consider whether it would be right to make the alteration in the law proposed by the Clause. I must say at once that it would be a departure in principle from the basis of the present duty. In technical language, the present Estate Duty is what is known as mutation duty, which means that the whole of the estate as such is charged at a given level of tax, depending on the size of the estate, without any regard to the circumstances of the beneficiaries.<br/>
No doubt this was one of the matters the hon. Member for Ayr had in mind when he said that he would like this duty replaced by an inheritance duty, but that is the law and it would be a departure from the principle to make this alteration. However, that is the sort of argument which I know does not greatly appeal to the Committee and, having made the point, I will leave it.<br/>
I come to more worth-while arguments. The first is that the proposal would be highly discriminatory as between one beneficiary and another. I concede that it is a class which commands great sympathy because, for the most part, this would benefit widows although, sometimes also widowers. It would, however, benefit only a limited sector of that class, namely, widows who were owner occupiers or whose husbands were owner occupiers. But even within that sector it would benefit only a limited number because it would affect only widows whose husbands were owner occupiers and who continued to live in what had been their home. These are the only people who would benefit.<br/>
The hon. Member for Chippenham (Mr. Awdry) gave a moving example of the man who has built up his business. Because the hon. Gentleman wanted to bring out the full iniquity, as he believes, of the Capital Gains Tax, his example was that of a man with a business where there would be a large capital gain element. The classic example of this would be the shopkeeper because of the large goodwill element within the value of the capital assets.<br/>
A great many shopkeepers live above the shop and if we are envisaging an example where the business is sold&#x2014;which is what the hon. Gentleman envisaged&#x2014;then usually the premises above are sold with the shop and so the widow in many cases could not benefit from the Clause at all because she would have ceased to live in the matrimonial home. The relief under the Clause would thus be confined to the surviving spouse who remained living in the house and only for so long as she remained in it.<br/>
Of course, many widows succeed to an estate which is larger than the exemption. The estate up to &#x00A3;5,000 is exempt. Then there is a very low rate&#x2014;1 per cent.&#x2014;on estates between &#x00A3;5,000 and &#x00A3;6,000, 2 per cent. within the next &#x00A3;1,000 and 3 per cent. within the next &#x00A3;1,000, and so on. It builds up.<br/>
Assuming that a widow succeeds to an estate of &#x00A3;10,000 to &#x00A3;15,000, there is an appreciable sum to be paid in estate duty. There will be many such widows whose husbands were not owner-occupiers and they will be confronted with similar difficulties. Yet they would not benefit from the Clause. Thus, the Clause would make one widow feel that she had been deprived of a benefit granted to another. That situation would not assist in producing that sense of equality and fairness which we strive to achieve in our tax system.<br/>
The hon. Member for Ayr&#x2014;at some peril to his argument&#x2014;referred to the fact that many elderly people at the time of the death of one spouse are already living in a house that is too big for them and that that element of under-occupation, as it is called by housing experts, increases when there is only one spouse left. Of course, if the surviving spouse did move to accommodation of a size better suited to her needs, she would lose the benefit of the Clause.<br/>
I remember that, just before the election, I discussed the housing problems of Derby with the housing manager. He told me that if he could have 1,000 old people's bungalows he could solve Derby's housing problem overnight. This is because so many people live in under-occupied accommodation. Nearly all of them are widows and elderly people who have brought up a family in their home and one can fully understand the

human reasons why they do not want to move.<br/>
Of course, for some particularly elderly people it would be a great shock to move. The hon. Gentleman quoted the instance where to try to move the person might imperil that person's whole future. Nevertheless, one wants to encourage movement wherever it can reasonably take place and to build into our tax law an inducement to remain in the house&#x2014;which is what the Clause would do&#x2014;when looked at from the wider social point of view would be of very dubious value.<br/>
The class of people who would be singled out for preferential treatment by the Clause are already getting some relief on Estate Duty compared with others because, while the Estate Duty on personal property must be paid when the probate is obtained, the duty on real property, which is what we are concerned with, can be spread by instalments over eight years. We should, therefore, be adding to an advantage which already exists. I would, in parenthesis, comment that this is the answer to the hon. Gentleman who referred to the favoured treatment of agriculture. The only way in which agricultural land is favoured is by spreading the liability.<br/>
A number of hon. Members have referred to cost. They say that the new Clause would not cost the Treasury anything because it would only defer payment. I do not base the argument primarily on cost, but I must correct the mistaken impression that if we defer permanently a tax for a period of years it does not cost the Treasury anything. It does. For the initial years, it costs the Treasury the whole amount. One can illustrate the point by imagining everybody's liability to tax being assessed at this moment but their being given two years before they need to pay. The result would be that the Treasury would get no taxes for two years.<br/>
This proposal would, in the first year, mean a loss of &#x00A3;10 million to the Treasury. The loss would decline over the years until it disappeared. From then on, there would be no further loss. However, at a time when my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has found it necessary to increase taxation very substantially, he cannot, even if he wanted


to do so, accept a proposal which would mean a revenue reduction this year of &#x00A3;10 million.<br/>
As I have said, that is not the argument on which I ask the Committee to reject the Clause. We do not think it should be accepted because it proposes a relief which would single out a particular class within a particular class on a particular form of property.<br/>
For these reasons, I suggest that the Clause is unacceptable.</p>

<p>I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger) and my other hon. Friends who have spoken will be very disappointed with the Financial Secretary's reply. I give my sympathy to the hon. Gentleman, who, for 16 days, has had to speak to long Treasury briefs, most of them proposing the imposition of very bad taxes on the country. I should have thought that the Treasury would have had the kindness to give the hon.

<p>My right hon. Friend was perfectly right when he said that for two days the Government had been in a state of constant capitulation. But this was not because they were being generous to the taxpayer; it was because they had drafted the Bill badly and incompetently and recognised the superior attitude to these matters of my right hon. and hon. Friends. What we should like to have is a little human warmth on the part of the Government. Once again, it has been lacking.<br/>
During the Committee stage I have come to the conclusion that the Treasury prepares its briefs by giving the Ministers five or six pages of arguments, many of them differing arguments, and leaving it to the Ministers to decide which of them they should deploy. One of the difficulties is that, probably through being

under great pressure, the Ministers have at times deployed contradictory arguments, all contained in the same Treasury brief. This afternoon was no exception.<br/>
We heard, first, the general argument that the new Clause involves a great change of principle in respect of Estate Duty. Later, it was said that there was a certain amount of discretion given on Estate Duty on real property in that the payment of the duty could be spread over a period. The principle which allows people to pay Estate Duty on real property over eight years is identical to the principle advocated in this Clause. We say, not that these people should not have to pay Estate Duty, but that the estate should pay when the widow or widower dies. This involves a spread of the period different from the eight year method, but in principle it is identical to the principle involved in allowing people to pay Estate Duty over eight years. I would argue that no change of principle was involved in the new Clause.<br/>
The second argument which the Financial Secretary endeavoured to deploy was that the Clause proposed a discriminatory concession which would not apply to everybody. This is surely true of almost every tax concession which is made. Estate Duty is a discriminatory form of taxation. There are discriminations within it. Any form of concession in Estate Duty obviously will apply in a different way at various levels of Estate Duty. This is not an argument for giving a concession in respect of something which involves real human hardship.<br/>
There is an easy solution to the argument about shopkeepers and the continuous under-occupation of property. I am sure that my hon. Friends would be willing for the Clause to be redrafted to fit the perfectly cogent argument of the Financial Secretary. He quoted the case of the shopkeeper. He asked what was the position if, as a result of Capital Gains Tax and Estate Duty, the family business has to be sold and the widow or widower has to move out of the premises into some other premises. He said that the Clause would not provide for such a person. He is perfectly right, and we shall be most grateful to him when he decides to include it in the Bill.<br/>
Perhaps he will add to the Clause a method similar to the replacement of


business asset provisions of the capital gains section of the Bill whereby such a person could change the living accommodation part of the shop into a private dwelling-house. This same happy formula could be applied, and it would encourage people to move to smaller premises. It would be the responsibility not of the local authority, but of the individual concerned. If there were added to the Clause a provision that if the widow or widower decided to move to a smaller unit of accommodation the amount of money invested in that smaller unit would enjoy the privileges of the Clause, this would overcome the Financial Secretary's difficulty. Perhaps he will decide, on reflection, that his objections can be easily overcome and will go back to the Treasury and say that, in view of the cogent arguments of my hon. Friends he is willing to accept the new Clause.<br/>
The hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles (Mr. David Steel) rightly argued the importance of the case. The action of the Treasury Bench today, after the blandishments of the Leader of the Liberal Party yesterday, must be disappointing to the Liberal Party. Within the space of three and a half hours, the Government have turned down a new Clause to encourage the spread of share ownership, a new Clause encouraging education and, now, the new Clause so ably advocated by the hon. Member for Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles. This is not the way to go on if the Government want 10 extra votes.</p>

<p>In the long term, as the Financial Secretary admitted, the Clause would cost the Treasury nothing. In fact, if the Government continued in office, they would actually make money. Over a time of rising prices, property would be worth much more than at present and thus the Government would have a share of the inflation that they are causing. All that the Committee is asking is that a person should not have to pay Estate Duty upon the home if he or she continues to live in it.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends the Members for Ayr (Mr. Younger) and Chippenham (Mr. Awdry) have both given good examples of what an inhuman form of taxation is imposed upon a widow or widower. My hon. Friend the Member for Chippenham pointed out that the situation has now been aggravated by the imposition of the Capital Gains Tax at the time of death. Not only do people have to find immediate cash resources to meet their Estate Duty obligations, but they have to find immediate cash resources to meet any Capital Gains Tax which is imposed upon on estate.</p>

<p>Stamp duties on policies of life insurance relating to death only shall be chargeable at the same rate as the duties applicable to policies relating to personal accidents in those cases where the period in which the specified contingency is to happen does not exceed five years.&#x2014;[<i>Mr. A.

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
I should, first declare an interest. I have been a marine insurance broker at Lloyd's for more than 15 years. I would add that at no time did I ever become an expert on short-term life insurance, and that I know little about it. I therefore hope to be forgiven by hon. Members if I do not appear to be as skilled in this matter as my experience might lead them to believe.<br/>
Unlike the previous new Clause, moved so ably by my hon Friend the Member for Ayr (Mr. Younger), this Clause has no emotional undertone at all. That being so, and because there has been a change in the Treasury spokesman, I hope that the Chief Secretary, who is very knowledgeable on this subject, will feel able to help the export trade by accepting a Clause which is designed to assist it. If the right hon. Gentleman does so, it will be the first time this afternoon that the Government have felt able to accept a new Clause.<br/>
The Clause deals only with short-term life insurance, for a period of five years or less. I seek to put right a very grave anomaly in the Stamp Act as it affects this type of insurance. There is no question of any party issue here; the sole issue is an anomaly which I think is affecting the invisible export trade, and one that I and many of my hon. Friends feel should be put right quickly.<br/>
This short-term life business has grown tremendously over the past few years; there is a much greater volume of it now than there was even 10 years ago. It provides cover against death resulting from accident, illness or natural causes. The present stamp duty on life policies is 1s. per cent. up to &#x00A3;500, followed by 10s. in full on the next &#x00A3;500&#x2013;&#x00A3;1,000, followed by 10s. in full for each additional &#x00A3;1,000 or part thereof. The duty has greatly handicapped this type of business

at Lloyd's and in the life market&#x2014;particularly foreign business.<br/>
Why is this the case? The foreign client wishing to take out short-term life policy in the London market would not only have to pay duty in his own country of origin, but also the United Kingdom duty. That applies, not only to reinsurance business, but to direct business. This is the first very real disadvantage that the stamp duty puts on the London market. If the same business were placed abroad&#x2014;in, say, France or Italy&#x2014;the client would pay only a small local tax.<br/>
The present situation, therefore, has a very obvious detrimental effect on invisable exports&#x2014;and we know, and we welcome the fact, that the Government and the Chief Secretary have been pressing very hard for an increase in our export trade. All hon. Members are 100 per cent. behind them in that aim.<br/>
On the other hand, the Stamp Duty does not greatly benefit the Chancellor of the Exchequer's pocket. It is very difficult to find out exactly what revenue it produces in one year&#x2014;I have tried to find out, and I have failed; perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will be able to give us the answer. Nevertheless, it is certain that the revenue produced must be minimal as compared with the loss of business on the London market that the duty causes.<br/>
I should like to give an example of the type of temporary life business placed in the London market which is badly damaged by this duty. If a foreigner wishes to place insurance in the London market on his life for one year, and is aged, say, 30 or less, he will pay a premium of 4s. 2d. per cent. Of that 4s. 2d. per cent., 1s. per cent. is Stamp Duty&#x2014;nearly 33&#x2153; per cent. of that premium. Without the duty, the rate would be 3s. 2d. per cent. Therefore, competing with the Continent, the British insurer has a loaded rate by 1s. per cent. Stamp Duty, thereby having to reduce the actual net premium charged for the risk to be covered in order to obtain the business. That is the very had situation that has developed. It means that a skilful overseas insurance company can beat us, in this market, even though we have prided ourselves for 200 or 300 years on being the world's greatest insurance experts.<br/>
Let us take the case of a salesman&#x2014;a young man going overseas to sell motor cars, and so help our export trade. If he has a wife and children, his company will have to take out short-term life insurance cover for him. He may be killed abroad. The policy may have been for &#x00A3;10,000 for one month. The premium would have been 1s. per cent., and the stamp duty would have been 6d. flat&#x2014;just a 6d. stamp bought from the Post Office, because that cover would be classed as an accident policy. If, on the other hand, he goes abroad and dies in his bed from natural causes and the cover which he had taken out had been a short-term life policy of the type I have been describing, the premium which he would have paid would have been 2s. 9d. per cent. of which 1s. per cent. would have been for the stamp.<br/>
So we reach the position that on a &#x00A3;10,000 policy, if he is killed the stamp for the cover he is carrying would be 6d. in full: while if he dies in his bed, with a cover of the type I have described, the stamp would have cost &#x00A3;5. The difference in the risk carried by the underwriters is the difference between the net 1s. 9d. and 1s., that is, the difference between the 1s. per cent. for the one policy and the net 1s. 9d. per cent. for the other, so that to the underwriter 9d. represents the difference in risk between the insured dying in his bed and being killed in an accident, while to the Revenue the difference is between 6d. and &#x00A3;5. I am sure that the Chief Secretary will agree with me that this is something very wrong and damaging to the insurance market.<br/>
Let me, finally, quote another type of case, a combined type of policy which is being written at Lloyd's and which is an important type of cover has two sections, one section for life cover, for death from any cause, a period of one month, for instance, which for a man aged 30 would have a premium of 2s. 9d. per cent., of which 1s. per cent. is the stamp; the other section is cover for death from accident and which, as it would be an accident policy for one month, would have a rate of 3s. taking only a 6d. policy stamp and not the 1s. per cent. stamp.<br/>
Those are typical anomalies. I could go on for hours giving other similar ex-

amples which, to put it vulgarly, are making a monkey out of the Stamp Act. I hope that it will be possible for the Chief Secretary to be very generous in a purely non-political sense and accept my Clause. All the Clause does is to bring short-term life assurance on to the same level for Stamp Duty, making the duty 6d. as with an ordinary accident policy. This gesture would have great benefit for the whole life market in this country and would certainly encourage the export drive and make it easier to attract foreign business. There would be another advantage in that it is important to help salesmen going overseas selling goods for us to be able to bring down their overheads and the cost of their insurance cover.<br/>
The Clause is widely welcomed throughout the insurance world, and I hope that the Chief Secretary will be able to accept it.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Richmond, Surrey (Mr. A. Royle) said that he would not allow any emotional content to affect the logic of his argument. I do not think that his argument has suffered on that account. He has put forward a perfectly valid case which, on the face of it, would seem to show that not everything we would like to do has been done to make one part of our economy as fully competitive as we would like it to be. I would, therefore, like to examine the matter and to discuss it, as the hon. Gentleman did, with a completely non-party approach to see whether the difficulties are insuperable or can be overcome.<br/>
I begin by demonstrating that there is no partisan approach. I remind the Committee of previous exchanges on this topic. On 20th December, 1962, the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Peter Walker) asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider the matter and the then Chief Secretary answered:
<q>I have noted my hon. Friend's suggestion."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 20th December, 1962; Vol. 669, c. <i>211.</i>]</q>
However, when it came to 19th January, 1965, and we had had a change of Government, the same hon. Gentleman put the same Question and the Chief Secretary answered:
<q>I have noted the hon. Gentleman's suggestion."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th January, 1965; Vol. 705, c. 15.]</q>


That demonstrates that both Governments have adopted the same "carefully noting" attitude on this matter.<br/>
The problem derives from the fact that foreign countries generally charge stamp duty on insurance policies by reference to the premium, whereas we charge by reference to the sum assured. When there is this class of insurance, when the rate is very small&#x2014;and I gather that there can be a rate for one month short-term life policies as low as 3s. per cent., 3s. per &#x00A3;100, there is a duty of 1s. in relation to the 3s., which, admittedly, makes the stamp duty high, 25 per cent. of the total, or 33&#x2153; per cent. of the premium charged. Normally, one would not want a Stamp Duty of 33&#x2153; per cent. If a person selling a house had to pay Stamp Duty of 33&#x2153; per cent., some hon. Members would be writing some letters to some Chancellors of the Exchequer about it.<br/>
I recognise the problem, but there are many difficulties about complying with the hon. Gentleman's suggestion. First, it would be entirely unsuitable for the standard form of Lloyd's policy, because that provides for extension without limit. The suggestion is that there should be a special category of short-term policy
<q>in those cases where the period in which the specified contingency is to happen does not exceed five years.</q>
However, if there is a policy which provides for extension without limit, even though the first date may be within the five years, the duty in effect would be avoided&#x2014;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.2025.0" hansard_membership_id="2341" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30685" speakername="Mr. Peter Walker" colnum="2025" time="">
<p>The right hon. Gentleman will find that Lloyd's itself is unable to write life insurance for a period of more than five years.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.2025.1" hansard_membership_id="3434" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30097" speakername="Mr. Diamond" colnum="2025" time="">
<p>That is something to be considered. If that is the case, it is surprising that Lloyd's lawyers, who are as competent as may be, none more competent, would find it necessary to write a policy providing for an extension without limit.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.2025.2" hansard_membership_id="2341" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30685" speakername="Mr. Walker" colnum="2025" time="">
<p>Under its general charter, Lloyd's is unable to do life assurance. It can do only temporary life assurance. The definition which has been accepted is five years. Within that five years, within the policy, Lloyd's allow extension without limit.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.2026.0" hansard_membership_id="3434" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30097" speakername="Mr. Diamond" colnum="2026" time="">
<p>I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying, and I am sure that he is accurate, as usual, but it is not inconceivable that the two things are not inconsistent and I would, therefore, like to look into it.<br/>
It is not inconceivable that it is possible to write a policy which is not for a period of longer than five years, but at the end of the five years to have another period, also not longer than five years, still not going outside the undertaking not to underwrite insurance for a period of longer than five years because the extension might be held to be not different from a new policy. I am saying only that that is something to be considered. It is one of the problems. I am advised that there is the possibility of avoidance by the issue of separate policies each for a specified period, but which, together, would give cover for a longer period. This is an obvious way of avoidance and so far no method has been discovered of preventing it.<br/>
There would be a very serious discrepancy between a duty of 6d. on a policy for the full specified period and the duty on a policy for a slightly longer period at the rate of 1s. per cent. One goes in this case from what would be a very small Stamp Duty to a very high Stamp Duty as one goes from four years, eleven months to five years, one month. The way to deal with this is to have some kind of tapering provision which would make it extremely difficult and hardly worth while. These are some of the difficulties which have been in the minds of Governments.<br/>
There is something more constructive I can say in drawing attention to the extra statutory concessions relating to group life policies. These extra statutory concessions are published so that every taxpayer knows about them and knows what the procedure is. This one is published in Appendix 9 to the 103rd Annual Report of the Commissioners of Inland Revenue, Cmnd. 1258. It applies where a company insures a group consisting of its directors and executives when abroad on business. This is one kind of business which is done and it is relevant to the question which is under consideration in this Clause. It does that provided that the names of the persons covered are not endorsed on the policy.<br/>
The effect of that is that the duty is charged on the total risk in one sum instead of separately on the individual amounts and irrespective of changes in the persons covered so that one can get proportionately a much lower Stamp Duty by covering a large group of persons without identifying the person too closely. However, the cover is still valid and adequate.<br/>
That takes care of a good deal of the difficulty, but not all of the difficulty. I have been asked about the cost and I am advised it would be quite negligible. All I can suggest is that the Committee should allow me to look carefully into these difficulties. I do not think that it will be possible for me, with the best will in the world, to undertake to bring anything back on report. There is not the time. It is not an enormous difficulty, but it is one which has been with us some time. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Worcester (Mr. Peter Walker) asks me to look at this and see whether we can overcome these difficulties. If it could be dealt with on extra-statutory concessions then it is something which could be conceded between now and next year's Finance Bill. If it is something which would have to wait for a Clause in a Bill then it would have to wait until next year's Bill at least.<br/>
I cannot say that we would find the answer, because I have not been able to find the answer hitherto; nor has my predecessor. The Government are most anxious that we should be fully competitive and that we should not be denied our full competitive power because of administrative inconvenience in one way or another. It is far better that we should establish and maintain our ascendancy as underwriters, both in this country and the world as a whole, and I would suggest to the Committee they should allow me to look at it in this sympathetic way.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.2027.0" hansard_membership_id="2341" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30685" speakername="Mr. Peter Walker" colnum="2027" time="">
<p>The point that the Chief Secretary has missed is that whereas we would not argue against the imposition of Stamp Duty based upon the sum insured, in what is normally known to be life assurance, we do argue on the subject of temporary life assurance because it is much nearer to being an accident policy in which a Stamp Duty is

imposed which is not linked with the sum assured. There is a fiat Stamp Duty upon the existence of a policy and the arguments contained within this new Clause deal with the temporary life assurance which is a fairly new feature of the insurance industry.<br/>
In previous years people who travelled abroad or decided to obtain, for a limited period, an insurance against death took out an accident policy because they considered it the right form of cover against the aeroplane crashing or some incident happening while they were abroad. In recent years people have recognised that while travelling abroad, and for other purposes, full life cover is a much better form of cover and this has become accepted in the national practice.<br/>
The tragedy of the present imposition of Stamp Duty is that this is the one aspect of the international insurance market, and it is an expanding one, from which London is completely cut out. It is quite impossible for London to compete on a cover where the rate of premium is 2s. per cent. and the Stamp Duty is 1s. per cent. so that there is a 50 per cent. taxation upon the premium. In persisting with this form of Stamp Duty, even for another year, in this developing market, the Government are ensuring that the British insurance industry shall not be able to participate internationally in this form of assurance.<br/>
I assure the Chief Secretary that this is a fast developing form of assurance and that he should recognise that if London is unable to go in for this form of contract for a further 12 months various re-insurers and insurers abroad will become accustomed to dealing with this form of insurance either on the Continent or in the United States. During that period they will establish further connections and links with these two other developing markets.<br/>
Even if, after a year, the Government decided that it would have been wise to have done this a great deal of goodwill would have been lost. The Chief Secretary mentioned the Lloyd's policy being drawn to have its extension Clause. I think if he looks into my intervention on this he will find the point is covered. The Chief Secretary also mentioned the possibility of avoidance by a series of policies. I must point out that if one has a life policy for a longer period the


importance of the Stamp Duty is minute. On the normal life contract the payment of the Stamp Duty is of no importance at all. If one is taking out a &#x00A3;10,000 policy one pays at the beginning of that policy &#x00A3;5 Stamp Duty. Compared with the total of the benefits at the end of the period it is of minute importance and people are not going to go into complicated procedures to avoid it.<br/>
I can therefore assure the Chief Secretary that if he re-examines this point he will find that no one will be so concerned about the relatively small proportion of the premium and that the Stamp Duty for a 10 or 15 years' policy is such that people will not go into various methods of evasion. That is of little importance. It is of importance where the policy covers travel for one, two, or three weeks, or a month or perhaps even six months.<br/>
7.30 p.m.<br/>
This dismisses the right hon. Gentleman's fourth argument, that if the Clause were accepted the position would be that at four years and eleven months there would be a low Stamp Duty, and that at five years and one month there would be a high one. Even at five years and one month the Stamp Duty, compared with the five-year policy, becomes of little or less importance, and I assure the right hon. Gentleman that the insurance industry and those concerned would not be anxious to continue the existing level of Stamp Duty on policies for more than five years.<br/>
This period, as opposed to any other limit, was chosen because the one sphere where this is likely to develop internationally is the sphere of the Lloyd's market and the surrounding companies, and this would enable them, with their considerable international collections, to bring a considerable volume of premium income to this country.<br/>
The Government have said, and quite rightly, that their endeavour is to encourage exports. They have said that they will do all that is possible within our international agreements to encourage them. This is a form of assistance which they could give to exports. It will cost nothing, but it will bring premiums into this country. In addition, it will save premiums from going out of the country. Thus, the Government would save, not only by increasing exports, but by cutting down outgoings from, for example, international companies with

their head offices in London, who, quite rightly, arrange their short-term temporary life assurance abroad because it is so much more reasonable in cost there than it is in this country because of this ridiculous imposition of the Stamp Duty.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has given us an assurance that he will consider this during the next 12 months, and I would not press the matter to a Division were it not for the fact that, knowing the technical aspects of the problem&#x2014;as the right hon. Gentleman knows I am interested in Lloyd's broking, though my firm is unconnected with this form of assurance&#x2014;I consider that it is in the interests of the country to do something about it to enable us to obtain the international premiums that are available. For this reason, I urge my hon. Friends to divide the Committee.</p>

<p>I tabled a new Clause to the Finance Bill of the following year, but, alas, it was not selected, so it was not possible to debate it. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, there are many items within our Stamp Duty and taxation systems in respect of which one finds anomalies such as this. I make no complaint that the Chancellor did not include this in the Bill. There are many other anomalies which could have been dealt with, but have not been. On this occasion, my hon. Friend has tabled this Clause and has been fortunate enough to have it selected for debate. We have discussed it, and taken up the time of the Committee in doing so.<br/>
Having taken up the Committee's time, I think that the Committee should come to a decision on it.</p>

<p>I would have thought that the right hon. Gentleman would by now have come to the conclusion that this matter needed to be reviewed before the Report stage. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Surrey (Mr. A. Royle), I have an interest in this in that I am a Lloyd's underwriter. I believe that in the past I have had the honour of seeing the Chief


Secretary engaged in the insurance world.<br/>
I would have thought that the Government would have been searching for ways in which to see that the premiums placed on the international market in London were increased. That being so, I would have thought that if this was a matter which required legislation, the Chief Secretary would say, "This is a matter to which the Government must give urgent consideration at once, because we do not see why the London market in this growing business should be prejudiced, while Paris, New York, Munich, and other centres are taking the sort of business which we, and the City, know how to run".<br/>
It astounds me that the Chief Secretary feels that he cannot give us an answer now. I realise that the Government have had a long and difficult Session, and a very tiring one. Perhaps they thought that this was one of the new Clauses which was interesting and rather technical, but nothing more. However technical it is, if it means that more insurance premiums will be paid into London to help the balance of payments position, it is the Government's duty to bring forward legislation to deal with the matter and not merely undertake to consider it during the next two or three months. If the matter were dealt with in the Bill, the Government would be able to say that they had done their duty.<br/>
If someone is competing in the international insurance markets of the world, his position should not be prejudiced by the imposition of some old-fashioned stamp tax which the right hon. Gentleman has admitted is of little value to the Treasury. I am astounded that at this stage of the Bill we have not been given a better answer than we have had from the right hon. Gentleman. If insurance means helping the balance of payments by bringing more premiums into London, and by providing more insurance for the London market, whether we have an interest in it or not.<br/>
I think that it is right to divide the Committee on the direct and clear issue of whether we intend to expand the life insurance markets in London, or to prejudice our position.</p>

<p>I do not wish to deny the Committee the opportunity of dividing as a matter of principle if hon. Gentlemen wish to do so. It goes without saying that, whether they divide or not, I shall look into this to see how quickly it can be dealt with.<br/>
When sitting on the benches opposite, which I wore out for a long time, it is one's duty to put the case with one's best foot forward, but there are more technicalities in this matter than were brought to light during the debate. I did not undertake to do anything before Report, because of the complexities of this matter. I did not think that it would be possible to do anything about it in view of the variety of things which remain to be done before Report.<br/>
I realise that this is a matter which ought to be looked at with the full understanding that I have indicated. If I can do anything before Report, I shall, of course, do so. I shall look at it as soon as I can. I do not want to deceive the Committee into thinking that there is nothing left to do, and that we are all going to play golf between now and that stage of the Bill, because that would not be absolutely accurate. I do not want to affect the decision to divide the Committee. I shall look at the matter again, and if anything can be done before Report it will be done, but if it cannot be done by then, it will be done as soon as may be.</p>

<p>I accept the right hon. Gentleman's reason for being hesitant about committing himself. I recognise that he was provided with a brief on this subject in which there appeared to be a series of technical arguments. As I said earlier, I would not urge my hon. Friend to press this matter to a Division were it not for the fact that I was convinced that the right hon. Gentleman's argument does not stand up to examination.<br/>
I recognise the urgency of this matter in terms of exports. Both sides of the Committee recognise that, because of the balance of payments situation, there is a need to increase exports, and to stress our feelings on this matter, I ask my hon. Friends to divide the Committee.</p>

<p>Where a person carrying on a trade, or an enterprise in husbandry or forestry, disposes of, or of his interest in, assets and acquires other assets, or an interest in other assets, in circumstances to which section 31 of this Act applies, then if part only of the consideration obtained for the disposal is applied in acquiring assets, or an interest in assets, in Class 1 in subsection (6) of section 31 of this Act, and part is retained and applied within five years from the date of the acquisition, or an unconditional contract for the acquisition, of the new assets in carrying out additions or improvements to the new asset, which additions or improvements would qualify for allowances under Parts X or XI of the Income Tax Act, 1952, or under paragraph 16 of Schedule 4 of the Finance Act, 1963, the part so applied in carrying out those additions or improvements shall be deemed for the purposes of section 31 of this Act to be applied in acquiring an asset within the said Clause 1.&#x2014;[<i>Sir M.

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
I hope that I can explain this Clause briefly. It is fortunate for the Opposition and unfortunate for the Government that this long Committee stage has given us the chance to make some elaborations or modifications of matters which we have previously discussed. I hope that I would not be out of order in saying that this Clause stems from the Country Landowners' Association, or in paying my

tribute to the work done by that body both in direct contact with the Treasury and the Inland Revenue and also, of course, in co-operation with the Opposition, in helping to clear some of the fog which hid the meaning and effect of the Bill when it was first published and which is not very much cleared now.<br/>
In our discussions on Clause 31, on the replacement of business assets, the Government accepted the need for some elasticity in the time allowed for the replacement of one asset by another. This was left to the discretion of the Inland Revenue and the Government also agreed to look again at considerations arising from the sale or purchase of goodwill. For that we look for something on Report.<br/>
8.0 p.m.<br/>
Equally&#x2014;and this is relevant to the new Clause, although in an opposite sense&#x2014;it was made clear when we discussed Clause 31 that the value of the asset acquired need not precisely match the value of the asset sold, with particular reference to the case in which the asset acquired&#x2014;a farm, an estate or whatever it might be&#x2014;might be in some respects larger than that required by the purchaser or contain elements unnecessary to the purchaser which must, therefore, be sold off at a subsequent sale.<br/>
This is a related but, in a sense, opposite proposition in that I want to


discuss the situation in which a business asset in good condition is disposed of, voluntarily or compulsorily, and the sum realised is reinvested in a similar business, perhaps of equal size, but in less good condition and which, therefore, would not itself absorb the full sum realised from the sale of the asset and would not become an asset of equal value, which is the real sense of the new Clause, until a considerable sum&#x2014;that is, a part of the proceeds of the disposal&#x2014;had been invested in the improvement of it to make it an asset of equivalent value.<br/>
Perhaps I can best explain the position this way. Farm A is sold in tip-top condition, with first-class modern buildings and with land well drained. With the proceeds, Farm B is bought&#x2014;a good farm but perhaps in poor condition although capable of being fully a match for farm A if the balance of the proceeds is spent on it, perhaps over a period of years. This is where it is related to the other point which the Government accepted when we discussed Clause 31.<br/>
At that time the Government accepted that the Inland Revenue must have some discretion as to the time that elapses between the sale of one asset and the purchase of another. I therefore ask the Government sympathetically to consider that the purchase should not be regarded as complete in itself if it can be shown that there is need for some investment of the proceeds for the improvement of the new asset before it can be said, in the terms of Clause 31, to be a complete replacement of the asset.<br/>
The new Clause seeks to define the improvements or expenditures, following Parts X and XI of the Income Tax Act, 1952, which deal with initial and annual allowances and with expenditure on scientific research. The relevant words in Section 314(1) of that Act are:
<q>.. incurs any capital expenditure on the construction of farmhouses, farm or forestry buildings, cottages, fences or other works &#x2026;</q>
If it were possible that discretion could be given or it could be written into the Bill that account should be taken of work of that type to bring the asset acquired up to the equivalent of the asset disposed of that would be of great assistance to men who find themselves in this situation.<br/>
Part XI of that Act includes a reference to scientific research, and has a par-

ticular reference to sums paid to the Agricultural Research Council. That may be taking the matter wide, although it is a factor. Equally, there is a reference to Schedule 4 of the 1963 Act, which refers to protection against the overflowing of the sea or tidal rivers, although that would seem to take us even wider. However, the Financial Secretary will understand that, if this matter is to be considered at all, one must consider the various factors which might affect the improvement of a farm or estate under certain conditions so that there can be an equivalent exchange of assets.<br/>
As I say, possibly they could be defined more simply. Although I have little experience of these matters of definition, it seems that if the Government are willing for the point to be covered within the discretion of the Inland Revenue, when these general definitions would be of use in deciding what expenditures should be allowed under this provision, as amended by the new Clause or under the undertaking which I hope the Government will give. Without going further into the matter, although some of my hon. Friends may wish to comment on it, I hope that, since this is a sensible and logical elaboration on the point already accepted by the Government, they will be generous on this issue.</p>

<p>As my right hon. Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Sir M. Redmayne) clearly pointed out, the object of the Clause is to clarify the great deal of uncertainty which now exists about the application and interpretation of Clause 31 in the transfer of business assets.<br/>
I am neither a lawyer nor a Parliamentary draftsman, but unless I have misunderstood the position&#x2014;and the Financial Secretary will put me right if I have&#x2014;as the Bill is drafted Clause 31 states, in effect, that liability to tax is deferred only so long as the assets from the sale of the old property are reinvested in a corresponding asset of exactly the same price within 12 months. This may be all right in theory, but&#x2014;</p>

<p>That is the point that we are endeavouring to clear up. This presupposes that the sale and purchase of agricultural property, whether a farm or woodland commercially managed, is a penny-in-the-slot machine process. It is not a question of selling for &#x00A3;X,000 one week and buying for &#x00A3;X,000 within a year, so that the two nicely balance up.</p>

<p>As the hon. and learned Gentleman knows, the realities of life are very much less simple. Consider what happens. First, it is difficult indeed&#x2014;and that is an understatement&#x2014;to find a farm, above all with vacant possession, to purchase within 12 months, no matter what the would-be purchaser might be prepared to pay. Secondly, it is highly unlikely that the vendor of the old farm and the would-be purchaser of the new one would be able to find a farm of the right size, type, character and location to suit all his requirements, let alone within 12 months.<br/>
Thirdly, he may decide that he wants to buy a different type of holding. He may have got fed up with all the problems of milk production&#x2014;particularly after the last Price Review&#x2014;and wants to get out of milk altogether, sell his dairy herd and his farm and buy an arable farm.<br/>
Suppose he finds one he likes and wants to buy it. It may require substantial improvements or repairs. He might want to extend a grain dryer, concrete the yards, and so on. It is ridiculous to suggest that he should not be able to retain a portion of the assets he realised for the sale of the old farm so that he can carry out those improvements without having to pay tax on the difference.<br/>
Suppose that a farm is sold for &#x00A3;50,000 and the seller finds a farm he likes for &#x00A3;40,000. Unless I have misunderstood the position, the vendor and the would-be purchaser, being one and the same man, would be liable for tax on the &#x00A3;10,000 difference, although he

might require, even in the interests of good husbandry, to spend at least &#x00A3;10,000, perhaps spread over a number of years, on improving the farm, a farm of a different type and which he wishes to bring up to date. This is what is worrying almost everyone in the agricultural and forestry industries.<br/>
The odds against finding an agricultural holding or a block of commercially managed woodland for exactly the same price as that received for the sale of the old holding are a million to one. It would be in the interests both of husbandry and forestry if the Capital Gains Tax were not applied to the sum realised when it is slightly larger than the sum the vendor has to pay for the new holding. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will appreciate that this is a serious point which deals with the difficulties of the sale and purchase of all agricultural holdings, that he will listen to our objections and see that in this new Clause there is not only obvious common sense, but experience.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.2042.0" hansard_membership_id="6095" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30175" speakername="Mr. J. E. B. Hill" colnum="2042" time="">
<p>I support this new Clause. Unless it is accepted, Government fiscal policy will be at variance with Government agricultural policy. We understood that the justification for Capital Gains Tax was to prevent people having fairly easy increments to their standard of living or spending power without proportionate exertion of effort, but we find that this would fall on people at difficult times of their earning career. This is characteristic in a change from one farm to another.<br/>
The Financial Secretary told us when we were discussing Clause 31 that a farmer could dispose of surplus assets arising out of the new purchase and not be caught for tax on that, but when we think of the pattern of purchase which is likely to be followed it is clear that, in most cases, in the move to the new farm there will be an indispensable requirement for further capital expenditure on new buildings and other works. If we consider the types of farms available we find that nearly all come into the market because the owner has died or someone has given up, often a non-viable holding. It is implicit in an examination of the agricultural situation by, I believe, all three political parties that there are many holdings which ought to be merged or amalgamated. Both main parties are


not only urging a policy of amalgamation but speaking of grant-aiding amalgamations still further.<br/>
When two farms are amalgamated it is not simply a question of saying that they will run together and that production from both will be bigger, although then there will be only one farm. There always has to be far-reaching reconstruction to allow the amalgamated farms or pieces of land to reach their full potential. The National Agricultural Advisory Service and all expert opinion would say to a farmer&#x2014;if he does not think of it himself&#x2014;that he ought to overhaul the drainage arrangements, modernise the farm buildings and economise on labour to make the new production far more competitive than the old. For all these farm improvements Government grants will be available usually up to one-third of the expenditure.<br/>
8.15 p.m.<br/>
The farmer's difficulty very often, after paying the purchase money and meeting the expenses of the move and the temporary interruption to his business, is to finance the other two-thirds. Therefore, the incidence of Capital Gains Tax, if levied at that point of change, will be precisely at the point when the farmer is unusually short of capital and credit. This is an expense at a very difficult time. In the first years of the move to the new holding the farmer will have to draw in his horns as far as his own standard of living is concerned and concentrate on working up the potential of the new holding.</p>

<p>I am trying to follow the hon. Member's argument, but I confess that I am not following it in relation to amalgamation. If one is considering an amalgamation when a farm has come on to the market, say because the farmer has died, one imagines that it would be amalgamated with a neighbouring farm. The neighbouring farmer will not have sold his farm, nor, as it were, have a capital gain on which tax will be levied on the transfer under Clause 31. I am sure that I have misunderstood the hon. Member's point.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.2043.1" hansard_membership_id="6095" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30175" speakername="Mr. Hill" colnum="2043" time="">
<p>I beg the pardon of the Financial Secretary. I ought to have realised that he would naturally visualise the farmer remaining in one farm and buying another to add to it. I was thinking of the case where the farmer would

have an opportunity of moving to obtain this or more new holdings and putting them together to make a new larger farm. Again, the new farm purchased may have been occupied by an old man and, in order to realise the potential, a great deal of capital would have to be spent in the early years. One of the proposals which the party opposite put forward at the election was to provide easier medium-term credit, say for 10 years, not to purchase the land but to finance essential improvements. It would be particularly unfortunate for Capital Gains Tax to be levied at that point of time.<br/>
We are not asking for remission of tax, but only for a postponement of its collection until the farmer is in a better position to pay it. It is not as though the scale of farming operations need necessarily be large to attract Capital Gains Tax, because there is no exemption limit of &#x00A3;5,000 as at death. There is a case in my constituency where someone occupied a small non-viable mixed farm, and was advised by the National Agricultural Advisory Service to change from uneconomic arable to intensive egg production. Undoubtedly the farm was bought for a few hundreds at the end of the war and it is perhaps now worth &#x00A3;X thousands. He was advised to buy a smaller area of land and equip it with specialised buildings. The form of farming production recommended would call for a great deal of capital expenditure after purchase of the land. It does not follow that this kind of work could be carried out in 12 months. A variety of factors may operate, in addition to the difficulty of deciding exactly what is needed, to postpone the new building. There may be difficulty in getting the site right or the drainage done. All of that might make a postponement for one, two or three more years before the work can be carried out.<br/>
I hope that the Treasury will realise the importance of not penalising farmers when carrying out the very operations we are trying to encourage at the moment of greatest need. If there is a fear in the Treasury mind that the construction might not be carried out and that the farmer might hold the balance of capital gains unexpended on new capital works, perhaps, if thought necessary, a way round that might be found by providing a system of drawback. If one puts up a farm


building one is entitled, if the profits or the income are there, to have a repayment of Income Tax.<br/>
If the Financial Secretary has this difficulty in mind, it might well be that he can devise a system whereby, if there is a delay in erecting the buildings and the Treasury wishes to make sure of the tax, it can be collected but remitted against the execution of the buildings. The essential thing is that the farming business should not be deprived of its capital at the moment that it is most needed.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1965-06-24a.2045.0" hansard_membership_id="9331" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30717" speakername="Mr. Peter Mills" colnum="2045" time="">
<p>I should like to place on record my appreciation of the valuable work that the C.L.A. has done. It has shown initiative and foresight and is to be congratulated.<br/>
I also support this proposed Clause because it could be of tremendous benefit to the West Country in which my constituency is situated. Over the last five years a large number of farmers, having sold their farms in other areas at a very high price, have come to the West Country, taken over a derelict and poor farm, and have started to build it up. Although I am a Devonian and it is said sometimes that we do not like "foreigners" to come into our part of the country, I can honestly say that these farmers have been of tremendous benefit to some of the poorer areas in the West Country. They have taken over these poorer farms and, with the extra capital that they have obtained from the sale of their better farms elsewhere, they have done a first-rate job.<br/>
Of course, this takes time. These improvements cannot be made overnight. Time and capital are needed. But these people have shown us how to do it. Some of the bigger farmers who have come into the West Country, with what I would call surplus capital from the sale of better farms, have shown what can be done with their knowledge and the extra capital available. But time is needed and they certainly do not want to be taxed in the early years when they are starting to build up and restore the poorer farms that they have taken over. This is a worthy Clause. It would enable the West Country to help these men who are injecting fresh capital and restoring these poorer farms.<br/>
Another point is that when one co-operates with the N.A.A.S. and works under the farm improvement scheme it is always necessary for the farmer to pay the whole of the improvement cost right away. He gets his grant when the work is completed. He does not want to be taxed again in the early days, in the sense of being hindered in finding the necessary capital in order to convert some of these poorer farms into viable farms. I therefore hope the Minister will consider this Clause carefully.</p>

<p>I am a chartered surveyor who is yearly&#x2014;I should like to say "daily" but I am afraid that is not the case&#x2014;selling farms, and I support this Clause.<br/>
I know of the practical difficulties involved in selling farms. Farm sales usually take place during the period May-September, and then probably no more farms become available until the next May-September period. It is very difficult to find another farm of the type one requires. One may go to one farm after another before one finds a farm which suits one's client. From bitter experience I can say how long it takes to get improvements done. The N.A.A.S. is an exceptionally good organisation, but it deals with public money and, therefore, has to be careful. We have to get out plans and estimates in triplicate, and very often it may take another two years to prepare the estimates and the plans and to carry out the work.<br/>
For these reasons, which I offer as a Member who deals frequently with the sale and purchase of land on behalf of clients, I hope that the Financial Secretary will be able to accept the Clause and find a way round these difficulties.</p>

<p>May I say sincerely that I have found this short debate very interesting. I am not a farmer, but for a number of years I have been a practising barrister on the Midland Circuit and we have some very litigious farmers on that circuit, as a result of which I have picked up a smattering of farming knowledge.<br/>
My father, who was also a barrister, used to say that the advantage of a career at the Bar was that one picked up what he called "Woolworth knowledge"&#x2014;nothing worth over 6d., but it covered a very wide range. I have got a little


beyond the 6d. range as a result of this and the earlier debates that we had on Clause 31.<br/>
This proposed new Clause is entitled "Disposal of assets in husbandry or forestry", but it has been framed very simply by the draftsmen so as not to appear to single out that industry for special favour, in wide and general terms which would cover any farm or trade. May I remind the Committee that the intention of Clause 31 is primarily to help the removal and expansion of industry. I said on 31st May&#x2014;it seems a long time ago now&#x2014;at column 1184 of the OFFICIAL REPORT that the object of the Clause was
<q>to try to afford relief in such a way as to ensure that the Capital Gains Tax does not inhibit the physical development and expansion of industry and commerce."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 31st May, 1965; Vol. 713, c. 1184.]</q>
I did not mention agriculture in that phrase&#x2014;</p>

<p>Some say that it is the biggest industry, while others like to think of it as being something different from an industry. Be that as it may, agriculture benefits singularly well compared with others from the effects of Clause 31. The reason for this is a curious one, which is that the definition of the trade of agriculture is very wide and is accepted by the courts as being wide.<br/>
During our debates I was given an example of a shopkeeper who had a pharmacy and then took on a sweetshop. I was asked, whether he would be able to benefit from Clause 31. I had to say "No, because it is a different trade," whereas when I was asked "What about the big farmer?", or, as the hon. Member for Windsor (Sir C. Mott-Radclyffe) said, if a dairy farmer is tired of dairy farming because the Government decide to concentrate on arable farming, or for some other reason, I said that he can still benefit because it is the same trade. The trade of agriculture is exceedingly wide.<br/>
I use perhaps a rather tendentious phrase in talking about the ability of "switching" within the agricultural trade which is possible under this Clause, and the result of Clause 31&#x2014;I confess it is not that we particularly intended it or set about trying to produce this result&#x2014;is to

give very great assistance of which others may indeed be envious.<br/>
8.30 p.m.<br/>
I stress that the purpose of Clause 31 is to give a relief to those people who realise one capital asset and reinvest in another. It is to the extent that the capital gain is reinvested during that operation that there is this relief, which is not an exemption but a deferment of the liability to the Capital Gains Tax. It is, therefore, a relief limited to a particular operation, a transfer of business assets. It is not to be looked upon as a relief in itself in abstract so that, if there is an unused part of the relief, one could set about trying to find some way in which the unused part can be absorbed.<br/>
We were talking a few minutes ago about the X figure, and it is a convenient way of discussing these questions. If a man sells his business, whatever it may be, a farm or any other business, for &#x00A3;X and he buys a new one for &#x00A3;X or &#x00A3;X-plus, he can enjoy the benefit of Clause 31 because he transfers his capital gain into a new investment. But if his new investment is not &#x00A3;X but is &#x00A3;X-minus, then, if he can benefit from the Clause at all, he can benefit to only a limited extent. It will depend on the extent to which the difference is related to the amount of the gain. If it is &#x00A3;X minus Y, and Y is less than the capital gain he realised on the disposal of the assets, he will still get some partial benefit; but otherwise not. So what one is looking at is the extent to which the old asset is reinvested in the new.<br/>
Right hon. and hon. Members concerned particularly with the interests of agriculture point out that a man may sell his old farm and buy a new farm for which the actual purchase price is less but he wants to invest the balance of the money in bringing up the standard of the new farm and making it a going asset. It may be a derelict farm which has been allowed to fall below proper standards and he wants to invest his money in it, bringing it up to a proper working asset. This may take some time.<br/>
Therefore, the new Clause is framed in terms of allowing a five-year period of set-off in respect of the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the business. I say "business," but let us assume that it is limited to farms, although, as I said, the


new Clause is framed in wider terms. The proposal is, as I say, to allow the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the old farm to be set off against any expenditure during the five years which would qualify for capital allowances or the special allowances under Section 214 of the Income Tax Act for agriculture.<br/>
I remind hon. Members that we have agreed in Committee, on Clause 31, not to be tied rigidly to the 12 months' period, and there is a discretion in the Revenue now to extend it. I gave an assurance to the Committee about the way in which we contemplate that the Revenue will exercise that discretion, and, perhaps, in order to avoid any confusion, I might quote my own words, which were, naturally, carefully chosen:
<q>Our intention is that the Board's discretion will be exercised in special cases, but in the normal way one would expect replacement to take place within 12 months. The Board would be prepared to exercise its discretion in a case where it was shown that it was not possible to replace the asset within the ordinary time limit by the use of ordinary foresight and prudence. If that can be established, if the person can show that, acting reasonably with ordinary foresight and prudence, he was not able to replace within the 12 months period, the Revenue would be ready to use its power to allow a longer period."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 31st May, 1965; Vol. 713, c. 1178.]</q>
The point made is that that is all very well, but in farming the replacement of an asset includes the additional expenditure on bringing it up to standard, and this may be spread over a period of time; it cannot be done very quickly.<br/>
Perhaps I should explain generally, not limiting it to farming, but to supplement what I said earlier on Clause 31, that within the proper time limits the Board will take a broad view of what capital expenditure on the acquisition of an asset qualifies for the relief, and it will regard it as including not only the original costs of the acquisition but also any expenditure which is necessary to put the asset into going order. I think that that is a reasonable proposition and one of general application. That is why I put it generally, not only in terms of farming.<br/>
I would draw the distinction and make it clear that this is not intended to extend to the type of recurring annual expense which in the case of a trader would be allowed as a deduction in computing his income for the year in which the assets were purchased. We are talking only

about capital expenditure in order to put the asset into proper-going order. On farming, all I can say is that if a farmer who is in the situation which has been described can make out his case and show that within the 12 months' period it was not possible for him, acting reasonably, and with reasonable prudence, to carry out that necessary capital expenditure in order to put the new farm which he had purchased into proper-going order, and that he needs a longer period, that application will be fairly considered on the basis of the principles I have stated. The test is in this sense: is it true capital expenditure to bring the farm up to the required standard, and is the period within which that was done a proper period with the use of reasonable prudence and foresight?<br/>
I hope I have made it clear that it is not that one needs to look upon this as an unused relief which can just be mopped up by any future capital expenditure, but if the actual operation of the transfer of the old asset to the new asset takes more than 12 months, once this is fairly established to the satisfaction of the inspector it will be accepted as being part of the transfer operation, and can include further capital expenditure beyond the original purchase price.<br/>
The example was given of a grain dryer. A farmer may have had a farm with a grain dryer and sold the farm and bought another and want to establish a grain dryer on it. One knows the time that it takes to get the necessary permits, permissions and building licences needed within a 12 month period.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is correct, but the farmer still has to get the building inspector to look at it. All these things take time, but as long as they are done within a reasonable time I think people will find that the Revenue will treat the matter reasonably.<br/>
But that is as far as we think it would be right to go. For these reasons, I ask the Committee to be content to leave the matter within the field of this discretion that lies wihin the Revenue. I could not accept a Clause framed in these terms, which would allow a five-year period. Extended over the whole field of trade,


it would not only be extremely difficult to supervise if as wide as that but would also have administrative complications, necessitating the reopening of tax assessments over past years. The Clause would go a great deal wider than hon. Gentlemen opposite intend.</p>

<p>Would the hon. and learned Gentleman clarify a point? He said that the Inland Revenue would consider whether or not the period put forward by the farmer was reasonable. He will appreciate that it may be very difficult for the farmer to have clear ideas about what he ought to do from an agricultural point of view at the very beginning. He may think that the new farm will support a dairy herd with modern dairy buildings, costing perhaps &#x00A3;5,000 to &#x00A3;10,000. It may not be certain that that is the right thing to do until he has been in the farm a year. He may just have a hunch about it.<br/>
At the same time, he has to decide to buy that farm and therefore I hope that, as soon as the sale has taken place and presumably there is liability to Capital Gains Tax, he should be able to give the Revenue a broad outline of his plans but not necessarily be expected to specify exact details.<br/>
This may depend upon advice from the Government. I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will meet the problem. Probably the farmer has to buy before he sells and is, therefore, heavily committed. I hope that the Revenue will be sympathetic and not expect to see a cut-and-dried plan within 12 months for, in many cases, it would be difficult to produce one.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Financial Secretary for his approach to the Clause. I hope, however, that we can get clarification on many of the points of substance put forward. The case argued by my right hon. and hon. Friends is very strong and the way in which the hon. and learned Gentleman has gone a long way to meet it shows that he accepts the point. However, clarification is needed of exactly how far the discretion of the Revenue will be able to be exercised.<br/>
Will it apply to forestry as well as agriculture? The new Clause would apply

to enterprises in forestry as well and I should imagine that there would be no difficulty in that. State trading in forestry enterprises would be covered by the same discretion that the hon. and learned Gentleman has mentioned for agriculture.<br/>
Then again, there is the case of the farmer who buys a farm which is perhaps not in a very good state. It is very difficult and most unlikely that he will be able to know exactly what is wanted, certainly in the first few months. Then there is the question of how long and how far the discretion is to be operated. I hope that, if a farmer is able to give the Revenue a broad outline of the kind of improvements necessary, it will look sympathetically at the case and exercise discretion in his favour, even though it may be that it will take, say, five years to get improvements and to know just what expenditure will be needed.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman must not forget that a farmer deals with Government Departments and it takes considerable time certainly for farm improvement grants to be arranged. Presumably, these would form the bulk of the improvements we are talking about. It would be wrong if, because of delay like that, a farmer were denied the ability to use Clause 31 for whatever remains of his capital from the selling of his old property for improving the new.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman referred to putting the farm into going order. This would, of course, include all the necessary repairs and the bringing of the farm buildings, the cottages and the fences up to proper standard. I imagine that that is what is meant. Will this discretion also include the sort of farm mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Torrington (Mr. Peter Mills)? Farmers moving to the West Country somethimes get rather out-of-date farms and modernisation is needed. This has been done in the past with the spare assets which have come from the sale of a farm. I hope that if a farmer has modernisation plans the Inland Revenue will be able to accept this as a proper and right use of the remaining assets of the sale of the original farm. If the Financial Secretary can assure us on this point, we shall be able to go a long way in accommodating him in his request to us to withdraw the new Clause.<br/>
8.45 p.m.<br/>
This is a vital matter for the farming industry. It is a pity that there is not a Minister from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food present. There are at least three Ministers in the Department, and I should have hoped that one would be able to sit, although mute, on the Government Front Bench to hear the strength of feeling which has been expressed on this Clause, and which will be expressed on subsequent Clauses.<br/>
The Financial Secretary has gone a long way to accepting the principle of what we are trying to do. If he can give assurances on the three points to which I have referred&#x2014;forestry and agriculture, the length of time during which the Inland Revenue will exercise its discretion in respect of the outline plan for improvements and repairs, and modernisation&#x2014;we shall be able to do what he has asked us to do.</p>

<p>I think that I can help to some extent. First, forestry and horticulture are clearly covered. Secondly, I do not think that it would be right for me to try to define the period further than I have done. We are here concerned essentially with something which we have agreed to entrust to the discretion of the Revenue, and it would not be right for me to try to define how it will use its discretion. It is its discretion and not mine. All I can do is to state the principles on which it is proposed that it should exercise its discretion. What the proper period is in any particular case must be decided in the light of the facts of the case. I think that it would be exceptional if it were to extend for five years. What one envisages is the work which is undertaken when the farmer moves into the new farm.<br/>
I was asked with reference to what I concede was a general phrase about putting the farm into going order whether that would include modernising. "Modernising" is also a somewhat vague term, but I know what the hon. Member for Cornwall, North (Mr. Scott-Hopkins) means. I can help him to this extent. If the programme of modernisation&#x2014;I gave the example of a grain dryer, and farm buildings may be necessary for a modern dairy herd, and so on&#x2014;is part of a plan on which the farmer embarks

when he acquires the new farm&#x2014;I agree that he may not be able to pinpoint precisely all the details of it, but if it is within the scope of a plan of capital expenditure to bring that farm up to the required standard, and it is obviously in the farmer's interest to establish this with the Revenue&#x2014;the fact that it is not practicable for him to complete the programme within 12 months will be accepted by the Inland Revenue.<br/>
What we have in mind is not merely the repair and rectification of defects in the farm if it has been allowed to become derelict, but expenditure to add to the capital assets of the farm, where necessary, to bring it up to the required standard to enable it to be farmed properly.<br/>
I hope that I have not gone too far, but I also hope that I have gone far enough for hon. Members opposite.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Clause be read a Second time.<br/>
We now move back from Capital Gains Tax to Income Tax. The new Clause is intended to clarify and, I hope, rectify an anomaly in Income Tax in that only too well trodden field of royalties. It has always been in the tradition of the Income Tax Acts that royalties have been regarded as income. As rates of taxation have increased, that has inevitably become an increasing source of grievance among those who receive royalties, because the royalty owner always has the feeling that what is being taxed is his own capital.<br/>
Two years ago, in the discussions on the 1963 Finance Bill, a good deal was said about allowances for mineral depletion. In the course of one of those debates, a precedent was set&#x2014;which I hope will be continued by the Treasury Bench&#x2014;that without accepting the Amendment in question, some useful advice was given from the Treasury Bench to those in receipt of royalties. I believe that that advice was much appreciated and that it has been of great use. I commend that precedent to the Chief Secretary as one which might well be followed in these debates.<br/>
The background to the new Clause is Section 37 of the Finance Act, 1963, which gives relief to those who are mineral operators, entrepreneurs or whatever the correct term is. The Section was confined to the operator and did not in any way cover the owner. It gave certain annual allowances at varying rates. These are set out in subsection (2) of the Section and are designed to give an Income Tax allowance to an operator who carries on his trade and who for the purpose of it has actually incurred capital expenditure on the acquisition of the minerals which he operates.<br/>
The object of the new Clause is to give a comparable concession to an owner who grants a licence to an operator under the terms of which&#x2014;these are still the ordinary terms of such leases or licences&#x2014;the owner gets a royalty for the minerals. The object of the Clause is to put the owner who enters into a lease or licence of that kind on the same footing for Income Tax as the operator who has launched on his own operation in the terms set out in Section 37 of the 1963 Act. The Chief Secretary may

be able to convince me that in some way the owner is already covered to this extent. If so, I and those who have advised me have not been able to satisfy ourselves of it. Equally, he may be able to give advice that is as helpful as was that given two years ago by one of his predecessors on the Treasury Bench. I ask that the new Clause be accepted in this form so as to put the owner on a footing comparable with that of the operator.<br/>
The new Clause has a proviso, because there are different ways of carrying out these things. The proviso has regard to the case that can happen, in which the transaction is not wholly in terms of royalty but, perhaps, partly in terms of royalty and partly in terms of premium. It is not the object of the new Clause to harm, so to speak, the Revenue by getting an allowance twice over for the owner and the operator simultaneously. We are trying to get an allowance for either one or the other. It is really in order to remove what appears to be a present anomaly, in that the owner is not covered, that I ask the right hon. Gentleman to accept the new Clause.</p>

<p>As the asset in question is a wasting asset, it seems desirable that an allowance should be paid to whoever had the capital which is represented by the wasting asset. To some extent, this new Clause links up with the previous one. A farmer might well find that he had bought a new farm on which there was some gravel for which there was permission to extract. In buying the new farm, he would have to pay the full capital value of the gravel. He would not want to sell it off because, with the gravel gone, the land would have to be restored after extraction in order to be used for farming operations. In such circumstances, it would be undesirable if an allowance for the wasting of a capital asset were not given to the farmer.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. More) expressed the hope that we would either accept the new Clause or be prepared to give some advice. At the Treasury, we always much prefer to give advice than anything else. I am sorry that I cannot accept the new Clause, for the simple reason, as I shall explain, that I do not think that the hon. Gentleman is wholly right in say-in that the person here concerned is on the


same footing as the operator, which is the essence of his argument.<br/>
Since the 1963 legislation was passed we have regarded the operator as a trader, so to speak, who wins minerals in order to sell them. Anything that enters into that cost is just the same as anything which enters into the cost of any other goods that a trade acquires with a view to selling. The so-called capital costs to which the hon. Gentleman referred are, in effect, part of the costs of acquiring the goods which he is then in a position to sell&#x2014;I am talking purely now of the operator. It is on that philosophy that an allowance is given for the capital cost spread so as to be appropriate.<br/>
I suggest that that is an entirely different situation from that situation of a lessor, because the lessor, by and large, and certainly not as part of his normal lease or licence, does not incur any capital costs at all. Does the hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. J. E. B. Hill) wish to dissent from that suggestion?</p>

<p>In the case I cited, the man quite obviously incurred a capital cost. The farmer bought a farm that had workable gravel on it. He had to pay for the value of the gravel. He does not want it, but it is there. He wishes to get rid of the gravel, but does not want to sell the land, because he wants to retain the land when restored after the gravel has been extracted.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I have not made myself sufficiently clear. The capital costs which the operator incurs are the costs of providing buildings, plants and equipment on which allowances are granted. There is no comparable capital expenditure by the lessor or the landowner who leases or licences for these purposes. On that basis the two codes are not on all fours.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether we would offer any advice. Considering Capital Gains Tax, as opposed to Corporation Tax or Income Tax, and, to make it simple, taking the straightforward case of the landowner who after Budget day acquires a piece of land on which minerals of some kind are discovered, and assuming that he lets the mineral rights; the minerals are won and the value of the land is then diminished; if he then proceeds to sell the land, he will

sell it at a loss and the loss will be equal to the diminution in value as a result of the royalties or part of the royalties.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman is suggesting that that part of the royalties should be allowed for and should not be subject to Income Tax as part of ordinary income and that it would reduce the value of the asset. However, the landowner would have made a loss which would be an allowable deduction from any realisable capital profit which he had made, or which he would make later on, not necessarily at identically the same rate. That is the way to look at it.<br/>
I can only repeat that there is no true comparison between the operator who incurs fresh capital costs which are divided over a period, so as to represent the true cost of acquiring goods which he then sells, and the landowner who receives royalties which are subject to Income Tax and Surtax in the same way and who incurs no capital costs and is therefore not entitled to any special allowance in that way. However, if as a result of the total operation the owner suffers a realisable capital loss, if he sells, that is available for set-off against future capital gains. In those circumstances, I imagine that I shall not be pressed to accept the new Clause.</p>

<p>Although the Chief Secretary has been his usual persuasive self, and I expect that he is as glad as the rest of the Committee and I am that this is the last new Clause which we are to discuss, I am sorry that he is not in as accommodating a mood as his hon. and learned Friend the Financial Secretary on the previous new Clause. Although he has been persuasive, his argument was not up to its usual standard of clarity and forcefulness.<br/>
I accept that the positions of the lessor and the operator are not exactly on all fours, but, as the right hon. Gentleman has accepted, the lessor has a diminishing or depreciating asset. Of course it is true that if the minerals had been worked out, he would have sustained a capital loss and been able to receive any allowance in operation at the time. But what the right hon. Gentleman is saying is that whenever mineral rights are worked out, the only way in which the lessor or owner can get any compensation is to sell immediately. But in many cases this will have


been a diminishing asset for many years, as with the example of the working of china clay, tin or gravel. In many cases disposal will not take place and the diminished asset will remain the property of the original lessor or owner, in which case there is to be no allowance of any kind.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow (Mr. More) made the point extremely cogently that we are trying to find some method whereby some small relief can be given to the lessor for the facet that over a period of many years he has been in possession of a dimishing asset. Although the Chief Secretary has obviously closed his mind to our suggestion in the new Clause, I hope that he will look at the matter again with his usual sympathy. Not long ago he said that there was nothing the Treasury Bench liked more than looking at something sympathetically and then doing nothing. I hope that he will do the former and not the latter.<br/>
I hope that he will give the assurance that he will look at this matter sympathetically yet again to see whether anything can be done, because there is a case for doing something for the lessor or owner of mineral rights, not necessarily on all fours with what is done for the operator, and I accept that, but something which would be only justice. I hope that the Chief Secretary will, in his accommodating way, come half way to meet us on this.</p>

So, just as in the course of time a capital gain comes to be realised and becomes assessed for Capital Gains Tax, so in the course of time this diminution in capital value would be realised and would be a set-off.

<p>I beg to move, That the Schedule be read a Second time.<br/>
I do not think that the Committee would expect a long explanation of this matter, because it is straightforward, the language is simple, and the notions underlying it are well understood by hon. Members on both sides of the Committee. It would, nevertheless, be courteous to refer to the matter shortly.<br/>
This Schedule relates to the Clause dealing with forestalling, that is to say the possibility of a company having decided to declare, in advance of Corporation Tax, a dividend in excess of what they would otherwise have done, with a view to escaping Income Tax which would otherwise be payable. The Schedule deals with the problem of subsidiary companies. Where a full subsidiary is concerned, it is not the philosophy of the Government to separate the subsidiary from the parent, but to regard a dividend paid by a subsidiary to a parent or a fellow subsidiary as an internal transaction, as it is.<br/>
The Schedule makes it clear that a dividend paid to a minority shareholder&#x2014;not a dividend paid to a parent or a fellow subsidiary&#x2014;would still, of course, be charged in respect of any excess dividend paid to that minority shareholder in the company if an excess dividend had been declared.<br/>
The Schedule goes on to describe the test of whether it is a subsidiary or fellow subsidiary and adopts the Profits

Tax test of 75 per cent., direct or indirect ownership. This is a test which is adopted from Profits Tax, it is familiar to practitioners and it seems to be a reasonable test. There are other provisions with regard to grouping which are, perhaps, reasonably straightforward. The rest is in language which "he who runs may read", and it would not be right for me to detain the Committee any longer.</p>

<p>I do not want to detain the Committee more than a few moments, but there is one important point which I think should be made. The Chief Secretary has said that the policy underlying the Clause and the new Schedule is that one should not separate the parent company from the subsidiary. It is also true that the idea of having a standard profit and relating this to the increase in profits and the standard dividend to the increase in dividend is to prevent forestalling. I should like to draw to his attention the fact that the principle which he has outlined&#x2014;that we should not separate the parent company from the subsidiary&#x2014;appears to have been applied only in the case of subsidiaries within the United Kingdom.<br/>
I should be glad if he would confirm whether it is the Government's intention to separate subsidiaries overseas from parent companies in the United Kingdom, or whether the principle which he has enunciated is of universal application. An individual subsidiary in this country may have a standard dividend of 100 which subsequently go up to 130. If there is the same relationship in its profits&#x2014;also 100 to 130&#x2014;it would not be regarded as forestalling and would not come within the scope of the Clause 78. On the other hand, for a subsidiary overseas the situation as the Schedule is now drafted appears to be different. The total profit of a concern with a subsidiary overseas may be 100 in the standard period, and then go up to 130 in the period 1966&#x2013;67. It should then be permissible for the dividend to be increased from 100 to 130 in the same way.<br/>
But if the parent company in this country has an increase in profits overseas and they are not all remitted as dividends from the overseas country to this country, we may find that the United Kingdom parent company will be penalised because of the way the Schedule is now drafted.<br/>
I will repeat the point because it is difficult to understand. The principal company in this country will be penalised if, although its profits have gone up from &#x00A3;100 to &#x00A3;130&#x2014;both overseas and in this country&#x2014;it does not remit all the profits to this country. It could be argued that in most instances it is possible to increase dividends from abroad, but that would result in the company being charged increased withholding tax in the country overseas.<br/>
In these circumstances, I suggest that the Chief Secretary should include in the Schedule a provision whereby if the parent company is located in this country overseas subsidiaries are treated in the same way as subsidiaries in this country. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will clarify the position and say whether or not it is intended to treat overseas subsidiaries in the same way as United Kingdom subsidiaries.</p>

<p>This is a new Schedule of 131 lines and the Government were kind enough at the commencement of the Corporation Tax to issue a White Paper, Cmnd. 2646, which I have no doubt all hon. Gentlemen opposite read with avid interest and have understood all its points. I cannot understand why the Committee has not had a proper explanation of these 131 lines. It is regrettable that a complicated Schedule such as this should come up at this stage of the Finance Bill without our being given an adequate explanation of it.<br/>
The Chief Secretary, probably alone, knows the purpose of the Schedule and that it is to prevent parent companies from taking excessive dividends from subsidiaries in the year 1965, thus improving their standard dividend. However, if we consider a company whose year ends at the end of the calendar year, 31st December, 1965, in this instance, it is only the dividend received during the calendar year which should affect its standard dividend and I cannot understand why sub-paragraph 3(1) refers to dividends up to 5th April, 1966.<br/>
One could have the position where one is making up accounts to the end of December, 1965, for the standard dividend, but, as I read the Schedule, it takes it another three months from the point of view of dividends received. We have had a lot of talk about overspill in our discussion of the Bill. This, however, is taking a 12-month period, is taking dividends for 15 months, which is more like overkill than overspill. Will the Chief Secretary, between now and Report, have a look at this valid point to see whether in the new Schedule the year 1965&#x2013;66 should not be deleted?<br/>
Sub-paragraph 5(1) refers to "income tax payable", but do those words mean only that the tax payable is the United Kingdom tax before the deduction of foreign tax credits? The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that this could make a tremendous difference to the standard dividend of a particular group of companies. Sub-paragraph 4(2,<i>c</i>) states:
<q>&#x2026; by treating as profits of the company as the profits of the companies in the year 1965.</q>
I assume, and I would like confirmation of the fact, that this merely means that the profits of the company include those profits which are treated as profits because of that sub-paragraph.<br/>
I appreciate that these are technical points and that, at this hour, the right hon. Gentleman may not be able to answer them off the cuff. If not, I trust that he will consider them between now and Report and will, if there is any valadity in them, table an Amendment on Report.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) raised a very valid point on this grouping Schedule. If there are five subsidiary companies, four of which are United Kingdom companies and one an overseas company, one can take only the four United Kingdom companies for the grouping. If one United Kingdom company has increased its dividend and another has decreased its dividend, the two are aggregated and, provided that does not increase the standard, it is all right.<br/>
As we read the Schedule the overseas company is excluded from the grouping. The reason for bringing forward this point is not at all for tax


avoidance purposes. The whole question of forestalling under Clause 48 is a once-and-for-all standard set up under the Bill. If there are four United Kingdom companies and one overseas company and if we are to group the United Kingdom companies, there is no reason why we should not be able to group the five including the overseas company.<br/>
I have read paragraph 4 of the new Schedule many times, but I am still confused. Probably all other hon. Members understand it, but I find it extremely complicated. During the whole discussion on Corporation Tax the Chief Secretary and his colleagues on the Treasury Bench have made great play of the fact that this will simplify our tax system, but paragraph 4 is so complicated that if the Chief Secretary could give a brief explanation, not only would I be delighted, but I am sure that his hon. Friends and my hon. Friends would also be delighted to hear it.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can deal first with the questions raised by the hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Mr. William Clark). He asked about the year 1965&#x2013;66. The Schedule refers only to a proportion of 1965&#x2013;66. There is no more than that and I do not think there is cause for any anxiety.<br/>
The hon. Member asked two other questions with his usual clarity, but, in order that I shall not possibly misunderstand a single syllable of what he said, I prefer to have the opportunity of reading very carefully the report of his speech in HANSARD. If there is any reason to do anything about it I shall, of course, either communicate with the hon. Member or put a clarifying, consequential Amendment down on Report.<br/>
On the point of substance raised by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) one is not entitled to make the basic assumption implicit in his argument that dividends of an overseas company should be taken into account unless they are remitted. The hon. Member drew attention to the fact that we can have regard to a domestic company's dividends and asked why we should not include a non-domestic company's dividends and profits also. The non-domestic company's dividends may not affect the situation at

all. Whether they are included or not it is a comparison of like with like.<br/>
What we are concerned with here is the possibility of forestalling for the purpose of tax avoidance in one year only. We are concerned only with one year, and because it is for one year only we were happy to accept the Amendment moved by the right hon. Member for Bexley (Mr. Heath) dealing with motive. Once we have dealt with the matter of motive we need not get bogged down with these considerations because that will solve the situation. Any dividend paid in the year that we are considering, which clearly was paid in good faith, is not a dividend to which the forestalling provisions would apply, where one would calculate the excess amount and charge tax in a way which otherwise would not arise&#x2014;that is to say, account to the Revenue for tax because tax had already been deducted at source and paid in the ordinary way.<br/>
Therefore, in view of the Amendment to which I have referred, which has been incorporated in the Bill, all these problems are now put on one side. The complication of trying to take account of the tax legislation of foreign countries where subsidiaries might exist is far too difficult for us to bring into account, for a comparison which would be necessary, any of the figures involved. It would be far more simple and much more in the interests of the companies concerned that we should adopt the simple expedient&#x2014;and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of this&#x2014;of having the motive test, and that will end the matter.<br/>
I repeat what I have said before, the businessman in future, once Corporation Tax is running, will for the first time know immediately and without any difficulty broadly what his tax liability is. He has never been able to know that up till now&#x2014;never. He always had to consult professional colleagues to find out.</p>

<p>My professional colleagues will be relieved in view of what the hon. Gentleman says.<br/>

there should be certain difficulties which one has to overcome, especially when we are dealing with it in a very short Bill&#x2014;I repeat, a very short Bill&#x2014;of taxation largely by reference. May I repeat yet again&#x2014;for the future, when Corporation Tax is running, the life of the businessman for tax purposes will be simplicity itself.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Schedule be read a Second time.<br/>
This is another series of somewhat complicated provisions which are required for the purpose of transition to lead us into the world of simplicity itself.<br/>
The provisions of general application in this new Schedule concerns the overspill relief for, firstly, the former overseas trading corporations and, secondly, groups of companies and associated companies. The Schedule also contains a revised version of the rules which were formerly found in Clause 79(5) which dealt with the case where companies have entered into arrangements providing for a particular relationship to be maintained between the dividends that each pays. I think these provisions will be of particular assistance to companies in the position, for example, of the Shell companies, which have been referred to a number of times during our debates, which have such an agreement, in their case with Dutch associates.<br/>
Hon. Members will have noticed that the Schedule as originally put down has been amended in a number of respects, and I should perhaps explain that the main reason for the amendment was to make the Schedule apply only if the company so elects. The automatic application of the grouping provisions could have worked to the disadvantage of some companies. The original Schedule also failed to allow an excess of unused credit in the related period to be carried out to a parent company, and this has now been provided for in paragraph 3(3).<br/>
I think that is all I need say in introducing the new Schedule. If hon. Members have any points to raise, I shall be glad to try at least to answer them.</p>

Dr. King, I am sure that everyone will wish to thank you very much for all that you have done during our proceedings in Committee. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I know that all hon. and right hon. Members on both sides of the Committee feel this quite sincerely.<br/>
The point about automatic grouping which was raised on the original Schedule is dealt with quite adequately in the new Schedule, and we thank the Chancellor of the Exchequer for putting it down. However, the Chief Secretary's reference to "simplicity itself" allows me to draw the attention of the Committee&#x2014;I had intended to do it anyway&#x2014;to paragraph 2(1), which begins:
<q>For purposes of the principle section a company which has at any time been an overseas trade corporation shall be treated as if it had never been an overseas trade corporation &#x2026;</q>
Obviously, this is simplicity itself, the sort of simplicity which, of course, keeps the Chief Secretary's profession well in business.<br/>
Seriously, on that point, I put this question to the Financial Secretary. Is it absolute that any O.T.C. may opt if it so desires? It has been put to me that there may be exceptions, and I should like it to be clearly stated that, as far as the Treasury knows, opting on grouping is definitely open.<br/>
This new Schedule means that the Treasury is now accepting the notional method of assessment in the calculation for transitional relief. Initially, we believed that the Government would not accept this. The question I put now is this: if they will have it in this case, why are they not willing to use the notional assessment in other cases where there is particular hardship? I shall not go over all the examples of hardship discussed during the debate on Clause 79, to which this Schedule relates, but we know of these cases, and it might well be that

a notional assessment as an alternative would deal with the problem which they raise. As the Government have accepted notional assessment in regard to O.T.C.s for the purpose of transitional relief, why not get themselves out of their problem by accepting it in other instances particularly where hardship arises?<br/>
As I understand paragraph 3(1), it means that a company Z may, if it wishes, make an election in relation to company Y if company Y is one of a group of companies owned by company Z. This is plain enough as far as it goes, but what is not clear is whether company Y could elect to do exactly the same for one of its own subsidiaries, company M. I believe that this would be obvious if company M was directly related to the main company Z, but is it so if it could not be done directly between company Z and company M? This is a very technical point, but I have given the hon. and learned Gentleman notice of the question so that I am not taking him by storm in this instance.<br/>
9.45 p.m.<br/>
We have now had 153&#x00BD; hours of debate in Committee on the Bill. For those who believe that one could glibly throw the Bill into Standing Committee, I suggest that if we did that with a Committee stage lasting 153 hours and the Standing Committee sat the normal two days a week and 2&#x00BD; hours each of those days, it would take to the middle of December to get through the Committee stage.</p>

<p>Although I have not been in the Chamber today until now, and had not intended to intervene&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] I cannot let this point pass. It would have been perfectly all right, surely, to have sent the old part of the Bill to a Standing Committee and to have dealt with the new legislation in this Chamber. That might have saved a tremendous amount of time for the House, as well as a great amount of strain on hon. Members.</p>

<p>I had no intention of debating the matter, Dr. King, because I


knew that I should immediately be out of order.<br/>
It is important to realise that the Schedule does not correct the two main criticisms which are being made about transitional relief. It should be quite definite that on the matter of transitional relief the Schedule does not meet the point of being able to deal with the long-term position of investment overseas, because investment overseas will still suffer according to the Schedule.<br/>
Also, the Schedule does not meet the second main point that we make about transitional relief, and that is that it is not fair all the way across the board the way it implies. That is why I come back to the initial question that I asked. Would the Chancellor consider in the cases of hardship the possibility of the notional assessment being used for transitional relief in these instances? If I could have an assurance on that, we should not wish to divide the Committee on the Schedule, because it gives easement compared with the original Bill.</p>

<p>I feel like saying to the right hon. Gentleman, "No such luck". This is just the swan song for this particular chorus.<br/>
The hon. Member for Reading (Mr. Peter Emery) asked me a number of technical questions. He was kind enough to give me notice of one of them, and I think that on that I can give him a fairly precise answer, which is in the affirmative, that the relief to which he is referring can be followed through an intermediate holding company. I think that the provisions which secure this are to be found in paragraph (3,5) of the Schedule.<br/>
With regard to the powers of election of O.T.C.s, the hon. Gentleman referred

to some fears that had been expressed about what the effect of the powers would be. He has not particularised the fears. All I can say in answering generally is that the intention, and, I believe, the effect, is to give the same kind of easement to O.T.C.s as provided for other companies. If the hon. Gentleman has some specific points in mind and cares to communicate them to me I would be glad to look at them further.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also raised the question generally about the notional method of assessment for transitional relief. I do not see the need, from his remarks, for alteration but if he has any particular arguments that he would like me to look at, I will do so. The hon. Gentleman at the end reverted to some general remarks about the effect of the transitional relief, saying that it does not give permanent easement to overseas trading corporations. Of course, this would cease to be a Schedule dealing with transitional relief if it did.<br/>
One of the main questions which have divided us throughout the Committee stage concerns the effects of the Corporation Tax upon overseas investment. The Government feel, and have stated quite clearly, that it is necessary through the tax system to put some brake upon the extent of our overseas investment. We do not, of course, wish to dry up or stop in any sense overseas investment. It is a matter of the proper balance. I hope that these remarks may be sufficient in reply to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 28, to leave out "person who" and insert "body which".<br/>
The extension of the Overseas Service Aid Scheme into the non-govern-

mental field will involve the negotiation of agreements between the British Government and various employing bodies in each country in which the extension will operate. Authority for these negotiations is to be found in the latter part of subsection (2) which enables the British Government to make suitable arrangements with "the authority or other person who is the employer."<br/>
During the Committee stage there were criticisms from the Opposition of the words "or other person". It was suggested that, in so far as these would enable payments of taxpayers' money to be made to private individuals, they were undesirable and that it would be wrong to authorise payments to a private individual and risk the loss of public confidence which would follow, perhaps, a scandal involving aid misdirected into that individual's pocket. As I said in Committee, I very much doubt whether there was any real risk of any such misfortune. I think that the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Mr. Tilney) will recognise that it was extremely unlikely that our Ministry would ever allow itself to get involved in this way.<br/>
Nevertheless, we have looked at what the hon. Gentleman said, as we promised to do, and we find that we can safely eliminate the reference to "person" but still preserve the desirable scope of agreement. We thought of the word "authority", but that is not wide enough in itself to cover the many employing bodies with which we shall be concerned. We felt that the expression "or other person" was a handy legal term covering everybody vested with a personality by law. But, recognising that there was the disadvantage to which hon. Members called attention if we used those words, I recommend to the House the substitution of the words "body which" for "person who".</p>

<p>In our many sessions in Committee upstairs the Parliamentary Secretary was charming and listened to our arguments. We appreciate that what appeared to be a very firm front has now dissolved, to some extent, as the result of the arguments which my hon. Friends and I put forward. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman has had a conversion to common sense.<br/>
We regret that the Minister, the right hon. Lady the Member for Blackburn


(Mrs. Castle), was unable to be present during the Committee stage. We understand why she was away in the great sub-Continent of Asia and that when she returned she was ill; but we had hoped that she might have been present to ensure that this exciting barque of aid was launched on the sea to the benefit of overseas countries. We feel that this excellent figurehead which has appeared in so many of our deliberations should have been substantiated on the Government Front Bench tonight. However, I must say to my hon. Friends that the Parliamentary Secretary has been good enough to explain to me why the Minister could not be present tonight. She is engaged in conversations with some of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers, and I think that a record should be made of that.<br/>
Similarly, I should like to say how much my right hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham (Mr. R. Carr) regrets that he cannot be here tonight.</p>

<p>I was saying how much my right hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham regretted that he could not be present because he is in the United States of America. I am glad that his arguments have prevailed.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary will remember what he said in Committee, as reported at column 133 of the OFFICIAL REPORT. He said that the aid might, in an extreme case, be applied to an individual. My right hon. Friend said:
<q>we had the categorical statement that these words would give power to give money to individuals. I do not think that that is right or that Parliament should do it."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A,</i> 4th May, 1965; c. 136.]</q>
My right hon. Friend urged that we should not underrate the seriousness of the point and, above all, that the public, who pay the taxes which enable this country to grant aid, should not be sus-

picious that aid is given possibly in the wrong direction and that false concessions could easily arise therefrom. Surprisingly, in answer to my right hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Secretary said that he did not expect that any change would be made in the drafting. I am only too glad to think that he has had second thoughts and that the Amendment is now before us.<br/>
We spent many hours in Committee upstairs. We on this side have been accused of arguing at length and of fili-bustering, but the example of the Amendment is enough to prove that the Opposition has shown great vigilance, which has caused the Government to alter their views. I only regret that Parliamentary time, which, I believe, is valuable to the Government, could have been saved if a change of heart had been shown much earlier than at this Report stage. At least, although this is such a belated conversion, we on this side welcome what the Parliamentary Secretary has said.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 30, to leave out "no person" and to insert:
<q>not more than five persons in respect of any one of the categories set out in subsection (5) of this section".</q>
In moving the Amendment, I should like to assure the Parliamentary Secretary that we agree on the principles of good Treasury control and that we should give aid as effectively as possible. The Treasury must, of course, approve any agreement with any overseas Government and we hope that this will result in continuing expenditure of aid over a number of years. But we do not see why there should be minute, detailed Treasury administration.<br/>
It seems to us that once agreement has been reached on policy decisions, the actual organisation should be left to the Department concerned. We should get away from the candle-ends type of control. Nowadays, we have new management techniques. The whole scale of Government activity has grown. Government, overseas and at home, are one of the biggest employers of labour. They really are in big business. I cannot believe that the Treasury would wish to interfere in the day-to-day administration of the nationalised industries, so I do not


see why it should interfere with the recruitment of single individuals, as is the case in the Bill as it stands.<br/>
I should like to quote part of paragraph 95 of the Sixth Report of the Select Committee on Estimates, 1957&#x2013;58, which reads:
<q>Your Committee believe that one of the main objects of any 'system' of Treasury control should be to see that Departments have a proper 'system' of financial control within themselves.</q>
That is to say, there should be a proper system of decentralisation. The paragraph also states:
<q>Your Committee are not convinced that this principle is fully acted upon by the Treasury.</q>
I want to refer again, as my right hon. Friend did, to what is known as the Plowden Report&#x2014;Command 1432. We read in paragraph 35:
<q>The primary responsibility of a Department is to conduct its policy effectively within the limits laid down by the Government. The Department is itself responsible for the efficiency with which it does its work: the Permanent Secretary, as Accounting Officer, is responsible for the financial management. It is important that these responsibilities should be clearly understood, fully accepted, and reflected in the Department's relations with the Treasury.</q>
That Report was published after the passing of the Overseas Service Act, 1961, but it seems to me that the Treasury wish to retain absolute control; that, according to the Bill, individual submissions have to be submitted to the Treasury for its consent. Yet we live in what we hope to be a modernising Britain. My fear is that the Treasury is still a little archaic in its views.<br/>
We on this side would like to see the mantle of Abraham falling on either the right hon. Lady or her successors, so that in communing with the Treasury and referring to the various categories set out in subsection (5) it might be said, "Peradventure, five shall be found. Can I not have my own way?" It seems to me that the Parliamentary Secretary, in almost a Russian manner, will say "Niet" and will back up the Biblical patriarch of the Treasury.<br/>
Not only is this a matter of modernisation and of bringing the whole Treasury system up to date, but it also has an effect on the thinking of the recruits. Surely speed in selection and appointment is very important. When we discussed

this matter in Standing Committee, the Parliamentary Secretary said that simultaneous action on behalf of his Department and the Treasury would be taken, but that has not really been proven and there is a danger that many qualified people whom we want to recruit for the benefit of the overseas developing countries may go elsewhere if they in their turn think that there might be undue delay.<br/>
I do not quite understand why there should be this needless duplication. We have highly qualified people, from the right hon. Lady, the Parliamentary Secretary, the Permanent Secretary and his admirable staff. Why are they not qualified themselves to say that they have the right people to do the jobs which are required to be done in the overseas countries? If they are unable to choose, surely it is cheaper in the end to remove or change those at the top rather than have this unnecessary duplication. I cannot believe that the financial director of any group of companies would insist that the managing directors of each subsidiary company should have to report to him what individual recruitment should be before those individuals were recruited. Does this happen in the nationalised industries? Of course not.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham (Mr. Carr) pointed out the difference between the Colombo Plan and schemes for Commonwealth education and co-operation. He said that he was far from satisfied when he held the right hon. Lady's post. A limit to the money has been set and we agree that this is right and, of course, we support having strict accounting. But having agreed that, surely it is better to decentralise to the right hon. Lady's administration and to make her and the Parliamentary Secretary decide who should be appointed, relieving the Treasury of this unnecessary duplication.</p>

<p>In Standing Committee we on this side of the House urged that responsibility for designating posts such as are covered by subsection (5) should be given fairly and squarely to the Minister of Overseas Development. The Government have enhanced this Ministry and its range of responsibilities. It is a pity that having a fully-fledged Minister, if I may so term it, of


Cabinet rank, the Government are tending to spoil the clear symbolism of the appointment. They surely have no need to mention Treasury control in the very Bill which sets out some of these extended powers. We all accept the need for the watchdog functions of the Treasury. It does not mean that those controls need to be bared to the public.<br/>
10.15 p.m.<br/>
The Ministry now has a Permanent Secretary, what some people have called "the Castle's other half". But surely this formidable set-up should be capable of exercising full responsibility for the task handed to this Ministry. Of course, they have to carry out these tasks in consultation with the Treasury and with many other Ministries of the Overseas Departments, but they are not mentioned in the Bill. Why was it necessary to mention this matter of detailed Treasury control in the Bill? The Amendment to which I am speaking is designed to give the Minister some additional formal responsibility. Far more, it is designed as a protest against the naked exposure of what I would call, for this occasion only "the dog beneath the skin."</p>

<p>I support the views put forward by my hon. Friends. I do not wish to rehearse all the arguments used at an earlier stage in support of the proposition that it is quite unnecessary that there should be this measure of detailed Treasury control. There is no difference of opinion between us as to the general control which it is appropriate for the Treasury to have and which it does have in the earlier parts of this Bill.<br/>
What puzzles me is that the Government have obviously accepted the principle that detailed Treasury control should be diminished, because we have a number of examples. I will quote only one to illustrate that they have accepted a change in this respect. I should like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Museum of London Bill as it was then, which is now the Museum of London Act. When it was a Bill before this House the Government, in the name of the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, tabled a number of Amendments proposing that the word "Treasury" should be replaced by "Secretary of State".

Among other Amendments there were some which related specifically to the appointments of officers.<br/>
In other words, the Treasury's control over such appointments was removed and the control was formally placed where we on this side think it should be, with the Secretary of State. I therefore feel that if the Government are disposed, in other parts of their activities to accept the policies to which my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Mr. Tilney) referred in terms of the recommendations of the Plowden Committee and the Estimates Committee, then the Ministry of Overseas Development should also follow the same lines.<br/>
A little earlier the Parliamentary Secretary in rebutting suggestions that had been made from this side that the Ministry, if it was left with a piece of legislation containing the words "person who" might get into difficulties, said, "It is unlikely that our Ministry will ever let itself get involved in this way". This was in explaining the Amendment which has just been agreed to, in page 2, line 28. I accept that, but I also believe that the Ministry of Overseas Development is unlikely to get itself involved in any difficulties in the appointment of these officers, and that it does not need to be told by the Treasury whether it should or should not appoint them.<br/>
I therefore appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the matter and to agree to accept the Amendment so that we can at least limit, if not remove, Treasury control in these matters of detail.</p>

<p>The Amendment deals entirely with the question of Treasury control. As we have just finished the Committee stage of the longest Finance Bill in living memory, one would have though that this was the time when one could consider not only the interests of aid but the interests of the Treasury. Is it in the interests of the Treasury that every officer designated by a Cabinet Minister should have to have his designation approved by the Treasury? If Treasury Ministers had not had to waste their time answering questions like this, some of their staff might have been more ready to prepare the major changes which have been made in the tax arrangements of this


country, and we might not have had the Government Amendments which appeared to the Finance Bill.<br/>
It is a well-known principle in business today that the time spent counting paper clips is time wasted. I believe that if we appoint a Cabinet Minister to a first-class Ministry such as this he should not have to run round to the Treasury every time he wants an appointment to be confirmed. I believe that the Treasury's time is being wasted by this sort of control and this sort of Clause in the Bill.<br/>
Aid today is still an art more than a science, and there is no question but that aid varies more in quality than in quantity. The giving of aid to underdeveloped countries is frequently a matter of a stitch in time, and giving it at the right time and finding the right man can make all the difference. The right man is frequently not prepared to hang about waiting while the Ministry sees whether the Treasury is prepared to give the O.K. to his appointment.<br/>
Only too often today the man with the qualifications which the Department wants has three or four commercial companies and possibly one or two other institutions looking for his services. If we are to get the right man to do the job, we must be in a position to offer him the job at once, and on the spot.<br/>
I wonder why the Minister and her civil servants have put this provision into the Bill. The obvious conclusion to be drawn, perhaps rather naively, is that they do not trust themselves, or perhaps it is that they know that the Bill will be operated largely by a Conservative Government, and they do not trust us. We, however, are prepared to trust the Minister, even in her absence, and the Parliamentary Secretary, and we feel that they might do the same for us.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Mr. Tilney) reminded us that we had some lengthy debates on this point in Committee. He suggested that we complained about it. There was only one occasion on which I made a complaint, and the record will prove that I had some little justification for that complaint. I certainly made no complaint about the care with which we debated the principle of Treasury control in relation to the process of designation. I make no complaint, either, that, in a

slightly different form, the hon. Member has seen fit to raise the matter again on Report. He will not be surprised to learn that the answer&#x2014;although I will not say it in Russian; I will say it in plain English&#x2014;is "No".<br/>
This provision is taken from the Act of 1961. That, in itself, does not give it justification, but we believe that there was full justification for including it in the 1961 Act and for carrying it forward into this Bill. The Opposition accept the principle of Treasury consent in relation to the conclusion of agreements. What they object to is the need for Treasury consent in relation to designation.<br/>
Here, I suggest, they miss a main point in the whole process of designating officers for service overseas. In this process the most significant financial act is not the conclusion of the permissive agreement in general with an overseas Government; the significant thing is the exercise of the Minister's discretionary power to designate officers who are eligible for benefits under this scheme. It is for this reason that the Bill provides that the Treasury can grant this consent not in relation to every individual but generally.<br/>
As I explained in Committee, in practice, officials&#x2014;we in the Ministry of Overseas Development&#x2014;agree with the Treasury general criteria for the designation of officers under certain agreements. Then individual cases are discussed with the Treasury&#x2014;and I stress this&#x2014;only when they fall clearly outside those general criteria and when new principles are brought up and need to be worked out.<br/>
The general criteria enable the process to work quite simply without&#x2014;in the hon. Member's phrase&#x2014;meticulous administration and without any delay, and I assure the House that the whole process works without the difficulties that the hon. Members envisaged.</p>

<p>If this procedure works so satisfactorily as an administrative exercise&#x2014;and I have no doubt whatever that it does&#x2014;why is it necessary to write it into the Bill? This creates the wrong impression. The Minister naturally consults the Treasury, as he consults all the other Departments involved. Why is it necessary to spell it out in black and white that the Treasury must be consulted by law?</p>

<p>I explained in Committee that on occasion one single act of designation can lead, in logic, to opening up the gateway to a vast category of other designated officers. It is for this reason that what may seem only a simple case may involve quite a huge financial expenditure as a result of one such decision.<br/>
In general, it is possible to do this in a straightforward administrative way without the detailed reference to the Treasury, but it is necessary in law to have this safeguard of Treasury consent in relation to cases of vast extensions with considerable financial implications.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman recognised in his opening speech, as the Plowden Report&#x2014;which he quoted&#x2014;recognises, that it is right for the Treasury to have a final power in relation to large expenditures. It is because there is a possibility of large expenditures being involved in one simple-seeming act of designation that it is necessary, in our view, that this should be continued in the Bill.<br/>
That is why we propose to proceed by this means in respect of the extension of the scheme under the Bill. The Amendment accepts this general principle, but seeks to exclude the case of a handful of designations. I would suggest to the House that this Amendment is not defensible under the general principles which I have explained. In so far as this handful of people comes within the general criteria for designation, it would be unnecessary, in any case, to consult the Treasury, but in so far as they did not come within those general criteria, new principles, as I have explained, might be involved.<br/>
It is in such cases of new principles that consultation with the Treasury would be right and sensible. I can see no new valid point in the Amendment or in the arguments produced in its support. I advised the House to reject it.</p>

These Amendments were designed to meet the points raised in Committee. It was pointed out by the right hon. Member for Mitcham (Mr. Carr) that these words "in any capacity" occur in some of the paragraphs, but not in others. He said that he was not particularly concerned whether they were included in all or in none, but he pointed out the desirability of uniformity in this matter. It was a point which I was willing to accept. We have looked at the matter since and we feel that it is better to produce uniformity by leaving out this phrase.

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, line 1, to leave out paragraphs (<i>d</i>) to (<i>g</i>) and to insert:
<q>(<i>d</i>) he is employed by any authority, organisation or institution established for public purposes in an overseas territory, including any marketing board, co-operative society or other body providing benefits primarily for a particular section of the public, or</q>
<q>(<i>e</i>) he is employed (otherwise than by any authority, organisation or institution established as aforesaid) in any service provided, or in any other activities carried on, for public purposes in an overseas territory.</q>
This Amendment is also designed to meet a number of points which were made in Committee. We had a long and protracted discussion on the question of the description of the organisations with which agreements might be sought. I think that it was in this connection that I was provoked on one occasion to suggest that we were being a little too meticulous.<br/>
I am satisfied that the wording of the Clause, with the inclusion of an Amendment which I moved in Committee, was sufficient to cover all the classes of people


we ought to help. Nevertheless, hon. Gentlemen opposite raised some criticisms and we have produced this Amendment with the object of covering the whole sphere we have in mind and, at the same time, meeting their criticisms.<br/>
The main objection was that paragraphs (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>) were unnecessary, because anything within them was covered by the general provision. The argument was that the general term "public services" must surely cover universities, education generally, health services and so on, and that it was unnecessary to have some of those public services especially mentioned in an earlier part of the Clause. There was no objection to the inclusion of the particular occupations mentioned in paragraphs (<i>d</i>) and (<i>e</i>), but it was suggested that in any Statute the inclusion of specified items inevitably tends to throw doubt on the generality of the later sweeping-up provisions because some meaning must be attached to the earlier specific references.<br/>
It was suggested, for example, that if it was necessary to mention doctors, it might be equally necessary to mention agriculturists. The argument was more sophisticated and architects and other categories came into the discussion. There are a number of sound reasons why the Clause was drafted in its original form, but I will not go over the arguments again now.<br/>
We have been able to redraft the provision in general terms which I hope the House will find acceptable. I am sure that the Amendment is free from the criticisms which were advanced, particularly by the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Mr. Tilney). It covers the whole scope we wish to have covered. It gives us the full powers we seek and, therefore, in this spirit of cordiality which now prevails after the long Committee stage of the Finance Bill, I hope that the House will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends may wish to comment on what the hon. Gentleman

said at the beginning of his remarks. We believe that our long and protracted debate, to which he referred, has had an admirable result. We are pleased that the Government have had a change of thought. We believe that the complaints&#x2014;only once, I think, from the hon. Gentleman but more than once from some of his hon. Friends&#x2014;that we were filibustering and speaking for too long have been shown to be untrue. Indeed, the Bill has been improved remarkably by this Amendment. The Opposition should take credit for the long debate we had on the Clause.<br/>
I have only two questions to ask the Parliamentary Secretary. Possibly he can expatiate on the words, "particular section of the public". The Amendment says:
<q>primarily for a particular section of the public.</q>
Does this include any help which may be given to a company in which the Commonwealth Development Corporation has a share? We would be grateful if he can comment on that.</p>

<p>I speak again with permission of the House.<br/>
The hon. Member will recall that we had discussions, for example, about co-operative societies and marketing boards. There may be some doubt whether the purposes they are serving are for the public as a whole. They are serving public purposes. Co-operative societies are serving a very wide membership who are members of the public and their purposes are to serve the public generally, but it is necessary to have this kind of wording to make sure that that kind of undertaking is included.<br/>
I can assure the hon. Member that operations under the auspices of the Commonwealth Development Corporation would be included.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
Since the Second Reading, the Bill has been subjected to an examination in Committee more detailed and protracted than any similar Bill has ever experienced. I accept the points of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Mr. Tilney) that the discussion has led to improvements in drafting, although I think he was inclined to exaggerate the amount of credit due to him and his hon. Friends; but I accept that one or two of those minor Amendments have made improvements.<br/>
The Bill is to provide means of furthering our overseas aid in directions to which both sides of the House attach a great deal of importance. The first Clause provides for further assistance towards Colonial development and is the latest stage in our long and continued contribution to the economic development of teriritories which are our direct responsibility. The period for which the present Bill provides money overlaps that for which the previous Act provided, and this is fortunate since already some three months of the first year have elapsed.<br/>
We shall, as soon as we are in a position to do so, tell the territories how much money they can expect from us for development over the next few years, and we shall then do all we can with the resources of our Ministry and of the Colonial Office to assist them in planning their economic development.<br/>
My right hon. Friend on 21st June announced her intention of making interest-free loans to selected overseas countries and the Colonies will, of course, be eligible for these on the same criteria as will be applied to other countries. As my right hon. Friend said, these criteria will have regard to the economic position of the territory and its capacity to achieve balanced and effective development. Already, the mixture of grant and loan in order in our aid to our colonies has resulted in their paying a very low interest rate on their development money looked at overall. In many cases already we have provided money only by grant, and this further concession will make development cheaper even in the territories which are able to borrow.<br/>
I need not spend long on Clause 2, because it, too, was very thoroughly examined in Committee and we have had further close examination of it this evening. I should, however, again draw attention to its main purpose. The Clause supersedes the Overseas Service Act, 1961, but it retains the Overseas Service Aid Scheme for which that Act provided. The scheme continues to ensure at the expense of the British Government satisfactory emoluments, salary, education allowances, overseas passages and, where necessary, compensation for over 10,000 expatriate officers still in post under 41 different Governments and Administrations.<br/>
It is because the scheme has been of so much value and its work is now well understood, that we propose under this Bill to extend it beyond the central public services of Governments to which so far it has applied, to the many non-governmental bodies performing public or social services in overseas countries.<br/>
In moving the Second Reading of the Bill my right hon. Friend said that for financial reasons we should not expect to be able to offer assistance to all the bodies that might qualify for it under the Bill and we should, therefore, in due course attempt to establish priorities for this assistance. Consultations to establish these priorities are beginning. We estimated in the Explanatory Memorandum that, having regard to our financial position, we should expect this extension of the Overseas Service Aid Scheme to rise in cost to an ultimate total of about &#x00A3;1&#x00BD; millions a year, and this continues to be our estimate.<br/>
My right hon. Friend also said that she intended to use this extension of the aid scheme as the means of discharging the undertaking given by the previous Government at the Ottawa Conference last year, that financial help would be offered towards the conditions of service of British expatriate staff in overseas universities. This, too, remains our intention and we hope to be able to give effect to it soon after the Bill becomes law.<br/>
It is natural that Clause 2 should have aroused interest and awakened anticipation in some of the bodies potentially eligible for the financial help which it


contemplates, and in the British expatriate staff of those bodies. While, therefore, our help must still be limited by the general financial considerations that I have mentioned, we know that this help will be welcomed by many bodies, and we are anxious to get on with the job of providing it as soon as we can.<br/>
I am happy to know from the previous discussion of the Bill in the House and through our work in the Committee that while there has been most careful consideration of the detailed wording of this Clause, its general purpose is welcome on both sides of the House.<br/>
I am grateful for the understanding and detailed examination that the Clause received from both sides of the Committee, and I hope that the House will now be prepared to give the Bill a Third Reading. We hope that it may also be possible for it to have a speedy passage through another place so that the Government may soon possess and be able to use the powers for which the Bill provides.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House agree very much with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said. We had many long sittings in Standing Committee&#x2014;in fact, there is quite a tome in HANSARD of our discussion&#x2014;and the Chairman once had to use her casting vote. I think that the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that there was really no repetition of argument. We on this side did try to improve the Government's Bill. I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary referred to the 10,000 expatriate officers. I believe that in this country we are inclined to forget, when we read about America's Peace Corps and what is happening about the help given by other countries, the wonderful work that is done overseas by Her Majesty's overseas civil servants, and those who are recruited on contract, in helping the developing countries overseas to try to improve their well-being and their overall happiness.<br/>
We on this side have tried to ensure greater flexibility. We have not always managed to succeed in our arguments with the Government. We never really wanted to spend more money. We hoped that we might get the Bill amended, so that when we on this side of the House

are on the Parliamentary Secretary's side we shall have greater scope for manoeuvre. But, of course, we agree that this is a good Bill. This is an agreed Measure overall. It follows the policy whereby we on this side of the House for 13 years managed to expand, and, in fact, I believe we doubled the aid over comparatively few years. I only wish that we could have done more.<br/>
But I regret that in the atmosphere of the Finance Bill the private investment overseas may come down; and, therefore, that the Government have declined the chance that we endeavoured to give them, of giving themselves greater scope for using public aid in a particular year, either to help our own exports or to help overseas countries in what may be a limited period of difficulty. However, that has been the Government's decision and they have decided against our wish to give them greater flexibility.<br/>
Mr. Speaker, there have been many sittings in Committee and I believe that that has shown that the opposition has been worth while, in that the bulk of our points have now been met and the Bill has been very substantially improved. It carries on the policy of 13 fruitful years. The Parliamentary Secretary has referred to free loans and lower interest rates. We on this side are aware of the great difficulty of many of the developing countries in servicing the loans that they already have to service. It is not easy for some of these poor countries to raise enough money, in currency which to them is hard, to meet interest and repayment of capital. We on this side only wish that we were richer and were able to help them more.<br/>
We like to remember that it was in the very dark period of the war that the first of these Measures was passed by this House. I believe that history will say that we have, as a country, a great record. We have tried to help the poor countries. We are not as rich as we would like to be, but we are a resilient nation and we are determined, if possible, to close the gap between the rich and the poor nations. This is agreed between all parties in this House.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary said that he thought that this Measure would be welcomed by many. I suggest that it will be welcomed by all.</p>

<p>The Bill is welcomed throughout the House. But there are two points which the Parliamentary Secretary will not be surprised that I raise. I want to deal, first, with the recently announced granting of interest-free loans. We welcome this move. It gives the Minister increased flexibility in the way in which he can help countries.<br/>
There are many countries which are amazingly naive about world economics. It is no good suggesting to them that we are so rich that money is lying around and can be given away or lent free. I ask that when these loans are being given, every possible step should be taken to make clear to the recipients that we have to pay 6 or 7 per cent. or more for the capital that we have and that when we give them interest-free loans, we here are paying that percentage. It should be made quite clear that this is the case.<br/>
The other matter about which I feel strongly is that in Clause 2(1,<i>a</i>) the Minister is given power to compensate designated officers. The job of the designated officer of Her Majesty's Overseas Civil Service is nearly over. A considerable number of these officers serving in various territories will in due course find their territories becoming independent and will largely have lost their jobs. I am happy to say that in the past the vast majority of officers who have served this country and the other country were fairly, justly and even, in some cases, generously compensated.<br/>
But the Parliamentary Secretary knows from the correspondence that I have had with him that there are a minority of cases of men who have served this country, Her Majesty the Queen and the other country with great loyalty, but when independence has come they have found that they have lost their promotion prospects, their employer in the other country and, largely, their careers. Because some precedent or strange criterion was built up, they received no compensation whatever from this Government.<br/>
In Committee, I went to some length to demonstrate how this rather false criterion about compensation for these officers had been built up&#x2014;officers who were never allowed to become

members of H.M.O.C.S. The criterion was built up in a false way, and we now largely pay compensation on what might be called the accident of recruitment. Whether an officer gets compensation when his career, promotion prospects and, often, his way of life are taken away by a declaration of independence&#x2014;though we welcome theindependence&#x2014;often depends on the minutial of appointment years before. There are hard cases, and hard cases may perhaps make bad law, but I ask that when this provision is applied the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will remember that the real criterion is whether an officer suffers because of a grant of independence, and if he has suffered in the career that he was led to suppose that he would have when he entered the service, he is entitled to fair compensation.<br/>
Whether these officers were appointed by a special commission sitting in a foreign country appointed by the Secretary of State or the Crown Agents, whether they were appointed locally, whether they were appointed in any of the various ways in which officers may be appointed, if they were led to believe that they had a full career in front of them and if that career is taken away, they are entitled to compensation. That is the only criterion on which we can honestly and fairly administer the system of compensation.<br/>
I will not labour this, although I myself missed compensation. The vast majority of officers have been fairly and generously met, but the hard cases spoil the record, and I honestly feel that it will be the hard cases which will be remembered in the years to come and not the generosity.</p>

<p>I should like to reiterate and support what my hon. Friend the Member for Antrim, North (Mr. Henry Clark) has said. Hard cases make bad law, but we are dealing here with a number of people who had intended to devote their lives to a certain field of work and, because of changes in the Commonwealth and the Colonial Territories, they have found that work coming prematurely to an end. Some are in jobs where it is difficult to say that they


qualify for compensation, but as this is a problem which is becoming smaller and smaller and is almost certain to come to an end in the foreseeable future I think that it is one of those situations which any Government, of whatever political party, should look at with sympathy and generosity.<br/>
I am not certain that there should not be a commission appointed to assess the hardship which these people have suffered, even if they do not legally qualify for compensation and pension, and that on that assessment the State should be recommended by the commission to recompense them to a certain extent. As for interest-free loans, I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Antrim, North said about the na&#x00EF;ve attitude of mind of some countries overseas where it seems to me people believe that money grows on trees. They do not understand the market. They do not understand that money which is loaned to the State in this country and then loaned overseas is still money loaned by individuals who expect some return on it.<br/>
Since we are trying to lead these countries to a responsible form of government it would be far better if when we give an interest-free loan that that loan was made at present market rate from the point of view of interest but that we then waived the interest to the country concerned. This would enable us to make clear to the people of that country that the loan was not only being given by this country but that somebody here was having to pay the interest. It would then be understood that this was a deliberate act on the part of this country in waiving the interest, which we were paying. By this means we would build in those countries a greater sense of responsibility.<br/>
It will not be long before many of these countries will have to finance their own loans and, therefore, it is not helping them to be responsible if they think that they are getting money without somebody having to pay the interest on it.<br/>
A criticism of these interest-free loans is that we are helping to create the impression that there is some sort of milch cow which provides this money. The country concerned should know that the interest on the money is being paid&#x2014;however much we like to ignore the fact&#x2014;in many cases by people who are not

very much better off than the people of the country to which we are giving the loan. The sooner the people of these countries realise that somebody somewhere is paying the interest the better for their own future development and responsibility. What I am saying is in the long run for the benefit of these countries.</p>

<p>At this stage, after our very long consideration of the Bill in Committee, I make three points. First, we had a long debate in Committee, trying to induce the Government to accept a slightly higher limit on their grants and loans for the territories to which Clause 1 applies. We did this because we thought that, in the light of the Finance Bill which was declared to discourage overseas investment, there should be a compensating rise in aid through grants and loans. The figures were slightly bigger than before, and we felt that the scope ought to be enlarged a bit more.<br/>
We thought this particularly important at a time when we ought to be attracting private capital to the smaller territories. It is always difficult. There has been a good deal of disinvestment in recent years, and this is the very time to try to encourage more. Since that encouragement had been withheld we felt it important to do what we wanted the Government to do, that is, make a symbolic raising of the limits for grants and loans. We were reassured by the Parliamentary Secretary that there was plenty of scope within the figures for giving the grants and loans which the smaller territories, under the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, would be able to use.<br/>
Secondly, the matter of interest-free loans. This is a debatable subject. It is most important not to overburden small territories which, in many cases, are already carrying a bigger burden than they can repay in the way of loans. Very often, they cannot even service their loans. Our Government have, on the whole, given a great part of their aid to territories in the form of grants, and they have done much better than many of the continental countries whose low rates of interest are always quoted against us. But we must be very selective in giving interest-free loans. There is room


in nearly every territory for quite hard loans for specific projects which can be expected to carry the servicing of a loan within a short time. It is important that these loans should be made on hard commercial terms because, if they can be made in that way, it becomes far easier to get money for Governments or anybody else.<br/>
I want great care to be taken to ensure that we have hard loans available for projects which can carry the repayments even in quite small territories. I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary and his right hon. Friend have this very much in mind. I beg him not to use soft loans without very careful consideration. Each one should be considered in the light of the total economy of the territory. I welcome the flexibility that these new interest-free loans give but I ask for very serious consideration to be given to the hard loans for projects that can carry them.<br/>
Thirdly, there is the question of Clause 2, concerning the extension of facilities to people from this country serving overseas who are outside what was known as the old establishment of the Civil Service. The most important form of aid we are giving to overseas territories is the trained manpower in technical assistance. This departure of being able to help people engaged in technical assistance in universities and para-governmental bodies is a real advance and a real service to those territories and I think that all of us on this side in the Committee welcomed it as a great help to the territories that need technical assistance.<br/>
All of us, although we have some points of detail over which we have argued, welcome the intention behind the Bill. I welcome the fact that the Bill is in the hands of an enhanced Ministry with enhanced hitting power.</p>

<p>Apart from the question of economic viability, the small farmer problem in Northern Ireland represents of a considerable amount of social distress and anxiety, with redundancy constantly hanging overhead. The problem is also charged with emotion through the deep-rooted desire for independence and of individualism. Since the average holding in Northern Ireland is 30&#x00B7;5 acres compared with 79&#x00B7;2 acres in England, the term "small farmer" has considerable difference in meaning between the two countries.<br/>
Although there are approximately 67,000 holdings in Northern Ireland, there are only 11,600 which have a size of over 50 acres, so we are literally a province of small farmers. In Fermanagh, out of a total of 7,800 holdings, there are only 239 of over 100 acres in size, with 4,900 holdings of under 30 acres.<br/>
The problem of farming income is so serious and so acute in Northern Ireland that there are approximately 13,000 farmers whose output of production is too low to provide an income equal to the minimum agricultural wage. Yet they have no alternative source of livelihood outside farming. The net income includes not only the work of the small farmer but also of his wife, his function as manager, and also the interest on his capital investment in the farm.<br/>
Because of rising costs and, to a large extent, falling prices, the Northern Ireland small farmer is just not in a position to absorb the greater part of the increased costs through increased earnings. The retail price index has risen by 4 per cent. in the last twelve months, yet the small farmer is battling to keep his end up. Somewhat naturally, he asks "Why should I be the victim of circumstances when the small farmer has played a vital role in an industry which, more than any other, has created the present climate of prosperity in Britain?" The small farmer now feels as though he is living on the edge of the industry, almost discarded, and in an atmosphere of uncertainty.<br/>
Paragraph 12 of the Government's White Paper on the Annual Price Review mentions the amalgamation of farms. What are these arrangements for amalgamation? What will they involve? What will be the end result in Northern Ireland, with its consistently high unemployment level? Will the promise of a really viable industry refer only to the "big" farmers? Although I am in favour of co-operation between small farms, more detail is clearly needed, and I doubt if it will achieve more than marginal benefit for the small farmer.<br/>
I welcome the announcement in the last Price Review of the setting up of an agricultural trust, because I believe this is a development of significance and importance, for such a trust could encourage the growing of experimental crops and/or new processing ventures. Both of these could be of considerable benefit to the small farmer. For agriculture must share in the technological revolution and, like all other industries, must place stress on experimentation, development and research. We have already in Northern Ireland an intensive system of farming through the large number of small farms which are not only forced to have specialised but also intensified enterprises.<br/>
Yet, in spite of this intensive farming, the small farmer is becoming poorer each year, and I doubt whether his income has ever risen by 1 per cent. over the last twelve years, compared with the national average of 56 per cent. This is in no way due to inefficiency, or through lack of agricultural education, and to quote from an article in <i>The Times,</i> May, 1963, by their agricultural correspondent:
<q>The Northern Ireland farmer has a quicker appreciation of the opportunities that have come the way of the post-war farmer, both technical and financial, with a distinctly greater interest in agricultural education".</q>
This article also stated&#x2014;
<q>&#x2026; that the optimism and evident skill of the fifty acre Ulsterman provides a wholesome corrective to the belief that farming in Britain is becoming a mere agricultural business dominated by tycoons".</q>
I fully appreciate and realise that farm structure, like all our social and economic institutions, must be constantly modified in order to keep abreast of the economic situation. However, through the astonish-

ing powers of survival, tenacity and adaptability, I am convinced that the family farm will continue to predominate in Northern Ireland.<br/>
I am also convinced that there is no single optimum size of farm in Northern Ireland and that they will continue to be financed by individuals, not by farming corporations. But, through voluntary amalgamation and increased mechanisation, an evolution, as opposed to a revolution, is taking place on the land, resulting in fewer people being employed in agriculture. Farms are becoming larger, both in terms of acres and of capital invested. In fact, ten thousand people have left the land in the last ten years.<br/>
I am fully aware that the problem of the small farmer is not unique to Northern Ireland, for it appears in Wales, North West Scotland and England. It exists on the Continent. However, because of the continuously high unemployment rate, the sociological problem is far more severe in Northern Ireland than in England, where there is more availability of alternative employment, thereby providing a better standard of living for redundant small farmers. In Northern Ireland it is extremely difficult to obtain alternative employment in rural areas, because the majority of small farms are situated in the outlying, more remote parts of the province where, in spite of intensive efforts by the Northern Ireland Ministry of Commerce, it is hard to attract light industry. These new industries are semi-automated requiring skilled labour which would require a most difficult readjustment for the middle-aged small farmer.<br/>
Mention has already been made in the House of the hardship which might be caused to a son who has to pay Capital Gains Tax on taking over a farm from his father. I understand that the Chancellor will reconsider this aspect, since it would not be in the national interest if a son were forced to sell part of his farm in order to find the necessary money to pay Capital Gains Tax. It would also not be in the national interest if the Capital Gains Tax would deter a small farmer from selling his farm to a neighbour who would thereby enlarge his farm.<br/>
Paragraph 7 of the White Paper on the 1965 Price Review states:
<q>Geographical location must therefore be taken into account in the formulation of agricultural policy.</q>


The minimum import price policy has depressed farm incomes among Northern Ireland small farmers because of our heavy dependence on importing essential feeding stuffs which we are importing at the rate of &#x00A3;20 million a year. As a result of this policy small farmers are being forced out of pig production, because grain which prior to 1963 cost &#x00A3;14 per ton is now costing &#x00A3;21 per ton to import. I ask the Government to examine this disparity with a view to making a special concession to Northern Ireland.<br/>
We realise in Northern Ireland that we can produce only as much as we can sell in the market. The three main commodities of the small farmer are eggs, pigs and milk. At present the market for eggs and pigs is in danger of overproduction and the small farmer is already up against the multi-laying and multi-breeding units. Eggs are the great stand-by of the small farmer and to the Northern Ireland agriculture industry worth &#x00A3;15 million a year in income. If the Government decided to give more security to the small farmer through special support adjustments, it would give both encouragement and help to the small farmer.<br/>
The small farmer will in no way be helped by the phasing out of premium payments for high price pigs. However, according to Press reports, the Minister of Agriculture recognises the special position in Northern Ireland pig production, in view of its importance and emphasis on bacon pig, and I trust he will take measures to alleviate this further hardship.<br/>
Since the Minister appears to pin his faith on the upward trend in larger milking herds and production units, life will be made even harder for the small farmer with his heavy dependence on the monthly milk cheque. There is, therefore, a strong argument for the introduction of a small farmers' milk quota scheme, which would be welcomed by the majority of farmers in Northern Ireland.<br/>
Our main assets in Northern Ireland are grassland and cattle, for grass is the principal crop of the individual farmer and during the last ten years output of production has risen by 50 per cent. I would welcome a special grant to be

introduced to provide cheaper fertilisers and lime for small farmers.<br/>
I am convinced that the small farmer would be considerably benefited if the industry were given the opportunity and encouragement to fill a greater share of the British market. A high agricultural policy which would maximise British food production would undoubtedly aid the small farmer and did not the Prime Minister in a speech in May, 1964, say that we must expand industries which could save imports? Again I would accept that our farm prices must be kept more in line with those of other countries.<br/>
Finally, on a number of occasions the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs has expressed the view that the resources of all areas and regions of the United Kingdom must be fully developed and must be harnessed for full economic use. As I have already stressed, Northern Ireland has its unique and specific problems. Here is an ideal opportunity for the Government to demonstrate its sincerity when it refers to regional development by assistance to the Northern Ireland small farmer.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Fermanagh and South Tyrone (The Marquess of Hamilton) has made a very moving plea for Ulster, and I welcome the opportunity to reply to the hon. Gentleman on behalf of the Government. As the House knows, the Home Office has a very special interest in the affairs of Ulster, and it falls to us to keep a watchful eye on its interests. I have a very good acquaintance with the officers of the Ulster Farmers' Union, and I look forward to a visit which I hope to make to Ulster during the coming Recess. I have therefore listened with all the greater care and interest to what the hon. Gentleman has said, for the future of the small farmer in Northern Ireland is of major importance to that part of the United Kingdom.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman reminded us how many farms there are which are not viable. I understand that there are 46,000 farm businesses with an average size of 40 acres. Just over half of these holdings are large enough to provide full-time employment for one or more persons.


The remainder are too small to provide full-time occupation by themselves, but there are part-time farmers who run the farm and also have an income from another source.<br/>
But the frightening aspect, the disturbing aspect, in Ulster is that there are 16,000 very small farm businesses which are too small to provide full-time employment and where the occupier has no alternative source of income. The hon. Gentleman was, therefore, quite right to remind us of the special problem which faces the Ulster people.<br/>
I say at once that we do not believe that we can solve the problem of the small farmer by raising the general level of price support right across the board for farmers as a whole. We believe there must be a selective approach, giving help where it is most needed. If we can single out the people who are in the greatest need and give them the greatest help, I am sure it would meet the wishes of the hon. Member. It is quite right that in the Review White Paper we announced our intention to help those who occupied holdings which are capable of providing a reasonable full-time livelihood but where difficulties are being experienced due to the character and the situation of the farm. We are also working on proposals to encourage the voluntary amalgamations of holdings which from their size and nature cannot yield a reasonable living.<br/>
It has been already announced in our Review White Paper that we are taking measures to help farmers whose businesses are viable, or potentially viable, to achieve more efficiency and a more satisfactory scale of production and marketing. I need not go into detail, but already 14,000 farmers in Northern Ireland have received grants under the old small farmer scheme. I hope that those who are eligible for the extended small farmer scheme will take advantage of the help which this can give them to increase the productivity and profitability of their farms.<br/>
Agricultural credit facilities are to be improved by arrangements for the provision of guarantees to banks so that they may make loans more readily available to those small farmers to improve their marketing activities and also to encourage co-operative marketing. All this is a help to the small farmer, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred. At the present time

we are studying steps to promote agricultural co-operation and a working party of officials from Ulster and our own Ministry of Agriculture have been examining for some months (<i>a</i>) wider arrangements for encouraging agricultural co-operatives in group activities and (<i>b</i>) voluntary amalgamation. What arrangements should be made to encourage voluntary amalgamation of these small farms is a matter of concern to us all.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman made some reference to the structural reform of the industry and asked whether we could not raise the minimum import price arrangements on cereals so far as Northern Ireland was concerned. The difficulty here is that we would then have to introduce some system of control on the passage of goods of an agricultural nature from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. This would lead to very considerable difficulties. I can assure the hon. Gentleman and the farmers of Northern Ireland that it certainly is not our intention to raise the general level of prices. We can only have the same minimum import price arrangements for the whole of the United Kingdom and it is not practicable to have different arrangements for Northern Ireland.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also welcomed the setting up of the Agricultural Trust, which was first proposed by the Minister of Agriculture in Northern Ireland and was welcomed by Her Majesty's Government. Its aim will be to overcome the disadvantage of remoteness and to improve the market prices received by Ulster farmers by securing greater efficiency in marketing, and by expanding the home and export markets for Northern Ireland farm produce. It might do this through the development of new crops, new products, and new uses of existing products, and through better sales promotion.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the interest on capital, and the Capital Gains Tax. I think he made the point that my hon. and learned Friend the Financial Secretary had told the House that the Government were now considering whether special arrangements were necessary in respect of the application of the Capital Gains Tax to agriculture. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government are well aware of the dire need of the Ulster farmers, as well as


of small farmers in Wales and England, to strengthen their industry. The plain truth is that we must all encourage the voluntary amalgamation of farms to make them viable, and, happily, the outlook for employment in Ulster appears to be improving.<br/>
The Wilson Economic Report, of which the hon. Gentleman will be aware, indicated that 65,000 new jobs might ultimately be made available in Northern Ireland, and these will, we hope, offer employment to those who today are on holdings which cannot give them an adequate standard of life. They will also help to absorb the other unemployed who, unfortunately, add to Ulster's problems.<br/>
I should like to stress again the Government's intention to deal with this underlying problem of the organisation and structure of the agriculture industry in Northern Ireland. We believe that the greatest help can be given by trying to achieve a satisfactory scale of production and marketing, and by the voluntary amalgamation of farms which never can be viable, and these basic problems have at last begun to be tackled in a comprehensive way.<br/>
I hope that I have answered all the points which the hon. Gentleman raised.

I assure him that it is our earnest desire, and my right hon. Friend's firm resolve, to do everything within our power to strengthen the agricultural economy of Northern Ireland. Already we are seeking to extend schemes which were introduced by the party opposite whereby financial assistance is being given to the small farmer in Northern Ireland. The hon. Gentleman will know, from speeches made in Ulster by the Minister of Agriculture there, and by his colleagues, that a great many farms have received help, and I hope that the future will be brighter as they realise that unless a farming unit is seen to be viable, unless keen attention is paid to business methods, and unless there is a readiness to co-operate with others, nobody else can help.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has raised an economic problem, and a human one. I hope to study this at first hand when I go over to Ulster in a few weeks. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are not only keeping all the points he has raised in mind, but our working party is looking for solutions which will help us and help them.</p>
