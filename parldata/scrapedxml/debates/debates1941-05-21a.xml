<p>My Noble Friend is most anxious not only that plans for social development should be prepared, but that, even during the war, the actual work of development should proceed wherever it can be undertaken without interference with the war effort, and that as full advantage as possible should be taken of the financial provision made by the Colonial Development and Welfare

Act; and he is about to address a circular despatch to all Colonial Governments in regard to this important matter. As regards the taking of a census, the conclusion was reached with regret last spring that in the circumstances then existing it was necessary to abandon the proposal that a census should be taken throughout the Colonial Empire in 1941. A special census for Jamaica is, however, under consideration in connection with the constitutional proposals recently made public for that Colony. The question of taking a census in the Colonies generally will be considered as soon as conditions make it practicable.</p>

<p>The Special War Tax recently adopted in the Straits Settlements and Federated Malay States is charged on incomes of not less than &#x00A3;560 a year, and the rate of tax varies from 2 per cent. on small incomes to 8 per cent. on incomes of &#x00A3;2,330 and above. Income Tax is not a normal form of taxation in Malaya, and the debates in the local Legislatures disclosed many doubts as to its suitability in local conditions. My hon.

<p>The peace-time conditions of service in the Army Educational Corps differ in various respects from those of the combatant arms. Officers of the Army Educational Corps continue, for example, to serve until they are 60 years of age, regardless of rank, whereas the combatant officer, who does not rise above the rank of major, under peace conditions normally has to retire at 47. For these reasons, I think the differentiation to which my hon. Friend refers is justified.</p>

<p>A British standards specification for fire-resisting treatment was issued

<p>Yes, Sir, but at the same time I should like to acknowledge the assistance rendered by a very large section of the Press in refusing to accept advertisements for those commodities of this nature which may be harmful or of doubtful efficacy as compared with water. A number of proprietary chemical liquids are being sold, some at high prices, for which it is claimed that they readily extinguish incendiary bombs. Many of these have been tested by the Research and Experiments Department of the Ministry of Home Security, but in no case has any been found which can be recommended in preference to water. There is no substantial difference in their favour in the time taken to extinguish a bomb. Apart from this, a far more important consideration is the necessity to be in a position to deal immediately with surrounding materials which are often set on fire by the bomb. For the dual purpose of extinguishing the bomb and the fire it causes, there is no liquid as cheap or as readily obtainable as water. Moreover, some of the liquids being sold are corrosive, some contain caustic substances dangerous to the eyes and others produce fumes and smoke which may be harmful, and in any case make fire-fighting difficult. In these circumstances expenditure incurred on any such liquids would not be recognised for purposes of grant.</p>

Casserole stewed steak is manufactured in Eire and imported under licence approved by my Department. The price at which first-hand sales in this country were to be made was agreed with the importers, and the licences were approved on the condition that the importers would take all possible steps to ensure that the retail price did not exceed is. 6d. per tin. It was arranged six weeks ago that further importations should have the retail price printed on the label. In reply to the second part of the Question, as in this case publication did not prejudice the taking of legal proceedings, the circumstances were different from the other case which has formed the subject of recent Parliamentary Questions.

<p>The published figures include all who happen to be out of work on the particular day on which the count is taken. Apart from those who have been found to be unfitted for ordinary industrial employment, they include those temporarily out of work and about to resume it and those in course of changing-over from one employment to another. Allowing for these factors, there is now practically no reserve of unemployed labour available for, but unable to obtain, employment. All workers who are suitable for employment and who are available to be moved away from home, can be placed in employment without delay. Under any system, there must always be a relatively small number of persons who on any particular day are out of work between two jobs, but it is quite erroneous to suggest that such persons are a body of unemployed for whom work cannot be provided.</p>

<p>Stocks of straw on farms are


normally low in the spring and summer months, and, while increased quantities of straw were available from the 1940 harvest, much larger supplies, particularly of oat straw, have been required for animal feeding.

As indicated, however, in reply to my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Howdenshire (Colonel Carver) on 13th May, the Papermakers' Straw Trading Company are being assisted to secure available supplies of wheat and barley straw.

<p>On a point of Order. I should like your guidance, Sir, in a matter which affects myself incidentally, and a number of other Members of the Select Committee on National Expenditure. There is to be a Supply Debate today in which I am hoping to take part. Our evidence is taken in secret and is not published. When a Member of a Select Committee takes part in a Debate, I assume that he should confine himself to matters on which Reports have already been presented to Parliament, and that it would be improper to deal with matters which have come before him in evidence on which a Report has not been presented.

It would be helpful to Members of the Select Committee if you would give some guidance.</p>

<p>In the Suda Bay area further air-borne attacks commenced at 4.30 yesterday. About 3,000 men were dropped. By 6.30 the greater part of these had been accounted for. Fighting continues, and the situation was reported to be in hand at 9 p.m. The method of attack was by Stukas, that is, dive-bombers, and Messerschmitts, followed by gliders and parachutes. In the Heraklion and Retimo areas attacks began at 5.30 by parachutists. Troop-carrying aircraft, many of which crashed, also landed. There are no details yet.
