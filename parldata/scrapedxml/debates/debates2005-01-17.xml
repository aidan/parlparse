	<p>Following on from the Minister's response to my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), is she aware that the BBC board of governors continues to argue that it has no role in pre-viewing material before broadcast and thus refused to intervene before the transmission of &quot;Jerry Springer&mdash;The Opera&quot;, despite 50,000 complaints from the public? Given that the job of adjudicating complaints after broadcast has passed to Ofcom, the question arises as to what the point of the BBC governors is. Will the right hon. Lady make that a priority in the review of the BBC's charter?</p>

	<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) pointed out, there may be 40,000 or more sports clubs in this country, and 2,000 of them are now receiving, year in and year out, &pound;5 million of investment in grass-roots sport. Disappointingly, although the press hammered us daily, screaming for mandatory rate relief and support for sports clubs, when we wrote to every national newspaper three or four weeks ago asking it to broadcast the good news about the relief, not one word about it was printed. The Treasury has been very supportive of the move. I call on the national press and everybody in the House to make sure that every sports club in this country knows that there is money for the taking, week in, week out, year in, year out.</p>

	<p>Is the Minister aware that amateur sports clubs up and down the country face enormous extra bills as a result of the new fees proposed under the Licensing Act 2003? Is he further aware that his predecessor, the hon. Member the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells), explicitly said in Committee that the Government intended to accept our proposal that voluntary sports clubs should not have to pay more than a 10th of the amount paid by commercial organisations, and that the Government have now betrayed that commitment?</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend may have noticed a reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury (Mr. Key) on 10 January, in which the Government announced that there would be a Defence Council initiative, which would be taken shortly, to encourage service personnel to vote. My hon. Friend is on to an extremely good point. As I have said before in the House, I am perhaps more likely to be concerned about this issue than most as the number of service voters registered in the borough of Gosport has fallen from 4,370 in 2000 to 474 in 2004. I think we all should be concerned about that.</p>

	<p>As the hon. Gentleman well understands, the investigatory role that the NAO carries out on behalf of the House must inevitably be retrospective. In order to retain the independence of that scrutiny, it is important that the NAO does not get involved at too early a stage. Let me report on what I think is a hopeful development, though not yet an achieved result. In November the Office of Government Commerce appeared before the Public Accounts Committee and outlined to us a programme of gateway reviews&mdash;key stage reviews&mdash;of IT projects across virtually all Departments. When a project is in trouble, the gateway is graded red and the project does not progress until it has been examined. I suggested at that meeting that the National Audit Office should be notified as soon as a project is classified red, and that the NAO should be able to recommend it to us. A couple of weeks later we had the Ministry of Defence before us, which does not operate quite the same system as the OGC, but has a system of its own. I put the same question to the MOD, which has agreed to speak to the NAO, and I am hopeful that we will be able to develop some sort of early warning system in our next report.</p>

	<p>Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the question is useful and pertinent, because it underlines the central importance of IT to the political debate? For instance, in the debate on identity cards there was very little mention of the fact that there are huge discussions about the costs will range from &pound;1.1 billion to &pound;3 billion, which is the Government's estimate, or &pound;5 billion, which is the estimate of others, solely because of IT? To give reassurance to the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Sir Archy Kirkwood), on Wednesday this week the NAO is publishing a report on patient choice&mdash;again, central to the policy debate. The cost of that and its effectiveness will depend crucially on IT. The question underlines the importance of the subject.</p>

	<p class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>
	<p class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I am pleased that, after much debate and discussion in the other place, the Bill has at long last come to the House of Commons. I shall address the details of the Bill in due course, but we must not neglect the fundamental principles driving the reform, namely, the need to modernise our constitution so that our institutions can serve the public in a clearer, more transparent and more effective manner; so that our courts and justice system can be administered by a full-time Minister clearly accountable to Parliament; and so that the relationship between the three arms of the state&mdash;Parliament, the judiciary and the Executive&mdash;is settled, clarified and easier to understand, in turn making each better fitted to carry out its vital roles in a modern democracy.</p>
	<p>The Bill therefore proposes the reform of the office of Lord Chancellor, removing the blurred lines between political and judicial functions, so that the post-holder, as a full-time Cabinet Minister, can concentrate on the administration of the justice system, no longer sitting as a judge, and we hope no longer tied to the Woolsack in the other place as its presiding officer. The Bill sets up a new judicial appointments commission, an independent body responsible for selecting our judges in the future, and it creates a new supreme court, putting beyond any doubt the independence from politics and the legislature of the highest appellate court in the United Kingdom. There will be a clearer separation of the powers of Parliament, the judiciary and the Executive, and greater confidence in the shape and nature of each branch of our constitution.</p>

	<p>I am not a lawyer either, but I think that having a fresh perspective on a particular responsibility is sometimes a benefit, rather than a disadvantage. There are pros and cons on both sides of this argument, but we do not feel that the post-holder should be tied to one particular qualification. That would not be justified by the nature of the new ministerial post.</p>
	<p>The Bill also makes new arrangements for many of the statutory functions of the Lord Chancellor that relate to the judiciary. These will either be transferred to the Lord Chief Justice completely, or be exercised jointly with the Lord Chief Justice, with requirements for consultation or concurrence between them and their counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland as appropriate. This division of responsibilities was agreed between the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice and is known as the concordat. Reflecting on this historic agreement, the Lord Chief Justice has commented that:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The judiciary considers that the parts of the Bill that reflect the concordat are a highly desirable package of measures designed to ensure the continued independence of the judiciary.&quot;</p>
	<p>He added that he</p>
	<p>&quot;would consider it an unsatisfactory situation if the present position were left in place.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 8 March 2004, Vol. 658, c. 1004.]</p>
	<p>The concordat was presented to Parliament on 26 January last year, and amendments to the Bill were tabled by the Government in the other place to reflect that agreement.</p>

	<p>Some parts are in the Bill and some are not. That is by agreement, and we shall no doubt go through those matters at great length in Committee, much of which, hon. Members will be delighted to know, will be held on the Floor of the House. The hon. Gentleman will have plenty of opportunities to go into that issue in detail later.</p>
	<p>The Bill also places an additional duty on the Lord Chancellor to have regard to defending the continued independence of the judiciary. That duty will also apply, for example, in his handling of the recommendations from the new judicial appointments commission and in funding and running the administration of the courts. Clause 5 amends the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 to ensure that the provisions made by that Act in relation to the guarantee of judicial independence are consistent with the provision made by clause 4.</p>
	<p>Our judiciary will have strengthened independence, but will still have a dialogue with the Government and Parliament. In recognition of the important contribution of the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the Lord President of the Court of Session and the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, clause 6 provides that they may table written representations to Parliament on matters relating to the judiciary or the justice system. In addition, the Bill recognises the important role of the Lord Chief Justice in respect of the judiciary. It sets out his responsibilities, including representing the views of the judiciary to the Government, and the training, guidance, welfare and deployment of the judiciary of England and Wales.</p>
	<p>The role of the Lord Chancellor in delivering the concordat will be fundamental. It has been agreed between the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor that functions of the Lord Chancellor that relate to the judiciary and the court system should not, in future, be transferable away from that Minister without primary legislation. That is set out in clause 17. It is another protection that the Chairman of the Committee has mentioned.</p>
	<p>I turn now to the question of who will act as the presiding officer of the other place. The Government continue to believe that, for a busy Minister of the Crown, sitting also as a Speaker or presiding officer over a House of Parliament is a heavy burden indeed. We therefore take the view that the House of Lords should have the benefit of a presiding officer who can devote his or her time solely to its service.</p>
	<p>Ultimately, of course, decisions on who should be the presiding officer of the other place are a matter for their Lordships themselves as part of the Standing Orders of the House of Lords, which currently stipulate that the duties form part of the role of the Lord Chancellor. But it is undoubtedly odd that any House of Parliament should automatically accept the appointee of the Prime Minister as its Speaker or presiding officer, a state of affairs not conducive to the supremacy of Parliament in our constitution. The Bill therefore helps to facilitate the process now in train in the other place about who might take on that aspect of the Lord Chancellor's current functions. The House of Lords has not yet formed its view, nor decided the title of that presiding officer.</p>
	<p>Part 2 of the Bill therefore allows the statutory functions of the Lord Chancellor, in his capacity as Speaker of the other place, to be exercised by anyone who fills that role in future.</p>

	<p>We will have to agree to disagree on the matter. It is not true that we will have no opportunity to debate the judicial appointments commission on the Floor of the House, because as the Bill progresses through its parliamentary consideration there will, of course, be Report stage, when we will be able to look in detail at many of those matters.</p>
	<p>I want briefly to mention the operation of the judicial appointments commission, which will select judges for appointment in England and Wales. It will be composed of 15 members: six lay members, five judges, one solicitor, one barrister, one tribunal member and one magistrate. The chair will be a layperson, emphasising independence both from the judiciary and from the Executive. The commission will recommend to the Lord Chancellor one candidate for each vacancy selected, solely on merit. No one will be appointed who has not been selected by the commission.</p>
	<p>The Lord Chancellor will have a very restricted role: he or she will be able to reject a candidate once and to ask the commission to reconsider a selection once, as I said in answer to an intervention by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier). The arrangements will ensure that the role of the Lord Chancellor is transparent, but that there is necessary ministerial oversight and involvement to ensure proper accountability to Parliament, which is of course sovereign.</p>
	<p>At present, the Lord Chancellor has statutory powers to remove judicial office holders below the High Court on grounds of incapacity or misbehaviour. Those powers will be reformed so that they can be exercised only with the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice. The Bill places all matters of judicial discipline and removal on a transparent statutory footing and provides a structure that reflects a proper balance between the independence of the judiciary and democratic accountability for the judicial system. The current role of Lord Chancellor will be shared with the Lord Chief Justice. No removal or other disciplinary action can be taken by one of them without the agreement of the other. None of those powers will displace the existing role of Parliament in the removal of the most senior members of the judiciary, in those exceptional circumstances.</p>
	<p>The Bill will also permit those who are dissatisfied with the administration of the complaints procedure established by the judicial appointments commission to seek review of the operation of the process by a judicial appointments and conduct ombudsman.</p>
	<p>Part 5 of the Bill takes account of the reform of the office of the Lord Chancellor in Northern Ireland, building on the provisions already made for that jurisdiction. Part 5 makes provision for the removal of judges in Northern Ireland in the period prior to devolution of justice to the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>
	<p>In Committee, we shall no doubt debate these provisions in much greater detail, but fundamentally, the principles and rationale for the legislation are clear and simple&mdash;</p>

	<p class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House declines to give the Constitutional Reform Bill a second reading because it creates a costly and unnecessary Supreme Court exercising the same functions as the current Law Lords; is based on the false premise that the separation of powers between the judiciary and legislature requires the physical removal of the Law Lords from Parliament; fails to demonstrate how the proposed Supreme Court would exercise its functions with any greater degree of impartiality, independence and integrity than the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords; will deny Parliament the experience and expertise that the Law Lords bring to debates and legislation; and notwithstanding the benefits of a Judicial Appointments Commission, offers no convincing justification for replacing a system that works well.</p>
	<p>I move the reasoned amendment with considerable regret, because I am by no means averse to the idea of evolutionary constitutional reform, and certainly not in respect of the judiciary and its appointments system, or of the operation of the House of Lords and the role of the Lord Chancellor. Far from it. As the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) said, it has always been a subject of legitimate public debate. Constitutions will survive the test of time only if they adapt. I have no difficulty with those arguments, but we cannot get away from the fact that the manner in which constitutional reform of a major kind was introduced was disastrous&mdash;disastrous for the reputation of the Government, disastrous in terms of undermining the independence of the judiciary, which it involved at its outset and disastrous in the whole manner of its announcement.</p>
	<p>In early 2003, we were assured by the previous Lord Chancellor that the Government on whose behalf he was speaking had no intention of changing the current systems in respect of the Lord Chancellor and the Supreme Court. In summer 2003, an announcement was made on the back of a Cabinet reshuffle&mdash;an announcement of which, it has become apparent, the Lord Chief Justice was informed only a few minutes before it was made. It was obvious that the Cabinet Secretary, who is supposed to steer Ministers, in particular the Prime Minister, away from serious pitfalls, had not been consulted. The announcement envisaged the immediate axing of the office of Lord Chancellor. It was a back-of-the-envelope job and within 24 hours we had the bizarre scene of the person who had announced that, whatever he was, he was not the Lord Chancellor, having to go the royal courts of justice to take the Oath of Allegiance to fulfil precisely that role. Not only was the spectacle unedifying as a piece of history, but it colours my approach to the Government's handling of the matter and the degree of trust that I place in the Government's delivery of their promises on it.</p>

	<p>I agree. A number of people were satisfied with the reform of the office of Lord Chancellor. The present Lord Chancellor seemed to be pleased with his promotion. Notoriously, the previous Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett), was filmed at the entrance to the Home Office embracing the present Lord Chancellor, who was about to carry out his new duties. The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside was overheard to say sotto voce, &quot;Now at last we will get the judges we want.&quot; Another reason why I find it hard to trust the Government on this issue is that, in the initial stages of reform in the period immediately after the announcement of the back-of-the-envelope proposals and the ensuing fiasco and back-tracking, the judiciary, who certainly did not wish to be dragged into the argument&mdash;none the less, they were&mdash;were under the impression that the proposals as they stood were the most serious threat to judicial independence in their lifetime. That was apparent from their response.</p>
	<p>I accept that, since then, the Government have taken steps to satisfy many of the judiciary's anxieties, but it is extraordinary that a Government committed to human rights and the rule of law should, in the summer of 2003, have introduced a series of proposals that threatened to undermine both. However, I have ceased to be surprised at the way in which they operate, because although they are loud in their rhetoric about trying to improve and modernise, the reality is a constant accretion of centralising control to Ministers&mdash;that has been their absolute and consistent hallmark.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman has made a perfectly reasonable point, but the problem that he identified is a fiction. Many of the Law Lords who considered that problem decided that it was most unlikely to arise and I believe that, if such a challenge was mounted in Strasbourg, the margin of appreciation allowed for a country's individual judicial system would enable our arrangements to stand the test without difficulty. The only issue that might have presented problems was the Lord Chancellor sitting as a judge, which is why, as the Minister knows, we have always been consistent in the view that that was a practice that could be ended as part of the evolutionary change. I disagree with the analysis of the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Soley) of what would have happened, or what would happen&mdash;after all, we have not brought these changes about&mdash;if we left the Law Lords as they are at present.</p>
	<p>The Minister said that it is wrong that judges should have to exercise forbearance in what they say, but the reality is that judges have to do so at almost every moment, including in private conversations and at dinner parties. I do not think that that made any difference and they succeeded in managing membership of the House of Lords and active participation in it without difficulty. I shall return to that point.</p>

	<p>Before my hon. Friend allows himself to be too far seduced by the hon.

He will remember that, while the case led to the change in the arrangements in this country over assistant recorders and so forth, that Court did not criticise the British system of having a Lord Chancellor who happened to be a member of the political class.</p>
	<p>It strikes me that we are getting into this groove because we are different and because it is thought that we should conform with everybody else's constitution. I hope that the Conservative party, above all, will ensure that it sticks up for what is good in this country and not allow the Labour party to wash all over us the slack intellectual guff that it seems to be seduced by.</p>

	<p>Whether my hon. Friend noticed it or not, the Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, the hon. the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie) looked genuinely quizzical and even disbelieving at the idea that someone who had once been a party politician and became Lord Chancellor could change in attitude and outlook according to the new post he occupied. Does my hon. Friend agree that it is curious that the Minister should be so disbelieving, for there is an obvious precedent much closer to home?

	<p>The Minister completely misunderstands my point. There are two separate issues. First, the office holder should be in the House of Lords and should take an oath that disqualifies him from further participation in Government thereafter&mdash;that is valuable and has nothing to do with his legal qualifications. Secondly, he should be legally qualified because his role is intimately involved in the selection of the judiciary and the knowledge of how the judicial system works. Thirdly, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) said, he should provide a lawyer's input into the issues of judicial independence that he is there to maintain. For all those reasons, I would keep the office of Lord Chancellor as provided for by the Bill as amended in the other place.</p>
	<p>I told the Minister at the outset that we support the principle that a judicial appointments commission should be set up, so many of the comments that I wish to make can be reserved for Committee. However, it is worth bearing in mind one or two key points. If the commission is to work, it must have sufficient flexibility to be able to respond rapidly to any given situation. For example, it is well known that at the end of the Pinochet case, the then Lord Chancellor realised that the House of Lords faced difficulties. He therefore carried out a musical chairs reshuffle, which worked superbly. He appointed a new senior Law Lord and a new Master of the Rolls and the consequences were widely appreciated. I have a concern&mdash;which I hope the Under-Secretary will note, even if he does not respond to it later in the debate&mdash;that the commission should have sufficient flexibility to act, if necessary, with similar finesse. That is important, because when one examines the bureaucratic structures that are being set up there must an anxiety that, however worthy the aims of the judicial appointments commission, it will not have the ability and flexibility to move in that fashion.</p>
	<p>Earlier, my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) mentioned the appointment of the new president of the family division. I make no criticism of the appointment, which appears to be unusual and, we hope, creative. However, I am bound to say that it was possible because, for better or worse, of the ability to make decisions in a highly flexible manner. I therefore need reassurance that appointments by a judicial appointments commission can have similar flexibility. I hope that the Under-Secretary will accept that as a seriously made and well-intentioned point. There is no point in our ending up with a rather ponderous organisation that fails to deliver the necessary flexibility to ensure that the higher echelons of the judiciary can be so moved around that people are happy in their jobs, that it functions well and that there is public confidence in it.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way because he allows me to clarify a point that I made in an intervention. I believe that Lord Justice Potter will make an extremely good president of the family division and I have no criticism of his judicial qualities. However, I am worried about the illogic of the Government's position. On the one hand, they advocate modernisation of the judicial appointments system, yet on the other they appoint a judge&mdash;as it happens, an excellent judge&mdash;by old-fashioned means. I heard the Under-Secretary's comments, but it is deeply unconvincing of him to try to advance one argument for after the Bill is enacted, yet rely on the much-criticised system that pertains before enactment.</p>

	<p>The right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) was incorrect to suggest that the Law Lords have a broad sweep of legal experience. There has not been a criminal lawyer in the House of Lords for quite a long time, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware. Is not what he is saying inconsistent with the fact that half of the current Law Lords first, announced themselves, through Lord Bingham, to be uncomfortable with their current role in the Lords, and secondly, declined to speak at all, going beyond even the self-denying ordinance of 2000 because they simply think it inappropriate to mix their two roles?</p>

	<p>I declare my interest as a lawyer and part-time judge. I see one other Member in the Chamber who sits as a recorder.</p>
	<p>I want to start with the important principles that are set out in clauses 1 and 4, which deal with the rule of law and judicial independence. It is vital that we focus on principle so as to build a system in accordance with principle. Other important values include equality before the law and access to justice, which has already been mentioned in the debate. There is an issue about whether the clauses would be justiciable, but the fact that they are in the Bill and will therefore be part of the Act is not just symbolic; the clauses are cardinal in our system.</p>
	<p>How do we define the principles of rule of law and judicial independence? We can do so negatively. We can look, for example, at Zimbabwe. The Bar Council and other Bars around the world recently published a report demonstrating how there is no longer the rule of law in Zimbabwe. Mugabe has said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The courts can do whatever they want, but no judicial decision will stand in our way&quot;.</p>
	<p>The report sets out how the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law have been corrupted. Judges who have handed down decisions adverse to the ruling party have been arrested, and up to 10 judges have left and hacks have been appointed in their place.</p>
	<p>More positively, we have clear definitions in our law. On the rule of law, as lawyers we tend to go back to what Dicey said&mdash;that the rule of law means that no person is punishable except for a breach of the law established in the ordinary manner before the ordinary courts of the land. That contrasts with Zimbabwe, where there is arbitrary power and wide discretionary authority. Secondly, no person is above the law&mdash;the principle of equality before the law. Thirdly, the general principles of the constitution are the result of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons.</p>
	<p>In modern language, the rule of law means that the system has to accord with certain formal criteria. The law has to be promulgated to the public; it has to be prospective and not retrospective; it has to be possible to comply with its provisions; it has to be clear, coherent and stable; and the persons who make and administer it should be accountable for the way in which they administer it. One aspect of the rule of law these days is also said to be judicial independence.</p>
	<p>As the criteria tend to be formal, some have said that we must also take account of substantive principles. Modern accounts of the rule of law thus include not only formal criteria, but the content of the rules themselves and the nature of the system. When the World Bank recommends new judicial systems to countries, it talks about the rule of law and tells them that they need democratic, open and transparent systems in which several political parties can contest elections. Additionally, public officials must be aware of the limits of their powers and act accordingly.</p>
	<p>Judicial independence is mentioned in clause 4. At a basic level, that simply means in some countries that one should be able to buy goods and services, but not judges. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) mentioned the separation of powers, and I agree with him that Montesquieu got it wrong. It was interesting that he was concerned about the separation of powers because he did not want Executive and judicial power to be coupled to oppress citizens. Even in the United States, the separation of powers does not exist in a pure form because, for example, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court would have presided over an impeachment trial of President Clinton. Bagehot was right&mdash;we have a fusion of powers. The fact that I sit as a recorder and a Member of Parliament shows that this country does not have a strict separation of powers.</p>
	<p>None the less, the notion of judicial independence has force. That independence has individual and institutional aspects. The individual aspect is mentioned in clause 4(5), which provides that the Government should not seek to influence the specific decisions of judges. That is absolutely right because courts must be protected from actual or apparent interference by the Executive&mdash;there should be no back-door influence. Lord Mackay, a former Lord Chancellor, was right to say that the independence of the judiciary denotes not only independence from the Executive, but the independence of one judge from other judges. Clause 4(5) reflects the international consensus on the meaning of the independence of the judiciary that is set out in international instruments such as those promulgated by the International Bar Association and the United Nations.</p>
	<p>There is a question about whether independence includes the concept of impartiality. Article 6 of the European convention on human rights uses the words &quot;independent&quot; and &quot;impartial&quot;. Although some people have suggested that they are separate principles, I prefer to regard impartiality as an aspect of independence. Impartiality means of course not only that judges must not have personal biases or prejudices, but that they must exclude considerations that are not relevant.</p>
	<p>A judge must mediate in disputes between citizen and citizen, and the citizen and the state.The institutional aspect of independence is recognised in clause 4(6). It says that a Minister or the Lord Chancellor</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;must have regard to . . . the need for the judiciary to have the support necessary to enable them to exercise their functions.&quot;</p>
	<p>Such support is absent in Zimbabwe because some of its judges have no facilities&mdash;several reports suggest that they sit in rooms without electric lights. Governments have an obligation to provide the administrative and financial support that is necessary for the judiciary to do its work.</p>
	<p>An independent judiciary does not mean that judges come in with a blank sheet of paper, which is especially important when we consider widening the pool and increasing diversity in the judiciary. We want judges to have varied experience and a range of expertise. They must, of course, act in accordance with law and, according to the judicial oath, without fear, favour, affection or ill will, but that does not mean that they come without any views at all. In fact, it could be argued that the wider the range of experience that judges have when they come to the job, the better.</p>
	<p>Judicial independence does not mean that judges are not accountable. The most important way in which they are accountable is that they have to give reasoned decisions, which are available to the parties and the general public. Judgments can be criticised, which is an important aspect of accountability. These days, judges have to be aware of the importance of acting efficiently; time is an important resource. Returning to the principle of access to justice, which I mentioned earlier, the fact that disproportionate resources are given to a few cases means that many outside the system do not get access to justice. Judges also have to be accountable if they are rude to litigants or counsel.</p>
	<p>Independence does not mean that judges can decide what they want. They have to act in accordance with the law. Lord Scarman, one of the most prominent Law Lords of the 20th century, who recently died, said that it is not just a matter of deciding what is right; judges have to act in accordance with statute and the common law. If neither statute nor common law gives a clear answer, it is possible to reason by analogy. One cannot simply decide issues without any guidance from law whatsoever.</p>

	<p>It seems to me that the Bill will provide a firm underpinning, especially in the principles set out at its very beginning, for the standing of our judiciary. I will come on to that in a moment, and I will acknowledge that the standing of our judges is unrivalled, both in their merit and in the quality of their decision making.</p>
	<p>I have said in earlier debates that there has to be mutual respect between institutions. Judicial independence does not mean that judges can completely neglect what Parliament, for example, says. Parliament, of course, has to respect judges' decisions, and we have rules about what we can say about judicial decisions and how we can criticise judges. Judges have to respect legislation, and there is no criticism of the position at present. In 2003, Mr. Rusbridger of <i>The Guardian</i> brought a case under the Treason Felony Act 1848, arguing that if he advocated republicanism he might be in breach of the Act. The House of Lords said that it was not for it to say that the Act was no longer extant.</p>
	<p>There is also an obligation on judges to make decisions in accordance with law, even controversial law, and to respect institutional expertise. The recent case law on the Human Rights Act 1998 is very interesting. Judges have developed a notion of judicial deference in relation to some decision making by the Executive, especially when moving away from article 6 on purely judicial functions to some of the other articles, saying that they have to respect the Executive and Parliament. In the recent Belmarsh case, Lord Bingham said in relation to the notion of whether there was a public emergency to satisfy article 15 that great weight had to be given to the judgment of the Home Secretary, his colleagues and Parliament, because they were called on to exercise a pre-eminently political judgment.</p>
	<p>Other aspects of the independence of the judiciary came up in debate in the other place. Should judges be appointed to inquiries, for example? I do not take any strong view on that. Recently, the Lord Chief Justice came to an agreement with the Lord Chancellor on how judges should be appointed to inquiries, so as to ensure that the standing of the judiciary is not undermined.</p>
	<p>Once we have the principles right, we can move on to discuss in a more informed way some of the Bill's specific provisions. Let me come first to the supreme court. I confess that, initially, I had some misgivings about its creation. As I have said, the House of Lords is highly respected in its judicial capacity. No one could suggest that it has not been independent, even though those of their lordships acting in a judicial capacity have been Members of the House of Lords as a legislative body. If there were concerns, they could have been dealt with by, for example, the Lord Chancellor not presiding over the Judicial Committee or by the Law Lords not participating in debates in the House in its legislative capacity.</p>
	<p>Having listened to the debates and having heard evidence given to the Constitutional Affairs Committee, I have been persuaded by what the Lord Chancellor has said, as I have by the comments of Lord Bingham and Lord Woolf. The creation of a supreme court, as Lord Steyn put it in a lecture a couple of years ago, is a &quot;badge of judicial independence&quot;. The institutional separation that the supreme court represents minimises the risk of any public perception that judicial independence is compromised. Like the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, I do not give great credence to the article 6 argument. Although that argument might ultimately have been lost, I do not think that we should have regarded it as especially persuasive. However, in terms of the basic principles inherent in our common law system&mdash;the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary&mdash;a supreme court is an eminently sensible idea.</p>
	<p>Of course, even if we get that far, that is only the start of the debate. What sort of body are we talking about? We are not talking about a constitutional court. We are not talking about something like the Bundesverfassungsgericht, the German federal constitutional court. The history and institutional arrangements there are quite different; there is a written constitution and a federal system. Similarly, in the United States, there is a mainly constitutional court. With more devolution and human rights cases coming up, the House of Lords or the new supreme court will deal with more constitutional issues. None the less we are not establishing a purely constitutional court, which would be concerned only with constitutional issues. Our tradition has been that constitutional issues are decided by the ordinary courts, which also decide matters of common law and statutory interpretation. It is absolutely right that that continue to be so.</p>
	<p>There is an issue about whether we have a UK court. We now have a clear statement that we indeed have a United Kingdom court. As I understand it, the decisions of the court on cases from England, for example, will not be binding in the other jurisdictions&mdash;in Scotland or Northern Ireland. Of course, their persuasive force will be great&mdash;I need only remind the lawyers present of the important Scottish case of Donoghue <i>v</i>. Stevenson, which was accepted as binding in all jurisdictions.</p>
	<p>Resources have been raised as an issue. We members of the Constitutional Affairs Committee were impressed by the system that governs the High Court of Australia&mdash;not only the resources available to the court, but the control that the court itself has over the allocation of resources. The supreme court must have a building appropriate to its status. Although it would be an inconvenience for the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) and for me to be unable to sit there as recorders, it seems to me that, when refurbished, a building on Parliament square would be most appropriate to a supreme court.</p>
	<p>Hon. Members have spoken about fees. I am not especially concerned about fees in a supreme court. The legal costs in most of the cases that go to such a court are so great that&mdash;unless someone has taken the case pro bono&mdash;the fees are infinitesimal. None the less, there is an issue about the principle of full cost recovery, which has not been debated by the House since it was introduced in the early 90s, and it would be appropriate to return to the subject at some stage.</p>
	<p>The supreme court will not sit en banc. That is partly because judges, in the past, also had to sit in the Privy Council, and partly because there was a separate panel to hear leave applications. I have no difficulty with that continuing.</p>
	<p>It is no secret that I have not been completely happy with the approach to appointments. Although it is not enshrined in the Bill, it is accepted that there has to be geographical representation: just as in Canada there are always three judges from Quebec, it is acknowledged that there will have to be representation on our supreme court from Scotland and Northern Ireland. My concern centres on the fact that the appointments commission is to put only one name forward. I have argued in the Constitutional Affairs Committee&mdash;I divided the Committee, and it accepted the view&mdash;that a number of names should be put forward. That is because the judges who are appointed to the supreme court will make extremely important decisions on tax, civil liability and contract as well as on constitutional issues. In my view, greater democratic input is needed. I agree with Professor Robert Hazell, who gave evidence to the Lords Select Committee. He said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;I strongly believe that ministers should continue to be involved in judicial appointments and have a bigger say than is now proposed and so should Parliament in its classic scrutiny role. On the executive having a choice, it is very important for the executive to retain a role in senior judicial appointments primarily so that the Government itself should retain trust and confidence in the judges.&quot;</p>
	<p>An additional argument is that such an approach offers additional protection for judges: if they are appointed by politicians, politicians might be inhibited from criticising them too much, whereas if, in effect, judges are appointed by the commission&mdash;the Minister will have only a veto&mdash;they might be subject to greater criticism.</p>
	<p>Before I discuss the judicial appointments commission, I should declare the interest that I was a member of the Commercial Bar Association group that made a detailed submission on the subject last year. I was pleased to hear that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield is generally happy with that part of the Bill. I was not surprised to hear that, because we have reached the present position through evolution. The Law Society called for reform in the early 90s. Lord Mackay as Lord Chancellor opened up judicial appointment by advertising for circuit court judges. Lord Irvine appointed a Commissioner for Judicial Appointments, and Sir Colin Campbell has reported on a number of occasions. The system has been brought generally into line with modern principles of appointment, with equal opportunities and feedback for those who are disappointed. Lord Irvine also instituted the annual publication of a report on appointments. In a way, the proposals in the Bill build on the principles of openness and transparency that already operate. Scotland has a judicial appointments body and Canada has commissions that recommend appointment in some of the provinces and at federal level.</p>
	<p>There are issues surrounding composition. The Constitutional Affairs Committee took the view that the commission ought to be chaired by a lawyer, but the concordat between the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor concedes that a lay member should chair the body, so we have to accept that. There has been some discussion about the extent to which the Lord Chancellor can issue guidance, and the Joint Committee on Human Rights states, at paragraphs 1.54 and 1.55 of its report, that guidance by the Lord Chancellor would breach the independence of the judiciary. I reject that view. There can be no human rights-based objections to the Lord Chancellor giving guidance to the judicial appointments commission.</p>
	<p>Merit is the cardinal principle. We cannot have a representative judiciary. Just as I want the best person to do brain surgery on me, I want the best judges. None the less, diversity is not inconsistent with merit. The excellent 2004 consultation paper &quot;Increasing Diversity in the Judiciary&quot; demonstrates the increase in the number of women and ethnic minority lawyers appointed to the judiciary&mdash;for example, Mrs. Justice Linda Dobbs was the first black female appointee to the High Court. I commend my right hon. and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor for quickening the pace of increasing diversity.</p>
	<p>I take the point made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, but I would put it more colloquially: we have to beat the bushes&mdash;we have to encourage people to apply. Some people might, for some reason, be dissuaded from applying. My concern about the judicial appointments commission as proposed is that only one name will be put forward. My argument is the same as I advanced in relation to appointments to the supreme court: it seems to me that democratic accountability would be better served by more than one name going forward to the Minister or the Lord Chancellor.</p>
	<p>Both in terms of the principles that I outlined at the outset of my speech and in terms of the bulk of its details, I think that the Bill is an appropriate measure to put to the House. I shall certainly support it tonight.</p>

	<p>It is important for Members who are not lawyers to contribute to the debate. Otherwise, there is a danger that it will become a dialogue between hon. and learned Members, and the measure is far too important for that to happen.</p>
	<p>At the outset, I should say that the Liberal Democrats support the Bill&mdash;but, my goodness, the Government have made it difficult for us to do so during its genesis. I do not accept the enormity of the problems portrayed by the Conservatives, and I do not believe that the supposed furore extends far beyond people with a particular and special interest in the proposals. Indeed, although excellent points were made in the debates in another place and by the Committees that considered the Bill, there was a great deal of trade unionism&mdash;people protecting their own interests rather than looking at the wider aspirations of the proposals.</p>
	<p>The Bill is an important measure in anyone's book. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, has been cited a couple of times already, but it is worth underlining what he said on 7 December in the House of Lords:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the Bill marks a gigantic step forward in our constitutional arrangements. Above all, it means that the future independence of the judiciary will be safer than it has ever been.&quot;</p>
	<p>We support that important aspiration. Lord Woolf went on to say:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;if we value an independent judiciary and its task in protecting our personal freedoms, we should ensure that this Bill reaches the statute book.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 7 December 2004: Vol. 667, c. 759.]</p>
	<p>That does not display the doubts which, it was intimated earlier, the Lord Chief Justice entertained. Of course he had doubts in the initial stages, but they have been resolved by patient consideration of the Bill in another place.</p>

	<p>I do not think it is for the hon. Gentleman or me to ascribe any further motivation to the Lord Chief Justice, and it would be unwise to do so. I am quite sure, however, that he shared the widespread concern about the way in which the proposal was introduced. The hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen) said in an intervention on the Minister that the Government had been urged to introduce the proposal for a long time&mdash;it had been subject to undue delay, but it was not a back of the envelope job. The sad news, however, is that it was both. Yes, the proposal was long overdue, but equally, it was produced on the back of an envelope, because the Prime Minister chose to make fundamental changes to the structure of government on the basis of poor or non-existent advice.</p>
	<p>In my capacity as Liberal Democrat spokesman on constitutional affairs, I often ask people two questions. First, what is the link between the highest levels of the judiciary and my constituency? The answer is that the statue of justice on top of the Old Bailey was made in Frome. Secondly, who was Lord Chancellor in 1075? I am relying on various websites for the answer, as I cannot find any historical details about the brief occupancy of the Lord Chancellorship in 1075 by Baldrick. Everything about the introduction of the proposals smacks of the character of Baldrick in &quot;Blackadder&quot;. As hon. Members will remember, he always had a cunning plan. This was the Prime Minister's cunning little plan, but it was rather a bad one, as it involved announcing the abolition of the post of Lord Chancellor without, apparently, a single thought about what would happen next. Indeed, the announcement was made on 12 June 2003, but it was not until 14 July 2003 that we finally had a White Paper that gave substance to the Prime Minister's spurious suggestions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-01-17.595.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="595"  time="17:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050117/debtext/50117-20.htm#50117-20_spnew4">
	<p>I agree with the right hon. Gentleman, but I fear that I will become lost in a metaphorical wilderness if I pursue the Baldrick theme too far, so I hope that he will excuse me.</p>
	<p>Not only did the proposals lack any substance other than a relabelling, which was palpably inadequate to deal with substantial constitutional change but, even worse, people who should have been consulted were not aware that an announcement was about to be made. The Lord Chief Justice had clearly not been consulted, and neither had the senior judiciary. No one in Scotland was consulted at all, despite the fact that the proposals had implications for Scottish constitutional arrangements. That is a serious criticism both of the way in which the machinery of Government operated under the Prime Minister's edict and of the readiness to put into effect a fundamental change to our constitutional arrangements.</p>
	<p>Consultation has now taken place, and it has been extraordinarily productive. We should give credit to everyone who has been involved in the discussions. In particular, the senior judiciary have been remarkably sensitive to the intentions of the Government, who have made a sensible response to those concerns. The concordat, which has been mentioned several times, is crucial, and it underlies our position on the Bill.</p>
	<p>I do not wish to speak at inordinate length in a debate that has already taken up considerable time, but I shall look briefly at the proposals. The first does not concern the Bill itself, but the Department for Constitutional Affairs, which we christened &quot;Decaff&quot;. People in the Department do not particularly like that abbreviation&mdash;which only encourages me to use it&mdash;but it is apt, because of its &quot;justice lite&quot; brand, as opposed to the full-bodied equivalent . We have argued for a long time that we need a proper Ministry for Justice, which would encompass the responsibilities of the Department for Constitutional Affairs but would also go much further, taking a large chunk out of that monolithic bailiwick, the Home Office. Responsibilities that are not appropriate for a Minister with executive responsibility for the police and investigative services would be removed to a protected area, where the proper concerns of justice and the relationship between the citizen and the Executive could be taken into account. Our principal criticism, therefore, is not about the establishment of a new Department but about the fact that it does not have the scope to do the job that we would like it to do.</p>
	<p>Secondly, we are anxious about the constitutional position of the Lord Chancellor&mdash;a post that was abolished in a day, but is now to be restored and maintained in perpetuity. There has been a great deal of debate about the doctrine of the separation of powers and, as hon. Members on both sides of the House are aware, such a doctrine is not current in our political philosophy, although it is in other countries. Surely, however, we have a concept in our political affairs of the de facto separation of matters that are properly the province of the judiciary and those that are properly the province of the Executive and the legislature.</p>
	<p>It was an anomaly of staggering proportions to have in one person a Cabinet Minister with executive power&mdash;a member of the Executive&mdash;as both the head of the judiciary and the Speaker of a House of the legislature. We only have to imagine for one moment arguing in a newly formed democracy that that was the right way for it to organise its affairs to realise what a constitutional anomaly it was. I am personally glad that the anomaly has at last, partially, been resolved. That is something that I have called for over many years, and I shed no tears for the judicial role of the Lord Chancellor, which I think was largely illusory in any case.</p>
	<p>I part company with those who say that Lord Chancellors have never exercised their powers in a partisan way. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) was right to say that over the past 25 to 30 years we have had excellent Lord Chancellors who have not exercised their powers inappropriately. However, I am sure that he would agree that in the early part of the 20th century there were Lord Chancellors who were anything but entirely open and transparent in the way in which they exercised their powers.</p>

	<p>If it is irreversible, let us make that clear in our statutes. That is an argument for the measure, and I think that there was scope for abuse.</p>
	<p>I have difficulties with the notion that the Lord Chancellor has to remain as the Secretary of State in charge of a major Department of State, in the House of Lords. I have problems with that on a number of fronts. I think that as a matter of principle, Secretaries of State should be answerable to this House. I am sorry that not everyone agrees with that, but I think that that should be the position. With all due respect to the Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, the hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr. Lammy), who is sitting on the Government Front Bench, I do not think it is right that this major Department of State can answer to this House only through the person of a junior Minister. The Secretary of State should be available to us for questioning.</p>
	<p>I find it difficult to countenance any Secretary of State being in the upper House. That is my personal view. I cannot understand the position of those who criticise the present Lord Chancellor by saying that he is one of the Prime Minister's cronies and used to be his flatmate, which played a part in his appointment. I think that the present holder of the position often does a very good job, but that is a common criticism. Why, then, would he want to institutionalise that arrangement, so that every future Lord Chancellor&mdash;every future Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs&mdash;had to be a crony of the Prime Minister of the day, because only by that patronage does anyone appear in the other place?</p>
	<p>That is an extraordinary anomaly. There is a further anomaly, and I have to say that the hon. Member for Beaconsfield rather ducked it when he was intervened on by one of his hon. Friends. If the Conservatives wish to see an upper Chamber that is 80 per cent. elected, why is it all right to have a Secretary of State&mdash;a Lord Chancellor&mdash;who is elected and sits in the upper House, but not all right to have a Secretary of State who is elected but sits in the lower House? Where is the constitutional logic of that position? I do not think that there is any logic.</p>

	<p>That is my view. That is the view that I will express in Committee when we reach that stage. I do not want to mislead the hon. Gentleman, and I will make it plain that some of my noble Friends, many of whom have legal qualifications, take a different view. However, from this Bench in this place, I shall express the view that the legal qualification is not a necessary part of the equation.</p>
	<p>I now move on to the proposals for the Supreme Court. This is a significant move but not a revolutionary one. It is absurd to suggest that it is. It is confusing and pointless that we have a Supreme Court already, with absurd names such as the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council acting in its constitutional role, and we choose to call the members of the Supreme Court the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, and Lords of Appeal in Ordinary is exactly what they are not, and nobody should suggest that they are.</p>
	<p>We have a senior court which is not the House of Lords despite the fact that people think that it is. It is a separate body of judges that happens to sit, rather uncomfortably, within that edifice. It has an entirely different function, as has already been argued in this debate, and very often Law Lords do not exercise their role within the legislature, and nor should they because that puts them in an invidious position in dealing with their primary responsibilities.</p>
	<p>We have fictions built on fictions built on fictions. Because I believe that we should be a modern democracy where things are as clear as possible&mdash;although nothing in the law can be entirely clear&mdash;it is helpful to the general public to understand that we already have a Supreme Court that is a separate entity and fulfils a particular function, and that the members of that Supreme Court are the senior judiciary of the land.</p>
	<p>As regards judicial appointments, I wholly support the proposals, with one caveat. In Committee we need to do justice to the concerns expressed by Sir Colin Campbell and the Commission for Judicial Appointments about the structure and role of the proposed judicial appointments commission. We ought to be careful to assess the validity of those concerns.</p>
	<p>In general terms, there is much to support in the proposals. I welcome the enhanced role of the Lord Chief Justice. As I said, I should like to explore whether the Attorney-General should have further express duties. The holder of that office sometimes plays a more significant constitutional role than we give credit for. It is a developing role, and transparency and clarity about what is expected of the Attorney-General, particularly in giving unequivocal advice, perhaps when that is not sought, on the appropriateness or legality of Government actions, might be an enhancement of the role.</p>

	<p>I do not deny that there are difficulties, but they can be overcome. That is the position that the Government have now adopted. The debate has been wonderfully amplified by having a recorder on each side of the Chamber, acting in stereo. I hope the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) will have a chance to contribute to the debate formally.</p>
	<p>Will the Minister confirm that under the Bill as it is currently formulated there will be two supreme courts&mdash;the supreme court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of England and Wales, as presently in statute? Will he confirm that he will remove one of those nomenclatures before the Bill reaches its final stages, as there is the potential for confusion with two &quot;supremes&quot; in one statute.</p>
	<p>It is extremely important that we get the funding right. I will not tease the hon. Member for Beaconsfield about how he would achieve cuts in the Department. That was dealt with in an earlier intervention. We cannot allow the important process of justice to be curtailed by a lack of funding. The funding must be predictable, so that those who administer the court can do so with certainty.</p>

	<p>That is precisely the point that I was making about the marginal cost increase. The hon. Gentleman is right. We can all do fuzzy maths, but it achieves nothing and people see through the credibility or otherwise of such proposals.</p>
	<p>On full cost recovery, the hon. and learned Member for Dudley, North (Ross Cranston) was wrong. We have debated the matter. I tabled amendments to the Courts Bill, now the Courts Act 2003, to deal with full cost recovery, which is a serious matter. The idea that litigants in civil actions must pay, for instance, an apportionment for the upkeep of the royal courts of justice is an absurdity that we need to address. I, for one, am not prepared to see the costs of court action being put beyond the means of most ordinary people seeking justice. There is a real fear that that will happen, and the same will apply to cases that are brought to the supreme court under these proposals.</p>
	<p>There is much to welcome in the proposals. There is certainly much to welcome in the concordat that was arrived at with the senior judiciary, and it would be foolish of us to seek to unpick that concordat in Committee or during the Bill's later stages unless we have very good reason to do so. I shall not resile from my position that the Department for Constitutional Affairs should take a greater role&mdash;a matter that I shall debate further&mdash;but we shall support the Bill, although not the time allocated to debate it, and we shall resist those who oppose it, either through blind reaction or sectional interest, which are unworthy of the considerable constitutional advance that the Bill represents.</p>

	<p>Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, especially for that advice.</p>
	<p>If anyone looks at the Register of Members' Interests, they will see that I have only one entry, which is as a non-practising solicitor, so I have no practical interest in the debate. However, as a former solicitor, I strongly support the Law Society's long-running campaign for more judges to be appointed from the country's body of solicitors. If I mention that from time to time during my contribution, that is the reason. It is certainly not from any personal expectation of reward if more solicitors become judges.</p>
	<p>I welcome the Bill's commitment to the rule of law, which my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Ross Cranston) dealt with at some length in his contribution, and the statutory pronouncement of judicial independence, which is an improvement on the present status of the law and gives a statutory underpinning to the safeguards that we enjoy&mdash;the safeguard against arbitrary government, the safeguarding of our human rights.</p>
	<p>On the separation of powers, those hon. Members who have mentioned Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu (1689&ndash;1755) have been unfair to the gentleman, who was an influential philosopher and a judge&mdash;as it happens&mdash;in France and whose influence was sufficiently long-lasting for his views on the separation of powers to be accepted quite fully in the writing of the original American constitution. It is true that he had an idealistic view of the benefits of the so-called separation of powers in this country at the time that he viewed it, which I think was in 1748, but he probably was not that far wrong at that time in the development of our unwritten constitution. As a snapshot at that time, the Executive was very much represented by the Crown and the Ministers who advised the Crown, the legislature was a nascent and growing House of Commons and, effectively, an established House of Lords, and the judges were independent of both, which was what impressed him in his thinking and writing. Time has moved on and he did not foresee the growth of an Executive with the legislature in this country. What is so different here today is the way in which the Executive dominates the legislature. Happily, the Executive do not dominate the judiciary, and the Bill is here to ensure that no future development in our unwritten constitution changes that. That is why the Bill is welcome.</p>
	<p>Just to finish with the Baron, he did say:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The political liberty of the subject is a tranquillity of mind&quot;,</p>
	<p>and on the loss of liberty he said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;there is no liberty if the power of judging be not separated from the legislative and executive powers.&quot;</p>
	<p>I agree with him on that.</p>

	<p>I take it that the hon. Gentleman is asking whether I approve of the American constitution. I am simply happy to say that I prefer living in this country and I enjoy its constitution much more.</p>
	<p>It is right that the position of Lord Chancellor should be filled by someone who no longer sits as a judge, no longer acts as the Speaker of the House of Lords and no longer carries personal responsibility for the appointment of members of the judiciary and Queen's counsel. It is right to impose a duty on the Lord Chancellor, whoever that may be in future, to uphold judicial independence. It is brilliant that the Bill goes beyond that and imposes the same duty on all other Ministers and all other persons who may have an influence on the administration of justice, but I see no reason why we should require the Lord Chancellor to have a legal qualification or to sit in the House of Lords. I am absolutely with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) in thinking that it is far more desirable in terms of democratic accountability that a Minister of State should be in this House at this Dispatch Box facing questions from elected representatives of the people.</p>
	<p>In future, judicial appointments will, by statute, be required to be made solely on merit and to require good character. That incorporates in statute what we presently practise, so that is correct and desirable. The statute is welcome because it includes those words, but a system of appointment must also be transparent, fair, efficient and independent to command widespread public confidence, so it is essential to ensure that the recruitment process itself attracts the broadest possible field of candidates. The judiciary tends to continue to attract those who look like the present incumbents. There are too few women, too few lawyers from ethnic minorities and I repeat that there are too few solicitors.</p>
	<p>I give credit to those who have steered the process to reach the point that we are at today, beginning with Lord Mackay, who was mentioned by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dudley, North, who introduced the advertisement of vacancies and competition for appointment in 1994,. That was a welcome first step in a process that has since moved on. Hon. Members will appreciate that Lord Mackay was a member of a Conservative, not a Labour, Government, so I like to think that there would be cross-party support for the development that has since taken place.</p>
	<p>By 1998, Lord Irvine, as the Lord Chancellor, was able to end the invitation-only system of appointments to the High Court bench. He was able to change the age limits for applicants and some of the sitting requirements for part-time judges&mdash;for example, block sittings&mdash;so as to be more flexible in accommodating people who would have found the previous system too restrictive for them to apply to be judges. He was also able to introduce the requirement that allegations of misconduct or serious criticism against an applicant had to be specific and backed by evidence or be ignored. He was able to introduce a lay input into the recruitment process itself, and, as my hon. and learned Friend said, he introduced the annual report to Parliament about the appointments process&mdash;again, desirable developments moving in the right direction. When he was still Lord Chancellor in 2001, it was Lord Irvine who introduced the present independent Commission for Judicial Appointments.</p>
	<p>In terms of the continuation of the development and praise for it, I should add that the present Lord Chancellor has introduced the proposals in this Bill, themselves subject to widespread consultation before their introduction, showing that we continue to move in the same direction.</p>
	<p>The existing commissioners for judicial appointments support further progress in this direction. In their last annual report in October 2004, they called for the continuation of the independent audits of the recruitment process, and both I and the commission look forward to a speedy extension of the new system to more of the appointments to lower judicial offices. The significance of that is that the commission could be criticised for not understanding what is going on in the legal profession lower down if it has no responsibility for the appointment of those judges. Broader experience and knowledge of the developing pool of judicial talent would help the commission to make future appointments higher up the judicial system.</p>
	<p>I hope that the judicial appointments commission will make further improvements on fairness and transparency, continuing the good work that has been done to date. I hope that it will integrate diversity into its recruitment work, because I strongly believe that diversity reinforces merit and does not detract from it. I hope to see continued structured and accountable methods of collecting views from the judiciary on candidates who are suitable for office. I also hope that it will introduce further audit trails on how selection decisions are reached. Parliament and the Lord Chancellor can help to secure improvements such as helping to ensure diversity, consistent with merit, in the future judiciary.</p>
	<p>Clause 58 covers the guidance that may be given to the commission and to selection panels for the most senior judges. Guidance may be issued on identifying persons who are willing to be considered for selection and on assessing them. The Bill states that the purposes for which guidance may be given</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;include the encouragement of diversity in the range of persons available for selection.&quot;</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) asked the Minister whether he will assure the House that the good progress that I have recounted will continue. The best answer that the Minister could give would be that the Government will be active in using guidance to ensure that such work continues.</p>
	<p>On the procedure for issuing guidance, which involves not only the Minister but Parliament, clause 59 requires the Minister to</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;consult the Lord Chief Justice&quot;</p>
	<p>and</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;lay a draft of the proposed guidance before . . . Parliament.&quot;</p>
	<p>The guidance must be approved by affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliament before it is given to the commission and to the selection panels. Clause 58 states that the panels and the commission must have regard to any guidance given. For the sake of completeness, the guidance may be revised and reissued too.</p>
	<p>After the change from the present voluntary commission to the statutory commission, the old voluntary commission will be left with complaints, which will be dealt with by a new judicial appointments and conduct ombudsman, who will, to all intents and purposes, cover the commission's present complaints role.</p>
	<p>One worrying omission, which I hope is put right in Committee, is that the Bill does not include a provision covering the voluntary commission's current role in auditing future judicial appointments competitions. Part of operating fair recruitment processes will be understanding what is going well and what is going wrong, which will require somebody to continue the audit practice of the present voluntary commission in the new system, because the Bill does not charge anyone with that responsibility.</p>
	<p>I welcome the Bill and the proposal to introduce a new supreme court. I agree with the Joint Committee on Human Rights that a supreme court with justices barred from sitting in the House of Lords will make it less likely that violations of the European convention on human rights occur in practice. I hope that Middlesex Guildhall becomes the home of the new supreme court and look forward to 2008, when the collection of buildings in Parliament square will become even more impressive, demonstrating in both the geographical and political landscapes that the tranquillity that Montesquieu discussed in 1748 has come to Westminster, the home of democracy.</p>

	<p>I am not expert on the size of those exports or their invisibility, but the present situation does not seem to put off people from abroad who ask for British law to be the basis of the interpretation of contracts and the like; indeed, the system appears to work quite well. On the question of practicalities, the people whom the Minister prayed in aid&mdash;the people from far beyond the seas who supposedly would not understand it&mdash;have not found it difficult to see that the system works. Indeed, only last week I perused a contract signed by a previous chairman of the company on behalf of somebody whom I employed. Although the company was French, the contract was to be understood in the context of English law and any argument about it was to be heard in the English courts. As the French today&mdash;leave alone Montesquieu&mdash;find it easy to understand that the system works pretty well, it is reasonable to think that it is not too bad. It may not be perfect&mdash;I am sure that the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) will mention several aspects that she would like to improve&mdash;but that is true of most of life. The Minister has not explained why this change, with all its ramifications, is a sufficiently necessary or successful alternative to be considered by this House.</p>
	<p>The Minister has not established the first point&mdash;that there is a real problem that needs immediate and fundamental resolution in this House. The second point that he must establish is that, having identified such a problem, he has made a considered response. Here, I very much sympathise with him. He had obviously thought carefully about how to deal with the fundamental difficulty that the issue was not introduced in the most felicitous of manners. I am sure that deep in his heart he said to himself, &quot;I wouldn't have done it this way myself. I wouldn't have suddenly announced something that I had not talked to anybody about, not thought about much, and did not know much about, and then found myself in a mess so that my best friend had to go off and explain to people that what he had said was not quite what he had meant.&quot; This started off in a very embarrassing way&mdash;&quot;back of an envelope&quot; would be putting it politely.</p>
	<p>Perhaps that would not matter so much were not this part of a pattern. Lord Butler restrained himself for many months before making his recent comments about the nature of this Government's approach to institutions of state. He argued, as an independent voice who was at the heart of Government, that this Government make decisions on the sofa. Very often, they do not act properly and sensibly by listening to people, finding out about the various views, and trying to use the institutions of Government better to serve the people, but by changing the institutions of Government ad hominem.</p>
	<p>Let me give two examples that parallel what we are discussing. We have an Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, as we previously had the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, that is based not on making Government more efficient or effective, but on providing what was thought to be a suitable job for the Deputy Prime Minister. His first Department did not provide him with a suitable job because he mucked it up considerably, so the Government created another Department based upon the same principle.</p>
	<p>Perhaps I would not mind that happening on one occasion, but I was very upset when the Government decided to abolish what everybody had seen as the best and most powerful Environment Department of either party or of any European country. They took it away from planning and local government, where it had the power to act, and shoved it in with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, as though the environment were something to do with rural development and woolly animals. It is not surprising that since then the environment has had no influence on any of the Government's decisions. When they introduced a planning Bill, the Minister responsible for the environment was never consulted.</p>

	<p>I am glad that that is the case. The fact that a court has made the point explains why the problem is at the heart of the Bill. The relationship between the law makers and the law interpreters is necessarily uneasy&mdash;there is bound to be tension; there always has been&mdash;but such tension can work creatively as long as both sides remember their purpose. Our purpose is to produce good law so that judges can make good judgments. We have allowed the Government to emasculate us.</p>
	<p>I stress to my hon. Friend the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly), who is on the Front Bench, that before he gets too enamoured of the wholly alien United States system, we have a parliamentary democracy and a key point in it is the ability of the legislature to keep the Executive under scrutiny and control. That means that the opposition&mdash;in the Government, of which there is a good deal, and outside the Government&mdash;must have the time to do that.</p>
	<p>My worry about my party is that when we return to power we will say, &quot;Well, they did it to us, so we won't give the powers back to the Opposition.&quot; I want to stress now that when we return to power, some of us will insist that our first action is to give back power to the people. That means that this House must have the opportunity to debate issues, such as the subject of our discussion, in the way in which we always did formerly, and thus produce legislation that is the envy of the world.</p>

	<p>Then this is an ideal opportunity for someone who has been married for 27 years to give the hon. Gentleman a small piece of advice. When one's wife asks, &quot;Can we afford to do this?&quot;, the one argument that one can never put forward is, &quot;Yes, but only if we don't do that.&quot; That cannot be part of the argument. The argument is always about doing both. That is a necessary part of life. The trouble with Parliament is that we are acting like that. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) got up and said that we had to have the best legal system in the world and that if it cost a certain amount of money, that would be the amount we would have to spend. The Liberals are well known for doing this, as they have no hope of coming to power. However, if we spend it on that, I am afraid that we cannot spend it on anything else.</p>
	<p>We have created a Bill whose justification has not been made out. It is not a considered response to a proper discussion. It will not be given proper scrutiny, and it will use resources that would be better used elsewhere. I am sorry that it has been brought before us and I wish that we were spending this time dealing with the issues that really matter, such as climate change or the way in which people who were already very poor have become poorer under this Government. The Government are not prepared to discuss those issues. Perhaps we could even have a debate about the Iraq war&mdash;an unnecessary and unacceptable war that we should have debated properly. We spent seven hours discussing it, yet we spent 200 hours on the Hunting Bill. This Government have no priorities and, above all, they do not know how to do things. They should not institutionalise the means of achievement, and that is why the Bill should be opposed.</p>

	<p>It is a pleasure, as ever, to follow the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer), although I am baffled by a number of the things that he said. I am left almost speechless by his comments about this Government putting people into poverty, when in fact we have rescued more than 1 million children from the poverty in which they were left by his Government, and by his complaint about cuts in legal aid, when we are spending more on it than ever before and are distributing it better.</p>
	<p>I should like to get to the point of this debate&mdash;something that the right hon. Gentleman did not do to a great extent&mdash;and say that this is an excellent Bill. Its main provisions will bring about a long-overdue modernisation of our constitution and start the process of making the courts and the legal system citizen-centred public services, which, to be consistent with a thoroughgoing democracy, is what they should be.</p>
	<p>I applaud the Bill's long-overdue commitment to the rule of law and judicial independence, and I congratulate the Government on introducing it.</p>
	<p>I strongly support the substantial change to the office of Lord Chancellor. In particular, he will no longer sit as a judge, he will not act as a Speaker of the House of Lords and he will no longer carry personal responsibility for the appointment of members of the judiciary and Queen's counsel. One could say that the main need for the Lord Chancellor to offer a separate personal guarantee of independence of the judiciary has been much reduced. I will not repeat the two quotes that I have already given from the Lord Chief Justice, whose negotiating skills with the Bill must be applauded, but he said that the Bill offers a better guarantee of judicial independence. I agree with him. However, there continues to be a requirement that the Lord Chancellor should&mdash;indeed, must&mdash;defend judicial independence and ensure that the judiciary has the resources to exercise its function and in government to represent the public interest in the administration of justice. That clearly requires the Lord Chancellor to be a senior Minister, but it certainly does not require either of the two restrictions that have been put on it in the Bill: notably that the Lord Chancellor must come from the Lords and that he must be a lawyer&mdash;not a bit of it. A Minister in the Lords is no more and no less secure in a ministerial post than a Minister in the Commons. He is no better and no worse equipped to take a strong stance in Cabinet than a Minister in the Commons.</p>
	<p>I take the point made by the Constitutional Affairs Committee that if someone at the end of his career is Lord Chancellor, as in the past&mdash;not least because he sat as a judge in the House of Lords, and such seniority is usually accompanied by maturity of years&mdash;he will not have a future to be interrupted if he defends the rule of law against his patron's displeasure. Another argument, of course, is that being Lord Chancellor in this place would be the pinnacle of anyone's achievements, but if he disagreed with his patron he could easily have that career ended, in suddenly imposed obscurity, instead of staying in that high-status, top-performing, challenging role. There is still a great deal of pressure, and while Ministers are appointed as they are there is no structural answer. There is only the integrity of the appointee and his or her strength of character. Those characteristics are to be found in this House every bit as much as in the other House.</p>
	<p>No one who takes on the role now can be under any illusion: there will be a statutory duty on them to guarantee the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law. They will be called to account for their conduct of that duty and they will be called to account for any dereliction of it as severely in this House as they would be in the other place. This House is as quick as the other place to see any such dereliction. There is no justification for requiring the Lord Chancellor to be a Member of the House of Lords and there is an overwhelming argument the other way. He must be accountable for his departmental budget, which is more than &pound;3 billion and approaching &pound;4 billion now. He must be accountable to the electorate through this House as every other Minister is. I want to be able to hold the Lord Chancellor to account when a constituent is kept waiting in the courts because a rape case has inconsiderately been listed as a floater. I want to be able to call the Lord Chancellor to account when my local magistrates court is under threat of closure or to raise the thorny issue of anonymity in family court proceedings when legal aid is not available. I cannot do that if he is in the Lords: I should be able to do so. I have great respect for my hon. Friend the Minister, but the proper situation is that the Minister in charge should be in this House and a more junior Minister in the Lords.</p>

	<p>Sometimes life is simply full of exciting invitations and I shall put that one next to the others. I am grateful for that kind offer.</p>
	<p>My last argument is surely the unanswerable reason why the Lord Chancellor should be a Member in this House. The Tory proposal, as well as being impossible, is crazy. It is crazy to suggest that we should legislate to ensure that a Minister cannot be a Member of the House of Commons. It defies all sense. I might add that the Judges Council sees no reason why the Lord Chancellor should be a Member in the Lords rather than in this place. The judges are the very people who might feel undermined if it were necessary to have a Lord Chancellor in the Lords as a guarantee of their independence, so no one else has a leg to stand on in making that argument.</p>
	<p>It is not necessary to provide that the Lord Chancellor should be a lawyer. One guesses that the next few post holders are likely to be so: it is a huge step to take. However, the composition of the job will change hugely. The equivalent of the Lord Chancellor in the Scottish Executive is not a lawyer, but she is doing the job very well. Of course, it is important to have close relationships between the Lord Chancellor and the senior judiciary, so that the Secretary of State can be well informed by them, but with that help he or she would assimilate the job in the same way&mdash;the example has already been used by my hon. Friend the Minister&mdash;as the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis) has assimilated all the intricacies of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill. He is not a lawyer, but he has managed that. My hon. Friend the Minister frequently shows his sophisticated grasp of complicated legal issues, but he is not a lawyer. One has to work hard, but it can be done. I do not buy the notion that the law is so arcane that no one but a lawyer can ever understand the Department, let alone be able to defend it in Cabinet.</p>
	<p>The Law Society has said, and I agree, that requiring that the post holder should be a lawyer could create the perception that the Secretary of State's primary purpose was to protect lawyers, judges and legal interests, rather than the public interest. Lawyers are rarely seen as the voice of the people.</p>
	<p>The Tories would require that the post holder should be a lawyer, and a particular kind of lawyer. He should have held high judicial office for two years, which I think means he should have been a High Court judge or more, or should have had at least 12 years' experience under section 91 of the Court and Legal Services Act 1990, which I think means he has to be a High Court advocate. That would restrict the pool of candidates for Lord Chancellor considerably. In any case, that pool is occupied by those chosen from the uniform elite whom we hope will be widened by the advent of the judicial appointments commission. To suggest that even as we try to open up the pool to academics, solicitors and the lower judiciary, we should preserve the top man's job for that little phalanx of people who already have higher court advocacy certificates is breathtakingly to miss the point. It simply does not take on board the urgent need for modernisation. I oppose totally both of those proposals and hope that the Government will see them off straight away.</p>
	<p>I am pleased that most people now welcome the changes to the judicial appointment process. Such measures are not new. In 1972, a justice committee recommended changes. In 1992, I was privileged to serve on another justice committee, chaired by the eminent Professor Robert Stevens, which recommended change. It is 14 years since Lord Rawlinson proposed in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 that there should be change, so the idea is not at all new.</p>
	<p>It is wholly inappropriate for a member of the Executive to continue to be responsible for selecting members of the judiciary. That is the real threat to judicial independence. Yes, people have behaved well, but shot through debates on the subject, both here and in the other place, have been comments that individual Lord Chancellors made characteristic appointments. Lord Mackay, it is frequently said, showed his independence of judgment by appointing Stephen Sedley to the High Court bench&mdash;a significant left-wing figure. Lord Elwyn-Jones appointed Sir Morris Finer to the High Court bench but did not appoint Lord Donaldson to be Master of the Rolls because in the 1970s national industrial relations court he fell foul of the then Labour Government.</p>
	<p>The appointments are made by a party politician, whether he is in the Commons or the Lords, and some of them are good. The independence shown by some of our Lord Chancellors has been good but some of them are bad, and the basis of making those appointments will not do. An individual can make a good or a bad appointment and it is individual instinct to try to be fair or to stick resolutely to political patronage, but the way in which it is being done is unacceptable. Judicial appointments at all levels must be made on merit, on a transparent, fair, efficient and independent recruitment process that draws appointees on merit from the broadest possible field of candidates.</p>
	<p>Modern recruitment procedures must be at the forefront, as must be modern recruiters. Of course, the judiciary must be heavily involved, but only within the modern framework of objectivity and neutrality. The judiciary must not dominate the process because it is the homogenous elite that has run the system for so long. It is no joke to say that there has been positive discrimination in favour of public schoolboys and Oxford graduates since appointments began.</p>
	<p>I cringe and worry when people talk about the dangers of positive discrimination, as though we had started from some perfect position where people are selected only on merit. The opposite is true. I am not saying that appointments have been universally bad&mdash;not a bit of it. Most of them have been very good, but they have been confined to one class, which has repeated and repeated and repeated itself by selecting those who resemble it. That is not good enough for a modern and diverse state.</p>
	<p>There have not been many serious mistakes. The calibre of the judiciary is generally extremely high&mdash;at least in the High Court. There have been mistakes; there have been people who were not up to the job intellectually. There have been people, too, who have no respect for the public who come before them, who think that it is their prerogative to sit in court and demonstrate how clever they are. They do not understand hardship because of their privileged background and demonstrate their cleverness by speaking in an arcane way, to the dismay and misery of people whose future depends on their decisions. Those are bad appointments not because those people are necessarily poor intellectually, but because of those characteristics. Some of those bad appointments would not have slipped through in a proper rigorous procedure.</p>

	<p>I shudder at the utter complacency of that intervention, which suggests that those atrocities of injustice do not merit being dwelt on and that one should hurry up and get on with something else. I know that the hon. and learned Gentleman comes from a party that does not welcome women to its higher roles, but it is really time that the Conservatives appreciated the need to come into the modern era and to understand that if they&mdash;like this system&mdash;sanction discrimination against women, not many women will vote for them.</p>
	<p>When such things are known about how the process works, it is not surprising that many people hide their merits under a bushel. It is pretty well known that it is much harder for women, and certainly much harder for people from ethnic minorities, to get into the judiciary. Surely, it is obvious that the wider the pool of qualified people, the better is the calibre of the appointees.</p>
	<p>I have heard it argued, too&mdash;in fact, I am vaguely surprised that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) has not said it&mdash;that women have only fairly recently come to the Bar, so we cannot expect many of them to have filtered through to the top. That is certainly the Tory argument in the Lords to try to justify what occurs because of the discrimination to which I have referred. Women have been allowed at the Bar since 1922, so someone with 70 years' call could be present at the Bar at the moment.</p>
	<p>In 1992, when I was on the committee for justice, there were disproportionately too few women in high office for the number of women who had 15 to 20 years' call at the Bar then, and we are now 12 years on. So that is not an argument either&mdash;sheer discrimination is the argument, and I make no bones about saying that. I know senior people at the Bar who are black, who are female and who are gay who are better in many ways than some of the people who are currently on the bench, but they have not been put on to the bench. That is bound to be so, as long as there is discrimination.</p>
	<p>I applaud the introduction of a system that has every hope of finding the means of fairer selection, to draw from the array of diverse talent that is available and increase the calibre of our already respected judiciary. That is the last point that I want to make about the urgency of the judicial appointments commission, given what has been said by the Opposition. Our judiciary is very good, but we must make it better and this is how we can do so. At last, we might start to have selection for the judiciary on merit.</p>
	<p>I strongly support the Government's decision to establish a supreme court separate from the legislature and in place of the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords. It is undesirable for members of the highest court in the land to serve as members of the legislature. The Joint Committee on Human Rights said that the creation of the new supreme court and the disqualification of judges from sitting in Parliament makes it less likely that violations of the European convention will occur in practice. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) is right to say that there is controversy in legal circles about whether there is any problem under the convention, but surely the Committee is right to suggest that such violations would be less likely.</p>
	<p>Professor Jeffrey Jowell has said that the EU would not now accept for admission a nation that had its senior judges in its legislature. It is a marker of how far out of step we are with international thinking that we have allowed that obvious anomaly to linger so long. No Commonwealth country has adopted that curious structure, although many base their legal systems on ours. Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa do not have working judges in their legislatures. The hon. and learned Member for Harborough referred to that aspect of the Bill as intellectual guff, suggesting that we should stand our individualistic ground and not be pulled into some sort of cheap version of a constitution by trying to resemble other people.</p>

	<p>I thank the hon. and learned Lady for politely giving way. I am prepared to withstand her insults; I am prepared to withstand her arguments; but I am not prepared to accept her utter failure to understand that what I was talking about in relation to intellectual guff were the arguments proposed by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Soley), who is no longer here. The hon. and learned Lady may make her arguments if she wishes, but will she please base them on what I said, not on what she thinks I said or on what she likes to assume all Tories, Conservatives or men say. It would have made for a better argument if she had listened to what I said, rather to what she thinks I said.</p>

	<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman must grow up or get out of the kitchen. He said that moving towards other constitutions by removing the judiciary from the legislature, as proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Soley), was intellectual guff. I do not mind learning from Canada, Australia, South Africa or any other Commonwealth jurisdiction. The hon. and learned Gentleman really must learn to control his words.</p>
	<p>The supreme court is a very good and important development. The ending of the system whereby members of the senior judiciary have seats in the Lords requires the establishment of an effective channel of communication between the judiciary and the legislature. There may well be times when the legislature wants directly to benefit from the experience and expertise of the judiciary.</p>
	<p>I support clause 6, which will enable the chief justice or his equivalent in Scotland and Northern Ireland to lay written representations before Parliament, and a parliamentary Committee through which the judiciary can maintain a dialogue with Parliament might also be appropriate. The Constitutional Affairs Committee has furthered such relationships. Its Chairman, the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith), enjoys good relationships with members of the judiciary, who feel free to give evidence and make their views felt. I do not regard that as a problem, but it necessary to ensure that those channels exist now that the Law Lords will disappear. That change is good constitutionally, and good, rational channels of communication can be set up.</p>
	<p>There are also practical reasons for such a change. First, as the senior Law Lord has said, it makes the position much clearer, particularly for the public who find it difficult to understand and can muddle the role of the House of Lords as part of the legislature and as a court. Let us consider the Hunting Act 2004 for a moment. Deciding whether the Parliament Act 1949, by which the Act was passed, is lawful will ultimately be decided by the House of Lords. Do people understand that that judgment will be made by people who could have voted against the Hunting Bill in the first place because they technically remain members of the House of Lords? Let us consider how undesirable and confused that position is.</p>
	<p>Let me give two practical bits of evidence to show why the change is important. All the lawyers present and many others will know about the doctrine in Pepper <i>v</i>. Hart, which allows the courts to look at <i>Hansard</i> to understand the purpose of any legislation if it is ambiguous. I was involved in a House of Lords case in which a colleague and I were trying to persuade the House of Lords to consider Pepper <i>v.</i> Hart, but after suitable argument the House of Lords declined to do so. Those involved did not want to be influenced in their interpretation by what appeared in <i>Hansard</i>, but three of them were there when it was said, taking on the role of helping to sculpt the legislation, so presumably they were taking it seriously. Does that not make a pretty powerful point?</p>
	<p>In a further House of Lords case in which I was involved the then senior Law Lord came in after the luncheon adjournment and said that he had to make it clear that he had been lobbied on how he should vote on a part of a certain Bill. Just before lunch, I was taking their lordships through that Bill to try to make a point that the legislative thinking in the Act in force must have been A because the new Bill was carrying on that line. He was considering a Bill as a guide to interpreting another Act, while being lobbied politically to vote against it. That is an extraordinarily complicated and tortuous position for anyone to be in. Of course, the Law Lords can set aside what they hear in one role and compartmentalise their thinking&mdash;frankly, there are such good people in the House of Lords&mdash;but there is a danger that they can over-compensate for having heard what they feel they should not have heard.</p>
	<p>It is an extraordinarily unhappy situation in a whole variety of ways. I agree thoroughly with the senior Law Lord, Lord Bingham, that a modern, clear and quite separate supreme court is very important. About half the Law Lords feel unhappy to be in the Lords now. They think that it is an inappropriate location and they will not speak at all in debates. They therefore play no useful role.</p>
	<p>The House of Lords is an excellent judicial tribunal. It shows every sign of wanting to get to the right result. It does not, as many other courts do, merely play and argue with counsel; it argues among itself and is truly intellectually stimulated by an argument. This court can play a great role in our democracy whether it agrees with the Government or, as it has done recently, disagrees with them. It should be freed and clearly seen to be having that role, with due standing, its own building and due respect for its calibre being judged on the merits.</p>
	<p>I support Lord Bingham, Dame Brenda Hale and Lord Steyn who are in favour of the supreme court. I support Lord Woolf, who in evidence to the Select Committee about the Lord Chancellor as now configured, said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;I see no difficulty with a Government Minister exercising any of the functions assigned to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs by the concordat. I do not consider that such a Minister requires any enhanced status or any particular title to enable him to exercise these functions.&quot;</p>
	<p>I agree with most of the people who have expressed support for the judicial appointments commission. This Bill was rightly described by the Lord Chief Justice in the other place as a</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;piece of great reforming legislation&quot;.</p>
	<p>I agree with him that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;it will rank in importance with the great constitutional instruments of the past&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 7 December 2004; Vol. 667, c. 759.]</p>

	<p>I sympathise with the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird). Her voice is clearly failing her, and I sympathise, not least because I am in a similar position. I am rather glad that this is not one of those occasions&mdash;at least, I fancy not&mdash;when I shall have to shout down hon. Members, on either side of the House.</p>
	<p>There are clearly aspects of the Bill that can properly be supported. It would be rather surprising if that were not the case. It is not, in fact, the Bill that the Government first introduced in the other place. Indeed, I think that some 400 amendments were made there. I can therefore say that within this Bill, there are substantial aspects with which we can associate ourselves.</p>
	<p>The reasoned amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) seems to encapsulate the criticism of the Bill remarkably well. It was echoed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer). I happen to think that the Bill is largely unnecessary; it is most certainly bureaucratic and expensive.</p>
	<p>I want to say something about the Lord Chancellor, something about the supreme court, something about the establishment of the judicial appointments commission and, briefly&mdash;Mr. Speaker made it plain that we could do this&mdash;something about the timetable motion.</p>
	<p>I do not know whether I have to declare an interest in that both my father and grandfather were Lord Chancellors. I certainly accept that the role of the Lord Chancellor has changed and is bound to change to take account of the change in circumstances. The role and office cannot be frozen in aspic. There have, in fact, been huge changes since my grandfather first came to this House in the 1920s and shortly afterwards went to the Lords as Lord Chancellor. I suppose that the most important change has been the desire for much greater openness than was then the case. Moreover&mdash;I think that this was important for the role of the Lord Chancellor in connection with appointments&mdash;there were far fewer judicial appointments in those days. I think that in my grandfather's day the King's bench division had 12 members; it has nearer 100 now. It is also true that in those days, the Lord Chancellor knew, or had access to those who knew, most of the people who were likely to be applicants for judicial office.</p>
	<p>The legal profession is now not very well represented in this place or in the other place. There are not many practising barristers in the House, and most of those who practise&mdash;I am one such&mdash;practise largely at the criminal Bar. It is therefore increasingly difficult for Governments to find either Attorneys-General or Lord Chancellors who can be appointed from Members who have served in this place. However, I happen to think that there are substantial advantages in having as one's Lord Chancellor or Attorney-General someone who has served in this place.</p>
	<p>I certainly accept that a number of the roles of the Lord Chancellor must change. I shall come to the judicial appointments commission, but I do not think that the Lord Chancellor should be responsible for appointments to judicial office. It would be a serious mistake, as a general proposition, for Lord Chancellors to sit judicially, although it is true that my father sat judicially on a number of occasions, and attached a very high importance to that role. He was probably wrong, but his judgments were, on the whole, rather good ones.</p>
	<p>That point does not address the role of the Lord Chancellor. That role is extremely important because over 10 years&mdash;in fact, more than that&mdash;there has been a whole flood of Home Office-driven legislation that has had a great impact on the rights and liberties of the citizen. I do not want to go over disputed ground about the previous Home Secretary. I regarded him, and I said so many times in this place, as a deeply illiberal Home Secretary. Much of the Home Office legislation that we are currently contemplating, and that we have contemplated in the lifetime of this Parliament, has been deeply illiberal and deeply authoritarian. I have opposed it and I deplore it&mdash; including, incidentally, the Identity Cards Bill, on which I had the misfortune to disagree with my own party's line.</p>
	<p>It is of critical importance that within the Government, there should be another source of influence and authority to set against the policies of the Home Office. If I ask myself where that person can be found, the answer is that he or she has to be found within the office of the Lord Chancellor. I cannot easily identify any other source of comparable influence and power. It is important therefore that the person who carries out the functions of the Lord Chancellor should have as much status as we can give him or her, and as much independence as well.</p>
	<p>I understand the argument of the hon. and learned Member for Redcar and of the hon. Lady for Stafford.</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Not one of the Lord Chancellors whom I cited would have been described as a cheerful chappie. We do not want Lord Chancellors who are cheerful chappies, but people who bring real authority, pre-eminence and distinction to the role, because only in that way can an overbearing Home Secretary be faced down.</p>
	<p>I hope that the House, in its Committee form, will insist that the Lord Chancellor be a lawyer, that the role of the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs should always be designated as one that the Lord Chancellor should perform, and that the Lord Chancellor should be a Member of the other place, so that he or she will by then be beyond fear or favour. We need to make every attempt to reinforce the status of the Lord Chancellor.</p>
	<p>Like so much done by the Government, the words &quot;supreme court&quot; mislead. The title suggests a genuine separation of powers, and in particular, although this is not stated, the power to strike down primary legislation. As a general proposition&mdash;we will see what happens during the challenge to the Hunting Act 2004&mdash;the supreme court will not have the power to strike down primary legislation. In truth, the supreme court as described in the Bill will largely be the Judicial Committee as it now sits, but sitting in a different, more expensive place and underpinned by an extremely expensive infrastructure. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal implied, if it is not broke, why seek to mend it? There is no overwhelming requirement for change, so I would not change the structure.</p>
	<p>I regret the prohibition on members of the supreme court from speaking in the other place, although I am assuming that we will not have a wholly reformed other place. I hesitate to say this in the presence of my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack), but I am in favour of a wholly or largely elected second chamber.</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend thinks that my point is unsound, but he and I have always disagreed about that.</p>
	<p>Within the parameters of the other place as it now is, I want members of the supreme court to be able to speak. I appreciate that Lord Bingham has constrained the circumstances in which such people should speak, and that there is a division of opinion about that. It is certainly the case that the Law Lords should be careful not to express themselves in a partisan manner. They must always express themselves temperately and bear in mind the fact that they might have to adjudicate on matters that are discussed in the other place.</p>
	<p>Of all those in this House or in the other place with judicial experience, the Law Lords have the most current expertise across the broad spectrum of legal issues that Parliament must discuss, ranging from the complex commercial questions to more humdrum issues of family or criminal law. They have knowledge of great constitutional issues, such as the impact of the European convention on human rights on the way in which the courts operate. The truth is that the Law Lords have greater current expertise than anyone else, because as I have already said, most hon. Members who are practising barristers or solicitors practise at the criminal Bar. Although there are competent barristers in the other place, they tend to have rather specialised practices. For example, Lord Grabiner, for whom I have high regard, has a specialised commercial practice. Of course if we rely on ex-Law Lords, we are dealing with individuals with experience that is not quite as current as one might wish. I greatly regret the prohibition on justices of the supreme court from speaking in the other place, and I hope that the House, in its Committee form, will reconsider that.</p>
	<p>I turn to the judicial appointments commission. The role of appointment should not be performed by the Lord Chancellor or his officials, although I accept that there was a jolly good case for that in the days when the Lord Chancellor knew most of the applicants, or could at least have a private word with the heads of division who did. However, those days have gone and one cannot hark back to them. I agree with the principle of the judicial appointments commission. It is undesirable for the Lord Chancellor's officials to perform the functions that were historically performed by the Lord Chancellor, because they are not well placed to determine the merits of a, b or c. However, we have chosen one of the most remarkably bureaucratic and complicated ways of making appointments that I have ever read. There is a powerful case for depriving the Minister&mdash;or Lord Chancellor&mdash;of any residual power and giving the power exclusively to the commission, but that is a matter for debate.</p>
	<p>I have two real worries about the role of the ombudsman. I doubt whether people who are dissatisfied with the decisions of the judicial appointments commission should have the right to apply to an ombudsman for remedy. I remark in passing that Back Benchers with desires that remain unfulfilled, or Ministers who are disgruntled because they have been passed over or sacked&mdash;I am casting no personal aspersions about any hon. Member in the Chamber&mdash;do not have the right to appeal to an ombudsman.</p>
	<p>Let us consider what is being suggested. If people were to make a complaint about process, I wonder whether the cost and inconvenience of the ombudsman would be proportionate. Indeed, the matter could probably be raised with the parliamentary ombudsman as is. Is it suggested that the ombudsman should be able to express a view on the merits of an appointment? At that point one enters a difficult area, because when one makes appointments of any kind, one's judgment is often subjective. One might have real doubts about a person's integrity, competence, good manners or judicial temperament. It might be difficult to make such subjective judgments stand up evidentially, but they may none the less be real and well founded. I fear that if we set up a process that allows people to challenge the merits of judicial appointment, we will find ourselves landed with many appointees who should not be appointed, because the commission will play for safety and rely only on reasons that can be evidenced.</p>
	<p>The question of merit and diversity is related to that matter, and although it is a small point, it causes me considerable concern. I entirely endorse a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield: merit should be the only criterion for appointments. By all means let us enlarge the pool as much as possible. I agree that it has been artificially constrained for many years. We should have a wide pool, but by goodness, let us stick to the criterion of merit and no other. The power that the Bill gives the Minister, or Lord Chancellor, to give guidance&mdash;for example as to diversity&mdash;could be misused.</p>
	<p>As to disciplinary functions, this is an enabling Bill. It enables the Minister, or Lord Chancellor, to set out processes for disciplining members of the judiciary. Again I preach caution; we need to look at this more closely in Committee. It is perfectly true&mdash;the hon. and learned Member for Redcar knows this as well as I do&mdash;that historically there have been some pretty eccentric folk on the bench. In my professional lifetime I have known some, and even since I went back to the Bar in 1997 I have come across one or two very odd figures who probably should not be there. I hope that the judicial appointments commission will prevent that from happening. In any event, peer pressure and the word from the senior judiciary can be brought to bear.</p>
	<p>I would, however, be very sorry if a disciplinary process curbed the independence of the judiciary. The hon. and learned Lady adduced from one Minister&mdash; I forget which one&mdash;the fact that each year there are between 1,000 and 1,200 complaints about the judiciary. We all know from our constituency experience that litigants, whether male or female, are frequently dissatisfied by the result. Very often they express their dissatisfaction by saying, &quot;It was unfair,&quot; or, &quot;He&quot;&mdash;or she&mdash;&quot;behaved badly. It was judicial misconduct.&quot; I do not want to see the judiciary cowed in any way. We look to it, in part at least, to defend the citizen against the over-mighty Government. Let us then be cautious about the disciplinary process.</p>
	<p>I turn briefly to the timetable. Mr. Speaker was good enough to say that we could speak about it, provided that we did not go on too long&mdash;and my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal have made the points that I would have made. This is a very important Bill. On the Floor of the House, where these things are traditionally discussed, we will be able to discuss only fragments of the Bill, and those fragments have been selected for us not by discussion between Front-Bench Members, but by the proposal of Ministers.</p>
	<p>I acquit the Under-Secretary of State of responsibility. I suppose that he did not know; it was not his decision. <i>[Interruption.]</i> No, I see, it was not his decision. I do not blame him; he is only an Under-Secretary. However, it is not right. If the proceedings were to be timetabled, there ought to have been discussion between Front-Bench Members of all the major parties and the minority parties. The House is being impoverished by the process. Not only that, but democracy itself is being impoverished. I hope that the House will rally, and vote, against the timetable motion.</p>

	<p>I am not sure that today's debate is a very good example of the stewardship of time. I like to think that we could have more time for these proceedings on the Floor of the House, but with discipline in how efficiently we used it to ensure that a number of important detailed points are considered.</p>
	<p>I want mainly to refer to what the Constitutional Affairs Committee has said and done on the matter, and the extent to which our concerns have so far been met. As several hon. Members have said, the problems go back to the way that the matter was introduced, as a back-of-the-envelope decision in a reshuffle. When one is reshuffling one's Ministers, one does not call them in a fortnight before and say, &quot;I'm planning to do this. What do you think? Will you get your officials to do me a paper about it?&quot; The previous Lord Chancellor was no doubt told at 3 o'clock in the afternoon that his services were no longer required and that his advice on the proposals or that of his officials was not needed.</p>
	<p>That is a hopeless way to embark on constitutional reform and it was particularly galling for those of us who broadly support the measures that the Government want to take. They managed to convey the impression that the proposals were designed to weaken and politicise the judiciary, which is precisely the reverse of the intention and, I hope, of the effect. The way that the matter was introduced made it much more difficult to argue for the reforms in principle and then get the detail right.</p>
	<p>The problems that the Bill is designed to solve are primarily ones of principle and perception, not of practice, except in judicial appointments, to which several references have been made. I welcome the agreement that has now emerged on the necessity for a form of judicial appointments commission. Even in that case, no one is arguing that the most senior judicial appointments in recent years have been other than very good, or that the quality of our judiciary is not envied around the world, but we can still make improvements and there are certainly people who are excluded from the judiciary.</p>
	<p>That was the main motivation for changing the system in Scotland, which took on a judicial appointments committee under the guidance of my friend and former parliamentary colleague, the Deputy First Minister, then the Justice Minister, Jim Wallace. That was partly because there was a feeling in many parts of the Scottish legal system that people were overlooked for judicial appointments because they were not part of the Edinburgh mafia, as it tends to be called, and partly because Scotland had a more recent history of political appointments to the judiciary than England and Wales. When we examined the system in an earlier report, we found that it was working reasonably well and were hopeful that an appointments commission, admittedly on the much larger scale required for England and Wales, would be of real benefit.</p>
	<p>When the reforms were announced, the Select Committee set about working and reporting on them, building on the work that we had already done on the judicial appointments commission. Most of the Committee's recommendations have been taken up by the Government, some willingly, some reluctantly in response to further pressure in the Lords and some on the basis of defeats in the Lords, a number of which the Government do not propose to reverse. Some of what we were saying was bolstered by the concordat between the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor, which the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) said was a successful piece of negotiation. Indeed, it has been referred to with a degree of envy by the Lords Chief Justice of several other countries as an impressive example of how to play one's cards effectively. The Lord Chief Justice did us all a service by getting certain things firmly clarified and accepted on all sides.</p>
	<p>Among the things that we said was that the Bill is so important that it should be introduced as draft legislation and given proper consideration. The Government rejected that, but the objective was achieved by the decision of the House of Lords to set up a Select Committee and the decision alongside that, by all parties, to allow the Bill to be carried over into this Session. If that had not happened, it would have been rushed through, if the Lords had agreed at all, in the previous Session, and that would have been bad news. I have to say that I disagreed with my Front-Bench colleagues on that. In their determination to support the proposals, they felt unhappy about supporting the motion to refer the Bill to a Select Committee. The end result of the process is that the Bill has had much better consideration and can still be introduced within a reasonable time.</p>
	<p>Another recommendation that we made related to the fact that the court is partly a United Kingdom court and partly the final appeal court in the separate jurisdictions of Scotland and Northern Ireland. None of that had been thought through when the proposals were first produced. I do not think that a moment's consideration had been given to that. We asked many questions and produced a lot of detailed information, and, to be fair to them, the Government responded fully, made significant amendments to the Bill and clarified a number of matters crucial to Scotland and significant also in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p>We also argued not only that supreme court judges should not be in the Lords&mdash;that is certainly my view&mdash;but that if there was any prospect of retired judges being appointed to the House of Lords while it continues in its present form, either all of them should be so appointed, or none of them. There should be no question of the Government picking those supreme court judges that they liked for preferment to the House of Lords. That would be undesirable and the Government accepted our view on that, too.</p>
	<p>We stressed heavily the importance of the court's independence, including its financial independence. We felt that its financial and operational independence needed to be guaranteed and that its budget needed to be secure. We looked at examples, and at Australia in particular, to see how that could be done. To a large extent, that has been accepted. The Department for Constitutional Affairs is still involved, but the chief executive will be an accounting officer in his own right and several detailed improvements have gone some way to meet the Committee's recommendations.</p>
	<p>We also felt strongly that the court should not operate until it had its own premises. The problem of perception could not be dealt with by having roughly the same people sitting in the same building&mdash;the House of Lords&mdash;being served by the same staff, and by saying that some new supreme court had been created. We therefore welcome the fact that the Government accepted that the court needs its own building before it can start work properly. My view was that, if everything else could be settled, Middlesex Guildhall was the right place. I disagreed with Lord Bingham on that, but he is getting much of what he wants anyway, so we can reasonable argue with him on the merits of which building to use.</p>
	<p>The Committee felt that the Lord Chief Justice should be primarily responsible for discipline and that that should not be a role for the new-style Lord Chancellor or whatever kind of Minister was to come. That, too, has largely been accepted and to a significant extent was sorted out in the concordat.</p>
	<p>We strongly recommended an appointments commission, but even we did not anticipate how many versions of judicial appointment would emerge at the end of the process. Effectively, we have a three-tier process&mdash;an appointments system for the supreme court, an appointments system for the higher judiciary and an appointments system for all the lower ranks of the judiciary. For the first two, judges are very prominent indeed. Again, the Lord Chief Justice's negotiating skills played a significant part. That will have met, to a degree, the concern of the majority of my Committee that the commission should be chaired by a judge&mdash;not a view that I shared. It is a rare occasion on which my view is defeated by a Committee that I chair and a situation that I try at all times to avoid.</p>
	<p>The Committee expressed some strong views on the role of Lord Chancellor. We said that part of that role</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;is the protection of the judiciary from political pressure in Cabinet and, when necessary, in public.&quot;</p>
	<p>The previous Lord Chancellor was prepared to act in such a way, and did so on one occasion in front of the Committee. In paragraph 13 of the report, we said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;There is a radical difference between on the one hand a Lord Chancellor, who as a judge is bound by a judicial oath, who has a special constitutional importance enjoyed by no other member of the Cabinet and who is usually at the end of his career (and thus without temptations associated with possible advancement) and on the other hand a minister who is a full-time politician, who is not bound by any judicial oath and who may be a middle-ranking or junior member of the Cabinet with hopes of future promotion.&quot;</p>
	<p>The Minister smiles&mdash;whether he sees himself in that position in future, I do not know.</p>
	<p>The Committee felt strongly that such independence was important and we were regularly confirmed in our views by outbursts from Ministers that seemed to some of us to be somewhat threatening towards the judiciary. There was a classic example of that from the previous Home Secretary, who when addressing the Police Federation&mdash;a good occasion on which to get a cheer from the gallery&mdash;said, &quot;We only want judges who will help us to do our job.&quot; That was not a good basis on which to set out the proposals. It further underlined&mdash;certainly in my mind&mdash;the importance of retaining a Minister who accepted responsibility in Cabinet for sometimes slapping down other Ministers who did not recognise the importance of judicial independence.</p>
	<p>We anticipated something that the Government did not anticipate: how important the issue had become. The Government did not seem to think it terribly significant, even as the consultation went on, but it became clear that among members of the judiciary in particular the status of Lord Chancellor was regarded as an important safeguard for their position. We recommended that the office of Lord Chancellor should remain, at least for the time being, in its more restricted form&mdash;shorn of judicial appointments and, almost certainly, of responsibility for chairing proceedings in the House of Lords. I welcomed the Government's ultimate acceptance of that when it came by way of amendment in the Lords.</p>
	<p>I personally do not think that it is essential that the Lord Chancellor should either be in the House of Lords or be a lawyer, but I am still concerned about how we achieve the Committee's objective of ensuring that the Lord Chancellor is not awaiting further political advancement and has the authority to challenge other Ministers on this most fundamental issue. I can think of many people who could do the job who are neither lawyers nor Members of the House of Lords, so I am not especially attracted by the amendments that their lordships passed as a result, to a large extent, of such motivation. Ministers must think further about the matter, so that we can ensure that the person who holds the office of Lord Chancellor and is responsible for relations with the judiciary has the status, authority and independence that he needs to be able to do that job.</p>
	<p>I shall mention one other area that has not attracted much attention. The proposals on ecclesiastical appointments arose out of the original intention to remove the Lord Chancellor altogether. At the end of the day, the Government decided to move the appointments to the Crown, thus allowing them to continue to be made by the same people who are making them at the moment in No. 10 Downing street. That reflected the evidence session that the Committee held on the subject. We did not make any recommendations, but we had an interesting evidence session in which much the weight of the evidence was to the effect, &quot;Do not disturb this system, it is working very well.&quot; Those who wanted to change it could not agree on what to change it to. The argument that the matter should be left in the hands of public servants, who were unusually highly commended in the Committee's proceedings, clearly weighed with the Government.</p>
	<p>On a large number of issues, the Committee's work was well justified, because it influenced the course of events. Many of our recommendations have been accepted, either willingly or slightly unwillingly by the Government, and we shall consider what happens in Standing Committee with the hope of reporting to the House prior to Report any further conclusions that we might reach.</p>

	<p>I preface my comments by saying for the record that, like the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), I am a non-practising solicitor, albeit of the Scottish variety.</p>
	<p>I shall focus my remarks on the detail of part 3, which deals with the proposals for the new so-called United Kingdom supreme court. Much has been said about the way in which the proposals came forth. It is certainly true that their timing was the direct result of the botched reshuffle in June 2003. As the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) said, at the time of the announcement of the creation of a supreme court, it had been forgotten that final appellate civil jurisdiction&mdash;appeals in civil matters&mdash;still lay with the House of Lords. That fundamental issue had been entirely forgotten down here in Westminster.</p>
	<p>There was no prior consultation with the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Ministers, which was a breach of the devolution concordats, which exist to deal, inter alia, with issues such as the important proposed changes to devolved areas of Scots law. At the time of the furore in Scotland when the proposals were first announced, the Scottish First Minister was asked his views on the failure on the part of the Prime Minister and the Westminster Parliament to consult him. He said simply that there was &quot;absolutely no reason whatsoever&quot; for the Prime Minister to have consulted him on such a major constitutional change. That says an awful lot about the limited lengths to which Scotland's First Minister will go to stand up for the Scotland's interests, a key aspect of which is the independence of the Scottish legal system.</p>
	<p>The substance of the proposals has caused much controversy in Scotland. On the one hand, the proposals represent a missed opportunity to end the 18th-century anomaly whereby final appellate jurisdiction in civil cases lies south of the border, while on the other, serious questions remain about the compatibility of the proposals with the founding constitutional document of the Union between Scotland and England&mdash;the 1707 treaty of Union. On the first point&mdash;that an opportunity has been missed to repatriate to Scotland final appeals in civil cases&mdash;in post-devolution Scotland, where the Scottish Parliament has jurisdiction over both criminal and civil law matters, why is it deemed necessary, desirable or logical that final appeal in civil cases lie south of the border? There has never been a final appeal to the House of Lords in criminal cases in Scotland and it does not seem sensible to continue the anomaly in Scottish civil law. That is especially important when seen in the context of the specific proposals made in the Bill, which states&mdash;probably for the first time in statute&mdash;that the final judgments of the new supreme court are not to be binding outwith their respective jurisdictions. It has been said that the judgments will enjoy persuasive effect, but if they are not to be binding outwith their respective jurisdictions, why on earth do we need to go to London to have a final appeal heard in a Scottish civil law case? That makes no sense in post-devolution Scotland.</p>
	<p>The fact that civil appeals lie with the House of Lords is simply an historical quirk. Now, in 2005, we have the ideal opportunity to end the anomaly and repatriate to Scotland final appellate jurisdiction in civil cases. That view has been echoed by many in Scotland both within and outwith legal circles. Professor Black, the renowned and respected professor of Scots law at Edinburgh university, described the present system of sending final appeals in civil cases to London as &quot;crazy&quot;. He added:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;I've always thought that civil appeals should be decided in Scottish courts . . . A UK supreme court should only be for constitutional issues&quot;.</p>
	<p>I agree entirely, with the proviso that, when Scotland reclaims her independence, there will be no need for so-called devolution issues to be dealt with by a UK constitutional court&mdash;the UK supreme court&mdash;which is to take over jurisdiction in such matters from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. When Scotland reclaims her independence, the writ of the UK supreme court will not run in Scotland.</p>

	<p>I am sure that the hon. Member for Perth (Annabelle Ewing) will forgive me if I do not follow her Scottish remarks in detail. Her speech and that of the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) were extremely fine, as they were of an exemplary length, and I shall try to emulate that.</p>
	<p>I begin with an apology to the House and an expression of regret. I apologise for missing some speeches. As you know, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I am a member of the House of Commons Commission, and I had to attend an important meeting with Mr. Speaker. I was therefore undertaking House business, so I hope that colleagues will understand why I missed one or two speeches. I regret the fact that few Members are present in the Chamber to debate an issue of such extraordinary importance. It is particularly regrettable that the Government have run out of speakers.</p>
	<p>Those of us who care about the Chamber&mdash;the forum and cockpit of the nation&mdash;will have to address this issue extremely carefully. What we need in the new Parliament&mdash;I suppose, as most of us do, that the present Parliament is nearly at its end&mdash;is a real determination to have the Chamber populated for major debates. When I first entered the House, and for many years afterwards, any major debate, especially a major constitutional debate, would have seen the Benches if not packed, at least respectably full throughout.</p>
	<p>The Bill began in a most unfortunate way, as many right hon. and hon. Members have said. It was classic back-of-the-envelope stuff. A major constitutional reform of this nature should have been preceded by a White Paper, and preferably by a Green Paper before that. There should have been a draft Bill for both Houses to consider in detail. The proposals should have been clear, coherent and deliverable. What happened in the wake of that extraordinary reshuffle a couple of years ago did none of those things. So we were left, especially in the House of Lords, with a dog's breakfast.</p>
	<p>We all owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the other place for the way in which it has tackled the Bill. It went through its own special procedures and it has now produced something for us that is, to a degree, coherent. We owe also a particular debt of gratitude to the Lord Chief Justice. The hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) has cited him on a number of occasions. I do not think that his enthusiasm was necessarily quite as great as she said, but he has behaved in an impeccably constitutional manner. Like the famous Irishman in the story, he would not have started there. However, confronted with what was a potential constitutional crisis he brought to bear his patience, his wisdom, his determination and his eloquence. He has played a major part in creating the Bill that is before us. It is very much a curate's egg of a Bill, in that it is good in parts.</p>

	<p>My hon. and learned Friend anticipates my arguments to some degree. Had we not had Law Lords in the House of Lords and had we not had the Lord Chief Justice in that place, goodness knows where we would have been.</p>
	<p>I am sorry that the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed has had to leave the Chamber briefly. He gave an admirable exposition of his Committee's views, especially in regard to the office of Lord Chancellor. He slightly distanced himself from those views, but when he said how crucial it was that the Lord Chancellor should be a figure of eminence, somebody who was not in any way influenced by his own political ambition, he described the sort of figure that the Lord Chancellor, as envisaged in the Bill as it stands, would be.</p>
	<p>Unlike the hon. and learned Member for Redcar, to whom I listened with great respect&mdash;as always, she spoke persuasively and eloquently&mdash;I accept the logic of the argument that the Lord Chancellor should be in the House of Lords and should be a lawyer. In particular, he or she should be in the House of Lords. I would be delighted to see a woman Chancellor. We have had a woman Speaker and a woman Prime Minister, so why should we not have a woman Lord Chancellor&mdash;somebody who could do that job?</p>
	<p>We need someone who is no longer motivated by political ambition and who, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) said&mdash;or my noble Friend&mdash;can stand up to the Home Secretary and, as I said in an intervention, stand up to the Prime Minister, as well. Looking back over my years in the House, I can think of a number of Lords Chancellors who did that. I think of my dear friend Lord Elwyn-Jones, for instance, from the other side of the House. I think of the last Conservative Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay, whose quiet, avuncular wit, but firm authority, enabled him to say things that others perhaps could not say. Of course I also think of the wonderfully rumbustious and very wise Lord Hailsham&mdash;and there are others.</p>
	<p>If the Government of the day have a large majority, we need someone in the Cabinet who can stand up to the Prime Minister. It was Lord Hailsham who coined the phrase &quot;the elected dictatorship&quot;. In whichever part of the House we sit, we must all accept that when a Government have an enormous majority, as the present Government enjoy, they can do pretty well what they want and what the Prime Minister wants. I was critical in supporting Lord Pym, who was sacked for his pains, when he spoke of not wanting too big a majority in 1983. Things began to unravel for the Conservative Government when the overall majority of 140 or so was attained. I believe that many poor and even bad decisions have been made by the present Government mainly because of their huge majority.</p>
	<p>In such a situation, someone at the Cabinet table who enjoys enormous respect, who is not ambitious, but who has an innate authority and who can speak up, is a great safeguard of many of our constitutional liberties. So yes, I am perfectly happy to see the Lord Chancellor shorn of some of his powers and responsibilities, as the Bill proposes, but I want the Lord Chancellor to be a man or woman of real authority, transparent integrity, wisdom and experience. I accept that it may not be necessary for the Lord Chancellor to be a lawyer, although I would prefer that, but he must have the attributes that I described.</p>
	<p>I very much hope that as the Bill goes through the House there will be no attempt to take out those parts of the Lords amendments. I am glad that the office of Lord Chancellor, ancient as it is&mdash;it has changed many times over the centuries; it used always to be a bishop&mdash;is not be removed from our constitutional history.</p>

	<p>May I provide another reason and see whether it attracts my hon. Friend? The Lord Chancellor not only has to command the respect of his Cabinet colleagues, particularly the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary, for the reasons given by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), but in so far as he is the voice of the judiciary in Cabinet and of the legal system, he must also command the respect of those whom he is representing from that constituency. My fear is that a Minister in the Commons, who was seen to be looking at the job as merely a stepping stone to greater things, would not command the respect that would be required of him in the judiciary and the legal profession as a whole. That is open to criticism and to argument, but it is certainly a reason that is worth considering.</p>

	<p>I am pleased to follow my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack). I entirely agree with the wise remarks about how the Government have presented the Bill to the House. For that reason, I will not dwell on those points, except to endorse them wholeheartedly.</p>
	<p>I am drawn to this debate not as a lawyer, but as part of the lay element&mdash;I have always regarded constitutional matters as being of supreme importance. The longer that I am a Member of this House, the more regard I have for constitutional issues, because they concern where power resides in the country, who exercises it and who is accountable, and to whom those people are accountable, how they can be removed and how they are appointed. Those issues transcend the temporary decisions of passing majorities in this House and lay down the ground rules under which future decisions will be taken.</p>
	<p>What I have just said is disguised by the fact that we do not have a written constitution in this country. If we were in the United States, Australia, India or anywhere else with a written constitution, it would almost be certain that the issues before us today would be subject to constitutional amendments and would therefore require super majorities in the relevant parliamentary Houses and possibly a referendum too.</p>
	<p>Under the unwritten British constitution, however, no Parliament can bind its successors, and no law or Act, whether constitutional or otherwise, is entrenched. Some disagree with that statement and claim that the Bill of Rights after the Glorious Revolution has an overwhelming status in our constitutional history to which we must refer, but the Dicey doctrine holds sway among most constitutional lawyers in holding that there is legally no such thing as a constitutional Bill and that any future Parliament may therefore repeal any previous Act, whether it is constitutional or not. That is the British system and the British way. It follows that the Government of the day may introduce or amend any Bill that they like in exactly the same way as any other legislation.</p>
	<p>That is the legal position, but politically successive Governments have approached those matters with a good deal of caution and forethought, and even with humility. That makes it doubly disappointing that, in promoting the Bill, the Government have, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire said, denied us the possibility of debating which clauses should be decided on the Floor of the House and which should be decided Upstairs. That is a monstrous denial of parliamentary powers and rights.</p>
	<p>I have something even more troubling to say: the Government are serial offenders on constitutional reform and seem to regard the British constitution as something to be tinkered with as a matter of passing convenience. They lurch from one ill-thought-out proposal to another without any real understanding or analysis of the underlying principles and accumulated wisdom that is personified in that collection of statutes and conventions that we call the British constitution. They resemble a blind monkey trying to do a jigsaw puzzle. We have had the botched and uncompleted reform of the House of Lords; the fiasco over regional assemblies; and the proposed European constitution, which will be this country's written constitution if the Government get their way, and is being introduced without any plan or any real understanding of the implications of what is at stake.</p>
	<p>So we come to the attempt to abolish the office of Lord Chancellor, which, as we have heard several times today, was done as part of a reshuffle. The office of Lord Chancellor is older than this Parliament, and it is outrageous that the temporary Prime Minister of the day should, as a matter of passing convenience, announce its abolition as part of a reshuffle without any consultation. There was no White Paper, nor were the Queen, the senior judiciary, the Cabinet or the House consulted or informed in any way. There was nothing about it in the Labour manifesto; no mandate whatsoever exists for these reforms. It was simply a way of conducting an awkward reshuffle, getting rid of one friend of the Prime Minister and replacing him with another.</p>
	<p>That is a shameful way of approaching matters of such importance, particularly given that as recently as 2003&mdash;the year of the notorious reshuffle&mdash;the Government defended the position of Lord Chancellor, saying that that office,</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;straddling as it does the three parts of the constitution, makes its holder uniquely placed to protect the interests of each part against the demands of the others. In particular, it both upholds judicial independence and mediates between the executive and the judiciary when occasion for controversy arises.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 7 March 2003; Vol. 646, c. 1095]</p>
	<p>What happened in the three months between that statement and the proposed abolition of that ancient office? Of course, those original proposals have been heavily amended in another place, which I congratulate on its struggle to get the Government to rethink their proposals, and I hope that they will accept most of the amendments that were forced on them or agreed to. However, the proposals remain radical.</p>
	<p>The Government now have a new way of justifying the Bill. Many hon. Members referred to the separation of powers. Of course, I understand that the doctrine of separation is reflected in various parts of our constitution. Power should not reside in one person or one institution, and there must be a check and a balance on the exercise of all powers. However, it is a completely different matter to advance a pure separation of powers, which does not exist under the British constitution and never has. This House is a standing affront to the pure separation of powers. Of course, in some respects we are a legislature, because we pass laws, enact legislation and check the Executive, but we also support the Executive, who are among us and arise from us. One of the duties of the House of Commons is to support the Executive of the day. That commingling of different parts of Government is established in the House that is debating this Bill.</p>
	<p>So it is with the judiciary. It was noticeable that when the Government recently wanted somebody to do a very political job&mdash;to conduct an inquiry into the death of the weapons inspector, Dr. Kelly&mdash;they appointed a Law Lord. The idea that has been advanced today in various quarters that there must be a rigid, pure and absolute distinction between the institutions of the judiciary, the Executive and the legislature does not apply and never has, and the Government do not believe it.</p>
	<p>If the separation of powers is so important under the European convention on human rights and we are said to be vulnerable to a challenge, how is it that we signed the convention in 1950 and have existed for more than 50 years under the system whereby powers are not absolutely separated? If there is a problem and an impending court case under the convention in which we are said to be in breach of article 6, let us hear about it and deal with it. However, I know of no such case. The reverse is true&mdash;the independence and impartiality of the British judiciary are widely admired throughout the world. Indeed, the Government suffered from that when the judiciary in the House of Lords overturned their attempt to incarcerate people in perpetuity without trial. That happened over detainees.</p>
	<p>The independence does not depend on any theoretical separation of powers but can be traced to the fact that we have&mdash;or had until now&mdash;a senior member of the judiciary at the heart of British Government. Again, my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire made that point. It is crucial that that position continues in order to safeguard the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary against attacks by weaker members of the Government of the day, who are always irritated by the judiciary. Indeed, the previous Home Secretary recently expressed his frustration at the judiciary, which was inhibiting some of his plans on asylum and immigration. That is a bit rich from a Cabinet Minister in a Government who imported the European convention on human rights into our law.</p>
	<p>A Lord Chancellor with the same status as in the past is better than declarations in the Bill that assert the judiciary's independence and the rule of law. They have no more than a declaratory value because no one will enforce them judicially. I quake at the idea of replacing the Lord Chancellor, with his historic office and traditional seniority, whereby he ranks alongside the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary, with a more junior Minister who may be called Lord Chancellor but will be no more than a career Minister on his or her way up the greasy pole, will have no respect for many of the conventions and will not bring to the Cabinet and the centre of Government the weight and authority that is our best safeguard of the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary.</p>
	<p>Of course we need amendments from time to time. The idea of the Lord Chancellor's sitting as a judge has had its day. The Law Lords have agreed among themselves not to vote on matters that are partisan or could come before them in their judicial capacity. The position continuously evolves. However, the Bill goes much further. I am worried by the prospect of granting responsibility for appointments, even with a judicial appointments commission in place, to a comparatively junior Secretary of State, who may be called Lord Chancellor. I am more worried about that than about the Lord Chancellor's making appointments under the current system.</p>
	<p>It is bizarre that the Government and the Under-Secretary who opened the debate made no criticism of the current appointments system. The hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) criticised it and she holds a more logical position. If there is something badly wrong with the current appointments system, let us change it. However, the Government's position appears to be that there is nothing wrong. They have no allegations about the quality of appointments or the criteria&mdash;they say that appointments should be made on merit&mdash;but they still want to change the system. I have observed lapses in the behaviour of recent Lord Chancellors, but not in regard to making appointments. I and others were critical, for instance, of the last Lord Chancellor for holding fundraising dinners for the Labour party while he was Lord Chancellor, but I certainly have no criticism of his judicial appointments.</p>

	<p>If the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) was so concerned about the European constitution he should have voted against Lady Thatcher's introduction of the Single European Act, which was one of the biggest constitutional changes made in this country.</p>
	<p>First, I have an apology. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney), I missed part of the debate to attend one of those quiet and relaxing meetings of the parliamentary Labour party where nothing ever happens. However, on this occasion the Lord Chancellor spoke extremely well on the very issue that we are discussing.</p>
	<p>As a member of the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and as someone who has been interested in the subject for many years, I have a few comments to make, but I shall be brief. As I have said before in the House, the British constitution has evolved over many hundreds of years, but at times&mdash;as at present&mdash;the Conservatives seem to think that it is set in aspic and that we should hold on to it for ever. We would not have some of our great traditions to defend if we had not changed things in the past. Change is long overdue. Before the 1997 election, I said that even if the Labour Government did nothing but make the constitutional changes we were talking about at that stage, Britain would never be the same again. Such change is a good thing. It is long overdue, and we should have made it before.</p>
	<p>Opposition Members say that judges must be appointed on merit, and they are right, but they are only just beginning to recognise that something was seriously skewed in the previous judicial system, inasmuch as that there were hardly any&mdash;if any&mdash;women or ethnic minorities at senior level. The Conservatives could have done something about that when they were in government, but they never did.</p>
	<p>I have listened to comments made throughout the debate about the need to debate all the Bill's stages on the Floor of the House. The Opposition may win that concession. Who knows? We should recognise, however, that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford said, few Members from any party have attended the debate today. The reason for that, I suspect, is that for too long we have seen such issues as issues for the Lords. The Lords have debated the Bill, and I can assure Members on both sides of the House that the Labour party has held plenty of discussions about it, but there has been relatively little debate in the Chamber. I am concerned that if we were to take all stages of the Bill on the Floor of the House we might have difficulty in increasing the number of Members who want to take part. There is something to be said for taking the important parts of the Bill on the Floor of the House while dealing with less contentious parts elsewhere. That would achieve a better debate.</p>
	<p>As a member of the Select Committee, I visited Australia and New Zealand, which have many similarities to Britain, to look at their constitutional courts. One of the most important lessons we learned was that although, as we all agree, it is vital to make a distinction and ensure the independence of the judiciary from the political system, it is a mistake to have too much of a gap between the two, in the sense that we could end up with a closed-shop legal system in which judges appoint judges and the whole thing feeds on itself&mdash;something greatly feared in Australia and New Zealand. I regard the legal profession as one of the strongest closed shops of all time, yet it was never dealt with by either Lord Tebbit or Margaret Thatcher.</p>
	<p>Opposition Members must take on board the complicated arguments about the need to bring the judicial system closer to the people. People in my constituency and elsewhere feel that things are moving on crime and law and order, and that policing is getting better. However, the trouble is the view that, as someone who phoned me today about offences said, &quot;But of course the courts will ignore that, won't they?&quot; One reason for that view is that the legal system, especially as set up in the House of Lords, is not close enough to the people&mdash;as we have argued in the Labour party for many years.</p>
	<p>The Opposition say that the Lord Chancellor&mdash;someone who spends about &pound;3 billion a year, running a Department&mdash;must be a lawyer and sit in the Lords. Why? There is a very strong case for the Lord Chancellor to be answerable in this House and to be heard on the media, defending the way in which the system works and arguing about how it needs to change to improve the lot of the people of this country, when we are dealing with judicial matters.</p>
	<p>If we consider what happens in other countries that have systems similar to ours&mdash;the Constitutional Affairs Committee rightly chose to visit Australia and New Zealand&mdash;there is strong evidence for better political oversight of the judicial system, and the independence of the judiciary from the political system can be maintained. I agree about the need for the independent appointments body and all that goes with it, but there should be more effective political oversight, with a requirement that the people in the key positions&mdash;obviously, the Lord Chancellor is one of them&mdash;must be answerable to the people.</p>
	<p>I might have got some of the details wrong about the father of the right hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), but I have a vivid memory of his father ringing the bell and making a great Conservative speech, while aiming to become Prime Minister and then popping up as Lord Chancellor. As a relatively new and interested person in politics, I was told that those two things must always be kept separate&mdash;but that was always nonsense, and a bit of a window-dressing exercise.</p>
	<p>In fact, Lord Chancellors are politicians, and most people outside the House have spotted it&mdash;they know that Lord Chancellors are members of political parties&mdash;and it is time that we recognised that, but let us not worry too much about whether they sit in the Lords or the Commons. Certainly, let us not worry too much about whether they are lawyers. I agree that they must be able to speak up effectively for the independence of the law, but they do not have to sit in the Lords.</p>

	<p>One of the advantages that the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Soley) has over me is that he was able to make a speech wholly uninfluenced by most of the contributions made earlier in the debate. That may be something that the House will value. It is a pity that he was unable to be here to listen to the entirety of the debate, as I have done&mdash;no doubt he was absent for very good reasons&mdash;because he would have realised from the outset that he did not need to speak the first sentence of his speech, given that the Opposition Members who have spoken do not take the antediluvian attitude that he ascribes to us.</p>
	<p>Many Opposition Members have spoken not in support of the Bill, but in support of some of its aspects, particularly in relation to the judicial appointments commission. There is much to be criticised in the detail relating to the judicial appointments commission, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg) set out those criticisms very clearly. When the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush has a moment, perhaps tomorrow, I suggest that he read the speech of my right hon. and learned Friend, because, clearly, he did not have the advantage of listening to it this afternoon.</p>
	<p>A number of hon. Members have criticised the Prime Minister for making these constitutional reforms, particularly in relation to the Lord Chancellor's office, on the back of an envelope, as part of a Cabinet reshuffle. Those criticisms are well made. That is not to decry all things that have been written on the back of an envelope. As I understand it, Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg address was written on the back of an envelope, and it was none the worse for that. However, we are not here presented with some Leonardo-style doodle by a perceptive intellect on the constitution; we are hearing about what is effectively a mediaeval assassination note written by a contemporary Henry II to rid himself of a turbulent Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg. To do that, the Prime Minister had to invent a system that required the abolition of the office, without thinking of the consequences.</p>
	<p>Most acts have consequences, and this act by the Prime Minister had profound consequences. It led to an embarrassing start for the office of the current Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, who is in every respect a perfectly likeable person, but who does not, I am afraid, carry either the political or the legal authority of many of his predecessors.</p>
	<p>The Lord Chancellor is not always a politician. Lord Mackay of Clashfern was primarily a huge legal intellect, who reached the very highest office as a Scottish judge and as a Law Lord. He was translated into the office of Lord Chancellor, and I am not even sure that he was a member of the Conservative party until he became Lord Chancellor. The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush was wrong about that too.</p>
	<p>Irrespective of whether a Lord Chancellor was a former party politician, it was assuredly true that once he became Lord Chancellor, he gave up any form of party political ambition and concentrated on doing what he was employed to do by the state: to defend to his last breath&mdash;to quote Lord Hailsham&mdash;the independence of the judiciary. It takes someone of intellect and authority, and someone who is respected by the judiciary, no matter whether they are appointed by a judicial appointments commission or under the old system, to command not only the respect of the judiciary and the legal profession&mdash;one can be as rude as one likes about either of those institutions&mdash;but of Cabinet colleagues and the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p>It is no good critics of the old system saying that the Lord Chancellor was no more than a jobbing politician, the protector of a vested interest and not a serious modern part of a modern constitution. It seems to me, at least&mdash;I leave it to others to make up their minds whether they agree with me&mdash;that the reason that the office of the Lord Chancellor is old is because it is good and has served a useful constitutional purpose. However, the Prime Minister, his friends and those who like to write constitutional reforms on the backs of envelopes now come and tell us that the Lord Chancellor's office is bad, because it is old and needs to be modernised. As many Conservative Members have demonstrated all too well in the debate, the Government's arguments are ill thought out and have not been properly assessed.</p>
	<p>One of the arguments put forward by the Government is that the office of Lord Chancellor is now out of date, so we should have a modern Secretary of State in the House who can secure the interests of that spending Department. If one changes the nature of the office or of the job&mdash;the &quot;post&quot;, as the Prime Minister prefers to call it&mdash;it becomes increasingly ridiculous to call that office holder the Lord Chancellor.</p>
	<p>The Lord Chancellor whom the Government would like to see is no more than a junior or middling rank Cabinet Minister. Indeed, we see the genesis of that in the current pecking order in the Cabinet list. Whereas the Lord Chancellor used to be No. 2 or 3 on the list&mdash;immediately after the Prime Minister&mdash;he is now second or third bottom in the Cabinet pecking order. That might be of no importance whatever, but it just so happens that the Government intend to fillet out the Lord Chancellor's functions and turn him into no more than the presiding officer over a spending Department. They will then say to the public, &quot;How ridiculous to have a man who is the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, the Speaker of the House of Lords, and a member of the other arm of the constitution. It is quite improper nowadays for this person to have a limb in each of the three parts of the constitution.&quot; The Government are performing a great con trick, and it is contemptible for them to try to persuade us that the changes that they are bringing forward are based on any thoughtful appreciation of what the constitution has stood for, and what the office of Lord Chancellor means.</p>
	<p>The Minister who opened the debate said that it was right for the person who administers the courts to be a full-time Minister in this House&mdash;but that argument is not especially useful when talking about the role of the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor's role is something else. We could have a courts Department, but if we go back only 20, 30 or 40 years&mdash;before the Lord Chancellor's Department, or, now, the Department for Constitutional Affairs, became such a spending leviathan&mdash;all the arguments that the Minister put forward at 3.30 pm fall to bits. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I can hear my hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt), but I have something to say.</p>
	<p>The Minister said that changing the present situation would settle and clarify the relationship between the courts, the Executive and Parliament and make it easier to understand. If there were any logic behind the Government's arguments, they would remove the Executive from the legislature. If they wish to be purists in the misunderstood sense of Montesquieu, as the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) said, they would clearly separate all three limbs of the constitution, but they will not do so.</p>
	<p>It is a pity that I have so little time, because although my views are no better than those of any other hon. Member, I would at least like the occasional opportunity to express them in the House. I would have liked to criticise the Government's proposals on the supreme court and criticise, yet support in part, their measures concerning the judicial appointments commission. Others have said a great deal about that, and no doubt hon. Members who could not attend the debate will be able to read what was said tomorrow.</p>
	<p>The Bill is by and large regrettable. Its conception was ill advised, and its nurture has not been improved by the arguments put forward by the Government.</p>

	<p>I declare my interest as a practising solicitor. It is good that a fair balance of lawyers and non-lawyers have spoken. We have had an interesting debate, but given the Government's proposals, it has not been satisfactory.</p>
	<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) and other colleagues made clear, the constitutional proposals in the Bill began life as a slapdash press release from Downing street. One and a half years later, the Government's proposals remain as ill conceived as ever and insult has been added to injury because they have refused to allow such serious constitutional issues to be considered fully in Committee on the Floor of the House, as my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Hertfordshirejy (Mr. Heald) powerfully explained. My hon. Friends the Members for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd) and for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) supported that point.</p>
	<p>The official Opposition will not oppose constitutional reforms that genuinely benefit this country, even when they are contained in such an unfortunate Bill. We accept the premise of the concordat and the redefining of the relationship between the judiciary and the Government for the reasons succinctly expressed by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Mr. Hogg), my right hon. Friend the Member for Wells and others. We thus do not object to the judicial appointments commission as long as merit, rather than a candidate's political views or crony potential, remains the sole criterion for the selection of judges.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) and the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird) broadened the argument about the commission by suggesting that there should be a greater mix of gender and ethnicity and more solicitor judges. The hon. Member for Stafford supported a more evolutionary approach, whereas the hon. and learned Member for Redcar was slightly more revolutionary.</p>
	<p>We will not, however, support the acts of constitutional vandalism proposed in the Bill. What my hon. Friend the Member for Beaconsfield called the unedifying spectacle of the undermining of the historical office of Lord Chancellor and the creation of an unnecessary new supreme court are not changes that we believe the House ought to accept. Concerns about the Government's plans have been eloquently expressed, both in this place and throughout the Bill's passage in the other place.</p>
	<p>I should like to address some of the interesting, and sometimes persuasive, arguments that we have heard today. Various hon. Members have considered the office of the Lord Chancellor. The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) explained the importance with which different groups view the role and its independence. We are still shocked by the Government's determination to mount an assault on this long-standing and constitutionally vital position. Indeed, it is only as a result of an Opposition amendment in another place that the Lord Chancellor has not been wiped clean off the face of the Bill.</p>
	<p>In supporting the Bill for the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) made a wide-ranging speech, which included his views on banning all Ministers in the other place and developing the role of the Attorney-General. I do not agree with him that a Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs will have a stronger position in Cabinet than an unelected Lord Chancellor. We believe that the Lord Chancellor has, and should have, a vital role in upholding the rule of law and as the guardian of judicial independence. He should continue to act as the key link between the judiciary and the Executive, and his influence over constitutional matters should be maintained through the tenure of a senior Cabinet post.</p>
	<p>Their lordships took a further opportunity to defeat the Government in the other place. In doing so, they secured an amendment to the effect that the Lord Chancellor must always be a member of the other place, as is the convention at present. That requirement would underline his ongoing constitutional role. He would also continue to assist in placing at least some distance between him and the political pressures of this place. Another Opposition amendment ensured that the Lord Chancellor will also need to have gained experience as a senior lawyer or judge. To undertake their delicate role, future Lord Chancellors must continue to be equipped with experience of interpreting the law.</p>
	<p>The Minister today announced the Government's intention to reverse those improvements to the Bill. After the significant work in the other place, that is regrettable. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham said, both the requirement for membership of another place and that for senior legal experience will help to attract individuals who should be less susceptible to any political influence. As he eloquently put it, they will not give two hoots for preferment or patronage. We welcome that.</p>
	<p>I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire that the Lord Chancellor has the inherent power to stand up to Prime Ministers. He and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) also made the important point that, had we not had the Law Lords in the upper Chamber, the content of the Bill, as it was delivered to this House, would be much worse.</p>
	<p>My right hon. Friends the Members for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) and for Wells, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham spoke of how style and convention is vital to the work of the Lord Chancellor and effective in practice. That includes the power of advice and influence, which needs professional expertise. A system that has taken 1,000 years to build is now, it is said, to be sacked in two years. The hon. and learned Member for Redcar said that it was unacceptable that members of the Executive should be able to appoint the judiciary, but spoke in rather absolute terms that do not always reflect the subtlety of our constitutional process.</p>
	<p>Many hon. Members spoke of the Government's proposal to create a supreme court, which is also the focus of our reasoned amendment. In creating such a court, the only outcomes that appear guaranteed are unnecessary upheaval and unwarranted cost. The Government's starting estimate is for &pound;30 million of set-up costs, but we all know how good they are at building estimates. Furthermore, an estimated &pound;8.8 million of annual running costs for the new court stands in marked contrast to current running costs of a little over &pound;168,000 a year. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wells mentioned how the situation is being exacerbated by proposals to increase court fees to litigants.</p>
	<p>What do we stand to gain in return for that hefty investment? The Appellate Committee of the House of Lords is admired at home and abroad for the quality of its rulings, as hon. Members have said. The work of the Law Lords would not change in a new supreme court, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills and my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal. How would rehousing the Law Lords add anything to the excellence for which they are so rightly renowned? There may be some practical difficulties with the present arrangements, but why not explore further the suggestions made in another place for improving the facilities available to the Appellate Committee at Westminster?</p>
	<p>The Government seem to think that the public are in total confusion over the role of the Appellate Committee and, worse still, they question the Committee's independence. I concede that a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary may not be a household name, but the role of the Law Lords as final arbiters of British justice is widely recognised in this country. We think that the public see clearly how well the country's highest court works and see no need to change it. A change of name would not produce some sudden breakthrough in public understanding. If anything, new questions would be thrown up. If a shiny new supreme court would prove so independent of Parliament, why would Parliament continue to be supreme over it?</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Perth (Annabelle Ewing) and the Scottish National party seem to be jumping on the bandwagon and want to use the proposals as an opportunity for the repatriation of jurisdiction to Scottish courts. As to the public's opinion, how would the court command more respect by moving from the nation's seat of power to less prestigious surroundings? The Law Lords might instead be perceived as ensconced in some ivory tower, delivering judgments detached from the real decision making in Parliament.</p>
	<p>The hon. and learned Member for Dudley, North (Ross Cranston) made a serious and measured speech on access to justice, but his comparison with Zimbabwe reinforced our contention that what we have in this country works pretty well. Separation of powers does not require the Law Lords to be evicted from Parliament, just as the Government are not proposing that the Executive need to be prised from the legislature.</p>
	<p>In noting the disagreement between the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed and Lord Bingham, I add that the functions of the Appellate Committee would not change with a new building, nor would the impartiality with which the Law Lords undertake their work. The Government's arguments on the point seem theoretical at best and, at worst, represent a failure to recognise the overall constitutional balance that works in this country.</p>
	<p>The integrity and independence of the Appellate Committee are not in question. As many hon. Members have attested, the scrupulous conduct of the Law Lords in another place already bears witness to their independence. Even the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998 has not challenged that legitimacy. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham and others have noted, removing the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary from Parliament would only impoverish the quality of debates and legislation arising in the other place. The Law Lords would likewise stand to lose something: the benefit of their proximity to the heart of government. In short, our present arrangements are effective and respected. The Government's demand for a supreme court risks damaging that position, at significant financial cost and for few if any tangible benefits.</p>
	<p>As my right hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk, Coastal warned, showing his experience of government and, incidentally, of a happy marriage, this is a Government of words, not action. He showed how we have not been given details of how the plans will work, while we know that what we have works now. He powerfully called for a return to courtesy being shown towards this place.</p>
	<p>We must resist any further attempts by this Government to modernise purely for the sake of ticking another box in Labour's modernisation agenda. Enough parliamentary time has already been spent on measures that are not a priority for the British public. Like us, they will not understand why millions of pounds should be spent needlessly on a supreme court given that the Law Lords have proved so adept at their work. Similarly, they will not comprehend a Government who seek to abolish in the Lord Chancellor a Minister who for hundreds of years has helped to ensure that the rule of law is respected by the Executive. The Government are forcing through their constitutional hobby-horses with inadequate justification.</p>
	<p>In those circumstances and for the reasons that I have set out, I ask the House to vote against the Second Reading of this Bill and in favour of the reasoned amendment tabled by my hon. Friends and I.</p>

	<p>Today's debate has been characterised by the spectre of the Opposition trying to find their feet&mdash;at least on finances&mdash;and falling over themselves in the process. The reasoned amendment is one of enervating insularity. They would deny the people of this country a supreme court that is absolutely free of the taint of political process&mdash;and for what? For nothing more than grubby opportunism. Today, we have heard the dinosaurs and continued to watch the process of their extinction with interest.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) sums up the position nicely and in so doing demonstrates that he and his party have become the Alf Garnett of British politics. It would be amusing if they were not so deadly serious. Theirs is the same patrician view that voted against devolution in Scotland and Wales, the Human Rights Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Every time the Government attempt to reconnect our public institutions with the people they serve, the Opposition oppose us.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-01-17.651.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1033" speakername="David Lammy" colnum="651"  time="21:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050117/debtext/50117-35.htm#50117-35_spnew3">
	<p>We are debating the Constitutional Reform Bill. Happily, other hon. Members have been more resolute in their values and contributions today. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dudley, North (Ross Cranston) offered a concise and considered endorsement of the rule of law and the proposals as framed. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath) voiced the Liberal Democrats' support for the Bill and disagreed with the official Opposition's suggestions regarding the enormity of the consequences. We heard outstanding contributions from my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird), not only in her main speech, but in her interventions. We also heard a powerful speech&mdash;albeit one with which I disagreed&mdash;from the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)&mdash;and a thoughtful one from my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney).</p>
	<p>The Bill is not constitutionally disastrous, as the hon. Member for Beaconsfield suggested, nor is it about change for change's sake amounting to a white elephant. It is about the relationship between people and the institutions that govern them, which is critical to a liberal democracy, as he knows. Yes, of course we should take pride in our constitutional heritage as the right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal (Mr. Gummer) and the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack) suggested. Our institutions are respected and renowned throughout the world, but a strong reputation should not prevent us from looking at how those arrangements are working in the 21st century. We must be informed by our history, not dazzled or paralysed by it.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that a body that exercises the same functions as the House of Lords is a waste of money. He knows that that argument is based on a false premise. The Government are not saying that the new supreme court would exercise different functions from the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords; we are saying that, at the turn of the 21st century, the time has come to ensure that the highest appeal court is separate from the legislature. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dudley, North said, quoting Lord Bingham, that separation is a badge of judicial independence.</p>
	<p>The time has come. It is unacceptable in the 21st century for the judges who are charged with deciding whether the detention of 12 suspected terrorists in Belmarsh is lawful also to sit in Parliament. It is unacceptable that judges sitting in the Lords must decide whether a Bill passed by the very House of which they are Members is compatible with the Human Rights Act 1998. It is unacceptable in the 21st century for us to tell emerging democracies that it is fundamental that they have a separation of powers but not to have the same ourselves.</p>
	<p>The right hon. Member for Suffolk, Coastal said that that the judiciary is not biased. Of course, Members of Parliament know that there is no political bias in the decisions reached by the judges, but that is not enough. Our commitment to judicial independence must be public and demonstrably clear. Our new supreme court will deliver that. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield was one of a number of Opposition Members who raised the issue of costs. The cost of locating the court at Middlesex Guildhall, as hon. Members will be aware following discussion, is &pound;30 million. That cost is effectively for the refurbishment of the existing building, and I am pleased that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Dudley, North and the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome supported the Government by saying that the building is desirable. In Lord Bingham's words, the cost reflects</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the importance which a liberal society attaches to the rule of law.&quot;</p>

	<p>In his speech, the Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, the hon. Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie), had to admit that rooms to replace the eight or nine Crown court rooms in the Guildhall must be found elsewhere in London. Where is that building to be found, when will it be completedand what will it cost?</p>

	<p>We are still consulting on that, as the hon. and learned Gentleman knows as a court recorder.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Beaconsfield said that the establishment of a supreme court would deny Parliament the experience and expertise that the Law Lords bring to debates and legislation. It is axiomatic that, in any policy to separate the supreme court from the House of Lords, the supreme court judges should cease to have a direct role in the work of the House. Law Lords are judges, not legislators, and are specifically appointed to act as the UK's supreme court. Half the Law Lords are reported to be uncomfortable with the present arrangements. Some of them observe a self-denying ordinance and do not participate in debates on political matters on which they may have to adjudicate. It is clearly time to sort out that confusing situation.</p>
	<p>It specious to suggest that the House of Lords will lose expertise. Retired Law Lords can remain in the House and contribute if they wish. There has been discussion about the location of the new court, as I said. Lord Millett said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The fact is that this House can no longer provide the accommodation, resources and facilities which a properly serviced Supreme Court requires&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 12 November 2004; Vol. 425, c. 1293.]</p>
	<p>There are certainly compelling grounds to change that arrangement.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Perth (Annabelle Ewing) raised the failure of the supreme court to repatriate final appellate jurisdiction of civil cases to Scotland. That is not the case. The Scottish Executive and the Scottish Law Society were consulted and favour our proposals. There is not a break with the treaty of Union. There has been considerable agreement today that the office of Lord Chancellor should be reformed to meet the demands of modern and complex government. The hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly) said that we have been defeated on this issue. However, it is not about the title but the responsibilities of that office. The relationship between the citizen and the state is too important to be left unchecked, unreformed and out of touch. Following a long period of political stagnation until 1997, the legislation is important, and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise in the House the important issue of controlling the sale of violent video games. I am delighted that my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts is on the Front Bench.</p>
	<p>Hon. Members may recall that I raised at Prime Minister's questions on 15 September 2004 the case of Stefan Pakeerah, a 14-year-old Leicester schoolboy who was brutally murdered. Stefan's parents believe that the perpetrator of that savage attack was influenced by the video game &quot;Manhunt&quot;. Stefan's mother, Giselle Pakeerah, has been campaigning to ban the sale of the PlayStation2 game. Stefan's father, Patrick Pakeerah, said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The game was like an instruction manual&quot;.</p>
	<p>Seventeen-year-old Warren Le Blanc pleaded guilty to Stefan's murder and will serve at least 13 years in prison before being considered for release.</p>
	<p>Since the tragic attack, I have been sharing the concerns of the Pakeerah family and have received a growing number of letters from concerned parents on the issue. I am grateful for the support of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury (Ann Taylor) and other parliamentary colleagues.</p>
	<p>The intense worry about video and computer games is based on the belief that the violent games are totally inappropriate for all children. Video games have come a long way since the creation of Pong in the early 1970s. Nowadays, there are thousands of games to choose from, and the technology becomes more and more sophisticated every day. In a little more than two years, video game consoles have gone from processing 350,000 polygons per second&mdash;a measure of graphic and action quality&mdash;to 125 million polygons per second. The increasingly realistic and exciting nature of electronic games has helped to make them immensely popular with children and youths. According to David Walsh, a researcher with the National Institute on Media and the Family, 79 per cent. of American children now play computer or video games on a regular basis. Children between the ages of seven and 17 play for an average of eight hours a week. I am the father of two children&mdash;Luke, aged nine, and Anjali, aged seven. They, too, play these games.</p>
	<p>For the video games industry, 2004 was one of the most successful gaming years ever. Sales totalled &pound;1.34 billion in the UK last year, a rise of 6.6 per cent. on 2003, according to the European Leisure Software Publishers Association. The game most anticipated for 2004 was &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, and it has sold an astonishing 1.75 million copies since its release at the end of October 2004. Without a doubt, we are in the midst of a gaming explosion. According to Deloitte and Touche, the worldwide number of game-compliant devices other than personal computers&mdash;mobile phones, consoles and hand-held computers, for example&mdash;will see a sixfold rise by 2010, from 415 million now to 2.6 billion.</p>
	<p>Most of the games on the market are appropriate for young players, and the best of them can bring a lot of benefits. Besides being fun, some of the games provide practice in problem solving and logic, as well as in strategising. However, the few games that feature violence, gore and antisocial behaviour have raised concerns. The virtual reality aspect of games has entered a new phase of reviving history by replaying it. The recent launch of JFK Reloaded, which allows players to simulate the shooting of former American President John F. Kennedy, can be easily downloaded from the internet without any control measures, and be played by children younger than the recommended age limit. This disgusting game, with its appalling content, should not be allowed on the market.</p>
	<p>The case of Stefan Pakeerah shocked the city of Leicester. Warren Le Blanc lured Stefan from Glenfield into the woodlands near his home at Stokes Wood Park, New Parks, Leicester, then chillingly inflicted more than 50 injuries with a claw hammer and a kitchen knife. He initially intended robbing Stefan of drugs and cash to raise money to pay off a debt. Mrs. Pakeerah, a senior nurse, remembers her only son as an intelligent, handsome, courteous and amazingly popular young man with an excellent sense of humour and a real zest for life. More than 350 people attended Stefan's funeral, and there are more than 1,200 entries on a memorial website set up in memory of Stefan by one of his friends. It is obvious that Stefan was loved by many people and held in very high regard. Passing sentence, Judge Michael Stokes QC said to Le Blanc:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;You've committed a truly appalling crime and have taken the life of a 14-year-old boy in the most brutal fashion. You and you alone carried out a prolonged murderous vicious attack with weapons upon someone who thought you were a friend.&quot;</p>
	<p>Stefan's parents believe that their son's killer mimicked a game called Manhunt, in which players score points for brutal killings. The game has been banned in Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand's chief censor, Bill Hastings, has cited the game as the most violent ever made. I pay tribute to Mrs. Pakeerah, a brave and courageous mother, who in her grief could easily have let matters pass, but who has started an impressive campaign on this issue. She will not give up until something is done.</p>
	<p>Violence is a recurring theme in the media, and the two combined have often been linked with aggressive behaviour in young people. The current trend in video games is for the players to be the bad guys, acting out criminal fantasies and earning points for attacking and killing innocent bystanders. Although the games are rated 18 for adult audiences, it is common knowledge that they are popular among young people. Nine out of 10 children have a computer or games console. A quarter play video games every day.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2005-01-17.665.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1300" speakername="Keith Vaz" colnum="665"  time="22:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050117/debtext/50117-38.htm#50117-38_spnew0">
	<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. He is right and I agree with everything that he said. I hope later in my speech to point out what can be done.</p>
	<p>Most games are harmless entertainment, but in many amazingly lifelike popular titles, children are acting out violent experiences on their screens. According to the Video Standards Council, 97 per cent. of all games are suitable for everyone. The few that qualify for careful scrutiny contain the following material. Players in &quot;Grand Theft Auto 3&quot; earn points by carjacking and stealing drugs from street people and pushers. In &quot;Carmageddon&quot;, players are rewarded for mowing down pedestrians&mdash;sounds of cracking bones add to the realistic effect. The first-person shooter in &quot;Duke Nukem&quot; hones his skills by using pornographic posters of women for target practice, and earns bonus points for shooting naked and bound prostitutes and strippers who beg, &quot;Kill me.&quot; In the game &quot;Postal&quot;, players act out the part of the postal dude, who earns points by randomly shooting everyone who appears, including people walking out of church and members of a high school band. Postal dude is programmed to say, &quot;Only my gun understands me.&quot;</p>
	<p>Unlike films and television, which are passively watched, the game lets the player feel the sensation of committing violent acts. Those playing the game are in the game, but there is no pain or aftermath, so children never learn the real-life consequences. The main concern is that children, unlike adults&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;have a problem in separating fantasy from reality. When young children play those violent video games, they are becoming more and more vulnerable to those violent messages.</p>
	<p>Following a public outcry, I convened a meeting with a few parliamentarians and the members of the video games industry to highlight the ambiguities in the current system. Towards the end of last year, in a meeting with my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister at the House, Mrs. Pakeerah and I urged him to tackle the menace of violent video games by examining the existing law governing the classification of video games&mdash;in particular, their labelling&mdash;and requesting the governing board to take a more cautious approach. My right hon. Friend made it clear at the meeting that he was looking at ways to strengthen legislation in the area to protect children. He listened with great care and attention to Mrs. Pakeerah and I am most grateful to him for his real concern about the issue.</p>
	<p>I wish to make it clear that the campaign is not about stopping adults doing anything: it is about protecting our children. Following the firm commitment by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to protect children and to review the law governing video games, I value the opportunity to debate the issue in this House.</p>
	<p>Over the years, there have been more than 3,000 research studies into the effects of screen violence, encompassing film, television, video and, more recently, computer and video games. However, little research has been carried out on interactive entertainment as it was originally perceived as a harmless and enjoyable pastime. Nevertheless, with the ever-increasing interest and participation of young children in that activity, much concern has been expressed about the effects of such games on them. At the centre of the debate is the question of whether they are detrimental to a young person's healthy development. There are specific concerns about the implications for aggression, addiction, criminal activity and reduced academic achievement.</p>
	<p>I understand that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is commissioning a review of existing research to determine whether there is a link between playing violent video games and real-world behaviour. The last such Government study was carried out by the Home Office in 2001, and the results were inconclusive. Research into the effects of long-term exposure to computer games on subsequent behaviour is noticeably lacking and at present remains speculative. Studies to examine the effects of computer games on children's aggressive behaviour and self-esteem only involve measurement of the possible short-term aggressive consequences, so I urge my right hon. Friend the Minister to fill that question vacuum and commission new research into the long-term effects of playing such interactive games.</p>
	<p>Last week, accompanied by Mrs. Pakeerah, I visited the third largest interactive publisher in the UK, Activision based in Slough, to see how publishers classify video games. Activision is a leading international publisher of video games, with 6 per cent. of the market share; its European headquarters is in the United Kingdom. Its profits for last year are estimated at just over &pound;100 million. Some of its games include &quot;Doom 3&quot;, &quot;X-Men&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.From my visit, I learned that violence in over-18 video games is a staple of the video game industry. It takes between 20 and 60 people to develop an idea for a game and between 12 and 18 months to create it. The entire investment period can take up to three years. During that time, the board responsible for classifying the video game is called in to give expertise about the rating to be given to the game and about its target audience.</p>
	<p>At the early stages in the creation of the video, the publisher foresees, using guidelines set out by the video games classification board, which rating the game should receive. Once the creation of the game is complete, using the pan-European game information system, the ratings are carried out by members of the games industry using a self-assessment form. After examining a game, the in-house coder uses an existing set of answers and the game is rated automatically on that basis. An age is established for each content category, based on the answers on the assessment form.</p>
	<p>The method may sound fair but in action, as I witnessed when I visited Activision, the game does not end up with the British Board of Film Classification until after it has been produced. Thus, using the Video Standards Council and PEGI guidelines, the publisher will resort to reviewing the game again if it has been rejected. I urge the British Board of Film Classification to take a much more cautious approach in reviewing those games, and also to provide publishers with much more stringent and unambiguous guidelines and detailed feedback about why a video game has failed to qualify for a particular rating. With advances in the technology to create those games, it is only sensible that the guidelines for publishers be updated.</p>
	<p>Ten years ago, the average game cost &pound;200,000 to develop, whereas now the average budget is more than &pound;1 million. The level of violence in the gaming habits of young people is disturbingly high, and 65 per cent. of the market is made up of boys aged between 13 and 16 years. On 1 November, the ITV programme &quot;Tonight with Trevor McDonald&quot; revealed from a nationwide survey of 223 children aged between 11 and 14 that computer games featuring drugs, sex and violence are being bought by boys as young as 12 in supermarkets and high street shops. More than two thirds of young people aged between 11 and 14 admitted that they had played games certified 18 plus. Boys aged 12 to 14 were seen in the programme buying adult games from Tesco, Virgin, Dixons, John Lewis, Sainsbury and Asda. The programme highlighted the problem that it is so easy for children to get hold of those games. Something needs to change.</p>
	<p>Any shopkeeper who supplies a game in breach of the law can be sent to jail for six months, fined &pound;5,000, or both. The law needs to be better enforced. To date, the retailers caught on the Trevor McDonald programme have not been prosecuted. According to the Video Standards Council, which also represents a large number of the UK retailers shown in the film, because the action was recorded for television people should not be liable to prosecution. I therefore urge Minister to ask the Attorney-General to review that absurdity and prosecute those retailers for their actions, so that, in future, retailers can fully appreciate the consequence of selling adult-rating video games to children. We need to make an example of one to make the rest take this seriously.</p>
	<p>Parents are becoming very concerned about the messages that their children are receiving while playing such games. Parents need to be made more aware that video games are much more difficult and more ingenious than ping-pong and that they contain such violent activity. An interesting approach was launched in Canada last year, ahead of the Christmas shopping period, entitled &quot;Commitment to Parents&quot;. A voluntary code was provided whereby parents entered into a dialogue with the retailers, thus enabling progress to be made to the benefit of parents and young children.</p>
	<p>Video and computer games will continue to be an exciting and growing part of children's media diets. As long as children have easy access to those games, policy debates will continue. There is much that is pernicious, banal and crude in popular culture. We must question what kind of society allows, if not encourages, youngsters to immerse themselves in such brutal fantasy games. Makers of the more violent games are pushing the outer limits of savagery and depravity, and current provisions have been widely criticised as ineffectual and confusing, so they need to be changed.</p>
	<p>I urge the Minister to do a number of things, and I seek her commitment on them. More research is needed into the long-term effects of playing such interactive games and their effect on children. Better regulation is needed, with much more clear and stringent guidelines, including transparent responsibility between the BBFC, the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association and PEGI. The current voluntary arrangements are too cosy. A more instructive and uniform labelling system is needed for parents to comprehend. Parents need to be educated, so that they become more aware of the content of games. The law must be better enforced. Retailers must be made aware of their responsibilities and prosecuted when they break the law.</p>
	<p>The tragic death of Stefan Pakeerah will be with his parents, family and friends for ever. I hope that this debate can shed light into the current ambiguities and prevent further callous attacks from happening again.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz) not only on securing this Adjournment debate but on the campaign that he has waged relentlessly on behalf of his constituents and, in doing so, on behalf of many parents and many citizens of this country. I acknowledge that the debate follows a meeting with the Prime Minister, questions asked in the House and, as he informed us today, a visit to the industry itself. I thank him for raising these difficult issues, which we ought to address.</p>
	<p>I also acknowledge the intervention made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton). The fact that he stayed for a short Adjournment debate shows his commitment, and I thank him for his interest. If he wishes, we will keep him informed of what we are able to do.</p>
	<p>I wish to put the issue into a wider context. We are all struck by the fact that this fast-growing, fast-moving industry uses technology that was not around when we were children and parents must become involved in something that is more unfamiliar to them than it is to their children. There is a danger that regulation enforcement follows the trend. As regulation catches up with a new invention, another new invention comes along. I make no criticism of anyone, but bureaucracy and government, both locally and nationally, can be slow and cumbersome in trying to ensure that it catches up.</p>
	<p>It is important to recognise that the games industry is a huge British success story. It earns money for us, and it earns us standing in the European and worldwide community. It is a good thing, and we are good at it. Most of the games, not those that have been mentioned this evening, add to the education, entertainment and cultural well-being of our nation&mdash;I would not want to suggest anything else&mdash;but, clearly, there is an issue with those that are violent or teach people how to commit crimes, and I would not want to pretend for a minute that such games do not exist.</p>
	<p>There might be an element of repetition, but I want to go over where we are, what has happened since my hon. Friend met the Prime Minister and where we might go in the future.</p>
	<p>The current position on classifying video games is important and it comes in two parts. First, under section 2 of the Video Recordings Act 1984, computer games are exempt from statutory classification unless they depict gross violence, human sexual activity or techniques likely to be useful in the commission of offences. As my hon. Friend said, about 30 games&mdash;about 2 per cent.&mdash;are referred each year to the British Board of Film Classification and they can be given an age rating that can be over 18.I do not have a feel for whether that figure is an indication that an insufficient number of games are being referred and that the relationship is too cosy. I do not have the evidence to go on, but I take the point that it could become too cosy. I want to give more thought to whether the statistic of 30, or 2 per cent. a year, is what one might expect to be referred to the BBFC given the nature of the industry.</p>
	<p>As my hon. Friend said, the United Kingdom has been involved in a pan-European system since 2003. It is a voluntary age-related classification system&mdash;the PEGI&mdash;that the Video Standards Council administers. As we know, these games cross national boundaries and we could find ourselves in the position in which an excellent UK classification and enforcement system went out of the window because games were being downloaded in the UK. As much cross-nation work as we can possibly do is important. That is why I welcome the Video Standards Council's administration of the PEGI system in the UK. As my hon. Friend, said it is an offence to sell video games to someone not of the age to buy them.</p>
	<p>Since my hon. Friend met the Prime Minister and representatives of our Department in early December, we have done what we can to improve the system. First, we held a meeting with all the representatives of the trade association, and that was a direct consequence of the meeting that my hon. Friend had. It involved the trade associations for the computer games and video games industries, the BBFC, video games retailers, the Video Standards Council and local government enforcement agencies.</p>
	<p>A number of things have emerged from that voluntary meeting. First, those at the meeting agreed that they would consider a new code of practice for retailers selling the games. That will be drawn up together with training and regulation of sales. That sounds good, and it is a voluntary code. That is where we are at the moment, and we need to see how it goes. It is important because the people selling the games will be personally liable for the consequences of any offence if they should be found guilty.</p>
	<p>I take the point made by the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham about parents understanding their responsibilities. Many parents who would not dream of letting their child see an X-rated film are less understanding of the need to monitor their child's behaviour and activity with video games. They did not play such games when they were children and they have to rush to catch up with what is happening. My hon. Friend will know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who shares Government responsibility with my Department for this issue, reminded parents of that before Christmas. Much more needs to be done, and the Government and the industry have to take responsibility to make sure that we inform more parents about what is happening.</p>
