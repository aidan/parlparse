	<p pid="a.416.4/1">It is clear that the matter goes much wider. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October</phrase>, my constituent, Mr. King of Bexhill, received a letter from HMRC, in which he was advised that a CD that had been sent to his pension provider, Standard Life, containing his surname, national insurance number, date of birth and plan reference number, had gone missing. He wants to know how many other CDs went missing before the CD that was sent to Standard Life, as well as the one that was sent out by HMRC with 25 million names on it. How many CDs went missing? How many of them have been accounted for? How many of them are still missing? And why, when CDs have gone missing in the past, did Ministers not act beforehand?</p>

As a result of that incident, HMRC wrote to all those affected, including the hon. Gentleman's constituent. The circumstances relating to the losses of that material, and in relation to the much larger loss of child benefit records, are currently the subject of investigation by Kieran Poynter, the senior partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. We will have his interim report in three weeks' time, and, as I said yesterday&mdash;I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was here for yesterday's debate&mdash;I intend to report to the House when I get that report.</p>

	<p pid="a.417.3/1">Again, I explained that when I gave my statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>. When I was told what had happened, I asked HMRC to carry out a thorough search, using its Customs investigations officers. When it was clear that that had not found anything, the Metropolitan police were called in and they carried out various searches. The position is that various buildings belonging to Revenue and Customs and the NAO were searched at various times as it became clear that the discs had gone missing. However, I covered all those points, both in my statement and in the debate yesterday. As I say, not only is the Metropolitan police investigation continuing, but we will have the results of Mr. Poynter's review fairly shortly. We can then discuss the matters further.</p>

	<p pid="a.422.2/1">I am more than happy to visit my hon. Friend's constituency to see the great work that is being done. The Government have funded a renaissance in apprenticeships. There are now 250,000, and there were only 87,000 when we came into power. We have further plans to create 500,000 by the end of the comprehensive spending review period. Those apprenticeships offer fantastic skills and opportunities, none of which were available during the era of mass unemployment when the Conservatives were last in power.</p>

	<p pid="a.428.4/1">I share my hon. Friend's concerns about aggressive credit selling. That is one of the reasons why we are supporting the growth of the credit union sector, which can provide affordable credit to those who need it. An independent review of the voluntary banking code has recently been completed, and the banks published the review's recommendations and their response last week, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-22">22 November</phrase>. That confirmed that the banks will strengthen and enhance the code in key areas, including the provision of more support for people in financial difficulty and the introduction of enhancements to responsible lending practices, involving the rigorous assessment of borrowers before loans are made, which I hope will help. In addition, the Government have made extensive changes to consumer credit legislation to strengthen consumer protection.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-29a.447.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1723" speakername="Peter Hain" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions"  colnum="447"  time="012:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071129/debtext/71129-0006.htm#07112971000712">
	<p pid="a.447.1/1">I wish to make a statement on the modernisation of Remploy. Since Remploy was founded in 1945, it has played a central role in the lives of thousands of disabled men and women by providing supported employment for those who need it and, increasingly, by placing others in mainstream employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/2">Both as a local MP and as a Minister, I have for the past 17 years worked closely with and supported Remploy and, as Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, Remploy workers will continue to have my full support. May I record the grateful thanks of the House for the diligence and commitment of my hon. Friend the Minister for Disabled People.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/3">Of course, the world has developed dramatically since the end of the second world war, not least in how the aspirations and expectations of disabled people have changed, and changed for the better. The vast majority want jobs in mainstream employment, and that is the Government's priority. That is why we extended the scope of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. That is why we have been transforming the support that we give to disabled people, moving away from a system that abandons people to the margins to one that helps them to realise their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/4">That is why we spent &pound;66 million last year on the Workstep programme to support 17,000 disabled people. That is why we spent &pound;62 million on access to work, to help 24,000 people. These programmes are already helping disabled people to take their place in an inclusive society. That is why we are introducing the employment and support allowance, which will replace incapacity benefit next autumn. That is why we are extending pathways to work across the country by April next year, offering tailored support to help people on incapacity benefit back into work. And that is why last year, Remploy's employment services division placed 5,000 disabled people in mainstream employment, for the first time outstripping the number employed by the factory network.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/5">We have helped more disabled people into jobs than ever before. For example, since 2001 the new deal for disabled people has helped over 150,000 into work. None the less, there remains a vital role for supported employment, providing a chance to work for thousands of disabled people who might not otherwise be immediately ready for mainstream work. That has been a central part of Remploy's work since it was founded, but increasingly, Remploy has struggled to fulfil this role effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/6">Low-wage, low-skill competition from countries like China and the EU accession states has put Remploy factories under enormous pressure. In turn, Remploy has failed to move adequately into higher-value, higher-skill work. Losses have spiralled, and Remploy's ability to support disabled people has been put at risk. Change is therefore essential for Remploy's 83 factories across the country, and the 5,000 people whom they employ.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/7">Following the National Audit Office's report in 2005 and the independent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Dr. Stephen Duckworth of Disability Matters last summer, Ministers asked Remploy to develop a new five-year restructuring plan. This was to modernise the business, avoid compulsory redundancy for Remploy's disabled workers, support substantially larger numbers of disabled people into mainstream work, and stay within a funding envelope of a &pound;555 million taxpayer subsidy over five years, to ensure that escalating costs do not put at risk funding for other Department for Work and Pensions programmes for disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/8">The reality is that without modernisation Remploy deficits would obliterate our other programmes to help disabled people into mainstream work. With no change, in five years' time Remploy would require &pound;171 million a year on current trends. That would be &pound;60 million over the &pound;111 million funding envelope, which represents nearly the entire current annual Workstep budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/9">In May 2007, Remploy made a proposal, for consultation with the trade unions, to close or merge 43 of the 83 Remploy factories. When I took over as Secretary of State a month later, however, it was clear that national and local management had not exhausted procurement opportunities to maintain the maximum number of Remploy sites. There was also a huge gulf between Remploy management and the trade unions, and the likelihood of destructive confrontation.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/10">In August I therefore asked Roger Poole, a former assistant general secretary of Unison, to act as the independent chairman of fresh negotiations, and I want to record my thanks for the way in which he managed to achieve real dialogue and progress. Although there was no agreement on factory closures, there was significant common ground for the first time. There was agreement on the &pound;555 million funding subsidy, on the quadrupling to 20,000 the number of disabled people Remploy would help into mainstream work, on significant cuts in management jobs and costs, on more efficient working practices, and on the vital importance of generating more public sector contracts&mdash;and, in consequence, the need for fewer factory closures.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/11">In September I reaffirmed Government policy on Remploy: that everyone should do their utmost to get a negotiated outcome; that there would be no factory closures without ministerial agreement; and that all public authorities should be encouraged to take advantage of European procurement rules allowing contracts to be reserved for supported businesses. I also reaffirmed, as I do again today, that there would be no compulsory redundancies for Remploy's disabled workers and that they would retain the protection of Remploy's terms and conditions, including&mdash;uniquely for workers facing plant closures or transfers&mdash;their salaries and final salary pensions. Both workers and management now need certainty to end the insecurity and worry for Remploy employees and their families and to allow Remploy management to begin the radical changes that we all recognise are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/12">The final proposals that I am announcing today represent the best package for Remploy's disabled employees in those difficult circumstances. Copies of the modernisation plan are available in the Vote Office, and a letter with agreed proposals to the trade unions has been deposited in the Library. There will be 15 fewer factory closures, with 55 factories remaining open and 11 merging&mdash;down from 32 closures to 17. The sales target for public procurement will increase to &pound;461 million over five years, up from &pound;298 million since the company's proposals in May. That is a huge and challenging 130 per cent. increase over the current rate of sales of &pound;200 million. There will be a total cost saving of &pound;59 million from around 25 per cent. fewer managers, changes in working practices and reductions in non-wage costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/13">Last week I had productive discussions with the leaders of the GMB, Unite and Community, joined by Remploy chairman Ian Russell, and I pay tribute to Ian Russell for his energy and commitment to get the best for Remploy workers. As a result, we have reached further agreements to protect Remploy's future and its workers. New skills in public procurement will be brought in to ensure that its marketing and sales effort is targeted appropriately. Appropriate employment advice will be available to all disabled employees whose factories are closing. Remploy will provide a travel-to-work package wherever necessary, where employees transfer as a result of mergers. Furthermore, Remploy has been contacted by third parties interested in keeping some form of production or training at six of the sites due for closure&mdash;Lydney, Glasgow Hillington, St. Helens, Treforest, Ystradgynlais and Brynamman. At four other sites&mdash;Mansfield, Pinxton, Plymouth and York&mdash;there is the possibility of staff transfers to nearby plants, most of which are local authority-supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/14">I know there will be disappointment that we are unable to keep even more factories open, but the reality is that it is simply not viable. For those sites, including those mentioned above, this is my message: if management, trade unions, MPs and others come up with a credible option involving a takeover or transfer, we will, of course, co-operate, and Remploy will help to facilitate. However, time is very short. The new funding envelope starts in four months' time&mdash;from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2008</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/15">We have managed to keep open 55 sites only on the basis of very stretching procurement targets and a tough forward plan. It will be up to everyone with an interest in Remploy&mdash;Government, management, trade unions, local MPs and other political representatives&mdash; to pull together to ensure that those factories meet their ambitious targets, otherwise they, too, could be put at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.1/16">The proposals that I have presented today are both realistic about the challenges facing Remploy and ambitious for the future. The plan makes some difficult choices, and many hon. Members wish that the circumstances were different, but we are where we are. What is now vital is that everyone concentrates their efforts on making the new Remploy a success. There will be a top-to-bottom restructuring and reskilling of Remploy. The plan will deliver a new beginning for Remploy requiring a radically new approach across the entire operation, which must include better management and better union relations. Last week, I agreed with union leaders that the modernisation and procurement plan will be properly monitored to ensure that it remains on course, so that Remploy can look to the future with a degree of confidence not enjoyed for some years&mdash;the people that it was set up to serve deserve no less. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-29a.453.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1723" speakername="Peter Hain" colnum="453"  time="012:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071129/debtext/71129-0007.htm#07112971000716">
	<p pid="a.453.0/1">Let me express my gratitude for the hon. Gentleman's support for the primary objective of putting more disabled workers into mainstream employment and of sustaining a viable, supported employment network.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/2">The hon. Gentleman asked about what other initiatives I am taking in respect of other Departments. Officials and trade union representatives are going to each Department to see what is possible. A range of Ministers has helped with that, and we are going to take it forward. He asked whether the 20,000 disabled people&mdash;that represents a quadrupling of the number that Remploy will help into mainstream work&mdash;will be at risk if the ambitious plan is not realised. The answer is no: that part of Remploy's funding is protected. We have already committed an average of more than &pound;111 million per year of the &pound;550 million to subsidise Remploy for the future. There will also be modernisation funding of more than &pound;100 million to help, particularly with the transition; substantial amounts of taxpayers' money is rightly going to help some of our most vulnerable disabled employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/3">Of course I will respond to local concerns. The hon. Gentleman will have noted that I mentioned both Brynamman and Ystradgynlais, proposals for which have been put to me. The hon. Members for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) and for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) have already made their own plans and we are happy to talk to them about the future. However, I do not want to give false optimism; my announcements today are based on a credible plan, but a very ambitious one. Of course, we will co-operate with anybody who wants to do so about alternative options.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/4">The hon. Gentleman asked about time scales. The proposals will kick in pretty well immediately from <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-01">1 December</phrase>. However, the new funding and arrangements have to come in by the end of March, when the &pound;555 million cost envelope over five years begins.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/5">Finally, let me point out what would happen if we did not take these steps. By the end of the five-year plan, we would be looking at funding Remploy with an additional &pound;60 million. That is equivalent to a substantial part of our specialist disability programmes&mdash;Workstep, access to work, work preparation and job introduction. To find that money, we would need to deprive almost 20,000 disabled people of support from those programmes. There are tough choices involved. However, I believe that this plan is the best available, and I will work with anybody to improve it.</p>

	<p pid="a.455.3/1">This will be a very sad day in Plymouth, which has one of the factories listed for closure, where 35 people currently work. I understand that 21 of those people are looking for alternative employment, and I hope that they will soon join the 93 who have been found employment locally since April this year in local Remploy services alone; there are a lot of other help services in Plymouth. It has already been agreed that four or five of them will go to Pluss&mdash;a sheltered workshop that has, by diversifying, done exactly what Remploy should have been doing all these years. May I invite my right hon. Friend, along with my hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for disabled people, to visit Pluss, to give assurances that there will be employment and places for all those 35 people, and to see how that award-winning factory operates so that he can draw on that experience when he works with Remploy to take these matters forward?</p>

	<p pid="a.459.7/1">May I first congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on his statement? It was an extremely difficult statement to make, as hon. Members and hundreds of Remploy employees today had the final confirmation that their factory is to close. I am in the fortunate position that the factory in my constituency, the Aberdeen Remploy, is to be saved. My right hon. Friend did not read out the list, but I hope that it still is.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.7/2">My right hon. Friend made a number of references to changes in management. That is crucial. One of the most serious criticisms of the way in which Remploy has been run concerns the quality of the management. Management needs not only to be cut, but to be improved, too. Extremely difficult targets have been set, and I for one do not want to be here in three or four years' time after we have gone through another similar process.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.7/3">Remploy management have been particularly deficient in centralised purchasing, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> mentioned. Since we launched the campaign to save our Remploy factor in Aberdeen, we have encountered a huge response from the local community and local businesses. &quot;Local, local, local&quot; is a strong marketing tool.</p>

	<p pid="a.464.2/1">Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. You will be aware that there was an exchange of views about topical questions at business questions. It is the case that the Leader of the House sought to give the House the impression that she was interpreting and implementing new <phrase class="standing-order" code="24A">Standing Order No. 24A</phrase>, which the House passed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-25">25 October</phrase>. During the debate on the modernisation of the House, the Leader of the House said in response to the shadow Leader of the House:</p>
	<p pid="a.464.2/2" class="indent">&quot;She asks for the subject of the topical debate to be announced by the Leader of the House following consultation with business managers. As I have stated, that is indeed what we envisage happening, and that would include consultations through the usual channels.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.464.2/3">In winding up the debate, the Deputy Leader of the House reaffirmed:</p>
	<p pid="a.464.2/4" class="indent">&quot;We are completely open to Back Benchers nominating subjects, and my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House pointed out that they could do so at business questions.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-25">25 October 2007</phrase>; Vol. 465, c. 448-98.]</p>
	<p pid="a.464.2/5">It has become apparent in the past few days that consultation did not take place about today's debate. Indeed, the Leader of the House confirmed yesterday to the Modernisation Committee that no requests were submitted to her for today's debate, while the usual channels submitted two questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.464.2/6">My point is simply that the Standing Order contains no indication that the Leader of the House is responsible for the choice of subject rather than its announcement. In fact, the Standing Order does not even state that she is responsible for announcing the subject. Would you be kind enough to ask Mr. Speaker, as the guardian of Standing Orders, to invite the Leader of the House to visit him to discuss the proper manner in which <phrase class="standing-order" code="24A">Standing Order No. 24A</phrase>, which was passed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-25">25 October</phrase>, should be implemented?</p>

	<p pid="a.468.6/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. Of course I congratulate the young people in her constituency for all that they have achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.6/2">I start with a quotation from Sir Terry Leahy, the chief executive of Tesco:</p>
	<p pid="a.468.6/3" class="indent">&quot;I am a huge fan of apprenticeships because I have seen what they can do for individuals and also what they have done for my business.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.468.6/4">Many top business leaders in this country share that conviction. It has been my great privilege over the past few months to travel the country visiting employers and apprenticeships, from meeting sheet metal workers in Huddersfield and seeing the recent launch of the media apprenticeships with the BBC in Manchester to seeing apprenticeships last week in Birmingham and talking to electricians in that area this week. Apprenticeships are vital and employers say that they are important to their productivity.</p>

	<p pid="a.478.6/1">I am coming on to that very point, and I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for reminding me that I need to do so swiftly.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.6/2">As has been implied, the problems I refer to have been exacerbated by the programme-led apprenticeships that were introduced in 2003, which enable apprentices to begin their training at a college or training provider even though they have yet to secure a work placement. A survey by the adult learning inspectorate found that colleges were to told to rebrand learners as apprentices simply because they were working towards qualifications which were also part of the apprenticeship framework. Overnight, the number of apprentices increased by more than 30,000, yet only 3,000 of them actually progressed to a full apprenticeship with a work placement. That was sleight of hand, and it diverted attention from a fact that has been raised: fewer people are currently studying for traditional work-based apprenticeships at level 3 than when Labour came to power.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.6/3">The Government's own figures&mdash;<i> [Interruption.] </i>It appears that the Under-Secretary is looking aside for guidance from his officials. I suspect, however, that he knows very well that the Office for National Statistics figures&mdash;I am happy to give them to him before the wind-up, if he wishes&mdash;show that the number of level 3 apprenticeships has fallen by 34,000 since the turn of the decade. A graph in a House of Lords report&mdash;<i> [Interruption]</i>&mdash;which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> has to hand, confirms that data, and it is neither fair nor reasonable to pretend that the growth in level 2 numbers compensates for that fundamental weakness at level 3. Lord Leitch identified it in his comprehensive report, the House of Lords report identified it, and the Government's own answers to written questions confirm it.</p>

That proposal gets to the nub of the challenge facing the Government and all parties. Such a scheme would match young people with apprenticeships in every area, which is a huge challenge given the realm of sectors involved. The Association of Colleges has cited some sectors, such as electrical installation and telecoms, where if that matching process is to be a reality a huge amount of work will have to be undertaken to engage employers. We heard earlier, and during questions last week, about the challenges facing the building sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.4/3">Demand for apprenticeships outstrips supply by a factor of 10, so if the UCAS-style model is to be valid for young people, there must be some equity. I look forward to hearing from the Minister how we can sell these ideas. In a Westminster Hall debate, I referred to the need to sell the idea of apprenticeships to employers and schools. It is a huge agenda. Who will be responsible for it? Will it be the Learning and Skills Council or local government? It is essential that we get the message across.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.4/4">I offer the House an example of a pioneering scheme from my constituency. Llwyn yr Eos school in Penparcau near Aberystwyth has established a young artisans club&mdash;children aged between seven and nine are involved in simple carpentry and joinery work. If we can do something like that for youngsters of that age, we have to achieve it further along the education system.</p>
	<p pid="a.483.4/5">I am positive, but I am sceptical about targets. We need to see the substance that will result from the review in January and the Bill. The Liberal Democrats look forward with some enthusiasm to taking part in that debate&mdash;not uncritically, but recognising that it is fundamental if the targets identified by Leitch are to be realised.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.2/1">I am with my hon. Friend absolutely on that. That was why I thought that yesterday's threat by the Prime Minister of imposing minimum wage legislation on apprentices' employers was a damaging development. The dictionary definition of &quot;apprentice&quot; that I cited makes clear that an implicit aspect of being an apprentice is taking a lower wage to reflect a lack of experience and skills. There is a partnership between an employer and an apprentice under which the apprentice agrees to learn and work on the job, and the employer gives his time freely. Obviously, however, the employer cannot afford to give the apprentice the full wage that he would pay to someone who was fully qualified.</p>

	<p pid="a.493.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.493.2/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House takes note of European Union Document 10516/07, Commission Green Paper on the future Common European Asylum System; notes the continued importance of working collectively on asylum issues with other Member States; further notes the importance of the Dublin II Regulation, the current responsibility mechanism to deal with asylum seekers; and supports the Government's position that proper implementation and a full evaluation of first phase instruments should take place before embarking on a second phase of legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.2/3">It gives me great pleasure to speak today about the important issue of asylum and how we work with our European partners to make sure that we have a common approach while protecting the UK's interests and sovereignty on that matter. We are here specifically to debate the green gaper published in June this year by the European Commission on the future of the common European asylum system. The green paper invited member states and relevant stakeholders to express their views on the future of European Union asylum work.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.2/4">The 1997 treaty of Amsterdam and the 1999 Tampere European Council committed member states to establishing minimum standards for asylum procedures and policies across the European Union. A series of asylum directives were subsequently agreed and the procedures directive, the last of those, will be implemented in the UK on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-01">1 December</phrase> this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.2/5">The implementation of the minimum standards directives has provided the basis for a common approach across Europe. That has helped to tackle asylum shopping, while also allowing member states to reflect their own distinct domestic circumstances.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-29a.502.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" speakername="Michael Connarty" colnum="502"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071129/debtext/71129-0015.htm#07112983001054">
	<p pid="a.502.0/1">I have heard so much about general immigration policy from the Opposition Front Bench that I wondered whether the Conservatives had read the Green Paper or the Government's response before they tabled their amendment. They seem to have tried to push enough in to make the amendment credible. In reality, however, they seem to be agreeing entirely with the Government's submission on the Green Paper. But perhaps they did not read it.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/2">The point of the European Scrutiny Committee sending this document to the House is partly to illustrate the service that we believe we provide to the House in summarising important and complex documents, recording the Government's view of them&mdash;all of which are available for people to read&mdash;and allowing the House to debate the issue. We need to debate the issue, but not to pile into the debate anything that the Conservatives might want to use to pad out their speeches. We have had much padding from the Opposition today. This debate is about asylum and about the Green Paper from the Commission on asylum. That is quite specific; it is not about immigration, border controls or anything else. It is about how we deal with people who eventually reach an EU country and apply for asylum.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/3">The 1999 Tampere European Council agreement established the aim of working towards a common European asylum system. That is clearly something that the Opposition may wish to resist, and that would be a valid point for them to make in this debate, rather than all the other things about general immigration that they threw into the mix. The first phase involved putting in minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers and procedure for considering their applications. It was decided at Tampere that, in the longer term, there should be a common asylum procedure with uniform status throughout the EU for people being granted asylum.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/4">The Council of Ministers has put forward and adopted four directives and three regulations since 1999. At the end of 2004, the European Council invited the Commission to value the existing legislation and proposed legislation to implement the second phase by 2010. There might be serious points of contention about that. The Green Paper deals with this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/5">The Green Paper was issued in June 2007, and it asks that we should introduce common standards. It also talkes about mandatory rules. This would mean that asylum seekers would be treated equally and that standards of protection would be fairer and higher. The Government, and the Opposition, would say that, in principle, those are good aims. None of us would wish anyone who had genuinely fled from a threatening situation and come to this country or any other part of the EU as an asylum seeker to be treated any less well than anyone else, although there are suspicions that some of them are not treated well enough at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/6">Many people are allowed to stay in this country after suffering incarceration. Sadly, more than 60 children are incarcerated with their families in Harmondsworth at the moment. Thank goodness that, in Scotland, we have driven out that terrible blight on our society by not having asylum seekers' children in Dungavel. I was happy to be part of the leading group that convinced the Government that it was not a good idea to make that rule binding in Scotland because it would have breached the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. In fact, believe it or not, this country actually takes a derogation from the UN convention on the rights of the child so that we can lock up the children of asylum seekers. That is an appalling situation under any Government, but it is an even more terrible shame, sadly, under a Government whom I support.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/7">The Green Paper invited some views on more equitable sharing among member states of administrative and financial burdens and on assessing asylum applications. It went as far as putting forward the idea of actually sharing the physical burden by redistributing people across Europe if too many people landed in one country. In the example given, Spain was overloaded with west African asylum seekers. It is possible that in the Commission's vision of the long-term future, those asylum seekers would need to be redistributed throughout Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/8">More effective EU support for developing countries is another theme. People flee countries that are near points of conflict and then go beyond them to the next country of safety, ending up in Europe. In fact, it would be possible to provide support for countries that are located alongside violent areas or areas where there are threats of violence. It might be possible for people to be supported to stay there rather than be driven forward and end up being trafficked. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1379" name="Damian Green">the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green)</phrase> accepted, people sometimes pay their life savings to get dumped on an inflatable dinghy in the middle of the ocean.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/9">We also want more practical data co-operation between members and views were sought on improving the EC's capacity collectively to participate in international agreements. There is some criticism in other parts of the world that we are not doing as well as we could in that respect and we are encouraged to respond to it. That was the Green Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/10">We are happy that we are having this debate now because the Commission had a public hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October</phrase>. It will now move forward to presenting a policy plan, which is what the Government responded to and what our debate is all about. Quite frankly, at this moment, I am not sure that much has been said on the Floor of the House that will help to develop that policy plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.505.1/1">The conflation of the Schengen agreement which emerged from Amsterdam and the asylum decisions at Tampere is completely false. The Schengen agreement involved conditions that we are steadily opting into, and&mdash;particularly in relation to information transfer&mdash;we are the keenest on its implementation. SIS I, the first Schengen information system, has not been implemented as we wished it to be, but SIS II is now being introduced. I believe that the way in which we are inserting ourselves into the Schengen process is justifiable, given the great benefits that we will gain.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.1/2">The Tampere proposals on asylum are different. They do everything that was done by the Dublin agreement, which allows people to be returned to the country where they first applied for asylum. That provision was a major breakthrough, and we use it again and again. We have made progress in securing right-of-return agreements with other countries from which people have come and applied falsely for asylum, which is fundamentally important.</p>
	<p pid="a.505.1/3">There is no open door in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the United Kingdom. My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase>, who has intervened several times today, has many constituents who feel abused by the strictness of our asylum-seeking process. But I know of many cases in Scotland of people who, having been incarcerated and threatened with expulsion, were eventually granted the right to stay when a reasoned view was taken about the conditions that they had left and the danger posed to them should they return. Is that not what we are about, as a civilised nation? Is that not what we have been about for many years?</p>
	<p pid="a.505.1/4">I am reading a book the first word of whose title I cannot use because it is unparliamentary, but the second word is &quot;foreigners&quot; and the second begins with B. it is an excellent study of emigration, and of people seeking asylum who add to our community. For hundreds of years waves of people have arrived here: the first wave of Jewish people driven here before the pogrom, the Huguenots driven out of France and the Irish driven out of Ireland by poverty and starvation, followed by the second wave of people from the Jewish nations, driven out of Russia and elsewhere before the war. All those people have fertilised and grown on our island in a very, very positive way, but each time they arrived there was xenophobia. The same phrases were used about the Italians, the Irish and the Jewish people when they came here, and they were used about the Huguenots when they came. We keep doing it, and I am sorry to say that the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman and some of his supporters are doing it again now.</p>

	<p pid="a.509.0/1">As we have already heard, the common European asylum system seeks, most notably, to prevent asylum shopping across Europe. For example, under an effective common asylum system, people seeking asylum in Germany would not be able to present themselves for a second time in another EU country such as the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/2">The structure created by the common asylum system demonstrates that the EU can be a serious force for good in reducing the number of asylum claims to the UK. That must cause significant mental discomfort to those Members for whom the words &quot;Europe&quot; and &quot;asylum&quot; are triggers to start snarling and frothing at the mouth. It must be hard for them to discover that one is the best mechanism to deal with the other. In any case, it is not my job to provide psychological support to the Conservative party.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/3">The Green Paper introduces stage 2 of the common European asylum system. To an extent, the Liberal Democrats agree that it is too soon to move ahead with stage 2 before we have judged the success of stage 1. We cannot yet judge whether what was agreed is what has been implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/4">I would be interested to hear from the Minister the extent to which she thinks that Dublin II&mdash;a regulation that enables the sharing of information to prevent asylum shopping around the EU&mdash;is working in practice. There are doubts that it is working well, and those add further weight to the argument that we should concentrate on getting stage 1 right before proceeding to stage 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/5">Nevertheless, the Green Paper deserves proper scrutiny, as it raises issues that are relevant to the Hague programme as it moves forward. Although the Government are right to say that we should not rush to judgment, they should not use that as an excuse to ignore the Green Paper and the serious issues that it raises. For example, it gives us the opportunity to consider again whether we should allow asylum seekers to work. The Liberal Democrats take the view that asylum seekers should be permitted to work if their claim has not been decided within two months. It is not only inhuman to prevent asylum seekers from working, but is a drain on the benefits system and causes serious social problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.509.0/6">I do not mean to stereotype, but asylum seekers are often among the most enterprising and talented people. Of the asylum claims I have dealt with&mdash;my constituency is in the lake district, so I have not dealt with as many as some hon. Members&mdash;most have come from professional people, including doctors, nurses, teachers, and other people who have the skills for which we are crying out, and the desire and the work ethic to go out and earn a living rather than sit and wait for a decision, living on benefits. Many of the more right-wing newspapers to which the Government are often keen to pander are apoplectic at the thought of asylum seekers claiming benefit, so why not silence them by allowing asylum seekers to earn a living?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-29a.529.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" speakername="Dominic Grieve" colnum="529"  time="017:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071129/debtext/71129-0019.htm#07112983001522">
	<p pid="a.529.3/1">The hon. Lady has made her point, and I am not going to get involved in an exercise in semantics as that would not be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.3/2">I think there might be agreement that, as the hon. and learned Lady said, the rise in rape is not a result of stranger rape, or people being dragged into the bushes or knocked over the head in a darkened lane at night, but in large measure results from the fact that people are properly coming forward and complaining about rape in the context of a relationship where they know their assailant. As the hon. and learned Lady acknowledged in her speech, that presents a real challenge, and we in this House must address it. First, we must ask how we can ensure that women who have been raped come forward and make allegations when we know&mdash;this is a telling fact&mdash;that many such women are in some uncertainty as to whether the allegation they wish to make constitutes rape. In many cases it almost certainly does&mdash;that point was picked up in Government statistics. We must also address how to ensure that that happens while also ensuring that there is fairness for the accused, and how to get such cases through the courts so as to ensure the conviction of those who are guilty.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.3/3">That is a very real challenge because all the evidence suggests that there are two major reasons why conviction rates are so low. First, a substantial number of the cases complained of never reach court at all. It is worth running through the statistics on why that is the case: one sixth of the complaints initially made are not investigated because the police conclude&mdash;one hopes they are right in this&mdash;that they are false; a quarter are dropped because of insufficient evidence; and one third are withdrawn, often because the victim will not co-operate further, which presents another challenge that should cause us a great deal of anxiety. We also know that once such cases get into court, the nature of the allegations presents juries with enormous difficulties. They must decide whether a very serious offence has been committed, and if the person accused is of previous good character and the consequence of conviction is a long period of imprisonment&mdash;as it should be&mdash;if there is any doubt, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of it. We have seen over and over again that such cases present real problems. It is worth noting that the conviction rate in such trials is now 44 per cent., and although that is too low, as the hon. and learned Lady has said, it is substantially higher than the initial statistics would suggest.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.3/4">I must also say that it is not my professional experience that jurors treat rape allegations lightly. Rape is viewed in our society as a very serious matter, although I agree with the hon. and learned Lady that there might be issues about young people's attitudes as to whether certain sorts of behaviour may render a subsequent complaint by a victim in some way wrong&mdash;I think we are in agreement that we would not wish to countenance that.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.3/5">What should we do? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">My right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> has made the point, which has been picked up, that greater support for rape victims is needed. It is worth pointing out that there were 68 rape crisis support centres in 1984 and there are only 45 today. There are funding issues in respect of whether the centres can survive in the long term when they tend to have a hand-to-mouth existence. I very much hope that the Government will be able to address that. As the hon. and learned Lady will be aware, we have said that the three-year funding cycles are unsatisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.3/6">I think that there is also complete common ground between the hon. and learned Lady and me on wider educational issues. It is vital that there is an understanding within the sex education context of people's rights in intimate relationships. That should be inculcated and fully understood at a young age, because in the long term that might do more to reduce the incidence of rape than almost anything else. I hope that the Government will have the opportunity to look&mdash;we will support them in doing so&mdash;at ways in which to take that forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.3/7">We also need to consider whether we are getting the right sentences, although I acknowledge that the Solicitor-General says that some of the statistics show a continuing rise in sentences in rape cases. That is also a difficult area, but if the Government make any suggestions, we will consider them creatively.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.3/8">I turn to the issues raised in the report. I note that the first recommendation is that the Government take the view that there is no need at present to interfere further with the law on capacity, and they are right. We carried out a major change in the 2003 legislation and, while I share the Solicitor-General's disquiet about the problems with several cases in which the judiciary and, sometimes, prosecuting counsel did not seem to understand the new rules, any form of legislative change takes time to be transmitted down the chain. I am pleased to hear about special training for those prosecuting such cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.3/9">I am sure that the Solicitor-General will agree that the case of R <i> v</i>. Bree has laid down clear parameters on the issue of capacity. I hope that those are properly understand and that, as a result, we will have no further instances of trials being abandoned even though the issue of capacity could be resolved in the jury's mind. I endorse the judiciary's assertion in R <i> v</i>. Bree that it was certainly not Parliament's intention to say that a person lacked capacity only when they became unconscious, and I am pleased that that has been made clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.529.3/10">I find the second issue, that of expert witnesses, more difficult, and I shall explain why. I was struck by the Solicitor-General's comments, because her language about a desire to see expert evidence admitted or special training for juries was much stronger in tone than the contents of the Government's response in the report. I do not know whether that indicates some difference of view between the Solicitor-General and others in the Law Officers' Department or the Home Office about how to approach the issue, or whether it is her personal view. In any case, one does not match the other, and I detected considerable hesitation in the report, insofar as it made it clear that there were potential problems with getting expert evidence admitted, which the Government fully recognised. I share those concerns.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-11-29a.547.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" speakername="Ann Keen" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="547"  time="018:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071129/debtext/71129-0022.htm#07112983001546">
	<p pid="a.547.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> on her success in the Speaker's ballot and on choosing allergy services as her subject. It is clearly close to her heart and it is an important topic to debate. I thank her for bringing to our attention an issue that affects so many people in our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.0/2">I pay tribute to the hon. Lady's gallant fundraising efforts, especially for the Anaphylaxis Campaign, which plays an important role in supporting people who are affected by anaphylaxis. I am a former nurse and have been on the receiving end of patients admitted in anaphylactic shock, so I recognise the obvious fear and anxiety felt in that situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.0/3">As the hon. Lady is acutely aware, I take very seriously allergic reactions to pollen, pets, foods and a range of other agents that she mentioned, and in particular reactions to latex among NHS staff. The number of people suffering from allergic reactions has trebled in the past 20 years and a third of the population are estimated to suffer from an allergy at some point in their lives. The severity of the reaction ranges from mild to severe and potentially life threatening, and the treatment options reflect that huge range.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.0/4">Many people choose to self-diagnose and treat. Others may require treatment from their GP surgery or in specialist clinics. Many experience serious consequences because of their allergy. Each year there are more than 3,000 hospital admissions for anaphylaxis alone. Allergic conditions represent a huge challenge, not just for our health care system, but for society as a whole. In addition to the obvious health effects, allergic reactions can make the most simple and everyday activities difficult&mdash;including even eating in this House, as the hon. Lady said&mdash;and can pose a major risk to an individual's health and well-being.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.0/5">The timing of this debate is opportune, as the hon. Lady acknowledged. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-27">27 November</phrase>, the Government published their response to the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee report on allergy. We welcomed the Committee's report, which highlighted the fact that the issue needs to be addressed by a range of stakeholders, including the Government. We recognise the importance of allergies and are committed to helping to alleviate the burden of allergic disorders. The Command Paper that we published on Tuesday highlights some of the strategies that are being developed and implemented to address the challenge illustrated in the Committee's report. I shall touch on those later.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.0/6">The Lords Committee inquiry into allergy is of course not the first time that allergy issues have been scrutinised by a parliamentary Committee. In 2004, the Health Committee published a report of its inquiry into the provision of allergy services. That report reflected earlier findings published by the Royal College of Physicians in 2003, namely that serious problems existed in the provision of allergy services.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.0/7">In response to the Health Committee's report, we carried out a review of the available data and research on the epidemiology of allergic conditions, the demand for and provision of treatments, and the effectiveness of interventions. Working closely with stakeholders&mdash;people with allergies and their families, patient groups, clinicians and representatives from the independent sector and industry&mdash;we sought to identify actions that could be taken at local and national levels to improve services for allergy.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.0/8">The review was crucial as a first step towards building a programme of improvements that would be based on sound evidence and reflect the views of stakeholders. The review report, which we published in July 2006, highlighted the range of existing service provision for allergy. That provision includes more than 90 allergy clinics in England led by a range of specialists, including allergists, respiratory physicians and dermatologists, as well as services provided by general practitioners, the mainstay of allergy care. I note the hon. Lady's point about GP training, which I hope we will take note of in Ara Darzi's report on chronic conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.0/9">The Department of Health's review identified good practice across the wide range of services available for people with allergies, and the spectrum of skills and competences of clinicians involved in their care. To take just one example, clinical immunologists at the Royal Victoria infirmary in Newcastle oversee a nurse-led allergy clinic, in which a nurse will see a complete referral and go through the whole treatment process without having to consult a doctor.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.0/10">In their reports, both the Health Committee and the Royal College of Physicians made the case for a model of care that would be driven and funded from the centre. In taking forward our improvement and reform agenda, we have moved away from a top-down management approach, as we develop a devolved and self-improving health service, where the main drivers of change are patients, commissioners and clinicians. Indeed, the Department's review concluded that one of the key levers for change for allergy services in the future will essentially continue to be for local rather than national level action.</p>
