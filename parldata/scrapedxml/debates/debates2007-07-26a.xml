	<p pid="a.1040.6/1">I, too, welcome the appointment of the Secretary of State and his ministerial team to the new Department and to its first Question Time. Can the Minister say what the Government are doing to ensure that the expertise in British universities, such as the excellent Durham university in my constituency, is applied by industries so that jobs can be created on Durham and elsewhere? Does he accept that the proposed energy technologies institute provides a good model for that, and that the institute should come to the north-east?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1052.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="1052"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0004.htm#07072638000835">
	<p pid="a.1052.1/1">I am grateful for your advice, Mr. Speaker. I was about to ask about a future item of business related to a more general issue. As that was not a matter of putting the interests of the House first, will the right hon. and learned Lady provide the House with a more accurate statement of her interpretation of her role as Leader of the House, and, given that she is also the chairman of the Labour party, will she touch on the duality of her role?</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/2">On Monday, the Minister for Housing made a statement on her plans for more housing, but its contents were in the morning's press and a BBC correspondent even had a copy the previous weekend. On Tuesday, the Secretary of State for Transport made a statement on the railways, but its contents were debated that very morning on the &quot;Today&quot; programme. Yesterday, the Prime Minister made his statement on the detention of terror suspects, but he had already given the story to <i> The Sun. </i>Will the right hon. and learned Lady take time from her other duties to ensure that all of her ministerial colleagues, including the Prime Minister, live up to his promise to announce policy to the House first?</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/3">Also on Monday, the Prime Minister insinuated to the media&mdash;not to hon. Members&mdash;that he would consider reversing the liberalisation of licensing laws. His spin doctors later confirmed that there would be a review of policy. That comes after a half-announcement to review the classification of cannabis and a half-announcement to reverse the super-casinos policy. This is no way to announce policy, so will the Leader of the House tell the Prime Minister that if he wants to restore Parliament's powers, he should treat hon. Members with respect?</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/4">On that same subject, the Prime Minister yesterday sneaked out 39 written statements and answers to five named day questions from Labour MPs. Those included statements on a &pound;3.5 billion shortfall in CSA payments, plans for the abolition of 25 councils and the failure of the Youth Justice Board. Today, a further 30 written statements are planned, including one on a breach of data security for visa applications, one on the Government's climate change target and one on the cost of ministerial cars. So much for the post-spin era. Will the right hon. and learned Lady make a statement on that abuse of written ministerial statements?</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/5">Finally, the European Council conclusions state:</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/6" class="indent">&quot;National parliaments shall contribute actively to the good functioning of the Union&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/7">The Labour Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/8" class="indent">&quot;This is a takeover of the rights of this Parliament&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/9">Parliament's representative on the former Convention says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The case for a referendum is even stronger now&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/11">The right hon. and learned Lady says that she understands her duty to Parliament, so after the recess, will she make a statement on the consequences of the treaty for this sovereign Parliament?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1056.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1472" speakername="Harriet Harman" colnum="1056"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0004.htm#07072638000842">
	<p pid="a.1056.0/1">On the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, the hon. Gentleman will be aware that Sir Ronald Flanagan will be giving his interim report in the summer. That Bill will then be considered in the usual way. If any amendments are to be brought forward by the Government or by hon. Members, the question will be whether they are within the remit of the long title, but I have heard the points that the hon. Gentleman has made and no doubt they will be reflected on by the Home Secretary as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/2">The hon. Gentleman asked whether there could be a debate on flooding when the House returns. I can assure all hon. Members that the Secretaries of State for Communities and Local Government and for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will keep the House updated, possibly by way of written or oral statements, but they have come forward with as much information as they possibly can. If there is a need for a debate over and above the statement, no doubt my right hon. Friends will seek such a debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/3">There will be a debate on <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 9 October</phrase> on defence procurement, and that that would be an opportunity for the hon. Gentleman to raise the important issue of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport made a full statement on the railways on Tuesday and I am sure that, like all hon. Members, the hon. Gentleman was pleased to hear that more freight is now going by rail, passenger numbers are up and regulation of fares continues. We all want to see the contribution that the railways can make to tackling climate change stepped up. That is the view across Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/4">Hon. Members will know of the suggestion to update the antiquated process that means that petitions have to be in a particular form of words, otherwise they cannot be submitted, and simply get put in the bag behind Mr. Speaker's chair. I thank the Procedure Committee for the important work that it has done on the question of petitioning Parliament. It made many useful suggestions and the Government's response has been published and will be available from the Vote Office by the end of today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/5">The hon. Gentleman asked whether early-day motions that have attracted great concern could be the subject of a debate once a certain number of Members had signed them. However, it is always open to hon. Members to apply to debate issues on the Adjournment or to seek a Westminster Hall debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/6">As the hon. Gentleman knows, the question of the House sitting in September has been the subject of experiment, and the House has voted on the issue. I understand that the hon. Gentleman and&mdash;I hope&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> received an advance copy of the document on petitions. It was certainly my intention that they should have an advance copy, but I hope that all hon. Members will be able to obtain a copy from the Vote Office shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1063.5/2" class="indent">That this House fully supports the IraqChild appeal launched by the UK-based Iraqi Association to raise &pound;250,000 for emergency protection for children through the Andalus Medical Clinic in Baghdad; notes that children in Baghdad will suffer disproportionately this summer through sweltering heat, electricity shortages and lack of air conditioning in addition to the violence and sectarian strife which has led to the displacement of thousands of children and many orphans having to fend for themselves; further notes that terrorists are using children as decoys for sadistic killings, that one in eight Iraqi children died of disease or violence before reaching their fifth birthday in 2005, and that there are worryingly high levels of malnourishment; believes that this non-sectarian project, which was developed through a lengthy consultation process with concerned medical personnel in Baghdad and local non-governmental organizations, is credible; points out that, for example, &pound;22 can buy a child's clothing pack, &pound;48 can treat a child for diarrhoea and ear infection, &pound;60 can pay for a qualified nurse to care for 10 children every week, &pound;650 can pay for a medical doctor for a month to visit 10 families with children every week, and &pound;1,580 can maintain running a children's clinic for a month for eight children everyday; and urges widespread moral and material assistance for this vital humanitarian initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.5/3">It refers to the appeal for the children of Baghdad, wherein the Iraqi Association in this country is launching an appeal for &pound;250,000 to raise money to develop a clinic in Baghdad to help with the one in eight children who will die this summer. I would ask that this be debated at the next sitting of the House, but there will not be a sitting over the summer and thousands of children will die. Can the Minister ensure that this motion gets to the relevant Departments, to see whether they can help to pay?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1077.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" speakername="Stephen Williams" colnum="1077"  time="012:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0007.htm#07072638000919">
	<p pid="a.1077.5/1">I thank the Minister for advance sight of the statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.5/2">I welcome the tone of the statement and some of the intentions that lie behind it. As has been said, it has appeared on the same day as the Institute for Public Policy Research report. The <i> Daily Mail </i>coverage is a caricature of the actual report&mdash;a Hogarth image of debauched behaviour by young people, which I do not accept and recognise as an accurate picture of young people in society today. I know that many young people participate in volunteering, raise money for charity and achieve in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.5/3">I hope that the statement is the welcome start of a departure from some of the language of the Tony Blair era, namely the language of marching children to cash points, the language of dealing with feral youth and the language of imposing dispersal orders on young people, such as the fatuous dispersal order imposed on skateboarders in my constituency this week. I hope that it is a fresh approach that will empower young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.5/4">On money, the Minister's Department, unlike all other Whitehall Departments, has its comprehensive spending review settlement for 2008 to 2011. Will the Minister say how much of the various sums identified in the statement is genuinely new money, rather than recycled existing money? Specifically, how much of it is Government money as opposed to the money of local authorities, youth offending teams and primary care trusts? How much is expected to be raised on the rather flimsy financial basis of recovering unclaimed assets lying in bank accounts? If investment in youth is really important&mdash;I think that it is&mdash;is that the correct source of money for that important investment?</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.5/5">The statement mentions that one of the aims is &quot;empowerment&quot;, which I welcome. However, the only example that I could find in my brief perusal of the statement was for young people to have &quot;influence&quot; over 25 per cent. of local authority budgets by 2018, which is not exactly immediate empowerment. I expected the statement to say much more about how we can engage young people in citizenship and how we can ensure that every school and local authority encourages young people to participate in elections to the Youth Parliament. The Select Committee Chairman has left, but the recent Select Committee report, to which I was a signatory, recommends that every school should have a school council. If that were implemented, it would teach young people through practical action the skills of working together. I also hope that at some point we will have another debate about reducing the voting age to 16.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.5/6">Will the Minister work with the Minister for Schools and Learners in making sure that every school in the country teaches all aspects of the personal, social and health education curriculum and the social and emotional aspects of learning curriculum without opt-out? Many of the problems that have been caricatured in the <i> Daily Mail </i>and that have been the subject of the crossfire between Government and Conservative Front Benchers could be dealt with positively in schools, if that curriculum were taught without exception.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.5/7">Investment in youth workers is important. Many hon. Members know that before I became a Member of Parliament my professional career for 17 years was as a tax consultant, but the first job that I was trained to do was as a children's play leader for the YMCA and for the local authority. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> It was good training for this atmosphere. I know that by working with young people, one can teach them how to trust and about teamwork. Importantly, one can teach them about risk, too, through games, which is something that has been missing in the past 10 years. Not only are those qualities good for children, but they will stand them in good stead in later life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.5/8">The statement specifically mentions &pound;25 million for the work force to attract graduates into youth work, which is worth while, but I wonder whether we can do more to encourage community leaders and senior citizens into youth work. People who have lost their jobs in other industries could also be retrained. That point particularly applies to men, because many young, disaffected men need male role models&mdash;they may not get it at home, but they could get it through the youth service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.5/9">Can we have a statement about detached workers? Much of the language of the statement is about places to go and investment in youth centres, but it is people who will make the difference. Rather than imposing dispersal orders on skateboarders in Bristol, it would have been much better to have sent a detached youth worker to talk to the young people, to engage with them and to tackle what is perceived as their antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.5/10">Finally, the statement mentions &quot;social and emotional skills&quot;. I think that values are important, too. Youth work has a great role to play in teaching young people tolerance and respect for other people in our diverse society. In particular, I would welcome an initiative to make anti-bullying work part of the youth service. I welcome much of the content of the statement, but the approach will succeed only if we engage with young people, rather than demonising them, and if we involve them in the construction of policies, rather than imposing policies on them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1090.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1876" speakername="Angela Browning" colnum="1090"  time="013:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0009.htm#07072638000953">
	<p pid="a.1090.0/1">I should like to draw attention to yesterday's written ministerial statement, from column 68WS of the <i> Official Report </i>onwards, on the Government's determination on the bids that they have received for councils to receive unitary status. I deplore the fact that the Government have made a written statement and that the Ministers concerned did not come to the Floor of the House with it. Contained in the statement is the fact that the Government are minded to implement the bid on behalf of Exeter city council to become a unitary authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/2">I and other hon. Members, on a cross-party basis, met Ministers during the consultation period&mdash;in fact, we had a constructive meeting with the Minister concerned. I want to draw attention to the five criteria that the Government have set themselves in deciding what would and would not qualify for unitary status, which are listed at column 69WS. The first criterion states that the bid</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/3" class="indent">&quot;must be...supported by a broad cross section of partners and stakeholders&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/4">Last week I tabled a named day question to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government asking</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/5" class="indent">&quot;whether it is her policy to approve unitary status only for those councils which command broad stakeholder support.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/6">Although the question was meant to have been answered by Tuesday, the Minister for Local Government replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/7" class="indent">&quot;I will answer this question shortly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/8">I do not know how long &quot;shortly&quot; means in the House, but today is the last day on which we are sitting and the question should have been answered on Tuesday. I checked the letter board before coming into the Chamber and found that as yet I had received no reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/9">However, the issue is pertinent in respect of the criteria that have been named yet again in the ministerial statement, because I do not believe that the bid for Exeter commanded the full support of the community that was consulted. In fact, when I receive my reply, I anticipate that the statistics will show that 83 per cent. of the responses that the Government received, including those from members of the public, were against the city of Exeter being made into a unitary authority and that only 14 per cent. were in favour. If that is a true reflection of where the figures lie, there is an obvious reason why the Minister has delayed answering a straightforward question, in the light of the ministerial statement. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House, whom I welcome to her position on the Front Bench, will make it a matter of urgency to ensure that I receive that reply in terms before the close of play today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/10">Another criterion was that the bid should</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/11" class="indent">&quot;deliver value for money and equity on...services.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July 2007</phrase>; Vol. 463, c. 69WS.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/12">The Government considered bids for unitary status in Lancashire, a large rural county, by both Burnley and Lancaster, but because of the impact on the rest of the county, the Government reckoned at the time&mdash;and I think have failed to implement unitary status for this reason&mdash;that those bids did not deliver equity on public services. Exactly the same argument can be deployed for the county of Devon, a large rural county with two moors that are national parks, where Torbay and Plymouth already have unitary status.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/13">If we take Exeter out of the Devon equation, we are left with a difficult situation for Exeter, which is far too small to be sustainable as a unitary authority in its own right, not least because there has just been a major restructuring of education in the city of Exeter, which was three-tier and is now two-tier, the cost of which is being borne under a private finance initiative county-wide. If Exeter is given unitary status, the city and the ratepayers of Exeter will have to pick up the long-term implications of that enormous PFI project. I am not just raising the issue from the point of view of a Member of Parliament representing a peripheral rural part of the 600 square miles of my county that abuts the city of Exeter. However, I am particularly concerned about the impact on the whole of Devon, which, if we take Exeter out of the equation is sparsely populated with a population of 93 people per square kilometre.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/14">We must also consider the economies of scale that can be achieved in some of the important services that have to be delivered, especially the complex care services delivered by the primary care trust across a rural area. Economies of scale of expertise can be pooled by the city of Exeter and the rest of the county, and there is clearly a question mark not only over the financial implications of taking Exeter out of the equation but over the subsequent ability to deliver acceptable, good quality services, particularly in an area with a large number of elderly people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/15">I was not going to raise this issue, but as the matter has come to light today, I must now ask the Minister to ask her colleague to give me an answer to my question as a matter of urgency. The Government's decision about the city of Exeter in today's ministerial statement is profoundly flawed and will almost certainly be challenged. There is cross-party agreement on this, although perhaps not from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">my neighbour, the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, who holds ministerial office. I imagine that he will be batting for the other side on this matter. These issues cannot be taken in isolation in a county such as ours.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/16">I have watched on television the plight of the many people around the country who have suffered from their homes being flooded in the most dramatic way. I also speak from personal experience. In 1997, my house in Devon, in which I had lived for 30 years, was flooded by an overnight flash flood. It was the first time that it had ever happened. We left the house that night, and were unable to return for five months. It is the most traumatic experience that can happen to anyone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/17">A lot is being said about the lessons to be learned from building on flood plains. Opinions vary as to whether the recent levels of rainfall are unique, and there was an interesting article in <i> The Sunday Telegraph </i>last week by Philip Eden which gave the statistics from the 1960s, '70s and '80s. They showed that we are not experiencing unique levels of rainfall, but we clearly have to take account of what we now know about the predicted climate change when we propose to build on flood plains.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/18">There are proposals to build a new town, Cranbrook, in my constituency, starting with about 3,000 properties and building up to 10,000. It is a pretty big development. An environmental study was carried out into the consequences of building a new town on an area of land, much of which comprises flood plains. The Environment Agency has approved the proposals, saying that although</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/19" class="indent">&quot;current guidance in PPG25 requires developers to avoid development within floodplain defined on the basis of the 1 in a 100 year (1per cent. probability) event,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/20">it accepts that, in the case of Cranbrook, it would be defined on the basis of a 1 in 1,000- year event, which is much less likely to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/21">The real point, however, with any large-scale development&mdash;goodness knows, a whole new town is pretty big&mdash;is that a lot depends on whether the infrastructure to help with the drainage, the run-off and all the other problems associated with a lot of new build will be put in place on time. My experience of developments of this scale is that, regardless of any negotiations about the infrastructure to be provided by the builders, that is almost the last thing to happen. We can see the consequences of that, especially as drainage infrastructure needs to be among the first things to be built, rather than the last. That involves spending money up front on the basis that the developers will anticipate getting more contracts to build and that the planning will go ahead as predicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/22">I will not rehearse the arguments about whether we should have this new town; that is a battle that I fought and lost many years ago. I will say to the Minister, however, that if we are genuinely to learn lessons, it cannot be acceptable to use predictive figures from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that have been on the books for a long time when planning large developments such as these. When this kind of infrastructure is required, we need to determine at what point in the development the developer should put it in. That will involve ensuring that the firms that win the contracts have the money and resources to provide that infrastructure, because there is often a question mark over their own viability. They usually want to sell the houses and get the money into the bank before they invest too much in any infrastructure other than the basic bits, usually the roads. If lessons are to be learned from the tragedy that many people have experienced in the past few days, that issue must be looked at, particularly in the context of planning policy guidance note 25.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.0/23">Finally, Mr. Deputy Speaker, may I wish you, members of staff and all colleagues here present and elsewhere a very happy summer recess? Devon awaits you. It is looking glorious, as always. If you want a weekend break or have not yet thought about where to go, the county of Devon will welcome you all.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1093.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1684" speakername="Harry Cohen" colnum="1093"  time="013:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0010.htm#07072638000954">
	<p pid="a.1093.0/1">Mr. Deputy Speaker, may I start by offering my humble apologies to you, to the Deputy Leader of the House of Commons and to the Opposition spokesman? I shall not be able to be here for the winding-up speeches, as I have to go to a local health meeting at a hospital in my constituency. However, I shall read the whole debate with interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/2">It is customary to say that we should not adjourn until we have discussed a particular subject. I do want the House to adjourn today, but when we get back, I want us to have a full-scale, grown-up, informed debate on drugs policy, the drugs industry and the drugs trade. I am not talking about pharmaceuticals; I am talking about the illegal drugs trade and its domestic and international ramifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/3">I should like to draw to the attention of the House the best book on the subject that I have seen for years. It was published last year, and it is called &quot;The Political Economy of Narcotics&quot; by Julia Buxton, a senior research fellow at the university of Bradford. She gives a history of the subject, along with masses of information and a very good analysis. I got the book from the House of Commons Library, and I can tell that it is a good book because its source, the British Library, demanded it back straight away. I read it through to the end, however, and it should inform the debate. If there is more in-depth analysis of the subject, however, we should bring it forward. Indeed, the Government should bring forward their own in-depth analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/4">Ms Buxton refers to the United Nations and the international drug institutions, and to &quot;institutional crisis and decline&quot;. Yet I know, from a parliamentary answer that I have received, that the UK is a major donor to those institutions, and to this failing effort. She refers to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the UN international drug control programme and the International Narcotics Control Board. She talks of</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the inability of the apparatus to revolutionize its working practices or to refocus policy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/6">Because of the institutions' dependence on donor countries,</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the mechanisms for debate, policy evaluation and review within the UN were limited and this further impeded the reform of UN and drug control approaches.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/8">She goes on to say that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/9" class="indent">&quot;while there might be a lively debate on changing aspects of the national drug laws in some countries, the reality is that national governments have very limited room for manoeuvre in terms of developing domestic drug strategies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/10">Importantly, she concludes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/11" class="indent">&quot;This situation is regrettable because the system of international drug control does not work. All the statistical information shows that, rather than decreasing, the number of people who are producing, distributing and consuming harmful drugs is increasing. The expansion of the trade in drugs has been particularly pronounced since the collapse of Soviet communism in the early 1990s and it has accelerated in line with the globalization process. On that basis alone, drug control policies have failed. Not only have they failed, they are also counter-productive...The current control model has not adapted to the enormous changes that have occurred in production and consumption trends during the 1990s and 2000s. As a result, drug control strategies are no longer simply counter-productive; they are doing more harm than good.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/12">Four types of drugs are dealt with in the book: poppy for opium and heroin; coca for cocaine, crack and other derivatives; synthetic-type drugs such as LSD and ecstasy; cannabis and marijuana.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/13">The book also provides valuable information about the financial value of the drugs sector&mdash;estimated by the UN as in the region of $300 billion to $500 billion a year, which is more than the market value of steel, cars, pharmaceuticals, meat, chocolate, wine, wheat, coffee and tea. In 2003, the global retail cannabis market was worth an estimated $140 billion a year; cocaine $70 billion; opiates $65 billion; and synthetics $44 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/14">In fact, the lucrative drugs market of north America accounted for 60 per cent. of amphetamine retail sales; 52 per cent. of ecstasy; and 62 per cent. of cocaine sales. That is interesting because America is the country most insistent on the prohibition policy&mdash;yet it has the biggest drugs market. What we have seen economically, because of the failure of the control system, is supply up, prices on the street down, demand up. Clearly, the current prohibition policy has failed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/15">What worries me most is the connection with crime. As with alcohol prohibition, which led to Al Capone and the US mafia, drug prohibition creates the most dangerous organised criminal gangs and threatens civil society beyond just drugs. For example, in Columbia, three presidential candidates were assassinated as a result of the drugs trade. The drugs industry almost went to war with the state in that particular case.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/16">The book notes that drugs prohibition has been advocated by the US Christian evangelists, who also brought in alcohol prohibition: the US likes bans and prohibition. I see that its policy on drugs is &quot;Just say no&quot;. That same phrase, by the way, applies to HIV/AIDS in Africa&mdash;but again it is not realistic. The British and US Governments have fallen out over that issue and we recommend supplying condoms. America says no to global abortion rights, but abortion should be a right. I note that our International Development Ministers are to address the Marie Stopes conference&mdash;again that shows that we are adopting a different position from that in the US. If the US will not change, we should be prepared to adopt a different policy on drugs. The book also points out that US foreign policy takes precedence over its counter-drugs policy. The US will condone drug states or drug players if that is seen to be in its best interests. That factor will be used against whoever the US regards as its enemy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/17">The drugs industry and the prohibition strategy, which makes it so profitable, lead to wars&mdash;Afghanistan is a clear example&mdash;and narco-states such as Columbia. That was the status of that country in the past and perhaps still now. The response is unreasonable militarisation and the mass denial of civil liberties; and environmental damage when crops are sprayed. There are also employment and livelihood issues. Bolivia is cited as having almost half a million people&mdash;16 per cent. of the work force at one point&mdash;employed in the drug industry. As we know from Afghanistan, people often have no other feasible livelihood. While the trade remains illegal, producers get a good price and the process is highly organised. There would be a better chance for alternative production to be pursued if the bottom were to fall out of the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/18">Julia Buxton says that the prohibition conventions of international organisations are out of date. They were brought in before the HIV/AIDS epidemic, before the collapse of communism and before globalisation. She argues that they spread harm while the real policy should be one of reducing harm. She refers to HIV/AIDS and drugs in prisons. Clean needle supply would help to combat the disease, and even safe supply could be justified. That would be better than the current practice, which ends up causing more HIV/AIDS as a result of dirty needles. The choice does not have to be between total prohibition or total liberalisation; Julia Buxton suggests that we could have a third way through regulation and an element of control. That is attractive because it would remove the worst of the criminality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/19">Let the House consider the equivalent industries that are also often viewed as unsavoury. There is the sex industry, for example. There are some bans, quite rightly in some respects, but that industry is not totally banned; indeed, most of it is legal and highly profitable, however unsavoury. The arms industry&mdash;most of us detest it&mdash;is not illegal; it is regulated. Tobacco is another example; it is legal, but we are quite rightly imposing ever more constraints on it. Alcohol is licensed. There is a third way, a third option, that could be adopted for drugs policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.0/20">Whenever this matter is discussed, the debate is seldom thorough. It is all about soundbites&mdash;a simple matter of whether we are tough or soft on drugs. I admit that drugs have an impact on our streets and even in people's homes when it affects their loved ones. It is, of course, a political issue, but we need to have a proper debate about it. I believe that we need to do what is best for public health and for society as a whole. I urge the House to have that discussion.</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1095.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26b.1095.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1095.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="1095"  time="014:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0010.htm#07072638000955">
	<p pid="a.1095.0/1">I shall limit my remarks to the time recommended by Mr. Deputy Speaker in order to maximise the opportunity for all colleagues to contribute to the debate. I would like to put one national issue&mdash;mentioned earlier in the announcement of forthcoming business&mdash;on the agenda and then discuss issues related to my part of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/2">On the national issue, I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will give us an update on whether active consideration is being given to the case of the Sri Lankan Tamils on hunger strike in Harmondsworth, which is causing great concern not just in the Tamil community, but more widely. The case is predictable; it is about people who are afraid to go back to their own country, given the terrible civil war. Many of us would encourage the new team at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to put Sri Lanka high on its agenda. It used to be British; it is a Commonwealth country; it is a great country&mdash;but it will be a truly great country only when it has become peaceful for all the communities living there, whether Simla, Tamil or others. I am sure that we all share that objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/3">Moving on to issues about London, my borough has a population of between 200,000 and 250,000. Like all inner-London boroughs, a significant increase in population is projected over the next 10 years. The official figures show that, but last night's Adjournment debate suggested that they may well be under-estimates and that the real figures are much higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/4">In that context, housing is, as always, a huge London issue. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will confirm that the good words about housing, particularly council housing, in the Government's recent statements represent a willingness to talk to boroughs and local housing authorities about the ability to build more council housing if that is what the people and their elected representatives want. There should no longer be any disincentives against council housing, forcing people to go down other routes. Council housing is often as well built and as well managed as any other housing. Our borough has the largest council housing stock in London, with more than 40,000 rented properties and another 20,000 bought under the right-to-buy arrangements. All three parties in the borough are determined to sustain that; we are all committed to that means of continuing to meet housing needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/5">In that context&mdash;and in the context of the great environmental debate&mdash;we would also like the Government to think more about funding not just decent homes initiatives, as they have done across England, but environmental initiatives that would allow the best heating systems and the least wasteful energy systems to be used. We have district heating systems, but they are old style. If we are to make properties for the future, we need, bluntly, to retrofit new combined heat and power systems. That has a cost, and we would be willing to work with Government to make sure that we pilot such proposals on estates such as the Four Squares, the Manor and the Rennie, which are old but have decent homes. If they had modern heating that did not waste energy, that would be progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/6">Secondly, I want to raise a health issue. South London Members of Parliament, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">my friend the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> who is present, and all other Members who represent Southwark and Lambeth seats, kept telling the previous Prime Minister's Administration that it was a bad idea to endorse the closure of the 24-hour emergency clinic for the mentally ill at the Maudsley hospital on Denmark hill&mdash;the most well known London and national hospital for mental illness. Sadly, that 24-hour clinic has been closed. A promise had been made to open decent alternative facilities on the King's college site that would separate the mentally ill and non-mentally ill. That has not happened, and it does not look as though it will. I hope that Health Ministers will reconsider that decision, and I have written to the Secretary of State to that effect. A review is needed. Tonight, I hope to present another petition from users of those facilities and their friends and families. It is not appropriate to deal with difficult mentally ill patients at one of the busiest accident and emergency departments in London and Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/7">Thirdly, given the announcements made, many parliamentary colleagues have post office closures looming in their constituencies. My request relates to a Crown post office in my constituency that has an uncertain future. A few post offices, of which Borough high street is one, have had a stay of closure without an outcome, and further closures of sub-post offices around the country are in prospect. Before we start having discussions and are given the list, will the Government at least insist that the Post Office provide the facts that we need to evaluate the case? The Post Office has been dreadful at sharing the facts; it always says that it cannot tell us. We cannot engage in debate if we do not know how many users a post office has, or what its turnover is. If we get the facts, we can have an honest debate about the relative merits of post offices. The four Crown post offices in my patch have been much busier since the sub-post offices that previously existed were closed. The facts need to be provided, and then I will happily engage in debate in defence of my remaining post offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/8">Lastly, I want to raise issues relating to transport, including train, tram and tube services. On trains, the Secretary of State for Transport's welcome announcement on Tuesday about investment in the railways left in abeyance the issue of whether London will get Crossrail. There is a united cross-party view that London transport will be hugely better if it has an east-west link. We urge the Government to come down on the side of investment in Crossrail sooner rather than later. I know that the private Bill is going through the House, but a green light for Crossrail is needed soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/9">Another major, strategic London-related announcement was on Thameslink, which is to have a &pound;5.5 billion investment. That north-south link goes through my constituency, crossing Blackfriars bridge. Thameslink is a very good idea, but has one problem, which I have raised over and again&mdash;the threat posed to Borough market and the area around Southwark cathedral by the impact of the scheme. I put on record that if Network Rail and Thameslink are to sustain the support of the community&mdash;but more importantly, protect one of London's heritage sites that has associations with Dickens, a cathedral at London bridge that goes back 1,400 years and Borough market, which is wholesale and retail&mdash;an inappropriate viaduct and the demolition of lots of listed buildings is not the way to proceed. There must be ways of accommodating the double-width viaduct without destroying the heritage of that wonderful part of London. Huge support has been received from across parties and from people all over the world who are worried about Borough market. Let us say yes to Thameslink, but to a Thameslink that does not ruin Borough market. We cannot rebuild history or remake Dickensian, historic London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/10">On the tram, I want to make a plea for the comprehensive funding review to direct adequate funding to Transport for London for good London projects, which would significantly reduce congestion, motoring and environmental harm. The first proposal in that regard is the cross-river tram, which is widely supported. London currently has two tram proposals in the pipeline: the Uxbridge road tram, which is not very popular; and the north-south London tram, which would go from Camden Town in the north down to Peckham and Brixton in the south, crossing Waterloo bridge and going through my constituency at Elephant and Castle, for which a fantastic new regeneration scheme has been announced this week. We need to know that the money is available to do it. If TfL has the money, the Mayor will say yes. My understanding is that if Crossrail gets the green light, and the money is there for one tram, it is likely that we can have the north-south London tram, because an east-west train will not be needed as much if we get Crossrail. That is logical.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/11">People north of the river&mdash;in the posher bits of Camden, I understand&mdash;might be a bit nervous about the thought of a tram going past their exclusive houses and giving them grief in some of the leafier squares. I hope that that problem can be resolved. Even posh people can go on trams and benefit from them. People with expensive houses might even see their house prices going up, not down. Can we at least have the money to allow us to have what is not a cross-river tram if it stops south of the river, having started south of the river? We want the tram to go from Brixton and Peckham to Waterloo, and at least over to Aldwych. If the good burghers&mdash;I use my words carefully&mdash;of Camden do not want it to go further north than the Aldwych, that is their problem; they are mistaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/12">Finally, London has two tube issues, which are not merely related to south London. South London has 38 tube stations, and north London has 200&mdash;a gross inequity, as I am sure that the Deputy Leader of the House will agree. On the first issue, everyone agrees that the extension of the East London line is a good project, which is waiting for the funds to be continued. Work is starting, and the line will close later in the year as preparations are made. In the first phase, it will run from Dalston junction down to New Cross, Crystal Palace and West Croydon; at the moment, it just goes from Shoreditch to New Cross and New Cross Gate. The second phase will eventually take it to Clapham junction via Surrey Canal Road. It will link all the bits of the system that are not currently linked. One will therefore be able to get on to the East London line via the Victoria line at Brixton, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/13">It will be no good, however, if the comprehensive spending review does not provide the money. I am a big fan of the line, which will hugely reduce traffic in east London. A lot of people will be able to go to Canary Wharf from south London&mdash;crossing the river is difficult, because there are not many crossing points. It would be a hugely valuable investment, so may I make a big plea that Transport for London be given enough money to allow the East London line to go ahead as planned?</p>
	<p pid="a.1095.0/14">The second tube issue relates to Metronet and its consequences. The Prime Minister has done many good things in his political career, but one of the bad things that he did was to insist on the public-private partnership for the London underground. That was always going to come to grief, and it has; and Metronet has come to grief. The impact of that is that all the restoration work, and the work on the lines affected, including the Bakerloo line at Elephant and Castle, is at risk because we do not know who will be doing it. Will the Deputy Leader of the House please take back to her colleagues, including the Prime Minister, the new Chancellor and the new Transport Secretary, the message that such a scheme cannot be allowed again? More importantly, we need the security that any scheme will be viable for all its users, if we are to have confidence in the London tube.</p>

	<p pid="a.1099.2/1">Even the most fervent or rabid fans of the school academy programme would find it hard to justify the fact that Heartsease high school in my constituency could be turned into such an academy. The two sponsors have each put money into the programme&mdash;up to &pound;2 million. One is a Pentecostal ex-car dealer and the other is the Bishop of Norwich. It seems to be a phenomenon raging across the country these days. Nevertheless, we are in the middle of a consultation, which ends on <phrase class="date" code="">20 August</phrase>, from which we will find out the views of at least some of the people in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/2">I will not bore hon. Members with all the honeyed words that are said about the aim of such academies and schools: providing a lovely new building, which is welcome, and making a contribution to people's lives and so on. We have all seen those words. I do not think that I would find anyone who would ever disagree with that, whatever position they took. The school no longer appertains to be a faith school. I say that because, in its original documentation, it said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/3" class="indent">&quot;there is an opportunity to support an academy in Heartsease. This derives from our faith that the love of God should be seen in our lives&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/4">in such a lively school. That has changed as the opposition has grown. It is now to be an open academy of the best sort and to be socially non-divisive&mdash;ethnic, and religious diversity will be the favour of the month.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/5">I should say too that it is a school that can improve; it has had trouble in the past. That was the original criterion for such academies. Let me quote from its Ofsted report following its hard years. In February 2007, inspectors said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/6" class="indent">&quot;This is a satisfactory and improving school. It has overcome significant turbulence caused by recent changes to headship&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/7">somebody whom I taught at university&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/8" class="indent">&quot;and governance and it is now much more stable&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/9">and there is a great spirit. It also interacts through the sixth form with the local Blyth-Jex high school and Sprowston high school. With the new middle school and early entry to secondary schools, there will be more pupils there than ever. I will say more about that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/10">One wonders about the vision for the school, because it is not always clear. When we enter discussions with the sponsors and others they say that they are going to have environmentalism&mdash;well, everyone says that these days&mdash;but they do not define exactly what that means in teaching in a school. They are of course to have their specialism, which is engineering. The school achieved specialist status in engineering. It is pretty rare in this country to take that on. It is a hard area to get people interested in, but by gosh when they do get into it they are interested and go on to universities and other places. The vision of how those things will merge has not been spelled out clearly and we have not seen any documentation explaining it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/11">On a wide range of value-added measures of attainment, the school is among the most improved in the country. It has improved at all key stages. It dispirits people when they see that that is not rewarded and that perhaps many of the teachers and others will lose their jobs. It will have its new glossy buildings, presumably, and its ICT facilities and it might raise standards, but the question is how those standards will be raised. Will it be by diversion of pupils from other schools into the academy because of the attraction of it? Will it really be because of the Christian ethos and what is taught there&mdash;sustainable development or whatever? Will that bring people to that school to raise the numbers from about 600 to perhaps 900? They will have to come from the other schools in that district.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/12">One thing that has really established Norwich schools has been the interaction between them. Norwich is not north and south; that is only a constituency matter and two MPs. There is a unitary educational system, where the schools work together and through the years they have interchanged heads and helped each other. The products from our schools&mdash;the young people&mdash;go on to do excellent work elsewhere; that is second to none. Therefore, social grounds alone may have helped to develop that school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/13">I am also concerned about the questionnaire that has gone out, which is quite interesting. If ever there were a questionnaire that you wanted to fail, this is it. The questions are biased and loaded. It is amazing. I will take just one example:</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/14" class="indent">&quot;Do you agree with the sponsor's vision for the proposed new Academy? 'We believe in the unique worth of each child'. Yes, No, Undecided&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/15">Who could ever be undecided about that kind of question? There are 16 questions just like that, for which the obvious answer is that Heartsease school, as it is now, is rubbish and we need an academy to make it better. No reasons are given. It is just pushing people in that direction. Many people have pointed that out. I am amazed that a county council&mdash;Norfolk county council&mdash;can allow such a questionnaire to go out in its name. I wonder as well about the Christian sponsors allowing that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/16">One other thing gravitates against giving the school academy status. Yesterday, there was a statement&mdash;it has already been referred to&mdash;that unitary status is coming Norwich's way. There is an argument about how it will come. It is not in one of the nine primary areas to which we were minded to give unitary status; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1876" name="Angela Browning">the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Angela Browning)</phrase> mentioned Exeter in that connection. Norwich is singled out and it is said that if we can widen the boundaries just outside Norwich&mdash;there is no green belt there now; areas have all merged together&mdash;to territory such as Sprowston and Hellesdon, we really have a chance to meet the five criteria. Everything I hear indicates that there is great hope that that might happen. That means that the local education authority loses its right to look after those schools, including Heartsease, Blyth-Jex and Sprowston. That reflects a difference from where we started, taking one school out of the system and trying to make it very different. It would be divisive to do such a thing in the current situation. I hope that the Minister will listen when we meet him to discuss that issue. Unitary status changes everything.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/17">The Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families has made some authentic claims about changing the criteria for academies, not dramatically but just enough. He said that it is just not enough to have a lot of money to be a good sponsor. One has to show leadership, innovation and commitment to act in the public interest. If one is going to run education, it would help to know a little about it before taking those responsibilities on. That is beginning to change, in terms of how the academy programme is rolling out across the country. There is a long way to go, but people are beginning to realise that sponsorship may not be the way to develop better standards in education. There may be better ways, such as addressing the size of the school or the interaction between schools. If someone gave me &pound;25 million, I could take those three schools into the stratosphere, including Nobel prizes or whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/18">Schools need better buildings and playing fields. The science labs at Sprowston high school are mediaeval. I had a meeting the other week with the director of education for the county and we showed him the appalling labs. The wooden desks have things like &quot;Tony loves Cherie&quot; scrawled all over them. We used to love such desks, but labs in good schools now look completely different. All those schools need an investment of money, and to interact with each other. That has started to happen with the sixth forms and it could happen in other areas of school endeavour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/19">I also wish to raise a point that someone made recently in a big meeting about academies, and that is the human rights of people in academies. Are they covered by the 1944 Education Act and the rest of the 9 ft pile of legislation and regulations on education and grant-maintained schools and the rest? A lawyer from the eminent Matrix chambers, which I seem to remember hearing of somewhere before, said that that has not been tested yet, so that is another problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1099.2/20">I do not think that the academy proposal has been considered in terms of value for the &pound;25 million that the sponsor gets to do what they like, such as appointing governors and so on. Because of the unitary status situation, it will take time to discuss with other local councils how they can work better together and how the schools and other services will be taken from the county council and brought under the umbrella of the unitary authority. In those circumstances, I call for a moratorium on the academy programme. The judgments that have been made so far are unsound, such as the questionnaire that I have mentioned. If one looks at the education situation in the round, the academy proposal will not give us a well funded, accountable or fair school system in my part of Norwich.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1102.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" speakername="Peter Bottomley" colnum="1102"  time="014:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0011.htm#07072638000959">
	<p pid="a.1102.0/1">I wish to raise three subjects, and I shall end with the one on which the Government could act before <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/2">The first subject goes back some way to the unfair treatment of pensioners from this country who choose to live overseas. Many people believe that the arguments that successive Governments have used are wrong. Brian Havard of Australia has pointed out that he has lost &pound;30,000 since he retired there. Another resident of Australia, aged 96, is getting a state pension from this country of &pound;6 a week, but it would be &pound;70 to &pound;100 a week if she had chosen to go and live in the Philippines rather than in an old British dominion. I do not expect the Minister to be able to do more than to say that she has heard what I have said, but it is a scandal that gets worse with the passing years. It is time that Government woke up and said that whatever the other spending priorities may be, pensioners should get the same north of the 49th parallel as in the United States, in another European Union country or in South Africa. People should be treated fairly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/3">The second issue is one to which I have given a great deal of time and attention. It is the proposed reconfiguration of hospitals in West Sussex. I pay tribute to the chairman of the primary care trust, David Taylor, who has resigned today for personal reasons. I do not believe that his resignation is linked to the fact that the health oversight committee yesterday referred the consultation to the Secretary of State on the grounds of inadequate and improper procedures. I accept what the chairman said and I wish him well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/4">I suggest&mdash;although he is in my party&mdash;that the Government appoint as chairman of the PCT someone such as Henry Smith, the leader of West Sussex county council. He would approach the issues in a proper way. He has led the council well and he would be able to get the consultation halted and then put back on course properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/5">It is unprecedented for the first meeting of a joint health and oversight committee to take the action that that one did, and the Government should take it seriously. If they say that it is nothing to do with them and that the strategic health authority should make the decision, they should give direction to the chief executive of the SHA to try to get the consultation working properly. I shall not take the House through all the issues, but the representations made to the former Secretary of State for Health have not apparently been referred to the PCT as part of its consultation. The thousands of representations made to the PCT in the year that it took to come out with its inadequate consultation get no more than a passing reference.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/6">Many of the clinicians, including those who got standing ovations at the meeting in Worthing a few days ago, have made a declaration that the proposals were not safe, and that&mdash;apparently&mdash;has allowed others to claim that the clinicians are agreed that there can be only one major hospital on the south coast in West Sussex.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/7">The county of West Sussex has a population of 750,000 and there will be 3,000 births at Worthing hospital this year. The former Prime Minister, who thought it worth bypassing one's local hospital for special primary angioplasty treatment, should know that if he wanted that treatment he could have it in Worthing, where our surgeons are of world renown. At a meeting of the all-party health group, some of us heard Professor Sir George Alberti and another Government adviser, Roger Boyle, agree with Mark Signy of Worthing hospital that treatment there is more likely to save a patient's life than if they journeyed to hospitals in Brighton, Chichester or Portsmouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/8">The inadequacies of the consultation are well known locally and to the PCT, too. As an example, it was decided to recommend three options. A fourth was cut out at the last moment&mdash;my belief is that it was done on the instructions of the SHA or the Department of Health, but I cannot prove it. There has been some dispute as to whether the consultation document was submitted to the Department of Health for approval before it was released. It was certainly released later than anyone expected, but that is in the past so there is not much point in going over it again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/9">The consultation should include an option for two hospitals with accident and emergency and maternity services. There are good arguments for Princess Royal hospital in Haywards Heath, but to make people decide between St. Richard's hospital at Chichester and the Worthing and Southlands hospitals in my constituency is wrong. The fourth option&mdash;knocked out at the last moment&mdash;should have been included, which, like the first option, includes a benefit to the NHS of more than &pound;20 million, but because it would be at Portsmouth in Hampshire it is not counted in the financial calculations. The Minister would have to look in a small box on page 7 of the fifth document attached to the seventh item of the PCT agenda to find it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/10">The PCT should also be required to reinstate one of the Government's accessibility hurdles, which was dropped in March without anybody noticing. I should be surprised if any non-executive directors of the PCT understood what was happening at the time. What is proposed is wrong. Worthing has one of the best hospitals in the country. People want to be patients there. Staff want to work there and people want to be trained there. I declare a slight interest, as my doctor daughter was trained at the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/11">My daughter is not the reason why I raise the next issue, which is the total mess of the Government's nationalised scheme for choosing doctors for hospital training posts. In November and December 2006, there were warnings, in which I took part, that the modernising medical careers system and the computerised medical training application system&mdash;MTAS&mdash;would not work. In March, sensible directors of medical education advised deaneries that they should hold the system for a year and process applications manually. If that had happened, we would have known about almost every hospital position by May. Those positions are for the benefit not just of doctors in training but for patients. They also enable senior doctors to do their work properly rather than downgrading themselves to jobs that require less experience and skill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/12">The Government did not heed those warnings. We have reached the stage of resignations&mdash;not only of the chairman of the BMA and of some of the people who helped design the system, but of the Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1676" name="Patricia Hewitt">the right hon. Member for Leicester, West (Ms Hewitt)</phrase>, who left her job for personal reasons, which we can well understand. The junior Minister responsible for some of those things has moved on to another post. The Select Committee on Health is to hold an inquiry and the Tooke inquiry is under way, but I should prefer Ministers to say, &quot;We realise the whole thing is a total mess. We went on regardless and we were wrong.&quot; The Minister will discover the strength of what is wrong if she asks Great Ormond street hospital whether it is true that it has up to 12 vacancies for posts that need to be filled on <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/13">We are used to flood warnings, but we are getting to the stage where we should put out a warning saying, &quot;Do not be ill in August.&quot; That is not just because people are changing their jobs everywhere in the country and many vacancies will not be filled, but because many of those that are filled will be filled by people who did not want to have that specialty in that place. Imagine what it is like to be one of the people who is actually given a job that they did want in a place that they wanted, only to be told two weeks after receiving that news, &quot;I am sorry; we made a mistake. We have offered six places for four posts, and two of you have to be picked to go elsewhere to do something totally different.&quot; That is not the way to treat a committed professional, on whom this country has spent perhaps &pound;250,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/14">The same applies to people referred to as IMGs&mdash;international medical graduates: people who came to this country to do A-levels, their first degree and their medical training. As a result of a change of policy by the Home Office in March 2006, brought about apparently by the Department of Health either conniving or being ignorant about the consequences, those people found out that by late last year a decision had been taken, without full information to everyone who would be affected, that it was now not enough to have a letter from the Home Office in order to switch to the highly skilled migrant programme, and that a stamp in one's passport was also required. Given the delays at the Home Office, one would not only have to have applied, having obtained the qualifications to get the FT3 grade that gets one above the salary level that makes it possible to apply for the highly skilled migrant programme, but would have to have got in the queue where they open the letter and put the stamp in. A letter from the Home Office was judged not to be adequate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/15">What kind of a Government say that one Department can send a letter saying that a person is qualified whereas another can say, &quot;Unless you actually turn that letter into a stamp in your passport by <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-05">5 February</phrase>, you cannot take up a job on <phrase class="date" code="">1 August</phrase>&quot;? I would be ashamed of that and I expect that, privately, both Ministers and the officials involved are ashamed. It is wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/16">Some specialties, such as pediatrics and psychiatry, normally rely on international medical graduates. I suggest that the new Secretary of State goes down to the airport and tries to stop some of those people leaving the country. They may have been in this country for seven or eight years but they are needed here. I challenge the Government to publish during the next week, even though Parliament may have gone off on holiday, the figures for every deanery, hospital, specialty and grade, and to say where the gaps are and how many doctors are trying to enter the transfer system, where they can swap with someone else. For example, someone with a job in Scotland may want to be down in Kent. How can they swap? It is a shambles of a system and I am ashamed to be part of it. We as MPs have failed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/17">On a different subject, during the break I am going to America to help win a clemency hearing for a man called Krishna Maharaj. The former Prime Minister mentioned him. Several members of the present Cabinet signed up to the amicus curiae brief signed by nearly 300 MPs and MEPs in the House of Lords. I hope that I can come back knowing that Florida will grant a clemency hearing to this man and have a full investigation. If he cannot be ordered a new trial, at least he can get the clemency hearing that he richly deserves.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1105.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" speakername="Kate Hoey" colnum="1105"  time="014:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0012.htm#07072638000960">
	<p pid="a.1105.0/1">The first issue that I shall raise has already been raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase>. That is no surprise, because it is the question of the closure of the emergency clinic at the Maudsley hospital. All the Members of Parliament in south London, the two local authorities of different political persuasions and health scrutiny committees of different political persuasion united to say that they did not want it closed and that they did not want it moved to an inferior position at King's College hospital. The former Secretary of State for Health did not listen to any words that we said. I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will make a point of drawing this matter to the attention of the new Secretary of State for Health even though that has already been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/2">The local paper, the <i> South London Press, </i>has led a very good campaign on this issue, and has really got people in south London to see mental health issues as central to the problems that many of my constituents and other Members in south London face. Each week now in the <i> South London Press</i> we read of people who have been treated very badly indeed, and we read of the bureaucracy that is involved in that change. And yet &pound;6 million was going to be spent, although it has not been spent yet, to move a service that nobody wanted moved. I still do not understand the reasoning behind that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/3">I am delighted that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made three changes in the last week or two, and all of them are on issues on which I voted against my own Government&mdash;on the questions of cannabis, casinos and 24-hour licensing. I am hopeful that, over the next few weeks and perhaps by the time that we come back in the autumn, there will be more changes on policies on which I was against the Government and on which they have now seen the error of their ways. I hope that the new Secretary of State will look again at the issue that I have raised, because it is not too late to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/4">I also wish to draw to the House's attention the way in which the ballots for arm's length management organisations are carried out and I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will refer it to whichever Minister is responsible for monitoring the conduct of those ballots. There has recently been a ballot in Lambeth for an ALMO and I was ashamed by the way that my borough handled it. The ballot form was biased and set out in a way that was clearly one-sided. Something like &pound;400,000 was spent on glossy brochures, DVDs and all sorts of other things that were sent to tenants, and they amounted to propaganda as to why the tenants should have their housing put out to an ALMO. Despite all that, there were questions such as</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Are you aware that the ALMO could attract over &pound;200 million of additional investment to make homes decent in Lambeth?</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/6" class="indent">Yes No Don't know</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/7" class="indent">Are you aware that with the ALMO for Lambeth you will remain tenants and leaseholders of the Council?</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/8" class="indent">Yes No Don't know&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/9">The whole ballot form was not in any way a fair way to ask tenants' opinions, especially after the expenditure of &pound;300,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/10">Ironically, of the 30,986 council housing tenants and residents who had the right to vote, the total number of valid votes cast was 8,278. Of that, the number voting yes was 3,518, the number voting no was 3,362 and the number voting &quot;don't know&quot; was 1,398. The council leadership portrayed that as a great victory for the ALMO and claimed that it had received the support of 52 per cent. of the tenants voting. However, when we add the figures up, we see that a minority of the people voting voted for an ALMO. I ask the Deputy of Leader of the House to make sure that the Minister responsible is made aware of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/11">Although we need extra resources to improve the homes in my borough, setting up a bureaucratic way of proceeding is not what residents and tenants want. I hope that Ministers will study that carefully and realise that Lambeth council would have done much better to spend its money and resources on improving the repair system and the whole system for the management of housing rather than on paying overtime to extra staff to knock on doors so many times that the residents told them to go away and locked their doors. Lambeth might then have had the chance to become a two-star housing authority, which it is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/12">Instead of Lambeth council wasting money, it could have campaigned for the fourth option of direct investment in local authority housing. That is needed and I hope that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister is moving towards greater support for council housing. I am fed up with the terms &quot;affordable housing&quot; and &quot;social housing&quot;. Let us get back to using the term &quot;council housing&quot;, because that is what people mean when they talk about improving some of the housing. It does not mean that other types of housing cannot be built, but people know what council housing means and that is what we want.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/13">The House should not adjourn until it has debated another issue. For 150 years, we had a wonderful universal postal service that was carried out by the Royal Mail. It was the envy of the world, with low, uniform stamp prices and six-day deliveries. I believe that the rapid introduction of full liberalisation in January 2006&mdash;well ahead of all other European countries&mdash;has created an unlevel competitive playing field for the Royal Mail that is now threatening its commercial viability and the future of the universal service. Postcomm has not carried out its duty very well in allowing foreign competitors to enter the UK market while denying the same opportunity for Royal Mail to compete in Europe. As the Communication Workers Union predicted, competition has amounted to cherry picking and to allowing the private competitors to cream off the Royal Mail's most profitable bulk mail business. Real competition has proved a myth, with no other competitor being prepared to develop a national collection and do all the things that we are so used to with Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/14">Those who run Royal Mail, Mr. Leighton and&mdash;I've forgotten his name, but I do know him. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Mr. Crozier. They have got themselves into a situation where they are refusing to negotiate properly with the Communication Workers Union. I have a long association with the Communications Workers Union, dating back to when it was the old Union of Communication Workers, and I know that the people who work for the Post Office do not want to strike. However, the Royal Mail has handled the situation appallingly. It goes on about huge salary increases for its workers, who actually earn a small amount, while people such as Crozier award themselves huge amounts of extra money every year. Over the summer, the Government need to get involved, address the issue, and knock some heads together at Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/15">There are two final issues that I would like to mention. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1411" name="Gisela Stuart">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)</phrase> will probably have more to say about one of them. It is quite wrong that we are going off for the long recess without having a proper debate on the need for a referendum on the European Union constitution. For me, it is still a constitution. It is disgraceful that, unless it has been produced today, we still have not seen an English edition of the so-called constitutional treaty. It is quite clear that the vast majority of the original 250 proposals in that constitution are there in black and white as they were before. A very strong commitment was given in the manifesto that I stood on that we would have a referendum on that constitution, and we need a referendum. The demands for that will grow over the summer. Before we come back in the autumn, I hope that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister will change his mind on that, as we changed our minds on the original referendum&mdash;unfortunately, we were not able to have that referendum because other countries voted against the constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/16">Finally, a lot of my constituents will be travelling this summer. They will be flying off and using the airports. I want to put in a word for some kind of reality check on the question of terrorism and the various measures that have been introduced. I am absolutely certain that one of the things that the terrorists want to do is to change our way of life and to change the basic idea in this country that we do things within the law and we do not change our behaviour too much. I am afraid that, as a constant traveller&mdash;quite often I go back and forward to Northern Ireland, where there is no alternative but to fly&mdash;I have noticed the attitude and the way in which people handle the security process. Quite honestly, if anyone wanted to do something, they would simply do it around the long queues at check-in and security.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/17">The Government have to allow a more common-sense approach to hand luggage. I had tiny bottle of blackberry jam, which my mother made, taken off me because it was slightly bigger than the size of blackberry jam that I would have been allowed to carry. There is no common sense in the attitude to the kind of measures that are being taken. Unless we take people with us on the measures, people will react. Although everyone wants to see normal security carried out, they do not want to see more and more people acting as if they just quite enjoy having a little bit of power over ordinary people. I hope that, over the summer, Transport Ministers do not react too much to suggestions that there should be even tighter security. We should take a common sense approach and recognise that the answer to terrorism does not lie in just making the lives of everybody in this country more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.1105.0/18">I am sure that many other Members want to speak. May I wish you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and all the staff a good long recess? We London MPs do not disappear off; we are usually seen wandering around the House of Commons where lots of work is going on, because we do not go off unless we are actually on holiday.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1111.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1411" speakername="Gisela Stuart" colnum="1111"  time="015:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0013.htm#07072638000964">
	<p pid="a.1111.2/1">In this debate, it is customary to raise constituency issues, but I do not want to do that this afternoon. I want to debate a Government Green Paper and a document that is not yet available, because this is the last opportunity before the summer recess to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/2">The Green Paper &quot;The Governance of Britain&quot; is excellent and I welcome it. In it, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the House commit themselves to much greater involvement by the public and Parliament in our constitutional decisions. They state that they</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/3" class="indent">&quot;want to forge a new relationship between government and citizen, and begin the journey towards a new constitutional settlement&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/4">The document briefly recounts how the British constitution evolved. It mentions at great length on a number of occasions the Council of Europe and the European convention on human rights. However, there is only one reference to the European Union, namely:</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/5" class="indent">&quot;in 1973, the UK joined the European Economic Community (now the European Union) and became a part of a multinational political structure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/6">The document does not mention the Single European Act and the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties, which I think are extremely important in the evolution of our constitutional settlement. Page 19 briefly refers to the process of EU treaty ratification, but otherwise the EU is absent. For example, the document includes a list of public appointments that could be subject to affirmative hearings, but I think that European Commissioner is a classic example of an appointment that should be open to a scrutiny hearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/7">The document encourages us to reinvigorate our democracy, and it mentions</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/8" class="indent">&quot;the Government's wish to ensure that decision-making is done at the right level: whether national, regional or in the local community&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/9">It also discusses the youth citizenship commission and voting rights, but, again, there is no mention of the EU. We have a whole Green Paper on the governance of Britain that completely leaves out the source of some 60 per cent. of our domestic legislation in areas such as health and trade. When was the last time we saw Department of Trade and Industry legislation? There is no mention of the European Parliament, other than mentioning the change in voting rights, which is a sad omission in what is otherwise an exceptionally good document.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/10">One part of the document attempts to define the values of Britain, and it considers with some envy the way in which the French or even the Americans have managed to do that. In the UK, we could make much more of the rule of law as one of the key values by which we define ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/11">At least we can discuss that Green Paper, because we can read it. I think that the second document is called &quot;The EU Reform Treaty&quot;. I want to make it clear that I am not against the European Union&mdash;far from it; my whole life has been a product of its evolution. However, it is sometimes disheartening how those on the Treasury Bench manage to pigeonhole anybody who has anything even marginally critical to say about it as being completely antediluvian&mdash;to want to withdraw immediately and go back to being little Englanders saying, &quot;Fog in the Channel: continent cut off.&quot; That is not the point. I am in favour of the European Union, but I would like it to work properly. We should have the right to discuss this, and not pretend that the elephant in the room does not exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/12">People say that the call for a referendum is an old Tory agenda, but I would have thought that it was a classic new Labour agenda. We are the party that has asked the people far more often than any other party has done before. The Conservatives never went to the people&mdash;they were afraid to do so. We have had local referendums and referendums on devolution. We had a referendum on whether Birmingham should have an elected mayor. I was absolutely delighted to go into the 2005 general election with a manifesto commitment that we would have a referendum on the then constitutional treaty, but it was extraordinary that the former Prime Minister did not give its constitutional implications as the reason for seeking the people's opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/13">Now we have the new treaty. In the past two and a half hours I have managed to skim through the first 26 pages of the 118-page document, which is still so far an unofficial translation. We are leaving for the recess and will not come back until October, when all the negotiations and deals will have been done, yet the purpose of this new democratic settlement, which started five or six years ago, was to involve the people and national Parliaments more. I do not want to get into whether this document contains 90 or 95 per cent. of the old constitutional treaty; all I will say is that I can see, having skimmed through it, that all the big items are still in there. I do not want to fall into the trap whereby we assume that anything that has been taken out must therefore be good and anything that has been put in is bad. That is not true. People really need to read this properly. One of the things that I just spotted is on page 26, where, under the heading &quot;Ordinary revision procedure&quot;, it says that</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/14" class="indent">&quot;any Member State, the European Parliament or the Commission&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/15">can bring forward proposals that</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/16" class="indent">&quot;aim to increase or reduce the competencies conferred on the Union in the treaties.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/17">That would be, for the first time, a mechanism for returning powers, which is extremely good.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/18">The new treaty also claims to give more power to national Parliaments, but that is extremely misleading. What it does is extraordinary. For the first time, the Union tries to put a duty on national Parliaments to behave in a particular way. We do not bind our successor Parliaments, yet we are being asked to accept a document that says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/19" class="indent">&quot;National Parliaments shall contribute actively to the good functioning of the Union&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/20">There is a whole list of ways in which we are supposed to fulfil that role&mdash;we will be informed, we will be seeing to things, we will taking part, and we will be notified, but will have no teeth other than in facilitating the functioning of the Union. I am sorry, but I have never perceived having a duty to serve the Union to be my role as a national parliamentarian&mdash;I thought that it was supposed to be the other way round.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/21">The document still contains the citizens initiative whereby more than 1 million people across a number of member states are being given the right to initiate legislation&mdash;something that national Parliaments have not done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/22">I suggest to the Deputy Leader of the House that the Government should stop going on about what percentage of the treaty is what it was before and look at it properly. The Government say that the red lines that we have secured mean that we do not need a referendum, but those matters were already protected in the constitutional treaty on which we were prepared to have a referendum&mdash;nothing has changed. Opt-outs are continually politically vulnerable to pressure every time a crisis occurs. This is now a question of trust. It is a question of having given a commitment to a referendum on a document that we say is good for Britain. We should ask the people to endorse that. If we are so confident that it is good, we should have the confidence to ask the people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.2/23">The Foreign Secretary and the Minister for Europe deny that the treaty is substantial enough for us to be bound by that promise. Are they being deliberately disingenuous or are they ill-informed? I suggest to them some light summer reading&mdash;read the treaty, in English or in French. They can then come back and we can decide which one of the two interpretations is correct.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1116.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" speakername="John Robertson" colnum="1116"  time="015:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0013.htm#07072638000966">
	<p pid="a.1116.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow the positive contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" name="David Amess">the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.0/2">I had hoped to discuss several issues on a national and an international basis, but, given that other hon. Members have cut down their contributions, I shall do likewise. I will therefore concentrate on my constituency and the work done by the few to help the many. I want specifically to refer to those with disabilities and especially a radio station called Insight.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.0/3">Insight Radio was once called VIP On Air and deals with people who are blind or partially sighted. The station delivers information, has music programmes, newspaper readings and book readings that people can tune into, and generally helps people who have a sight problem. Insight Radio is a community radio station and broadcasts via a mast in the centre of my constituency at Anniesland Cross to radius of about 5 km. The station is also on the internet and broadcasts all over the world. It receives contributions from contacts in Australia and Canada, as well as other countries in Europe. The station does an excellent job, and I see my job here as being to try to assist it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.0/4">Let me tell a story about why Insight Radio came into existence and why it wants to give information to blind people. There was a train from Glasgow to Edinburgh. The Edinburgh station at the end of line is Waverly&mdash;the other of the two main stations is the stop before, at Haymarket. ScotRail, which was in charge of the service at that time, put notices on all the seats in the train to tell everybody that the train would not stop at Waverly, but that it would stop at Haymarket. That was really good for people who could read the signs and knew that they were there, but blind passengers would have known nothing about it. Needless to say, two blind people got off at Haymarket, but thought that they were in Waverly and did not know where to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.0/5">Insight Radio provides a service in telling people that kind of information. Unfortunately, people have to have a computer, and blind people can have problems with computers, but the facilities and the technology are advancing and we hope that they will move further. I see part of my job as being to help Insight Radio get on to Sky radio services and freeview, so that it can deliver the service to approximately 2 million in this country who have such problems. That is one of the campaigns in which I hope to be involved when we return after the summer recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.0/6">Another campaign that I took up some years ago was on ATMs. It was pleasing when the Select Committee on Treasury took it up and Ministers jumped onboard, too. That was great, but when I first raised the issue back in early 2005, I did so in connection with a constituent who had gone to the ATM to get some money out. He had &pound;40 in his account. Unfortunately, the ATM charged him &pound;1.75 to get his money out, which meant that he could get only &pound;30 out. That meant that the rest of his money just had to sit there, and in Yoker, in my constituency, that extra &pound;8.25 could have gone a long way. Unfortunately, if my constituent had wanted to go to a free ATM, he would have had to pay a bus fare, which would have cost him &pound;1.50. That was totally unfair, so I took up the cause, along with many others. I worked closely with a newspaper in Glasgow called the <i> Evening Times</i>, which was helpful. The newspaper helped to broaden the campaign and the Committee took it up, too, which also helped.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.0/7">I was pleased to receive a phone call last year&mdash;funnily enough, in the first week of the recess&mdash;from the Royal Bank of Scotland to say that the campaign had worked and that the bank was about to install 400 free ATMs throughout the UK. Since then, HBOS has also announced its intention to install 100 free cash machines in low-income areas in Scotland and the north of England; 74 have been installed so far, of which 38 are in Scotland. It is still looking for sites for the other 26, however, and if any hon. Members in those areas are looking for a free ATM, they should please get in touch either with me or with HBOS, which I am sure will try to install them in any deserving area. This campaign has given a lot of pleasure when things go right, and it is pleasing to know that I am now having difficulty in pinpointing sites for the other ATMs from HBOS that are not too close to other free ATMs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.0/8">The first that I know of was put into a credit union by the Royal Bank of Scotland, and I want to see the idea being taken up by other credit unions, so that people who are paying money into a credit union do not have to take it there from a bank and perhaps run the risk of being mugged or attacked on the way. The bank was very helpful. Nationwide must also be congratulated on the work that it has done. HBOS started the red and green notices on the ATMs, but Nationwide took that a step further. It did a lot of work on the red and green stickers, which show which ATMs are free to use and which involve paying a fee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.0/9">I hope that the Treasury Select Committee, the Government and hon. Members on both sides of the House will take note of this project. I believe that there is a case for taking it forward, particularly in rural areas, where people have been short-changed&mdash;no pun intended&mdash;by the banks. I do not live in a rural area, but I am quite happy to lend any assistance that hon. Members might require to contact the right people. This is certainly something that we, as Members of Parliament, should be doing to help our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.0/10">I want to mention the communications allowance that has been given to Members of Parliament. I know that some Opposition Members did not think that it was a great idea, but let me tell them, it will allow me to contact every one of my constituents. I am going to do that this summer by putting out a questionnaire to ask them what they want and what they think are the most important issues. I, as their Member of Parliament, can then address the matters that they think are important. I can then go back to them and they will be able to tell me whether I have done my job or not. Come the next general election, whenever it might be, they will have the opportunity either to vote for me or to replace me, but at least I will not have had to say that I did not have the opportunity to contact them and to let them know what I was doing, or that they could not contact me to tell me about their issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.0/11">I want to talk about the draft legislative programme and the Queen's Speech. I have tried twice already&mdash;and I shall keep trying until I succeed&mdash;to introduce a Bill on employment retention and rehabilitation leave. People who become disabled or whose disability gets worse while they are in employment and who want to remain in employment should be given the opportunity to do so while being supported not only by the company but by the Government. They should be enabled to get back into work where they can pay their taxes, which will give money to the Treasury, and give valuable work to their employer, to whom they might feel that they owe something for having looked after them. I hope that hon. Members will support that measure when it comes back.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.0/12">I want briefly to mention yesterday's announcement about the ships to be built in Scotstoun in my constituency, which has secured the employment of 2,000 workers. I also want to reiterate my point to the Secretary of State that I am still looking for the seventh and eighth Type 45 destroyers, and I certainly want to take part in the debate on defence procurement on the second day after we come back from the recess, to talk about what we are going to do with the MARS&mdash;military afloat research and sustainability&mdash;ships and to ensure that shipbuilding in the United Kingdom is up and running and will continue for quite a few years to come.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1126.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1659" speakername="Ann Cryer" colnum="1126"  time="016:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0015.htm#07072638000970">
	<p pid="a.1126.0/1">I agree with comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2022" name="Dai Davies">the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies)</phrase> about proper workplace apprenticeships for the most basic skills that we need in our engineering industry. Those skills are lacking at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/2">I will gallop through my speech to give other hon. Members time to contribute. I will raise my concerns about the conduct of the local election that took place in my constituency on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-03">3 May</phrase>. I do not think that I can do any better than to start by quoting early-day motion 1435 in my name. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/3" class="indent">&quot;That this House congratulates the individuals and organisations, secular and religious, who have over many years worked assiduously towards community cohesion and integration in Keighley; but condemns in the strongest terms the behaviour of certain Keighley Conservatives who, under the direction of their candidate Zafar Ali, used the tactics of intimidation, treating and discriminatory propaganda to secure electoral victory in Keighley Central ward on 3rd May 2007; further condemns the failure of officers of Bradford Metropolitan District Council to take action against such activities; expresses the hope that no authority in future will allow such activity to take place; and urges the Government to review electoral law as it applies in these circumstances with a view to tightening up regulations and providing for sanctions in future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/4">A number of factors on that day caused considerable concern to me and others. Although an understanding of electoral law is not the most exciting of subjects, unless our council officers, presiding officers or the police are trained in electoral law, how can we ever hope to protect our democracy? The assistant returning officer in Bradford argued that treating was not an offence and stated that, as long as the cost of the food and drink that is offered to voters on election day is included in the election returns, it is not illegal. That is absurd.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/5">Worryingly, the confusion goes beyond the returning officer. In dealing with allegations of treating, West Yorkshire police, in a recent e-mail to my office, took the view that reference should be made to</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/6" class="indent">&quot;the Election commission document 'Guidance on fraud prevention and detection for use at May 2007 elections in England and Wales'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/7">The e-mail continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/8" class="indent">&quot;a protocol between ACPO and the commission describes the role of both organisations in such an instance. The Police should not independently investigate matters pertaining to expenses. This is the commission's responsibility. If they consider there are grounds for further investigation the enquiry is passed to the relevant Police force.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/9">However, in dealing with the same allegation, the Electoral Commission states its position as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Looking into allegations of 'treating' is a matter which falls beyond the remit of the Commission.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/11">The sad reality is that, when the returning officer, the police and the Electoral Commission all take the view that they are not responsible, nothing is done&mdash;and nor will it be. Treating is a crime and if the perpetrators are allowed to get away with it, I am afraid that the practice will continue and possibly be accepted as the norm, eventually becoming decriminalised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/12">Similarly, confusion regarding responsibility between the police and the electoral services in Bradford was highlighted by the issue of the use of discriminatory language. Over the public address system&mdash;used only in areas inhabited predominantly by the Asian community&mdash;those acting for the Conservative candidate, Zafar Ali, called for people to &quot;vote for their Muslim brother&quot;. My constituents were told that that was their religious duty. When that was reported to both the electoral services and the police, they each said that it was a matter for the other. Again, the result was that nothing was done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/13">Intimidating crowds stood outside polling stations discouraging people from entering to vote. Again, contemporaneous complaints to both the police and the electoral services resulted in each insisting that responsibility rested with the other. Again, the net result was that intimidation was allowed to continue unchallenged.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/14">Much worse is the fact that, recently, people with no party affiliation whatsoever came to my office to tell me that they had been visited by Zafar Ali and told by him not to mention to the police the fact that he did indeed ask them to &quot;vote for their Muslim brother.&quot; I have had to guarantee their anonymity because they fear violent repercussions for them and their family should their identity be known. Clearly, the breaking of ranks is feared more than the weight of the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/15">I was also recently visited by a member of the clergy in my constituency who told me that the Conservative parliamentary candidate in Keighley was concerned by the fact that he was having to work with &quot;unsavoury characters in the Asian community.&quot; Indeed, for once, I agree with him. Of the main supporters of the Conservative candidate in Keighley Central in May, one has been investigated for money laundering and another declared bankrupt on at least two occasions. They are the small minority, but they are running the show.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/16">To add to this shady political cocktail, there was a recent announcement by the local organiser of the British National party in support of the Conservative candidate at the next general election. The announcement said that the BNP would not field a candidate. This coalition of the extremists may appear to be a strange alliance, and it certainly is. The relationship between extremists&mdash;they need to feed off each other in order to survive&mdash;is not new. However, it is the first time that we have seen it in Keighley and the first time that it has, through electoral manipulation, threatened our electoral system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/17">I do not fear elections; I thrive on them. Nor do I fear losing. I am prepared to accept the views of the electorate when they are allowed to express them freely and within the law. However, I am not prepared passively to stand by and allow extremists, from wherever they hail, to take advantage of our elections and get away with clear infringements of the law. I do not believe that the type of incidents witnessed in Keighley on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-03">3 May</phrase> are confined to Keighley. Similar allegations have arisen across the country. However, the situation can never be challenged when our authorities are untrained and unprepared on questions of electoral law and, more importantly, unwilling to act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/18">As a society, are we prepared to accept the blurring of the lines and allow inappropriate practices to become the norm? Are we prepared passively to allow a misguided minority, hell-bent on victory whatever the cost, to rule? At the heart of British society is a sense of decency, tolerance and compromise. The fairness of our legal system inspires confidence, here and abroad. It is naive to believe that everyone will simply act according to the spirit of the laws, and there can be nothing more naive than to think that turning a blind eye or passing the buck will solve the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/19">Postal voting can be&mdash;and is, for most people&mdash;a real asset, but there have been irregularities. The answer in the Bradford district, which includes my constituency, was for candidates and agents to sign up to a voluntary code of conduct, based on an assumption of decency and honesty. It never seemed to cross the mind of the police and officials that it might be ignored, and neither group made any preparation to deal with the law-breakers. We must accommodate the desire for easy access to the polls, but we must balance that with the real threat of prosecution when there is any infringement of the law. Realistically, we can only hope to reach that stage when there is a coherent and clear line of responsibility, supported by the will to act. I have not finished my speech, but given your request, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I will bring my remarks to a close.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1136.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="1136"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0016.htm#07072638000978">
	<p pid="a.1136.0/1">I start by saying how pleasing it is to see my hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House, a fellow Durham MP, on the Front Bench to answer this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/2">I would like to concentrate on an issue in my constituency that I have already raised in an Adjournment debate, which concerns View Lane park in Stanley and the absolute scandal of Derwentside district council selling more than half of the park to a development company called Mistal Homes, for a centre for the treatment of adults with autism. The company made an unsolicited bid to the council to buy more than half of the park. The bid was fiercely objected to by local residents, who value the green lung in their town centre. Despite that the council steamrollered ahead, as has become all too commonplace, and not only gave Mistal Homes planning permission, but sold it half the park. It did that even though the district council has no responsibility whatever for the provision of autism services or adult services; that is the function of the county council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/3">When the council took that decision, it did not look at the track record of the company. In fact, it had no track record, because it was registered at Companies House only in January 2006. Nor did it take a close look at the directors of the company, including a Mr. Hampshire, who declared to Companies House that he was a director of no other companies apart from Mistal. In fact, he is also a director of several other companies, one of which, Chartnell Ltd, is late in filing its accounts and Companies House has proposed that it be struck off. A post in the <i> London Gazette</i> last September suggested that the company in question was going to be wound up under the terms of the Insolvency Act 1986.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/4">I raised my concerns and those of angry local residents with the Audit Commission earlier this year. I wrote to the commission on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February 2007</phrase>. Alas, I did not get a reply until <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-04">4 July</phrase>, as a result of a follow-up letter to the chief executive. I finally got a letter on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-10">10 July</phrase> from Paul Heppell, who described himself as the audit manager. He said in his letter that he had noted my</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/5" class="indent">&quot;concern about 'the adequacy of assurances gained by the Council over the potential buyer of the land'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/6">He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/7" class="indent">&quot;My understanding of the position is that the Council is not proposing to be involved in an ongoing contractual relationship or joint delivery of services with the developer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/8">Well, that is what I thought until a few weeks ago, when the leader of Derwentside district council, Mr. Alex Watson, and its chief executive, Mr. Mike Clark, had a meeting with the chief executive and the leader of Durham county council to ask the county council to procure 20 beds over a five-year contract for Mistal homes at the autism centre, even though the district council has no responsibility for the procurement of adult services. Quite rightly, the leader of Durham county council, Mr. Albert Nugent, and the chief executive, Mr. Mark Lloyd, were not going to be strong-armed by this approach. They wrote back to stress that the commissioning of services by the county council was done on an individual basis and that they could give no block contracts to the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/9">This worries me. What on earth are the leader and the chief executive of a district council that has no responsibility in this area doing trying to procure business for a private company, Mistal Homes, which has no track record of delivering this type of service? I shall write to the Audit Commission again to ask about this matter, as there are some very serious concerns surrounding the entire deal. Who approached whom in the first place? What is the relationship between certain individuals on Derwentside district council and Mistal Homes? Mr. Heppell's letter goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/10" class="indent">&quot;In common with other sales of land, officers took the view that the track record and financial status of the developer or individual Directors was not relevant to the sale itself.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/11">If the council is now going round touting for business for this company, what is that relationship?</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/12">Mr. Heppell is clearly not doing his homework. Part of the so-called deal relating to the sale of this land involved the reinvesting of a proportion of the capital sale of the park into improving the remaining park area. People ask whether that is really a concern. Well, yes it is. I raised this matter in an Adjournment debate recently. Derwentside district council has made no attempt to apply for lottery funding for improving the rest of the park, so it is relying on the success of this development for the improvement of this vital remaining piece of green space in Stanley.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/13">There are some disturbing unanswered questions here. If the leader and chief executive of a council are touting for business for a private company, I want a full investigation into the matter. If that is not carried out by the Audit Commission&mdash;to which I shall write again, because I do not accept that it has carried out a full investigation&mdash;I shall refer the matter to the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/14">This week, I was pleased to hear that Derwentside district council is to be abolished. That will be welcomed by many of my constituents. I am concerned, however, that the dying days of the council will lead to more shoddy deals like this, to fire sales of land, or to commitments with private companies, which will hamper the new unitary council's ability to make certain commitments. The Audit Commission and the Minister need urgently to ensure that no further dodgy deals like that are entered into in the next few months during the dying days of Derwentside district council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/15">I have welcomed the formation of a unitary council for Durham. Indeed, I think that it is long overdue and it will certainly abolish Derwentside district council and others that are, frankly, pathetic for having delivered such a poor service to my constituents for so many years. As I have suggested, that council has done things that are highly questionable, if not verging on illegal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/16">Durham now has an opportunity to have a dynamic and strategic new county council&mdash;not the existing one, but a new one. I understand that it will be painful for the 249 councillors to be abolished in the process, but it will lead to better governance in county Durham. In looking forward to the new county council, we should reflect on how best to promote the county and ensure that developments in former mining communities&mdash;across my constituency and that of my hon. Friend the Deputy Leader of the House&mdash;are pressed forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/17">I would urge the Liberal Democrat council in the City of Durham, which is threatening judicial review, not to waste a single penny more of taxpayers' money on attempting to challenge the decision. My understanding is that there is no legal case whatever, so going ahead would be a scandal. I suspect that Durham taxpayers would never forgive the Liberal Democrats; they would quite rightly be very angry about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/18">The decision to move towards a unitary council is part of a broader agenda, which includes the abolition of the regional assembly. Once again, I believe that that is long overdue. Regional issues about transport are important; and the new Select Committees announced by the Government&mdash;and designed to scrutinise what happens in the regions&mdash;are quite exciting. I believe that those new Select Committees will need to have teeth. They will need to hold to account not just the regional development agency, but organisations such as the Environment Agency and the strategic health authority. They should help to ensure that local people have a clearer understanding of how those organisations work, while also providing a key role for parliamentarians in this place to scrutinise the quango state of the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.0/19">To conclude, I wish you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and right hon. and hon. Members a successful and enjoyable recess. Speaking as a member of the north-east tourism board, it would be remiss of me not to say that if people wish to visit the north-east, there are great attractions in Northumberland, Durham, Teesside and Newcastle. No one coming to North Durham should miss the Beamish open air museum, in which the constituency takes such pride, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> has the fantastic attraction of the Durham cathedral.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-07-26a.1138.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" speakername="Julia Goldsworthy" colnum="1138"  time="016:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070726/debtext/70726-0017.htm#07072642000194">
	<p pid="a.1138.0/1">I was not intending to touch on the issue of the local government review, but following <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase>, I shall do so. My part of the world is also going to see a new council. I greatly share the hon. Gentlemen's concern that in the transition period, the assets of previous councils will need to be monitored very carefully so that they are not disposed of in a way that undermines the set-up of the new council. There will need to be greater devolution and a drawing down of powers from central Government to the new authority&mdash;an issue that Members in the Cornwall area will closely monitor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/2">It has been a very interesting debate. I shall touch on a couple of issues raised by other hon. Members. I believe that both <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">the hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase> referred to access to banking.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/3">It struck me that one of the key ways for people to gain access to free banking is through their local post office. A number of banks allow their account holders to withdraw cash free of charge from the local post office. It is important to put on record how important that service can be, particularly in rural areas. When the House returns after the recess, perhaps we should look into encouraging all banks to provide that service and support the post office in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2022" name="Dai Davies">The hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies)</phrase> raised the issue of Remploy&mdash;its factory in my constituency is being proposed for closure. It is important that services for people with disabilities reflect the 21st century. I share the hon. Gentleman's concern that a number of people who have been employed by Remploy for a very long period have almost become institutionalised. It will be difficult for them to adjust to a new setting. In addition, Cornwall is very isolated, and people who may end up being based at another Remploy factory may have to travel greater distances. The needs of those vulnerable people must not be forgotten in the consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/5">I wish to raise a constituency issue that is causing considerable concern: the proposed changes to fire cover across Cornwall, and particularly the proposal to downgrade two fire stations in my constituency, Falmouth fire station and Camborne fire station, which are the only two fire stations in Cornwall that provide 24-hour whole-time cover. Downgrading those stations to whole-time day cover only would mean that, across Cornwall, there would only be a retained service on offer at night.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/6">To provide some background for those who are not familiar with Cornwall's geography, the fire authority is within the county council, but that covers an area of 3,500 sq km, and has only one neighbouring authority&mdash;the rest of it is surrounded by sea. In the vast majority of cases, it cannot rely on help and assistance from other authorities, so it must be self-contained. The authority has a total of 31 stations, 20 of which are entirely retained, five of which are day-crewed&mdash;precisely because of difficulties recruiting retained staff, as many people are self-employed and must travel all over the county, and hence cannot respond in time&mdash;and two of which are the 24-hour whole-time cover stations in Falmouth and Camborne.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/7">Those two stations cover the most densely populated part of Cornwall. Camborne has a population of about 50,000 people and will grow further, and that was not taken into account when the proposals were put forward. Falmouth fire station not only has responsibilities to the town and surrounding area but to the docks and further out to sea, if there are problems there. In addition, both stations have specialist equipment that has been used to provide assistance all over Cornwall, for instance in the flooding at Boscastle. When there were blizzards on Goss moor, and people were stranded, that equipment was used to help. The stations are therefore not just an asset to their immediate community but provide an invaluable service to the rest of Cornwall, yet they are under threat of being downgraded under proposals currently being considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/8">I want the Deputy Leader of the House to take back for consideration by the relevant Ministers the issue of how this situation transpired and what the Government can do to assist. Ultimately, it has transpired because Cornwall's local government has one of the lowest levels of funding in the country. As with other areas, Government grants have not kept pace with the cost of service delivery. As a result, there is an overall deficit of &pound;15 million to be overcome. There is also the capping on council tax&mdash;the regressive council tax would not address the problem even if the Government tried.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/9">Consequently, we are seeing cuts to a whole range of services. Adult social care has had no choice but to withdraw support for those with the lowest levels of need. The fire service is facing cuts of &pound;1 million in costs&mdash;the equivalent of a cut of one sixth of the whole-time work force. Although that will be achieved without compulsory redundancies, it has significant implications for the cover across Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/10">The Government's nationally set targets conflict with what the fire authority is trying to achieve. According to the first public service agreement, the authority is required to reduce accidental fire-related deaths in the home by 10 per cent. and deliberate fires by 20 per cent. by 2010. The fire authority has already done a lot to reduce such occurrences, by providing a greater retained service, which it was asked to do, and by doing more school visits and so on. Therefore, it is already delivering. At the same time, however, there is a requirement to find efficiency savings totalling &pound;105 million by 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/11">The problem is that, because the authority delivered efficiency savings and because things were so tight ahead of that requirement, the only way that it is going to make those further efficiency savings is to make front-line cuts. I ask the Deputy Leader of the House to take that back to the relevant Department. When setting that efficiency target to pay for the pay deal for firefighters, what account did the Government take of authorities such as Cornwall that have already delivered efficiencies and whose only alternative therefore is to make front-line cuts? Are they happy that, in areas such as Cornwall where efficiencies have already been delivered, there will be virtually impossible challenges in delivering both those targets?</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/12">We are already seeing the results in Cornwall, particularly in the area that I represent, of the freeze in recruitment in previous years. The local newspaper called Camborne</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/13" class="indent">&quot;the arson capital of Cornwall&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/14">where there were</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/15" class="indent">&quot;218 attacks in the towns and their surrounding villages in the last 12 months, nearly a quarter of the 941 suspicious fires in the whole of Cornwall.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/16">At the very time when arson appears to be increasing across the area, we are having to look at proposals to make cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/17">Serious questions have to be asked about the integrated risk management plan process, which had the task of trying to deliver those cuts to make the books balance. The response to a parliamentary question that I tabled stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/18" class="indent">&quot;Fire and Rescue Authorities (FRAs) are required by the Fire and Rescue Service National Framework to have in place and maintain an Integrated Risk Management Plan (IRMP) which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle effectively both existing and potential risks to communities.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-16">16 July 2007</phrase>; Vol. 463, c. 76W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/19">But that bears little relationship to the correspondence that I have had with the chief fire officer, who is clear that the reason behind looking at cuts and looking again at the IRMP was the financial situation, not the risks. Undoubtedly cuts to the number of staff and the level of cover will have an impact on the risk to people living in that community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/20">The council and the chief fire officer are trying to do the right thing in coming forward with the proposals. They have openly acknowledged that those proposals are the least worst option, not the best option, and the chief fire officer himself said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/21" class="indent">&quot;I had to recommend this objective because I had to make savings. The downgrading of Falmouth and Camborne is purely a consequence of the budget&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/22">Therefore, the people of Falmouth and Camborne are being asked to meet the brunt of the so-called cost-effectiveness drive, knowing that it will result in longer call-out times and that there will be knock-on effects across the county. The county council has agreed to look at that again and to undertake a risk assessment. I cannot believe that it was not required to do one in the first place. Will the Minister go back to the Department and say that there are serious pressures?</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.0/23">As a constituent wrote to me recently, people in Cornwall are not asking for fire services that are better than anywhere else in the country. We just think that we deserve the same level of fire service as the rest of the country. We do not want lives to be threatened because we have become the only county in the whole of England that has no whole-time fire cover at night.</p>

	<p pid="a.1143.0/1">I will not give way, if the hon. Gentleman does not mind, because it would not be fair to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker&mdash;and I am your friend&mdash;or to others who wish to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.1143.0/2">The hon. Gentleman might also wish to intervene on the final issue that I wish to raise, which relates to the welfare of our ex-servicemen and women. I have one particular constituent, Dennis Dimond, who is a former leader of the Conservative group on Thurrock borough council and a former officer of the Essex regiment, whom I consult regularly about such matters. We are especially exercised about those people who have left our armed forces, some of them many years ago and who are now in the evening of their lives and becoming fragile. They are not getting everything that they are entitled to and I invite the Deputy Leader of the House to ask ministerial colleagues to prepare, over the parliamentary recess, a comprehensive statement of care available for ex-service personnel, perhaps through a White Paper, Green Paper or other formal statement. In that way, we could take stock of the care available for our ex-service personnel. I am especially concerned about people who are wounded or suffer trauma, or both, in the current conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and other places in which our armed forces are committed&mdash;sometimes, of necessity, in a secret manner. Many of us are not satisfied that when they are discharged appropriate care and facilities are available at the time or will be sustained in the long term. Trauma or mental illness can arise much later and we need reassurance that the nation's commitment to ex-service personnel is comprehensive and that care will be ongoing. We need to understand how we as Members can assist and counsel such people, working with veterans organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1143.0/3">This morning, I received a letter from a parliamentary colleague, Eddie Lowey, a member of the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man. He has no access to this place, but on behalf of his constituents he wanted me to raise the case of an Isle of Man resident who served on Christmas Island between 1958 and 1959 and was involved in the atomic tests. A further 10 residents of the Isle of Man are in the same category, as are many of our constituents who served on Christmas Island at the same time. There is growing and compelling evidence that they were adversely affected by the atomic testing. Members who are listening to me will share the view that when the Ministry of Defence says, &quot;Oh, it's really not a problem and we're monitoring it&quot;, that is not good enough. We heard the same thing about Gulf war syndrome.</p>
	<p pid="a.1143.0/4">I asked the Library to do some work on the subject, and my attention was drawn to a parliamentary question diligently raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">our colleague, the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase>, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-12">12 July</phrase>. He asked the Ministry of Defence to comment on the EU directive Euratom 96/29. The gentleman in the Isle of Man says that the directive requires the UK to have a national register of all persons who may have been exposed to ionizing radiation in the past, especially in relation to atomic weapons experiments in the 1950s. He notes that the directive states that such people should be independently examined for genetic damage by the calculation of the number of aberrant cells shown by translocation within their chromosomes, that cytogenetic assays, such as the eBand or mFish may be carried out by molecular geneticists and that there should be ongoing screening. Many former servicemen feel that their immune systems were irreparably damaged by exposure all those years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.1143.0/5">In reply to our colleague, the hon. Member for Forest of Dean, the Minister said that the directive was not &quot;legally binding&quot;. Well, whether it is or not there is a moral obligation and although the Minister acknowledged that the Government recognise their obligations to such veterans, he went on to make the worrying statement that they had found</p>
	<p pid="a.1143.0/6" class="indent">&quot;no general effect on the participants' expectation of life nor on risk of developing most cancers, though there was a small increase in risk of some leukaemias&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-12">12 July 2007</phrase>; Vol. 462, c. 1599W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1143.0/7">We have heard such denials all too often in the past. It is not good enough, so I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House will tell the Ministry of Defence that over the coming months Members will increasingly demand that the issues are addressed on behalf of the people who suffered as a result of those experiments in the 1950s. A remedy should be found soon, rather than having a big row in the House of Commons in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1144.0/1">It is always a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase>. I thought that he was going to wind up a little earlier and I was thinking that I might follow your strictures, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and rush over and embrace him, but he took all his time so I will not, you will be glad to know. I want to raise two issues concerning my constituency. As I am a Gloucestershire Member, the House will not be surprised to hear that I shall be raising the issue of flooding. I shall also raise the issue of ambulance cover.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/2">I undertook a comprehensive tour of my constituency on Monday and Tuesday, and unfortunately I found that the flooding there was far more widespread than I had anticipated. I am keen to stress that, despite the high-profile news coverage of Tewkesbury and Gloucester, my constituency suffered quite considerably as well, to the tune of several hundred houses being flooded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/3">Perhaps I might acquaint the House with some of what I discovered on Monday and Tuesday. I started my tour at a small village near Lechlade in the south-west of my constituency, and I drove through rather a deeper flood than I should perhaps have done. I donned my wellies, rushed into a house&mdash;the water immediately went over the top of my wellies&mdash;and found a poor person whose furniture and carpets had been ruined. I then went on to Fairford, and even more dismayingly I found a road of houses that were under 2 ft of a mixture of sewage and water. The main bridge in Fairford had fractured and the main road was closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/4">I went on to Bourton-on-the-Water&mdash;wryly called by one resident Bourton-under-the-water&mdash;and found, as many people may be able to picture Bourton-under-the-water, the picturesque village, the rivers, the bridges, the greens and the high street entirely under water, which had spilled over into many shops and houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/5">Perhaps the biggest shock was when I went on to Moreton-in-Marsh, where I found that 250 people had been evacuated last Friday night to the fire college, their homes having been rendered unfit for habitation. I discovered that more than half the shops had been flooded, many of the houses near the station had been flooded, and many of the hostelries will not be open for many months.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/6">I went on to the pretty town of Chipping Campden, where the Cambrook had burst its banks and many houses had been flooded. Likewise in Northleach the main culvert under the main high street had closed, and there a problem re-occurred that I had heard about in several other places. A road had been flooded and HGVs and cars trying to get through the flood, driving far too fast, were causing bow waves and causing even worse flooding into the houses&mdash;until a public-spirited local resident put his car across the road, effectively closing it. Even the main road into my own village was washed away.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/7">Repairing the infrastructure will be expensive and time-consuming, and because it is spread over a very large area of the Cotswolds it will be expensive. I therefore issue this plea to the county council: that we in the Cotswolds should get our fair share of funding. I know that the high-profile cases of Tewkesbury and Gloucester will cause vast strain on both the county council's and the Government's budgets, but we are going to need some resources in the Cotswolds, not only to restore the infrastructure but to pay for emergency things such as the simple provision of Portaloos, sandbags and pumping equipment. There will need to be a substantial clean-up. I pay great tribute to the Cotswold district council for immediately swinging into action and providing a free collection service for ruined furniture and carpets. That was hugely appreciated by people on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/8">Some of the flooding had been caused by the Environment Agency's policy of clearing out watercourses only on a biennial basis, on the grounds that to do so encourages biodiversity. That will need to be looked at again rigorously, because if it causes any possibility of flooding homes it is totally wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/9">I have mentioned the problem of sewer flooding. I had had a problem of sewer flooding in various places in the Cotswolds before this general flooding of water. Fortunately, I was able to persuade one of my two water companies, Thames Water, to advance a &pound;5 million sewerage scheme in South Cerney, which did help this time, but there are many smaller instances of sewer flooding which will need attention. I call on the Deputy Leader of the House to bring the matter to the attention of the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, because the regulatory regime needs looking at to ensure that water companies have sufficient ability to invest in the infrastructure from their profits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/10">I should also like to bring to the attention of the House a matter about which I received another e-mail from a constituent this morning. The flooding of the Mythe waterworks, which was raised in Prime Minister's questions yesterday, resulted in the cutting off of the fresh water supply to 340,000 people, which is being attended to by the provision of bowsers. It was widely advertised on BBC Radio Gloucester and on the website that a bowser would be available for the villagers of Birdlip in my constituency. There is, or was, no such bowser in that village. The villages have no fresh water and no bowser from which to get it. I urge Severn Trent Water urgently to attend to the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/11">Like many other Members of the House, I cannot express high enough praise for the emergency services, particularly the fire service, that worked throughout Friday night to pump out a vast number of houses. The community spirit that I found when I was going round on Monday and Tuesday was absolutely tremendous, but the problem is that that community spirit will give way in some cases to depression when the true extent of the damage sinks in. I urge all the social services and other support services to be in place when that happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/12">The second issue that I would like to raise is the provision of ambulance cover in my constituency. The chief executive of the newly merged Great Western Ambulance Service NHS trust said to me in a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-04">4 July</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/13" class="indent">&quot;rurally based resources have been pooled in to urban areas to cover higher density activity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/14">Ambulances are being taken away from rural areas and are being put into towns. In fact, that has already caused the loss of one life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/15">As it has been in the press, I would like to bring to the attention of the House the tragic case of a young lady, Rebecca Wedd. She was hit by a car just outside Cirencester, but the ambulance service took 45 minutes to attend to her. The incident was totally unacceptable and it occurred not in a rural village but near the Royal Agricultural college just outside Cirencester, which is the largest town in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/16">I will run over the facts of this particular case. The only ambulance available in Cirencester was not available that evening, because the entire crew had reported sick. At the beginning of the evening, there were five crews in Staverton and, when the ambulance service knew that no ambulance was available in Cirencester, I would have thought that it would have immediately deployed one of those crews to cover Cirencester, particularly when an event with 700 people was taking place there. There had been a serious incident at Tetbury further south in my constituency and three ambulances attended that. The Wiltshire air ambulance was also deployed, but it was delayed and did not reach the scene on time. However, most tragically, an ambulance was available in Swindon, a mere 15 miles down the dual carriageway, and the most shocking fact of all is revealed in a letter from the chief executive of the trust. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Gloucestershire Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre did contact the Wiltshire Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre, and ask for assistance&mdash;but this was declined.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/18">A young lady tragically died because of that, and ongoing investigations are being carried out to discover what happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/19">Sadly, that is not the only case. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-23">23 January</phrase> this year, Evan Bailey, a 12-year-old boy from Coates, a small village a mere 3 miles from Cirencester, had his first ever asthma attack. Let us all imagine the panic of that small boy and his parents, Christopher and Rosemary, as he underwent that new and frightening experience. Mrs. Bailey estimates that the ambulance was called at 10.15, but did not arrive until well over half an hour later at 10.50. He was subsequently moved to Gloucester hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/20">I am aware of those two examples of response times failing to live up to targets, but how many other constituents have had their lives put at risk? Despite assurances from the chief executive of the trust, I am not convinced that trust targets are being met even in the most urban parts of my constituency, let alone in the many far-flung villages, hamlets and farms of the Cotswolds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/21">I raised the issue of the merger of the Gloucestershire ambulance trusts in Westminster Hall, and I said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/22" class="indent">&quot;If someone is lying beside the road, dying from a motor accident...the one thing that that person wants is a quick ambulance response. The merger will inevitably slow down that response.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/23">I went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/24" class="indent">&quot;If they do not have a proper ambulance service when they need it, they will die. There is no question about that. We must be sure that the merger will work; otherwise, we are putting people's lives at risk.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-09">9 February 2005</phrase>; Vol. 430, c. 442-44WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.0/25">I take no pleasure at all in saying that that prophecy sadly came true and I ask the ambulance trust to see what it can do to prevent it from ever happening again.</p>

	<p pid="a.1155.3/1">For the second time, I present a petition about a matter that I raised during the debate on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the Adjournment. My friend the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> also raised it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1475" name="Shailesh Vara">The hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire (Mr. Vara)</phrase> warmly recognised that it was an important issue, and the Parliamentary Secretary referred to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1155.3/2">I last did this job on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-18">18 May</phrase>, just before the implementation of the decision by the then Secretary of State for Health to close the 24-hour emergency clinic at the Maudsley hospital. The service was retained for longer than originally planned because of concerns and inadequate alternatives. The Government responded to initial pressure by putting much more money into King's College hospital. However, although the service has been transferred, it does not fulfil the community's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1155.3/3">I therefore have many more signatures from people who are residents of the London boroughs of Southwark, Lambeth, Croydon, Lewisham and others.</p>

	<p pid="a.1155.3/7" class="indent">The Petitioners further declare their anxiety that new replacement facilities at King's College Hospital will not be ready for a further 18 months and that even then they may not constitute an adequate replacement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1155.3/8" class="indent">The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urge the Secretary of State for Health to postpone the full closure of the 24 hour emergency mental health clinic until the incoming Prime Minister and Health Ministers have an opportunity to review the situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1161.0/1">The traditional congratulations are due to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is enormously important and timely. One would never have imagined that an Adjournment debate on flooding would follow the summer recess debate. That shows how pertinent the debate is. I assure him that the Government have not forgotten the June floods. Indeed, immediately before this debate, I attended a ministerial meeting on flood recovery following the June floods, and ministerial visits have been made this week to find out the situation for ourselves. I ask him to take that message back.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/2">I will answer the specific points on Leeds, because that is what will be of most value to my hon. Friend in the time that I have available, but briefly to answer his questions on the insurance companies, I and ministerial colleagues met the Association of British Insurers two weeks ago to discuss that point and to reinforce the message that he and others have passed on. The Leader of the House announced arrangements for Members of Parliament with concerns to get in touch during the recess, and a letter will be sent to him from the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. The press statement that was issued after the meeting gave a full account of the points agreed at the meeting, where the statement of principles was reinforced and the assurances that were sought were given.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/3">On drainage co-ordination, my hon. Friend kindly made the point that it has already been announced that that is a matter for the review. It is also fundamental, core business for my Department. Irrespective of the recent floods, that is an area of huge policy attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/4">On my hon. Friend's specific point about the authorities' response, I concur that no civil resilience planning can substitute for the resilience of the public. It does not work without them and without individual acts of initiative and of people taking responsibility. However, the fact that the response this time was much better than three years ago is a tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> and the former Deputy Prime Minister <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1646" name="John Prescott">my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)</phrase>, who put into place the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 precisely to ensure that, at local level, there is co-ordination under a single command and control structure&mdash;the gold command. I suspect that the better responses that my hon. Friend has had reflect that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/5">We are aware of the problems in Leeds generally and of the Wyke beck situation in my hon. Friend's constituency. I am advised that there have been five flooding events in the past seven years, three of which were especially serious and affected up to 70 properties. The Environment Agency is undertaking a study using previous flood studies and hydraulic models to identify detailed flood risk areas and the constraints within the river channel. Some 20 possible options for flood alleviation have been identified, based on site visits, past flood events, flood studies and discussions with Leeds city council and Yorkshire Water. The Environment Agency will assess the options and evaluate their impact on reducing flood risk. That work will be completed in around three weeks' time. The next stage will be to assess the costs and financial benefits of the options, together with identifying any environmental improvements. It is likely that that element of work will be contracted to consulting engineers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/6">We have also been asked, through the agency, to assess whether a footbridge is causing a constriction to the river flow at the Dunhill Rise estate. A river gauge has been installed to provide a flood warning service based on empirical evidence. It will be available for operation in September 2007. As my hon. Friend will know, a flood warden network has also been established.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/7">In terms of future development, there is the Leeds plan, and my hon. Friend mentioned the reinstatement by the agency of the money. The time factors are in part dependent on, and a function of, the funds available, but I assure my hon. Friend that we weigh the risk factors, including the population and economic importance of Leeds, in deciding such matters. I hope that he can take reassurance from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/8">I hope that I can convince the House of the truth that it is entirely a coincidence that the pilot project money for resilience has been made available at the same time as my hon. Friend's Adjournment debate. The fact is that the robustness of the bid made it clear that it should be successful and I was simply acting on recommendations from experts and officials. I am grateful nevertheless for my hon. Friend's thanks. I hope that I have answered my hon. Friend's specific questions and given him some good news to take back up the M1, or on GNER, if he is looking after his carbon footprint.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/9">The next major policy initiative in the area, which current events will feed into but which was happening anyway, is the thorough review of the flood risk management policy in the cross-Government &quot;Making space for water&quot; strategy. That looks at the issue in the round, including risk from all forms of flooding, such as rivers, sea, ground water, surface run-off and sewers. We are looking at a broad range of management measures and aiming to improve management of the risk nationally by giving the agency a strategic overview of all forms of flooding in close partnership with local authorities, the water companies and others. We have already announced the detailed form that that new role will take on the coast and we have invited initial views on the situation inland. The responsibilities and co-ordination concerning urban drainage are complex. Water and sewerage companies plan for future demands on the public sewerage network, and Ofwat has been working with them to develop 25-year sewerage supply and demand plans that will take account of our climate change expectations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/10">The Government have significantly increased funding, from &pound;600 million to &pound;800 million for the next spending review period&mdash;a considerable increase on earlier capital budgets. I emphasise again that the reduction forced on the Environment Agency owing to pressures in the financial year was on recurrent expenditure, not capital expenditure. However, my experience of the exceptional circumstances of the past few weeks suggests that no amount of funding could have prevented the disasters we have seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/11">I send my good wishes to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to the House and, especially, to the victims of flooding in my hon. Friend's constituency and throughout the country. I assure them that the Government will not take their eye off the ball during the recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/12" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1161.0/13" class="italic"> Adjourned accordingly at half-past Six o'clock till <phrase class="date" code="">Monday 8 October</phrase>, pursuant to Resolution [<phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May</phrase>].</p>
