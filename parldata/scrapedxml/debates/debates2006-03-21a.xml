<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21a.155.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" speakername="Jack Straw" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs"  colnum="155"  time="015:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/debtext/60321-06.htm#60321-06_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.155.1/1">With permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I should like to make a statement in respect of today's publication of the first-ever comprehensive guide to the Government's support for British nationals in difficulty abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/2">It is obviously traumatic to be caught up in any emergency, to fall victim to crime or to have to go to hospital in an emergency. When that happens abroad, it can be worse still for those involved, who might be far from friends and family and unfamiliar with the local language, laws and procedures. It has therefore long been a central task of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to assist British nationals who get into difficulty while travelling or living overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/3">Demand for such support has never been greater. People from the United Kingdom now make more than 65 million overseas trips a year&mdash;three times as many as 20 years ago&mdash;and a greater proportion of them are travelling independently and to more distant and sometimes more dangerous destinations. Meanwhile, some 13 million British nationals live overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/4">Our travel advice covers 217 countries and territories and the website receives nearly 5 million hits a year. Our consular staff now deal with nearly 3.5 million inquiries a year, including from the 860,000 people who visit our consulates in person, and we help around 85,000 people a year in need of more acute assistance. For example, last year, we supported 4,200 British nationals in hospital abroad, helped the families of 3,900 people who died overseas and dealt with the detention of 6,000 British nationals. Last year, we also assisted nationals affected by major crises, including the hurricanes in America and the Caribbean and the terrorist attacks in Egypt and Turkey, and we continue to provide support to the British victims of the tsunami and their families. In addition, we are the only western nation regularly to provide special consular services for Hajj pilgrims in Saudi Arabia.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/5">We have responded to the growing and changing demand through a programme of major improvements to the consular support that we offer British nationals. After the Bali bombings in October 2002, we set up consular rapid deployment teams, which are on stand-by to travel quickly to the scenes of major emergencies. Today we have twice as many trained consular staff on 24-hour stand-by for those teams as before the tsunami. In addition, we also have a new team based in Hong Kong that covers the Asian region and we will launch another in north America before the hurricane season this year. Our teams now include staff from the police and the Red Cross and medical personnel when they are needed. We have raised the quality of training for our consular staff and made crisis management training obligatory for all our heads of mission overseas. We have set up specialist teams in specific areas, such as forced marriages and child abductions, and recruited specialist advisers in family law and police and social work. We have expanded our 24-hour response centre in London and have new call-handling arrangements with the police to allow us to deal with a very high volume of calls in a crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/6">We are determined to keep improving the support that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office provides. To that end, in the summer of 2004, we asked the National Audit Office to review our consular operations. Its report was published in November last year and I have accepted in full its recommendations&mdash;indeed, many have already been implemented. In the report, the NAO noted that the UK</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/7" class="indent">&quot;has a reputation among other countries' foreign ministries as world leaders in consular crisis management&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/8">If we are to deliver consular assistance in the most effective and efficient manner possible, the public need to know what support the Foreign Office's staff overseas can provide to them in times of need, and, just as importantly, people need to be clear about what we cannot do. For example, we cannot get people out of jail and nor can we pay their hospital bills. Helping British travellers better to understand what support is available should encourage them to prepare thoroughly and minimise the risks that they take.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/9">It was for those reasons that in the manifesto for the last general election, the Government said that they would</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/10" class="indent">&quot;consult widely before publishing a comprehensive statement&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/11">on the support that they could offer British nationals in difficulty abroad. I launched the consultation process with a written statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">20 October</phrase> last year. My noble Friend Lord Triesman, the Foreign Office Minister with responsibility for the matter, hosted a major consultative event on <phrase class="date" code="">27 October</phrase> with representatives from the House, the travel industry, non-governmental organisations and consumer groups. The consultation period lasted until <phrase class="date" code="">30 November</phrase> and produced an overwhelmingly positive response. The result is the document that I am launching today.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/12">The fundamental responsibility in respect of the risks of travelling abroad must be met by travellers themselves through an appreciation of the risks and with comprehensive travel insurance that covers the loss of personal effects, medical care, accidents and criminal acts, and, if necessary, repatriation to the UK. The only alternative to the personal responsibility of the traveller is that the taxpayer should meet the cost, but since travel abroad is plainly a matter of choice, and those who do travel abroad tend to have more disposable income than many in this country, it cannot be right for the burden to fall on the taxpayer as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/13">However, since the atrocities of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, we have accepted that there may be circumstances so grave and exceptional that it is appropriate for the Government, from public funds, to provide exceptional assistance. The available assistance is set out on page 29 of the guide. When we trigger such assistance must be a matter of judgment at the time, and its potential availability should never be seen as a substitute for good insurance cover.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/14">Where there has been a major disaster and we have triggered an emergency package for victims abroad, there has often also been a need for comprehensive support for victims and/or their families on their return to the UK. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has very kindly taken the lead on this. For victims of the tsunami and their families, for example, we worked with the Red Cross to help those worst affected to gain access to financial support on their return.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/15">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made it clear that we must examine the question of financial support for those caught up in terrorist attacks overseas. At present, neither our domestic criminal injuries compensation scheme nor any other victim compensation scheme covers those killed or injured abroad. We are now considering a range of options in that respect, and we will make an announcement when we have concluded that consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/16">I have sent copies of the new guide to all hon. Members, and we will also send copies to all libraries and citizens advice bureaux across the UK and to our partners in the travel industry and other associated industries and bodies. We are producing a summary document in leaflet form, which will be available at airports and our travel agency partners. Information based on the guide is being sent out in the form of a checklist for travellers, which will be included with every one of the more than 5 million British passports that we issue each year. We will place the guide on our travel website, from which hard copies can also be ordered. We are also translating it into Welsh, Bengali, Punjabi, Urdu, Gujurati, Arabic and Chinese, and those versions will be available on our website or in hard copy on request.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/17">Within the Foreign Office, the new guide will provide our staff both overseas and in London with a clear statement of exactly what they can and should do for British nationals in difficulty, and it will therefore be an important tool for further improving the quality and consistency of support across our consular network. Next week, I shall launch an updated document setting out the Government's international strategic priorities for the next decade. For the first time, consular work will become a strategic priority in its own right, which means that every one of our heads of mission abroad will have personal responsibility for delivering support for British nationals in difficulty as set out in the new guide.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/18">Almost a year ago to the day, I made a statement to the House on our response to the tsunami in the Indian ocean. I was struck then by the tributes from both sides of the House on the work of our consular staff around the world. Our staff deal face to face and on a regular basis with the kind of traumatic situations that most people rarely have to confront over a lifetime, and I pay tribute to them again today. I am proud that the consular support that we give British nationals abroad is among the very best in the world. I am determined and confident that it will stay that way, and the new guide will be an important tool to that end.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.0/1">I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's welcome for the initiative and for the tribute that he paid to our staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/2">He asked whether we have learned lessons from previous emergencies overseas. I believe so, but I am not at all complacent. We all learned from an unsatisfactory performance in Bali. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> is in the Chamber, and I know that he had a tragic and personal experience of that. We must continue to learn lessons. As for a victims' compensation scheme, we are looking at the examples provided by France, Spain, Australia and the other countries mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase>. On the question of whether there is sufficient interdepartmental co-operation abroad, I have never, in fact, seen any problems affecting the co-operation between representatives of different Government Departments abroad. When they are abroad, they represent the British Government and, as I saw in the aftermath of the tsunami and several other disasters including the Istanbul bombings, they do not stand on departmental loyalties&mdash;they get down to business. A bigger issue is the co-ordination between British Government Departments once people return home, and the right hon. Gentleman asked why the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has responsibility for co-ordination. In the aftermath of <phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase> there was a need for a Department without parti pris to try to bring together other Departments. It was for that reason that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister invited the Departments of Health, Social Security and others to co-ordinate their work, and I think that that arrangement has worked rather well. I accept that it appears slightly eccentric, but there is method.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman asked whether necessary and proportionate steps have been taken to protect the security of our staff. Yes, I believe that we are taking such steps, and a very large amount of money has been spent on protecting staff. However, one can never guarantee staff security, as I saw on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-20">20 November 2003</phrase>. Moreover, we must ask our staff to take risks. I do not want reach the position in which some Governments have found themselves&mdash;their staff are in bunkers, unable to communicate with members of the public&mdash;and neither do our staff.</p>

The right hon. Gentleman kindly arranged for my constituent's mother, Yvonne Hart, and I to visit officials. He will remember that one of the most appalling aspects of the case was that Richard's body was not kept properly and, consequently, within days, it was not only unrecognisable but had deteriorated to such an extent that a proper investigation could not be conducted into the cause of death. Will he ensure that, in future, consul officials overseas have a standing instruction that, when British nationals are murdered, they should try to make sure that the body is properly maintained not only for investigation but identification purposes? Surely that is not an unrealistic expectation.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman has raised an important issue. There was a period, particularly during the cold war, when the most attractive posts were seen to be in the northern hemisphere, including those in America and the key posts in Europe, the Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc. Since I have been Foreign Secretary, post-<phrase class="date" code="">11 September</phrase>, I have been determined to shift that emphasis and to ensure not only that we honour the staff who work in very hard posts abroad&mdash;which numerically comprise the greatest number&mdash;but that they are given the best career opportunities. Yes, staff can go to the more attractive, and sometimes easier, posts but there is an expectation that, if they want a good career, they will have to serve in the harder posts as well. We are doing a great deal in that regard. For example, an exercise is now under way to reduce the staffing of the European directorates in London and of some of the western European embassies, because an awful lot of their traditional tasks are now carried out either on a capital-to-capital basis or in Brussels. We shall use those resources to train and improve the opportunities of the staff of posts elsewhere, including the Arab world.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21a.181.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="181"  time="016:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/debtext/60321-13.htm#60321-13_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.181.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That this House does not insist on its Amendments 22E and 22F but disagrees with the Lords in their Amendments 22G and 22H.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I should say, first, that I am very pleased that their lordships have now dropped their outright opposition to the designation power in the Bill by dropping their previous amendments Nos. 16 and 22. That is very good news and an important development. However, the amendments in lieu are not a real compromise as they would simply delay the power to link the issue of identity cards to designated documents, such as passports, until 2012. That is unacceptable and it would not be right to allow the other place to delay the implementation of legislation that it dislikes until five years have passed. That is a deliberate plan for delay and destruction of the process in the Identity Cards Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/3">This is the fourth time that this issue has come back to us from the other place and I submit that this really should be the last time. Although we might not expect to phase in the introduction of identity cards to all categories of passport applicants straight away, any constraint on designation would create uncertainties in our planning and a risk of additional costs. In line with other European Union countries, we expect to start the issuing of biometric British passports, including fingerprints, by 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/4">Without the requirement for recipients of designated documents, such as biometric passports, to register on the national identity register, to be issued with an identity card and to get the protections that the national identity register offers, we would have to provide for two alternative processes with separate records for those who choose to register and those who choose not to register. Such a purely artificial deadline would create real problems for the phasing of the scheme, which would be bound to have an impact on costs. The real intention behind the amendments is to make the scheme unworkable by fuelling uncertainty about its implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/5">We are also likely to start issuing biometric residence permits to foreign nationals who are temporarily resident here at about the same time&mdash;in 2008 or 2009. Again, without the requirement for designation and registration on the national identity register, foreign nationals could opt out of the scheme and we would be forced to maintain separate records for those who opted in and those who opted out of the register. The plans for the ID cards process are predicated on the introduction of a single, seamless process for issuing passports and identity cards as a single package.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/6">Parliament has spent many hours debating the Bill. Leaving aside the discussion on the draft Bill and the substantial debate on the earlier Bill that was introduced before the election, we spent some 39 hours discussing this Bill on the Floor of the House and in Committee before passing it to the other place in October. The Committee stage involved 11 sittings over seven days. The other place scrutinised the Bill over all its stages for a total of 61 hours, including six days in Committee and three days on Report. Since then, a further 15 hours of parliamentary time have been taken up as each House has considered the other's amendments and reasons. I suggest that it would be inappropriate, and a waste of parliamentary time, for the Opposition in the other place to try to force the Government to use the Parliament Act. Moreover, to suggest that we should wait six years before we are able to implement the Bill is not a compromise in any respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/7">I welcomed the helpful intervention that was made during yesterday's debate in the other place by Lord Armstrong of Ilminster. He suggested that it might be a compromise between the positions of the Government and the Opposition if the Bill provided for an opt-out, rather than an opt-in, for people applying for a designated document such as a passport. I understand the reasoning behind Lord Armstrong's proposal and am very grateful to him for his efforts to help to resolve the impasse. However, I have to say that while I agree that an opt-out might well make more sense than an opt-in, the reality would be the same. We would still be introducing a large degree of uncertainty into the plans for rolling out identity cards linked to passports.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/8">Perhaps I can also emphasise that fact that, as I have already made clear in debates in the House, anyone who feels strongly enough about the linkage not to want to be issued with an ID card in the initial phase will be free to surrender their existing passport and apply for a new passport before the designation order takes effect. Although I doubt whether many people would want to avoid the opportunity of obtaining an ID card when renewing their passport, the facility will be available. I hope that Lord Armstrong will consider those points before deciding whether to table further amendments in another place.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/9">In fact, I believe that the moment for such a suggestion has passed because it appears that the Opposition have moved beyond their outright resistance to the designation powers in the Bill&mdash;the latest Lords amendments accept the principle of designation. The argument now is simply about whether the powers should be available straight away, or whether an artificial delay should be imposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/10">I understand the position of the Liberal Democrats. Indeed, the Liberal Democrat spokesman in the other place, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, has at least been consistent in opposing the Bill because of his party's avowed dislike of identity cards in principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/11">The position of the Conservative Opposition, both here and in the other place, is more complicated. When <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase> was leading his party, he said in an article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-20">20 December 2004</phrase>, which was less than six months before the general election:</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/12" class="indent">&quot;We must protect our citizens in every way we can and in my judgement that includes ID cards&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/13">On Second Reading of the original Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-20">20 December 2004</phrase>&mdash;again, less than six months before the general election was called&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> said that</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/14" class="indent">&quot;it is incumbent on all of us to examine carefully any measures which might enhance the nation's security. Identity cards introduced properly and effectively may help to do that.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-20">20 December 2004</phrase>; Vol. 428, c. 1953.]</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/15">The Conservative Opposition have since flip-flopped this way and that on identity cards. They have voted for identity cards, abstained and voted against them. They decided not to mention identity cards at all in their election manifesto. However, it now appears&mdash;I welcome this&mdash;that they accept the principle of linking the issue of identity cards to designated documents such as passports.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/16">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-18">18 March</phrase>, <i>The Times</i> reported Conservative party sources as saying that they wanted the delay added to the designation powers, so that if the Conservatives were to win the next election they would have time to repeal the legislation. That report may have been inaccurate, and I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> will have something to say about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/17">I note with interest that yesterday the Leader of the Opposition in the other place, Lord Strathclyde, was not prepared to commit his party to such a stance. In response to an intervention by my noble Friend Baroness Scotland, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/18" class="indent">&quot;She knows of our opposition to this legislation and to the whole principle of ID cards. What our position will be at the next election, I cannot tell.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 680, c. 38.]</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/19">That sums up the problem. Lord Strathclyde was not prepared to commit his party to such a stance and refused to confirm whether his party will be committed to reversing the ID card provisions at the next election.</p>
	<p pid="a.181.2/20">As the Conservative party seeks to use its entrenched vote in the Lords to frustrate the will of the elected House, I urge it to think again given the deep inconsistencies in its position throughout the whole debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.2/1">Of course, Madam Deputy Speaker, I respect everything that you say and the admonition that you give me. I may have used a word that the Home Secretary does not wish to hear or understand, but that is not the point. He will have to come to terms with the fact that we have a bicameral constitutional arrangement. It is entirely proper for the other place to present these amendments to this House, and all the more proper given that the other place is a creation of this Government. Having set up this new House of Lords, it is simply not good enough for them to complain when it sends back legislation in a form that they do not like. They should have thought about that before they mucked around with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/2">On amendments Nos. 22G and 22H, which Ministers may or may not have read, it is important to point out that when we last debated this the Home Secretary was chuntering to the effect that the majority of Cross Benchers did not support the majority of 36 in favour of those amendments. Well, I have news for him. That majority contained within it a majority of Cross Benchers, so he has shot his own fox, if I may use an allusion that may be of interest to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.2/3">The House of Lords has presented to this House two sets of amendments that would delay the onset of compulsion until after <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2011</phrase>. That entirely complies with the Labour party's manifesto on which it was elected at the last election. It would preserve precisely what that manifesto required&mdash;the rolling out of ID cards on a voluntary basis&mdash;by allowing members of the public who so wish to enrol their details on to the national identity register in order to receive an identity card prior to that time. The House of Lords is doing no more than what the Labour party promised the public that it was about at that time.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21a.192.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" speakername="Nicholas Clegg" colnum="192"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/debtext/60321-16.htm#60321-16_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.192.0/1">The Home Secretary has rejected amendments Nos. 22G and 22H from the other place, claiming, if I understand correctly, that they are not serious compromises. I wonder why that is, because any cool and objective assessment of the amendments would suggest that they are very serious compromises indeed. Let me highlight three reasons for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/2">First, the amendments are a major concession of principle from those who objected to identity cards and their compulsory introduction, because opponents accept for the first time that they will become compulsory, but according to a deferred timetable. That has been a painful and difficult decision for those who have a long track record of opposing the Bill out of principle. The Home Secretary's dismissal of the seriousness of that concession does not do justice to their deliberations.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/3">Secondly, it is simply implausible to suggest that the amendments would cause huge practical problems. All that they suggest is a deferral from 2009, which would be the first full year of operation of the ID card scheme, to the end of 2011, 18 to 24 months later. Nothing that we have heard today suggests that that shift of a few months poses enormous complexities and practical problems for the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/4">Thirdly, I should have thought that, from the Government's point of view, these compromise amendments would be a good deal better than some of the other compromise amendments that are doing the rounds. During the debate in the other place, Lord Armstrong referred explicitly to the possibility that, when the Bill returned there, he would table amendments inserting a complete opt-out for those who do not want to subscribe to the identity card scheme at all. That would blow a hole in the Bill that would surely be much more serious for the Government than these measured amendments. They represent a major compromise, undertaken in a spirit of careful deliberation over where the two sides may meet on this difficult issue. They are practical, they will not lead to insuperable obstacles, and they are certainly better than the alternatives that may now be debated in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/5">The Home Secretary said that the amendments would introduce uncertainty, delay and extra costs. I do not see what is uncertain about a date, <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2011</phrase>. That seems to me very certain and very precise. The date is a little further away than what is envisaged in the much vaguer timetable that the Government appear to have in mind, but there is nothing uncertain about it. Yes, it involves a delay, but a modest delay that has been mooted with the aim of securing a reasonable compromise. As for the costs, it is impossible to test the assertion that the amendments would lead to extra costs, because the scheme has not been properly costed by the Government and we have not yet been given a detailed account of what the costs would cover. The costs that have been floated have been summarily rejected and called into question by independent analysts, not least in the London School of Economics, which recently suggested that in its first 10 years of operation the scheme would run up a whopping &pound;1.8 billion deficit.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.1/1">No; if I conclude remarks, somebody else might be able to speak; indeed, the hon. Gentleman might be able to.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/2">The second game of semantics that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough engaged in today involved quoting my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister when he was shadow Home Secretary in the 1990s, saying that he was opposed to the introduction of an identity cards Bill. The implication is that my right hon. Friend changed his mind on this issue when he came into government. That is partly true, but it was not true between 1997 and 1999, when I was a junior Home Office Minister. I have good reason to know that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister was still opposed to the introduction of identity cards during that period. Opposition Members must ask themselves what has happened in the meantime to make him and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary believe that the time is now right for their introduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/3">The world has changed enormously since that time. We have seen huge changes in mass migration around the world, and the rise of Islamist terrorism. The events of 9/11 constituted the worst example of that terrorism, and last summer's London bombings the most recent. That is why people feel that the time is right to introduce identity cards.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.1/4">It stretches the imagination too far to claim that my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and Home Secretary want to introduce identity cards for a reason entirely different from what has been claimed. The world has changed and, for my part, I would support the introduction of compulsory identity cards. However, the proposals in the Bill will at least give us an opportunity to challenge people to prove that they are who they say that they are.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.3/1">There are all sorts of variations on who is being more flexible. The truth is that there is a difference of opinion between having a low-tech, low-cost voluntary card and a high-tech, high-cost compulsory card that is rooted in the register. The House and the public ought to have the chance to resolve that. This way of trying to nudge up to and sidle round a compromise is not satisfactory. Let us get to the nub of the question. If the Home Secretary will not enable us to do that, he must come up with some movement himself. I will certainly vote against the motion again tonight and I hope that the other place votes accordingly and that we will return to the matter later this week. I hope that, by that stage, the Home Secretary will have had second thoughts and found some measure of flexibility in his position.</p>

	<p pid="a.202.8/1">I could not agree more&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1483" name="Kevin Brennan">My hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, West (Kevin Brennan)</phrase> tells me that Welsh swimmers are doing incredibly well, too. I realise that I am digressing, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I am sure that you, like me, welcome the fantastic performance of our team in Melbourne and hope that it continues until the end of the week. It is nice to see headlines in the Australian press that we whacked the Australians in the swimming pool as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.8/2">As Members will recall, this House debated advertising and it was debated again at length in the other place. The debate focused on whether we should put a requirement on the face of the Bill for the Secretary of State to consult the advertising industry and anyone else likely to be affected directly by the regulations under clauses 19 and 26. Members will remember that I gave unequivocal assurances that the advertising industry would be consulted. Those assurances were echoed in the other place. However, Members will be aware that we have been very much in listening mode during the Bill's passage and, as a result, I am pleased that the Government brought forward an amendment in the other place, which addresses the concerns of Members and the industry, and gives a statutory basis to the commitments that I have already given.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.8/3">I draw Members' attention to the fact that the amendments address the comments made by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in its report on the Bill of <phrase class="date" code="">15 December</phrase>. The Committee commented on the need for organisations representing those affected by either the advertising or street trading regulations to be consulted. The amendments mean that representatives will be consulted where interested persons are affected by the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.8/4">I shall deal briefly with the detail of the amendments. Amendment No. 3 ensures that the advertising industry, and anyone else who may be affected by the regulations that will control advertising in the vicinity of games venues, will be consulted as the regulations are being drawn up. Amendment No. 8 ensures that those likely to be affected by regulations under clause 26, controlling street trading in the vicinity of venues, will similarly be consulted.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.8/5">The remaining amendments in the group make minor and consequential changes, and I commend them to the House.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21a.203.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21b.203.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21a.203.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" speakername="Hugh Robertson" colnum="203"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/debtext/60321-19.htm#60321-19_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.203.0/1">I, for one, am extremely encouraged that we are all here. On Third Reading, I said that, although the Bill is not lengthy in parliamentary terms, it is, in fact, quite complex&mdash;setting up a de facto regional development agency in the Olympic delivery authority in its first half and establishing the ground rules of the marketing of the commercial media rights in the second. The Minister agreed about that then and looked at me, possibly a little ruefully, over the Dispatch Box. Indeed, subsequent events have proved that right. Given the fact that these are difficult and technical issues, I am delighted that they have been ironed out during the parliamentary process and that the Bill is back with us tonight.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/2">The time interval between winning the bid on <phrase class="date" code="">6 July</phrase> and the first publication of the Bill on <phrase class="date" code="">14 July</phrase> was extraordinarily short, even allowing for the fact that much of the preparatory work had obviously been done. Given the Bill's technical nature, which I have already acknowledged, it is a very considerable achievement on behalf of all those responsible for drafting the Bill&mdash;LOCOG, the British Olympic Association and, of course, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport&mdash;that the list of amendments is so short. May I therefore genuinely ask the Minister&mdash;I mean this absolutely seriously&mdash;to pass on my thanks to all those who were involved?</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/3">In the other place, my noble Friend Lord Glentoran said:</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/4" class="indent">&quot;If democracy in this country could run on the sorts of lines that we have debated in this particular Bill, this country would be a better place&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">14 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 679, c. 1210.]</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/5">Fabulous, is it not? I wholly agree. The process of parliamentary scrutiny has genuinely made this a better Bill. I am told that the Sydney games needed four Bills, and I suspect that, as the games progress, a number of other issues will benefit from parliamentary scrutiny. I hope therefore that the Government will be encouraged by their experience with the Bill and that, as a result, they will involve Parliament closely, as the process develops. That is crucial to maintain the cross-party consensus that has characterised both the bid and the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/6">All four groups of amendments before us tonight were introduced as a result of concerns first raised in Committee and subsequently by our Front-Bench spokesman in the other place, and I should like to record my thanks to Lord Glentoran for the part that he played. Unsurprisingly, all four groups of amendments therefore enjoy my support.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/7">This the first group of amendments mandates the Secretary of State to consult the relevant industry bodies before regulations on advertising and street trading are drawn up. The Minister agreed to that principle in Committee, but it will now be given statutory force. Clearly, it is eminently sensible to involve the industry closely at every stage and for that requirement to have statutory force, and we all want consultation, rather than prescription, to characterise the delivery of the games. This group of amendments, therefore, has our full support.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that, on the important matter of advertising, we do not want people to use ambush marketing on the pretence that someone came from their area when that was not true. Of course, he rightly reminds us that the success in the Commonwealth games to date has come from all the home countries, and we should rightly applaud all those who are involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/2">The Minister rightly made the point in introducing this string of amendments that the Bill has received a great deal of cross-party support. These proceedings are rather like the marathon runner who can find the extra energy to sprint at the end of a long race: we have the opportunity to make some important improvements during the Bill's final stages, as a result of the cross-party consensus.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/3">The Minister is well aware of the history; it has been referred to already. Much of what we are debating now is based on ideas that were first suggested by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> and myself in Committee, when the Minister was not prepared to accept an addition to the list of consultees in the Bill, particularly in relation to the advertising industry, notwithstanding the fact that the proposal was modelled on the Gambling Act 2005, which the very same Minister had taken through the House only a few months earlier. None the less, he was not prepared to accept that proposal. The Bill then went to another place for debate, and we were all eventually delighted that the Government were willing to accept that the advertising industry should become a statutory consultee.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/4">Although I clearly welcome these amendments, because they are based on proposals that originally came from Liberal Democrat and other Opposition Members, I want to raise an issue with the Minister nevertheless. We are considering the important issue of ambush advertising and marketing, and it is crucial for the House to accept that such things can happen and that we must guard against them for obvious reasons, to protect the Olympic symbol from its unwanted use in advertising.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/5">We therefore accept not only the need to take rapid action, as people propose novel ideas for ambush marketing, but the need for rapid consultation. That is all accepted, so it is important to take account of the fact that, only yesterday, the Joint Committee on Human Rights commented on that aspect of the Bill in its seventh report on legislative scrutiny. On page 6 of that report, on the procedures that might be adopted, it said:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/6" class="indent">&quot;Ordinarily this would be the occasion for adverse comment from our Committee&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/7">It went on to point out that it would not make such adverse comments, because of the special circumstances of the Olympic and Paralympic games. However, it made a strongly worded recommendation. It said:</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/8" class="indent">&quot;We consider it, however, all the more important that the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the regulations when they are made provides a detailed explanation as to why in the Secretary of State's view the restrictions on advertising are compatible with the rights identified above&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/9">The Committee was obviously referring to human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/10">It is crucial that the Minister use this opportunity to give absolute assurances that the regulations, when published, take account of Joint Committee's recommendations. With that said, I, like the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent, am delighted to accept these Lords amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/11" class="italic">Lords amendment agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.4/12" class="italic">Lords amendments Nos. 2 to 10 agreed to.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21a.208.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" speakername="Richard Caborn" colnum="208"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/debtext/60321-21.htm#60321-21_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.208.5/1">This group of amendments relates to the status of the words and phrases listed in schedule 4. In debate, both here and in the other place, considerable concern was expressed about the &quot;evidential burden&quot; that we had created in relation to schedule 4. The evidential burden would have meant that the use in combination of the words and phrases listed in paragraph 3 of the schedule would, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, have been treated as constituting an association with the London Olympics. Although the burden was a light one, by which a defendant had to produce any evidence that an association had not been made, to shift the burden back to LOCOG to prove its case, we have listened to what has been said during the Bill's passage and have taken the opportunity to amend it by removing the evidential presumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.5/2">We still feel that the list of words and phrases in schedule 4 is important in helping the public to understand what sort of activity may create an association with the London games, but we appreciate the concerns that have been expressed about the position in which we would have been putting advertisers and businesses by virtue of an evidential presumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.5/3">The amendments will remove the evidential presumption attached to the use of the words and phrases listed in paragraph 3. Instead, we have suggested that when considering whether the London Olympics association right has been breached, the courts would be able to consider, in particular, whether the defendant had used a combination of the words and phrases listed in schedule 4.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.5/4">I hope that hon. Members will be able to support this approach. It removes the evidential presumption about which both Houses had expressed concerns, but retains in the Bill the list of words and phrases that provides greater clarity for the public about what the association right is about, and allows the court to take into account the use of those words and phrases when deciding whether someone has infringed the association right. I hope that the House will accept the amendments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21a.209.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" speakername="Hugh Robertson" colnum="209"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/debtext/60321-21.htm#60321-21_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.209.0/1">The amendment addresses the use of presumption, in that a person is &quot;presumed&quot; to have infringed the London Olympics association right by using any of the words listed in the Bill. It has become known, slightly unfortunately, as the reversal of the presumption of innocence, and it was one of the most controversial aspects of the original Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/2">As the Minister has said, we debated the issue at length both in Committee and on Report, and I warned him on Third Reading that I thought that it would cause problems in the other place.In Committee we discussed the defences that were available in the original Bill and the fact that the approach was consistent with Sheldrake <i>v.</i> DPP and the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. However, concerns remained, focused mainly on two areas: first, the fact that it is a basic principle of English law that one is innocent until proven guilty, and the regulation at least seemed to contravene that principle; and secondly, the fact that the Bill seemed to weight the dice firmly in favour of LOCOG.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/3">We all accept that the marketing of major international sports events is now in a new era, and organisers demand exclusivity to derive the most commercially advantageous sponsorship deals. As a quid pro quo, we all accept that some of the money finds its way back to the grass-roots development of sport. I wholly agree with that principle. However, it is important to strike a balance so that the enforcement of the measures is not unduly heavy-handed.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.0/4">The amendments represent a good compromise. LOCOG gets the exclusivity that it requires and the security of knowing that the regulations will take effect on Royal Assent, while on the other side of the fence, the industry gets some measure of protection from over-zealous enforcement. I therefore have no hesitation in agreeing to the amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">I, too, am delighted to say that we will support the amendments. This matter caused great concern during the passage of the Bill. I said in Committee that at the very least the presumption of liability, if not of guilt,</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/2" class="indent">&quot;goes against what everyone in this country and certainly our courts holds dear: the principle of innocence until proven guilty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/3">When the matter was first raised, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/4" class="indent">&quot;it is appropriate, and indeed proportionate, that the burden of proof falls on the defendant in this case.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/5">We argued strongly that the Government's view was incorrect, but the Minister tried to justify it by saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/6" class="indent">&quot;we are not going after the little granny who owns the sweet shop at the bottom of the road, in order to haul her before the courts. That would be crazy.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October 2005</phrase>; c. 94&ndash;97.]</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/7">However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> has rightly pointed out, it is crucial that we realise that we will be dealing not only with the little granny, but with local sports clubs and community bodies, which need protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/8">I was genuinely delighted that although the Government failed to accept amendments tabled in this place, progress was made when the Bill got to another place and was in the hands of my noble Friend Lord Clement-Jones. I noted with interest that Lord Davies of Oldham described himself as quailing in the face of Lord Clement-Jones on the matter. It was good to note that after Lord Davies had listened to my noble Friend's argument, he was willing to accept it and move an amendment with wording similar to that tabled by my noble Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/9">I am sure that the amendments will be accepted today, but I hope that the Minister will give thought on another occasion to the outstanding question of LOCOG's status in respect of freedom of information legislation. He will be aware that LOCOG is exempt from such legislation because it is a private body. I accept entirely that confidential business matters need to be protected, but that legislation already protects them. Although LOCOG will not be covered by freedom of information legislation, I hope that it will operate as if it was covered by that legislation, because it is important that there be absolute transparency whenever it acts and makes decisions, especially on the matter that the amendments address. Let me end as I began, by saying that I am delighted that we are considering amendments to the most controversial bit of the Bill and that we have found a satisfactory situation to the problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.3/1">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase>, I am delighted that we have seen this final change of heart by the Government on this important issue. I am also delighted that we will now see on the face of the Bill some of the things that a number of hon. Members have requested for quite a long time.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.3/2">As I said when we discussed the first group of amendments, we must accept that sometimes there will be a need for rapid change in the light of clever techniques used by advertisers. However, it is equally important that before any rapid change takes place, whether because of an incident or because of a request from the IOC, the consultation to which the amendment refers should take place. That may be difficult, because advertising is often planned a long time in advance, which involves the investment of a lot of money. I can foresee a number of difficulties, which is why I am pleased that the amendment includes not only consultation with the advertising industry but a requirement to consult those who regulate the advertising industry, which is a crucial addition.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.3/3">It is worth reflecting that this is the only amendment that appears to have come almost out of nowhere. When other amendments were debated in the Lords, there was agreement that the Government accepted the principle and would come back with their own amendment. When this provision was debated in Committee in the Lords on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February</phrase>, however, it was rejected outright, and the Government said that they were not interested in implementing it. Suddenly, lo and behold, the Government introduced the provision on Report on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-16">16 March</phrase>. None of us is sure what caused their change of heart, but whoever persuaded them&mdash;on this occasion it was not Lord Clement-Jones&mdash;they did a good job and deserve congratulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.3/4">Like the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent and the Minister, I think that both Houses of Parliament can be inordinately proud of themselves for the way in which we have handled this Bill, which is the crucial legislation for the important 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. All of us have been extremely well served by the Minister's staff, Department of Culture, Media and Sport civil servants and a wide range of lobbying groups. The lobbying groups have advised hon. Members on both sides of the House, which has enabled amendments to be tabled that have made the Bill much better than it was when it came before us a few months ago.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.1/1">May I say unreservedly that I completely agree with the right hon. Gentleman? It is not racist to talk about immigration control or managed migration, but the Conservatives' national campaign suggested that we believed it was. However, that allegation was not true, either nationally or in my constituency. I deplore the actions of anyone who attacks people simply for trying to hold a debate on serious issues that matter to our country and describes them as racist. We need a substantive debate, and our five-year strategy, including the points-based system, is an important contribution. In February, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State delivered a speech in which he outlined the points-based system, the new asylum model and other aspects of policy that I have had the pleasure of trying to implement since the election. During the election campaign, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said in Dover on <phrase class="date" code="">24 April</phrase> that most people recognise the huge contribution that immigrants have made to this country. That is central to what we are trying to achieve with the points-based system.</p>

	<p pid="a.220.0/1">I regret having to bring in an element of negativity, but I wonder whether hon. Friend shares my concerns about a situation in my constituency whereby a mushroom farm that has taken on a lot of migrant workers has been deliberately squeezing out the local work force. The migrant workers are working for far lower terms and conditions of employment and for excessive hours, and the indigenous work force, who were in their hundreds, are now down to 20-odd. Surely we must do something to protect our indigenous workers and prevent the racial tensions that mount as a result of this.</p>

	<p pid="a.225.4/1">I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way a second time. I am concerned about the numbers game because, when the new member states joined the European Union on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-01">1 May 2005</phrase>, the Conservatives made allegations that those coming here would not make a contribution to the British economy. Those allegations were even extended to suggest that those people would go on benefits. The fact is, however, that their presence in this country has contributed greatly to our economy, and, at the last count, fewer than 100 of them had gone on benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.227.1/1">I am grateful for that burst of clarity from the Government Front Bench, which is a rare treat.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/2">While I am on tier 2, however, let me deal with the vexed question of restaurants, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> rightly raised. We are grateful to him, and I am also grateful to Christine Lee of the North London Chinese Association, and to others including Mr. Enam Ali from the Guild of Bangladeshi Restaurateurs for passing on their detailed concerns about the effect that the new system might have on hundreds of small businesses. I know that the Minister has held meetings on this subject, so he is aware of the main points of concern, which boil down to whether enough chefs with specialist skills will be available to keep Chinese, Indian, Bangladeshi and other restaurants going.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/3">A few days ago, the Home Secretary appeared to say that the way to solve the growing shortage is simply to train replacements in this country. Again, the House deserves some clarity as to whether that is the Government's solution to the problem. Ministers are aware of the concerns that under the current proposals even highly skilled chefs will not score enough points to qualify under tier 2, particularly if they do not have any significant paper qualifications. There is also the issue of benefits in kind, such as accommodation, which is often provided for chefs who come to this country. It is not obvious from the Command Paper how the salary-based allocation of points accounts for that. Mr. Ali, whom I mentioned, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We can cite numerous examples where the lack of educational opportunity (which is the norm throughout the third world) to gain formal qualifications equivalent to NVQ levels 3 or 4, is being abused by Entry Officers as a pretext for Visa refusal. Typical is the story of a top chef currently running the kitchens of a five-star Bombay restaurant, who cannot gain entry to the UK because he is virtually illiterate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.227.1/5">Clearly, such sensitive issues will arise.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21a.231.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" speakername="Neil Gerrard" colnum="231"  time="020:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/debtext/60321-28.htm#60321-28_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.231.0/1">I welcome the debate, and a great deal of what is in the White Paper. That is not always the case when I see what the Home Office proposes. We do need clarity in the system: people must be able to understand the rules, because that is good for both employers and applicants. There is no doubt that the present system is far too complex and bureaucratic. Many of us will know of people who have been given work permits and then refused entry clearance, although it must have been blatantly obvious that some of them would be refused entry clearance before they were given work permits.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/2">A huge amount of detail remains to be filled in. The White Paper is really no more than an outline, although both <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1379" name="Damian Green">the Minister and the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green)</phrase> referred to some of the detail. Neither this debate nor any other debate on the subject that I have heard has dealt adequately with the extent to which a managed migration system should relate purely to economic benefits for the United Kingdom, or&mdash;a key question, in my view&mdash;with how much attention will be paid to the rights of the people who come here to work. I do not want to see a Gastarbeiter system involving people coming here and working for quite lengthy periods with no rights. That would affect not just those people but the rest of the work force, in ways that I may describe later.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/3">As for the application process, it is clearly advantageous for both applicant and employer to know what is required and to be able to carry out some self-assessment. In theory at least, that is simpler than the present arrangements. However, I should like the Minister to clarify a couple of points, one of which is about the position of sponsors in some of the tiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/4">Obviously the reliability of a sponsor will matter. I do not object to the suggestion that an employer or educational institution should have a duty to report when someone has disappeared, or has not even taken up an offer. I note, however, that in some cases sponsors themselves will be given either an A or a B grade. I am far from clear about how that will work, especially early in the process, before there has been much experience of the scheme. What assumptions will be involved in deciding whether a sponsor will be given an A or a B? Will there be any arrangements for sponsors to contest their assessments? It could be argued that an A or a B grade could constitute a reflection on the sponsor's reputation. Certainly some sponsors who receive B grades may wish to contest them, for that simple reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/5">As others have pointed out, the system of sponsorships and grading may tend to favour the large employer who continues to import large numbers of workers, rather than the small employer who may find it harder to enter the system. Another question that has been raised concerns the liability of an employer at the end of a contract of employment. I feel that it would be unreasonable to expect a small employer, in particular, to bear any liability once the contract had ended. At the same time, there seems to be no scope for people who may have worked here for two or three years to have a holiday, or to wind up their affairs before they leave.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/6">Obvious questions have been raised about how the higher tiers will cope with people who may be highly skilled, but who may not have academic qualifications or earn large salaries. I have another concern about tier 1, however. It does not require a job offer or a sponsor; it allows someone to come in purely on the basis of qualifications and earnings&mdash;in some instances, perhaps, on the basis of qualifications alone. We must ensure that we do not strip other countries of skilled people whom they cannot afford to lose. We have had discussions of this kind in the past about the health service, but it is not only in the health service that such problems arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/7">What causes me most concern is tier 3, which will probably cover most low-skilled migrants. We know that some sectors, such as agriculture and hospitality, are highly dependent on unskilled labour from outside the United Kingdom. Tier 3 involves a maximum of 12 months, no rights of entry for dependants and no right to switch to another employment route. The White Paper says that that tier will be run by &quot;operators&quot;. I should be interested to hear from the Minister who he thinks those operators will be.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.1/1">I entirely agree. The Minister has made clear that he is willing to talk to the various industrial interests, which will have to make their case if they believe that they have one. The skills advisory boards in particular should be consulted, because they will have a key role in identifying skills shortages.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/2">The point that I was trying to make, however, related to lower-skilled migrants. If we go down the road of effectively shutting out people who are not from other EU countries, what will the possible consequences be? The danger is that that could inadvertently result in more unauthorised people trying to work illegally. Such an approach rests to some degree on an assumption that unskilled work is not really essential work, that it does not matter that much and it does not matter who does it. However, London has a huge number of unskilled people who have come from other countries to do such work. If they were not here, whole sections of London's economy would virtually collapse.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/3">Reference has been made to the effects on indigenous workers, and to the fear that the presence of migrant workers holds down pay and conditions. In this regard, employment rights for migrant workers are very important. Some of the exploitation of migrant workers that undoubtedly goes on is clearly related to their inability to enforce their employment rights. There could be a number of reasons for such an inability. In some cases, the explanation is simply a lack of knowledge of those rights. We should perhaps ensure that those who work in the tier 3 schemes get information on their employment rights in their own language, so that they can understand them and know what they can do to enforce them. If one examined the evidence, it would doubtless become clear that some migrant workers are being discriminated against on the basis of their immigration status. Migrant workers who are sacked by their employer do not simply lose their jobs, they also lose the right to be in this country. That, in itself, can make it much more difficult for such people to enforce the employment rights that they should be able to enforce.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21a.239.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1638" speakername="Peter Lilley" colnum="239"  time="020:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/debtext/60321-30.htm#60321-30_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.239.0/1">We are asked to consider today a points-based system of managed migration. Most of the management gurus tell us that the important aspect of any management system is not the process, but the objectives towards which it is managed. That is also true of a points-based managed migration system. How it will work will depend above all on the objectives the Government use it to pursue. I wish to discuss, first, what the Government's objectives are, and secondly, what the objectives should be for any points-based managed migration system.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/2">Happily, we know&mdash;not, admittedly, from the Minister's speech, but from other sources&mdash;what the objectives of the Government's migration policy are, because they were spelt out objectively by Home Office officials in a Government document that the House required them to produce. That document stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The government wants to encourage lawful migration to the country . . . sustaining and perhaps increasing current levels of lawful immigration.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/4">So we know that the Government's objective is to encourage, sustain and increase lawful migration to the UK, presumably using the proposed system to achieve it.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/5">The Government have certainly been successful in increasing immigration. The net inflow last year was about 223,000 people; more came to settle in the UK than left to return home or emigrate. The figure for net immigration was five times the number Labour inherited in 1997. We know how the Government have achieved that figure: by systematically liberalising the immigration rules. They have trebled the number of work permits granted and drawn to companies' attention the fact that they can bring people from abroad to fill vacancies. In the pamphlet I produced last year, &quot;Too much of a good thing?&quot;, I list 10 other liberalising measures that the Government have introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/6">Above all, we know how the Government will operate a points-based system if they generalise it, because they have already introduced one such system. In 2002, they set up the highly skilled migrants programme, setting the number of points people needed to be able to come to this country and seek work. The Government set the points objectively, to establish the level of skill they thought desirable in anyone given the right to seek work in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/7">Only a modest number of people applied under the scheme, however, so did the Government accept that that was the number who should be allowed to immigrate? No, they promptly reduced the number of points needed to acquire right of entry under the scheme to such a degree that the system was overwhelmed. We know that the Government will, if need be, manipulate a points-based system to achieve their objectives of encouraging, sustaining and possibly increasing immigration.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/8">What should be the objectives of a points-based system? First, let us dispose of the notion that one objective should be to exclude economic immigrants because they are intrinsically undesirable. The caricature of economic migrants as welfare scroungers, driven by a desire to milk our benefit system, prone to criminality and a danger to society is not simply wrong; it is by and large the reverse of the truth. For most of my life, I have lived in areas where there was a large number of immigrants. I have known them as my neighbours, worked with them as my constituents and worshipped in the same Churches, and I have concluded, like anybody who knows the facts, that the vast majority of people who come to the UK to work are decent, hard-working and law-abiding.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/9">Conservatives particularly admire two virtues that characterise economic migrants; they tend to be enterprising&mdash;they have to be to get to this country&mdash;and to be driven by family commitment and cohesion. We are biased in their favour. In the language of &quot;1066 And All That&quot;, we think immigrants are &quot;a Good Thing&quot;, but the implication, common to both sides of the debate, is that we need to manage migration and that we need to restrict it&mdash;that we can have too much of a good thing, and there should be limits.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/10">Secondly, let me dispose of the notion that the reason for managing migration is that immigrants take British jobs. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> said earlier, that idea is based on the lump of labour fallacy. In any well-working market the number of jobs will sooner or later equal the number of people seeking work, who will price themselves into jobs and by obtaining them generate extra demand, exactly equal to the amount of demand that they have absorbed from the labour market. However, precisely the same fallacies lie behind the Government's claims that we need workers to fill shortages.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/11">Whereas those who want to play the race card argue that there is a lump of labour&mdash;a fixed amount of work to do&mdash;and that, if we allow in immigrants, there will be too many of them and they will take some of that fixed amount of jobs and some of our people will be out of the work, the anti-racists, including the Government and my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham, say that there is a fixed amount of work, but that there are not enough people to do it and that we must therefore import them from abroad. That is the same fallacy, based on the same logical mistake that there is a lump of labour, that prices do not work and that extra workers do not create extra demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/12">Indeed, the very idea of a shortage in a properly functioning market is problematic. The vice-chairman of the US Commission on Immigration Reform said:</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/13" class="indent">&quot;the very phrase . . . 'labour shortage' provokes puzzlement or amazement among most informed analysts of . . . labour markets.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/14">His colleague added:</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Long term labour shortages do not happen naturally in market economies. That is not to say they don't exist. They are created when employers or Government agencies tamper with the natural functioning of the wage mechanism.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/16">So shortages can occur only in unusual circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/17">The idea that we suffer from a generalised labour shortage is denied by the evidence. The symptom of a shortage in any market economy is a rising price. If we had a labour shortage in this country, we would see wage inflation, but we have never had a period of lower wage inflation in our lives. The idea that we are suffering from a labour shortage is manifestly untrue.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/18">The idea that importing labour fills established shortages has also been disproved by the facts. The Prime Minister began some years ago to say that there are 500,000 vacancies in the British economy and that we need to employ people from abroad to fill them. Some years later, we have imported more than 500,000 people; there are still 500,000 vacancies in the British economy. So that theory has not been proven, because all those who come to work in this country and get jobs generate as much demand for additional work to fulfil their consumption needs&mdash;the goods and services that they consume&mdash;as they fill any shortage that exists before they arrive. That is why that theory simply does not work in this or any other country: we do not end shortages by importing workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/19">As for shortages in certain sectors, they can surely only persist if pay is not allowed to rise to the market-clearing level that will attract people to acquire those skills domestically. If pay is held down artificially in sectors by importing people from abroad who are willing to work at below the market-clearing level for this country, a temporary shortage can be rendered permanent. Of course, the pay will not rise to the level at which people in the domestic market will acquire those skills, so people must continue to be imported from abroad. That has clearly happened in a number of professions in this country, particularly in public sector health and medical services.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/20">The Government's whole theory that there are endemic shortages that can be filled only from abroad is, by and large, wrong. We should avoid becoming permanently reliant on immigration to provide any skill that can and should be acquired by the resident population. We should allow the market to work, with pay rates rising to levels that attract people from the resident population to acquire those desired skills. Even if we import people to meet short-term difficulties, we should not allow that to be used as a reason to depress pay rates in that sector. That would allow the shortage to become permanent.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/21">What the system should do is focus on giving work permits to people with skills that people in this country cannot acquire by the normal processes that are used to fill vacancies. There are such skills and, in the past, they have been the main reason for importing workers from abroad. The first such type of skill is company-specific skills. Companies have their own way of doing things and those that operate worldwide will often want to bring their accountant to this country to install their accounting system here, to train people to operate that system or to introduce their work-flow processes. For all the systems that IBM or Coca-Cola have, they will bring workers here to establish the systems. In due course, those workers will probably return home having transmitted the skills that are specific to that company to people in this country. That is fine and right; we ought to encourage that process. If anything, we should make it easier for international companies to transfer personnel from subsidiary to subsidiary across the world so that they can transfer the specific skills that have been developed internally within those companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/22">The second type of skill that one cannot easily just acquire is entrepreneurship. I believe that entrepreneurs are born rather than made. If we can import more entrepreneurs who will generate high-quality jobs in this country for other people, that is excellent. Let us do that. It is another reason that we have traditionally given for granting work permits.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/23">Another category is that of star performers&mdash;the people of outstanding skills at an international level. Many sectors of the City need a star performer in their analytical or sales teams. In medicine, one may need a star performer to develop a particular team and its expertise. We should bring in the star performers and, around them, they will generate teams and create jobs and wealth for those of us who star less in those professions.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/24">Very rarely, there can be cases in which economies of scale mean that it is impossible to recruit domestically sufficient people with the particular skill for a post because we do not have the people with the basic aptitudes to fill such posts. An industry the size of City probably could not meet all its needs from the domestic population, so it is perfectly reasonable to allow it to bring in additional people from abroad to build the huge wealth-generating capacity that the City has.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/25">We therefore need to encourage some immigration. Some immigration is a good thing, but I use the analogy of oil and petrol. We need some oil in a car or it will not go at all. However, putting more and more oil in it does not make it go any faster. It is not like petrol. The Government seem to think that immigration is more like petrol than oil. They think that if they put the foot on the accelerator and encourage people to come, the economy will grow faster and faster.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/26">We need some sensible targeted immigration through a managed points-based system. However, to respond to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, why do we need to worry about numbers? If immigrants are a good thing&mdash;in my view, they are; by and large, they are admirable people&mdash;why do we want to impose any restrictions at all? The answer is that we are one of the most densely populated countries in Europe. South-east England, including London, is more densely populated even than the Netherlands. It is absurd to suggest that there not enough people here to run a good economy. It is absurd to suggest that we need to&mdash;or even can&mdash;attract relatively large numbers of people. It is absurd to suggest that we ought to be a country of immigration. For most of our history we have been a country of net emigration, and it is only in recent years that we have become a country of net immigration.</p>

	<p pid="a.249.1/1">I follow the Minister's argument, but there is more advantage in the proposals than simply the ability to manage a system of economic migration. They also constitute an opportunity to establish clearly from the outset that people who come to this country can make a contribution, but that there are also expectations of them. The system's ability to admit those who can make a contribution benefits not only the economy but many other aspects of life. I understand the Minister's points, but the debate could be allowed to go a little wider, and that is what I have tried to in my contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.1/2">However, with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1379" name="Damian Green">the reservations that my hon.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21a.259.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1569" speakername="Andrew Miller" colnum="259"  time="021:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/debtext/60321-36.htm#60321-36_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.259.2/1">I am sure that you have sat in that Chair through a number of debates about the Post Office, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I want to start the discussion of the closure of Ellesmere Crown post office by saying that I do not blame my hon. Friend the Minister for the state of the Post Office today. However, he must listen to the combined voices of all political parties in Ellesmere Port, who, together with the Communication Workers Union, the employees of the Crown post office, and the public, are all disgusted at the cavalier way in which Post Office management have not only ridden roughshod over the views of local people, but have failed in their duty to look after the public purse.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/2">My hon. Friend will also be aware that at the Labour party north-west regional conference last week a resolution was passed that referred to this sorry debacle and called on the Government to institute a statutory review of the impact of full liberalisation from January 2006, to ensure that Postcomm meets its primary duty to defend the universal service.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/3">The farce in Ellesmere Port goes back to the summer of 2004, when I returned from a couple of weeks away with my family to discover a pile of letters on my desk from constituents, complaining about the threatened closure of two branch offices, one in Station road and one in Whitby. The Station Road post office, in particular, serves some of the most disadvantaged people in my community.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/4">I wrote in some detail to the chief executive of Post Office Ltd, Mr. David Mills, and after a series of public meetings and the gathering of information, a very detailed case was submitted. I shall refer to one of the letters in my bundle of documents to focus my hon. Friend's mind on the disingenuous language that the Post Office has used. In a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-06">6 February</phrase> this year, a Mr. Partington referred to previous commitments that I &quot;alleged&quot; had been provided to me. If I, as a Member of Parliament, on behalf of my constituents, say to a public servant that I have received some information, he should accept that I have done so. It is an insult to the House to use language like that.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/5">The letter referred to information that I &quot;alleged&quot; that a previous employee of Post Office Ltd had given me about the future of the post offices. Mr. Partington then sought to disconnect what had happened around Christmas 2005 from more recent events by saying that the former had been part of the Post Office reinvention plan, but the latter were entirely different.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/6">In 2004, the Post Office failed to get to grips with what happened at Station Road. It was a sad story of dishonesty. Loyal employees were working for an owner who had spent some time in jail. Those loyal employees had served the public well and treated their elderly customers as if they were relatives. They would knock on doors when elderly people did not come to collect their pensions. People of that calibre were dumped by the system. But, of course, that was under the Post Office reinvention scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/7">In the letters to me at that time, the Post Office, in describing what it now claims to be a different exercise, used the heading &quot;Post Office area plan for Ellesmere Port &amp; Neston&quot;. That could mean one of two things. It could mean the area plan for the borough of Ellesmere Port and Neston or for the parliamentary constituency. It cannot, under any use of the English language, be reinterpreted a year later to mean a post office covering two super output areas in the poorest parts of the community. It covered the whole community.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/8">Mr. Dave Barrett announced the closure in a letter I received on Christmas eve 2004, when pensioners were trying to collect their benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/9" class="italic">It being Ten o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the House lapsed, without Question put.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.2/10" class="italic">Motion made, and Question proposed, That this House do now adjourn.&mdash;[Tony Cunningham.]</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-21a.260.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1569" speakername="Andrew Miller" colnum="260"  time="021:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060321/debtext/60321-36.htm#60321-36_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.260.0/1">I accept that the closure of the post office notified on Christmas eve was due to unfortunate and unforeseen reasons; a robbery at the post office had brought forward the closure. However, Mr. Barrett wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/2" class="indent">&quot;Within the scope of the Network Reinvention programme, we have now completed our work in your constituency and no further closure proposals will be considered under this programme in your constituency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/3">If I were in the Minister's position I could be pedantic and say, &quot;Ah, that was the Post Office reinvention plan&quot;, but I remind the House that the heading on the letter was unambiguous: &quot;Post Office area plan for Ellesmere Port &amp; Neston&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/4">What were the motives behind that lack of clarity? Laziness, incompetence, deliberate action? I will let the House determine the answer. I only know that one of the most impoverished parts of my constituency was left without an essential service. Post Office management said, &quot;They can go to the Crown office just up the road&quot;, referring to elderly and infirm people in an area with the lowest car ownership in the sub-region.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/5">The letter of <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-23">23 December 2004</phrase> said that there would be no further closures, yet a year later the Post Office came back for another bite at the cherry and announced that the Crown office would be absorbed in an Asda store. The proposal was to halve the counter space and the resources for post office services in the town centre. I was told that the Post Office had identified financial losses at the Crown office, but that information was not shared with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/6">I have no complaint about Asda, but I object to being insulted by the deviousness of Post Office management. I do not mind that personally, as in this place one gets used to being insulted by experts, but Members are entitled to expect at least some deference from a public body towards our constituents. No such thing has come from the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/7">My early-day motion 1446 states:</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/8" class="indent">&quot;That this House condemns the manner in which the Post Office has failed to engage in meaningful consultations with either staff or public about the closure of Ellesmere Port Crown Office; and calls upon the Government, as shareholders, to instruct the Post Office management to withdraw its current proposal, to share with stakeholders the financial facts and ensure that if it demonstrates a position that is commercially recoverable that time is allowed to enable a proper recovery programme to be instituted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/9">That is not an unreasonable request from a Member of Parliament, yet it was wholly ignored. The Post Office made no comment on it, apart from an indirect one to which I shall refer.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/10">A letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-06">6 February</phrase> set out in four or five pages the logic behind the Post Office's decision to close. I was assured that there would be</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/11" class="indent">&quot;longer opening hours . . . a brand new, modern Post Office branch . . . flat, level access . . . automatic entrance doors . . . a low-level writing desk . . . car parking facilities nearby . . . and . . . a bright, modern, customer friendly retail environment within which to shop&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/12">Interestingly, that letter referred to events that occurred just yesterday&mdash;the axe fell finally, the closure happened and the new system came into force.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/13">All hon. Members have constituents who are prolific letter writers. I bet that you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, could name a handful of people in your own constituency who are the most prolific letter writers, as could every other hon. Member. One such in my constituency is gentleman called Mr. Ellams, who writes to me on all sorts of issues, and he would not be offended if I say that I find myself in disagreement with him on nine out of 10 of them. However, he pointed out something extremely useful yesterday, and the Minister ought to be aware of it, bearing in mind the commitments that the Post Office has given to me in writing, which the Minister has seen. Mr. Ellams says that some of the counters were closed and that queues were coming out of the door&mdash;at a post office that was supposed to provide a better service for my constituents. Frankly, that is what I expected, because I do not believe that the provision for either the transition into the Asda operation or the final scale of the Asda operation will be adequate to meet my constituents' needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/14">One of the issues that I raised in the early-day motion and in the subsequent correspondence with the Post Office was the financial basis on which the decision was taken. At a public meeting&mdash;at which the Post Office was at least represented, to be fair to two very junior members of its staff&mdash;a member of the public asked a question, doubting, as I do, the veracity of the financial information that was presented to us. We were simply told that the Crown post office in Ellesmere Port was making a loss. That may be the case, but the point was that a financial year had not been completed since the closure of the two sub-post offices, so no stable pattern worth a light could be analysed. No sensible business financial planning is based on the kind of data that could have been drawn together in that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/15">What made me particularly angry was that, when I eventually pressed the Post Office about the financial basis on which the information was taken, Julia Marwood wrote me a letter, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-20">20 February</phrase>, in which she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Turning to the financial case behind our decision to change the way in which we manage Ellesmere Port Post Office branch, I fully appreciate it would give a clearer picture if we could simply publish the financial information and data relating to any individual branch.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/17">I asked the Post Office not to publish that information, but to make it available to me, as a Member of Parliament. The letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/18" class="indent">&quot;However we are not obliged, or indeed, at liberty to disclose this confidential information with any third party due to commercial confidentiality.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/19">I have a little difficulty with that. I had understood that we taxpayers owned the Post Office. Of course, if some information is commercially sensitive, I would accept that. I deal with other companies with a similar structure. For example, I regularly deal with British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, which shares with me huge amounts of information. It provides it to me in confidence as a Member of Parliament with a local constituency interest. Why cannot the Post Office do exactly the same? Does it think that some smart Alec Member of Parliament might come up with a better idea because they have more knowledge of the locality that they represent than the people sitting miles away in their ivory towers in the Post Office branch change section as it is now called? It would not be unreasonable for the House to say to the Post Office, &quot;In these circumstances, we expect you to share information with Members of Parliament.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/20">The language gets even more confusing. In November 2005 when the Post Office decided that the Crown office was to close, it wrote a nice, lengthy and detailed letter to me. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/21" class="indent">&quot;As an organisation committed to delivering the best possible service&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/22">tell that to my constituents&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/23" class="indent">&quot;we want to do our best to meet our customers' requirements and maintain continued access to our branch network.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/24">No wonder we are confused, because the Post Office is confused. It confuses branch with Crown offices, but that is its choice. The letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/25" class="indent">&quot;Whilst the decision to change the management of the Ellesmere Port Post Office branch to Asda Store Ltd is not, in itself, subject to public consultation, we are keen to seek feedback&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/26">In writing to me, the Post Office says that the matter is not subject to public consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/27">I know that my hon. Friend the Minister treats his correspondence seriously. In a letter he wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-22">22 January</phrase> this year, he says:</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/28" class="indent">&quot;No decisions will be taken on individual closures until after public consultation has been completed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/29">Again, there is an anomaly between the position adopted by the Post Office management in its discussions with Members of Parliament and what it is saying to my hon. Friend. I do not believe for a minute that he invented that sentence without believing that the Post Office should have consulted representatives in the constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/30">The Post Office can rescue the situation and the operation in my constituency can be made more profitable. However, given the decision on the Station Road branch affected one of the most disadvantaged wards in the country let alone my area, the fact that the Post Office is prepared to ride roughshod over people such as the folk in the Westminster ward in Ellesmere Port and to use disingenuous language in correspondence with a Member of Parliament and the fact that there has been no attempt to resolve the problem by a process of examination, negotiation and studies as to whether alternative solutions can be found, I despair for the future of the Post Office. I therefore hope that my hon. Friend and his colleagues will get hold of a few people very tightly and suggest to them that because the Post Office is a public entity&mdash;it should remain so&mdash;it should act with greater consideration towards the people whom Members of the House seek to represent. When ideas come forward about alternative ways forward, it should respond positively to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1569" name="Andrew Miller">my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has been absolutely assiduous in voicing concerns about recent changes to the local provision of post office services in Ellesmere Port on behalf of his constituents. I can honestly say that over the course of the past four or five weeks, I have not had a single refreshment in the House of Commons Tea Room without my hon. Friend sitting beside me to discuss these matters. Indeed, I was almost at the point of being able to deliver his entire speech to the House myself without notes. However, in saying that, I do not wish in any way to undermine the excellent work that he has done to represent his constituents' interests to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/2">My hon. Friend spelled out clearly and fully his views and concerns about the changes that are planned by Post Office Ltd in the coming months to post office services in the Ellesmere Port town centre. The future of the post office network is relevant to every Member of the House. We all share concerns about the future provision of postal services in our constituencies. We all also recognise, as I know that my hon. Friend does, that until 1999 and the advent of the action taken by the Government, there had been underinvestment in the business for decades. Most of all, we know that advances in technology, greater mobility and changes in constituents' shopping and financial habits have resulted in a growing proportion of people simply not using post offices in the way in which they did in the past. For many reasons, custom across the network has sharply reduced, which has created a spiral of decline in certain areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/3">If the post office network is to survive and thrive in the longer term, it needs to change significantly. The Government want a post office network that can prosper on the basis of the needs of today and the future, not those of 20 or 30 years ago. However, in doing so, we also have to face up to present reality. The Government are providing &pound;150 million a year to support the rural network and will continue to do so until 2008&mdash;I am delighted to say that state aid clearance came through from the European Union only a couple of weeks ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/4">May I correct my hon. Friend on a point about the directly managed Crown offices? He implied that his correspondent from the Post Office had been mistaken in calling them branches. In fact, the correspondent was entirely correct because the proper name for them is directly managed branches, although we colloquially retain the name Crown offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/5">The Crown offices and the deprived urban area network are also losing substantial amounts. Collectively, some 500 directly managed offices have been losing &pound;70 million a year. Clearly the status quo is not sustainable in such circumstances. Several important steps to restructure and revitalise the Post Office have already been taken, but the future of the network rightly remains an issue of national debate. It is clear that there are still considerable challenges to be faced.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/6">The starting point for the Government's policy for the post office network is the performance and innovation unit report &quot;Modernising the Post Office Network&quot;. The Prime Minister commissioned that report in 1999, because it had become clear that, following decades of decline and under-investment, dramatic action was necessary to get the business on track and to secure its long-term future. We set about introducing policies that would help to achieve that, which previous Governments had totally failed to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/7">The PIU report showed very starkly that the post office network had not kept pace with the changing needs of its customers. Too many post offices had become dingy and shabby through lack of investment and were losing business. The report was widely welcomed as squaring up honestly to the challenges facing the network, and the Government accepted and implemented all 24 of its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/8">It is important to remember that the post office network has been contracting since the 1960s. Between 1979 and 1997, Conservative Governments presided over 3,500 closures, and in all that time they produced not a single policy on how to ensure that the network could continue to remain relevant into the 21st century. There have been reductions in post office usage for all sorts of reasons, and the absence of investment by the previous Government is significant, but above all changes in lifestyle and habits mean that a large proportion of our constituents do not use the Post Office as much as they used to and custom has sharply reduced. That is not a matter of the Government or some unseen market force acting against the interests of post offices and their customers; it is about ordinary people&mdash;our constituents&mdash;making personal choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/9">Research commissioned by Postcomm, the regulator for postal services, has also noted that in other countries people are also increasingly accessing services electronically, over the telephone and through the internet. In response, most countries have been remodelling their networks, usually by closing the smallest or least profitable offices and converting directly run offices to agency offices. In Germany, for instance, the number of post office branches has been reduced by 17,000 offices, which is more than the entire UK network of 14,500 offices. In Britain, other networks, such as those of the retail banks have been scaled back too. Like them, the post office network needs to adapt to changes in people's preferences and new ways of doing business. Those external changes pose big challenges to the network of post offices, which must be addressed, not ducked.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/10">We must recognise that 96 per cent. of the nation's post offices are run by sub-postmasters, who are private business people who have invested not only their own money into their businesses, but a great amount of care and effort to help the post office network achieve its highly regarded status. My hon. Friend has said that we, the taxpayer, own the Post Office. I must inform him that we, the taxpayer, own Post Office Ltd, but we do not own the 14,500 sub-post offices up and down the country, which are private businesses that enter into commercial contracts with the Post Office. The reason why it is not possible for the Post Office to make available commercially confidential figures about the viability of those offices is because it would prejudice the capacity of that private business person to sell their business in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.3/1">Neither my hon. Friend nor I would expect to be made privy to information relating to the commercial viability of any private business in our constituency. We must therefore agree to part company on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/2">Turning to the substance of my hon. Friend's argument, I have said that we must recognise that 96 per cent. of the nation's post offices are run by sub-postmasters. However, as there is declining profitability in the network as a whole, the viability of many individual offices has taken a severe knock. Decisive action in the form of the urban reinvention programme was taken to restructure a sector of the network where there was extensive over-provision with the aim of better matching supply to demand and of creating the viability necessary for a sustainable network for the future. That is why we backed Post Office Ltd's plans for managed restructuring of the urban network, which resulted in almost 2,500 office closures while ensuring that, nationally, 99.3 per cent. of people in urban areas, including Ellesmere Port, still live within a mile of their nearest post office.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/3">We now need to address the issues facing the loss-making sectors of the network that are no longer financially sustainable in their present form. It is no longer clear that the needs of customers are best served by the traditional costly and inflexible network structure, so we must find innovative and more cost-effective ways of delivering post office services. My hon. Friend diligently monitors the issues in his constituency, as he has made very clear tonight. He took a keen interest in the urban reinvention programme, probing and challenging Post Office Ltd's area plan proposals for Ellesmere Port and Neston. Ultimately, as part of that programme, two of the 17 sub-post offices in the constituency closed. I accept that he had particular concerns about force majeure events, including the attempted burglary of the Station Road sub-post office, which led to its closure ahead of schedule just before Christmas 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/4">I should like to point out to my hon. Friend that the Station Road closure was, indeed, a voluntary closure under the urban reinvention programme. A former sub-postmaster volunteered for closure at the same time as he sold the premises. He was not the post office manager at the time&mdash;indeed, he had to secure a tenant, because he could not manage the premises&mdash;but the closure was voluntary, as is the case for every single one of the 2,500 closures under the urban reinvention scheme. There was therefore a voluntary closure of Station Road by a former sub-postmaster who was selling the premises. It was not something that was done by Post Office Ltd or by the Government to the people in the area around Station Road&mdash;the closure was volunteered by the former sub-postmaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/5">More recently, my hon. Friend challenged Post Office Ltd's plans for changes in service provision in Ellesmere Port, setting out his concerns in an early-day motion tabled on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January</phrase>. As he has explained, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-06">6 February 2006</phrase>, Post Office Ltd confirmed its intention to merge the operations of the existing directly managed office in Marina walk and the existing Market Square branch in Asda into the new Asda Market Square store when rebuilding work is complete. In the interim, Asda will take over the management and operation of the Marina Walk office while the existing Asda Market Square office will close as the premises are to be demolished to enable redevelopment of the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/6">Before addressing specific details raised by my hon. Friend, there are some key points of general principle that it would be helpful to clarify. First, although the urban reinvention programme achieved its aim of better aligning post office service capacity with current levels of demand in urban areas, it was never envisaged that that would preclude further changes to the urban network as the need or opportunity arose. Secondly, the plans for Ellesmere Port relate to the combined results of the impending demolition of the present Market Square office premises&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/7" class="italic">The motion having been made at Ten o'clock, and the debate having continued for half an hour, Mr. Deputy Speaker adjourned the House without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/8" class="indent">Adjourned at half-past Ten o'clock.</p>
