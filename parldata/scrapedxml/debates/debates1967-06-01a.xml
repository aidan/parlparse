<p>My right hon. Friend fully explained this matter in his letter


of 12th May to the hon. Gentleman. As regards the use of the 8.15 p.m. train for mail posted in London up to 5 p.m., we cannot in this interval collect, date stamp, sort and make up into despatches the large number of items posted in the late afternoon and early evening.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that that is a terrible answer? What is the use of British Railways inaugurating magnificent new fast, direct services, London-Oxford-Evesham-Worcester-Malvern-Hereford, if the Post Office, another nationalised industry, will not use them for mails posted before 5 p.m. in London for delivery first mail in the morning in Worcestershire?</p>

<p>Can the hon. Gentleman explain why this journey is really necessary? Can he say whether it is entirely by road or by rail also?

<p>This area was being covered by cycle post and we introduced a motor post within the area. Although the motor van is faster than the cycles, which is understandable, it has further to go. [An HON.

The need at the moment is to talk about peace, not about war.

<p>I am obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for that Answer, but, while recognising the difficulties that he has in this problem, may I ask whether

<p>Frankly, I do not want to become involved in a propaganda exercise here. When the hon.

My concern is to give what help I can either to bring the parties together or to find some other forum in which means of ending or reducing the hostilities or moving on to talks can be found.

<p>When I asked just now who was to report to the House of Commons on the European Community negotiations the Foreign Secretary said that he had a Question on the Order Paper in reply to which he could give an answer to that supplementary question. In fact, it is not the same question that I asked. Will he now answer Question No. Q15?</p>

<p>If the Question has already been withdrawn, was it not improper for the Foreign Secretary&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I withdraw the word "improper". Was it not disingenuous of the Foreign Secretary to give that as a reason for not answering the supplementary question?</p>

<p>That is one reason why I sought your permission to rise to the right hon. Gentleman's point of order, Mr. Speaker. I did not know that the Question had been withdrawn until just now.

<p>Order. I am ruling on a point of order. The hon. Gentleman must contain himself. The right hon. Gentleman was asked a question in answering which he thought he would anticipate a later Question on today's Order Paper. I gather from what he said that he did not then know that the right hon.

<p>The question I asked is not the one that appears later on the Order Paper. I asked who will report to the House of Commons. The House knows who is handling the negotiations.

<p>I am sorry, but I still regard the right hon. Gentleman's original question&#x2014;not his present rephrasing of it&#x2014;as raising the issues involved in Question No. Q15. For that reason I did not answer it at the time. I have not sought your permission to answer it out of order, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;and I could not, since it has been withdrawn.

<p>I have been asked to reply.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is responsible for the balance of payments and I am, of course, responsible for foreign relations.

<p>I wish to make a statement on the recent disturbances in Hong Kong.<br/>
The course of events was as follows. An industrial dispute in two factories producing artificial flowers led to minor disturbances during picketing on 6th May.


But what began as a genuine labour dispute then changed its character on 11th May. It was taken up and exploited by local Communists with the aid of hooligan elements, some of whom were paid. Organised demonstrations were mounted as a direct and deliberate challenge to the authority of the Hong Kong Government. In some cases these were orderly, but in others they led to disturbances involving police action. There has been open incitement to violence and to disaffection.<br/>
Up to 17th May the demonstrations were confined to parts of Kowloon, but thereafter they spread to Victoria, on Hong Kong Island. Processions, large gatherings of people, and the sticking of posters on public buildings, while unlawful, were tolerated so long as the demonstrators remained fairly orderly, although noisy. On 20th May, disorder and violence became part of the pattern of demonstrations, and it was necessary to disperse further unlawful processions and assemblies, but orderly groups of 20 were able to present petitions at Government House.<br/>
Throughout the disturbances the Hong Kong police were able to control the situation with the minimum of force. Firearms were used on only one occasion, when a constable over whom petrol had been thrown fired three revolver shots and wounded one man. The greatest restraint was exercised throughout by the police, despite extreme provocation. The Secretary of State and I have already paid public tribute to them in Hong Kong, and I do so again now. I would like them to know how much we admire their restraint in these very difficult circumstances.<br/>
In all, 36 police and 70 demonstrators were reported as injured. Of these, three police and 14 others were admitted to hospital, but have since been discharged. There was one death, that of a bystander who was killed by a stone, and 815 persons were arrested, of whom 65 have been released or acquitted. Of the remainder, 565 have been convicted, and 185 cases are pending. All those arrested are being dealt with by the normal processes of the law. The House may feel that these facts contrast somewhat with other reports which have appeared elsewhere, alleging, for example, that on one day alone

<q>&#x2026; at least 200 compatriots were killed or severely injured".</q>
Since 22nd May there have been no demonstrations, but there have been a series of token stoppages. There has been widespread and forthright public support in Hong Kong for the measures taken by the Government to deal with violence, intimidation and hooliganism and to preserve order. The Governor has received messages of support from over 500 representative organisations. My latest information is that work at both the factories involved in the original labour dispute has now been resumed.<br/>
The House may wish to know that for some time now improvements in labour conditions have been under consideration in Hong Kong, and that I am in consultation with the Governor about changes in the labour laws, which, I think we all feel, would be timely. They include such matters as hours of work for women and young persons, and conciliation machinery.<br/>
For the future, we must hope that good sense will prevail. The Secretary of State and I are, of course, in close and constant touch with the Governor. There have been statements alleging that the Hong Kong Government have been acting out of motives of enmity towards China. I do not need to say that we, like all sections of opinion in Hong Kong, have sought, and will continue to seek, friendly relations with China. But the Government of Hong Kong have the duty to maintain peace, order and good government there, for the benefit of all sections of the community, and we have given them clear assurances of our complete support and determination to fulfil our responsibilities in Hong Kong.<br/>
Finally, I want to pay tribute to the calm and courageous leadership during these difficult times of the Governor, Sir David Trench, to the ability and determination shown by the whole Hong Kong Administration, to the spendid behaviour of the police and to the spirit of the people of Hong Kong generally.</p>

<p>I think that it will have been clear, from events of the last week or 10 days, that for all those arrested for various offences during the disturbances the perfectly normal processes of the law were followed in reference to the timing of their being brought to court and in every other aspect of the way they were treated. In other words, everything that would normally occur is occurring.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for dealing with this matter on a factual basis and I, too, join her in expressing admiration for what the police have done in Hong Kong and all down the line. Is it not a fact that the Government and the Governor have been asked for the last 12 months to do something to alleviate the economic conditions as well as the working conditions of trade unions in Hong Kong? Is it not a fact that if the Chinese people in Hong Kong were given more participation in their affairs, if not in the Executive Council then in other ways, such as the Municipal Council, and were allowed to have some say in what is happening, some of this mischief would be stopped at the source?</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend that the original labour dispute gave way to something in which there was indeed a great deal of political motivation. We must bear in mind here that there are ideological debates going on about such matters as the cultural revolution among the local Communists in Hong Kong. I have found, as my hon. Friend has obviously found, a number of interpretations here about events in Hong Kong which have been very interesting indeed and I think that many of the interpretations have been considerably relevant to what we know has been happening.</p>

<p>I agree with what the hon. Lady has said about the police in Hong Kong, but would she not agree that whatever may have been the external political influences that arose, there are two causes of the frustration? First, there are appalling housing conditions in places like Lion Rock town, the Walled City and Aberdeen, whatever may have been the housing achievements of the past?<br/>
Secondly, there is the fact that in a British Colony of 4 million, not a single, solitary soul has a vote, save for 10 members of the town council. If direct


elections, for cold war reasons, are impracticable, could we not move toward some form of indirect elections?</p>

<p>This is where it is of the utmost relevance that we get the opinions of representative organisations and individuals in Hong Kong on proposals now under consideration for changes in local government. This would introduce much of the kind of thing which the right hon. Gentleman has in mind.<br/>
May I make one thing quite clear. There is no indication, paradoxical though it may seem, that either concern about the degee of democratic representation in Hong Kong or about the working conditions have been among the motivations at this time. They may be a part of the deep background, but there is no indication that it has been at this time anything other than what my hon. Friend has said, a degree of political motivation, arising mainly from the ferment of ideas that is taking place in that part of the world.</p>

<p>All of our indications are that the origins were in Hong Kong. Local Communists in Hong Kong took opportunities which they saw arising from a genuine labour dispute. Certainly, there was later official Chinese Communist organisational involvement. For example, the Bank of China was one of the headquarters of Chinese propaganda, but in the early stages, as far as we can see, although it is very difficult to know precisely, there is no doubt that the origins were among the local Communists in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Without discussing the merits of the arguments that my hon.

<p>May I say that I know how very much the tributes that have been paid to the police and to the Governor, on both sides of the House, will be appreciated in Hong Kong.<br/>
As to the involvement of the Bank of China, the Governor has certain powers to deal as he thinks best with a matter of this kind. One of the most effective things that he did was to counter the propaganda from the Bank of China by what he called "light-hearted Chinese music". We must leave it to the Governor to exercise his discretion, knowing that he has powers to do whatever is necessary to be effective.</p>

<p>Would the hon. Lady, besides stimulating further legislation in the labour field, have a look at the educational and youth services? Is she aware that a great number of the rioters leave school at the age of 12 and that, by existing legislation, they are not allowed to work until they are 16?

<p>This is a very serious problem, as is housing, which the right hon. Member the Leader of the Liberal Party mentioned. We have in Hong Kong the situation of an exploding population, in which tremendous achievements have


been made in the last few years, but where, even so, it is difficult to keep up with the needs. Certainly, one of the needs is for more educational opportunities for secondary school children. It is a question of buildings and teachers, as elsewhere.<br/>
This is a very general problem in many parts of the world, where one has the effect of a population explosion. The Government in Hong Kong are very much aware of this and are doing their best. I think that they are achieving some remarkable success in trying to minimise this problem.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 2, in page 2, line 7, to leave out from ' Act' to the end of line 13.<br/>
The Committee will be aware that this Amendment seeks to change the Clause as it now stands and, in particular, to alter it with regard to renewal of the regulator powers. In moving the Amendment, we are effectively asking the Chancellor to justify the perpetuation of those powers. Ever since the regulator was introduced in 1961 the House of Commons has been fortunate in having

a number of illuminating debates which have customarily, though not always, taken place on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill," but on this occasion we felt for a number of reasons that it would be more appropriate to table an Amendment.<br/>
The first reason is that the Clause is in a more complicated form than is normally used to refer to the regulator. The usual form is simply to renew the regulator powers, whereas this Clause does a number of other things. In particular, it consolidates the powers under last year's regulator.<br/>
The second reason is that, as it now stands, the Clause gives to the Chancellor of the Exchequer somewhat greater powers than he had under the previous arrangements. Effectively, what he would have under the regulator if the Committee were not to accept the Amendment would be the right to increase or decrease Purchase Tax by 10 per cent., but this is 10 per cent. on an amount larger than it was last year, because the Chancellor of the Exchequer has meanwhile increased a number of Purchase Tax items by 10 per cent. Therefore, this is in some ways an extension of the regulator rather than a renewal.<br/>
The third reason is very important. We must appreciate that the regulator is effectively a convenience for the Government. Without the regulator, if the Government felt, during the course of the following year, that it was necessary to make a change in the Purchase Tax, they would have to ask the House to pass new legislation to do so. We might well consider the regulator as a convenient arrangement for the Government of the day, and one of the reasons why it was introduced originally&#x2014;</p>

<p>I should not like my hon. Friend to mislead any member of the Committee. It was ruled 10 years ago by Mr. Speaker of the day that Purchase Tax rates could be raised on the Adjournment of the House, for the precise reason that no new legislation is needed. It may be done by Treasury Order.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend, but my point is that if we are to give the Chancellor of the Exchequer the powers we are now considering it is right and proper that they should be debated


adequately and a reasonable justification given for them.<br/>
First, I should like to clarify on the size of the regulator. There can be no doubt that the powers we are now asked to give are very considerable. The present Prime Minister, when shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, described them as among the very largest powers that had ever been taken by a Chancellor of the Exchequer in time of peace. I should be grateful to the Financial Secretary if he would clarify precisely the sums involved.<br/>
I pointed out last year that the taxation affected was divided into five main groups. The figures given last year of the estimated yield in 1966&#x2013;67 were alcohol, &#x00A3;646 million; tobacco, &#x00A3;1,030 million; oil and petrol, &#x00A3;830 million; Purchase Tax, &#x00A3;670 million; and other duties, &#x00A3;20 million. That made a grand total of &#x00A3;3,200 million. Ten per cent. of that sum, plus or minus, would come to &#x00A3;320 million. In his reply&#x2014;admittedly rather late at night&#x2014;the Chancellor said that I had somewhat over estimated the amount and that it was something under &#x00A3;200 million. I appreciate that the right hon. Gentleman could not then give precise figures, but with this sort of difference between our estimates we must know exactly what the amounts of the individual components are. I should be grateful for an accurate reply.<br/>
There is also a drafting point. I raise this question, because although I am sure that it is in order, these things sometimes do not go as well as they might. For example, Clause 20 appears to correct one of last year's drafting mistakes. I will be grateful if the Financial Secretary can confirm that although the regulator is to renew the amount of the duties that have gone up in the interim and the whole thing is embodied in a single Clause, there is no problem in renewing the full 10 per cent. on the increased amount.<br/>
Section 9 of the parent Act of 1961 very clearly stated that the purpose of the regulator was to influence the economy, if it should appear expedient to the Treasury to do so, with a view to regulating the balance between supply and demand in the economy; in other words the relationship between the real resources or capacity or the United King-

dom economy and the demand for these resources. It is true that for a very long time the purpose of the Government has been not merely to raise sufficient taxes to meet the expenditure which the Government will incur, but to adjust demand to resources and, through the fiscal mechanism, to attain a number of other objectives such as full employment, restraint of inflation, and so on.<br/>
4.15 p.m.<br/>
But the Committee should be clear that though that is the ostensible purpose of the regulator, there should be some limits on its use. There would be a case, for example, for the regulator to be used if some emergency arose during the year which could not reasonably have been foreseen or, alternatively, to smooth the passage of the economy if there would otherwise be some sudden change in the level of taxation, or in the level of demand on the economy. On the other hand, I suggest that it is not right to use the regulator to make increases or decreases in taxation that could properly have been included in the Finance Bill and debated on the basis of the fact that they could be foreseen.<br/>
We very definitely raised this point last year in the debate on the regulator, when we pointed out that it was likely that the economy was becoming overheated and that the effect of the Selective Employment Tax in taking steam out of the economy would be deferred. The Chancellor of the Exchequer then felt that all he needed was renewal of the regulator powers, and he saw no reason to take action through the Finance Bill. We had that debate in June, and within a matter of weeks the right hon. Gentleman produced the July measures and introduced the use of the regulator to control the economy.<br/>
It would be wrong for us to feel that the regulator is an instrument to be used to meet foreseeable circumstances. Rather, it is an instrument to be used only to smooth the passage of the economy during the year or to meet unforeseen emergencies. For this reason, we very definitely believe that today we should have an indication of what the Government think the course of the economy is likely to be over the next year or 18 months.<br/>
There has been increasing pressure on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to publish explicitly the various components of his forecasts. I hope that on this occasion he will see fit to go a stage further in improving the amount of information we have. This need has been explicitly recognised. The <i>Financial Times</i> recognised it shortly after last year's debate on the regulator, when under the heading:
<q>Squeezing the Facts from the Chancellor</q>
Mr. Sam Brittain advocated full publication of official forecasts. Other people&#x2014;for example, Mr. Andrew Shon-field in the current issue of <i>Encounter</i> under the title "The Pragmatic Illusion"&#x2014;attack the right hon. Gentleman's reluctance to give more information on his forecasts, while this week's edition of the <i>Economist</i> puts forward the same argument. If we are to decide whether the regulator ought to be renewed we ought to know what expectations the Chancellor has about the economy.<br/>
The disadvantages of not doing this are very considerable. The <i>Economist,</i> in the article to which I have referred, points out that if this is not done there is a grave danger that, far from foreign opinion in regard to sterling being reassured, the fact that the Chancellor is not giving a coherent forecast leads to a mistaken view that sterling is not strong. This, I suspect, was somewhat the case at the time of the regulator debate last year. It is also true that the whole of Government thinking tends to be not in quantitative terms but in terms of vague generalities. Therefore, events arise which should have been foreseen where the regulator would not have to be used, but it has to be used because of the lack of quantitative analysis which with an explicit statement of the forecast, would have been able to be appraised by the public at large.<br/>
Real resources are not considered, but only the monetary magnitudes. We are dealing with ordinary accounting concepts and a few figures here and there rather than with major forecasts. This is particularly true in the case of the regulator, where the Chancellor is given the option of using these enormous powers. The real reason is that the country has a right to know when taxes are being imposed,

particularly by the use of the regulator, what estimates the Government make about the authority for imposing taxes and the need to impose taxes to maintain the economy in a state of balance.<br/>
Again, as the <i>Economist</i> points out, the Revenue estimates presented to Parliament are necessarily dependent on the Government's estimate of what the money income will be. If these are made explicit it is unlikely that unforeseen events will occur which could have been avoided. I hope that we shall have a comprehensive answer, because we cannot hope to have the regulator balancing supply and demand if the Chancellor is not prepared to say what he thinks supply or demand are likely to be.<br/>
The counter arguments are surely false. The first is that perhaps the Chancellor's estimate will turn out to be wrong. That is quite possible, but it does not appear to inhibit him. I shall not mention the National Plan again,but it did not seem to inhibit the framers of the Plan or the Chancellor in giving the Budget out-turn. This is a false reason for saying that he should not publish forecasts. The Chancellor forecasts many things, some of which turn out to be right and many wrong, but that is not a reason for not setting out forecasts in a coherent way.<br/>
The second reason is that if a forecast of a wage increase is given it will encourage wage claims, but the Chancellor has already suggested what the change in wage rates is likely to be. None of these is really a coherent reason. Because of this, while we appreciate the right hon. Gentleman's attachment to the "Silent Service" and his nautical reference in his Budget statement to "Steady as she goes," he should consider being rather more forthcoming in this respect.<br/>
One thing needs particular attention. We have to consider the need for a coherent view to be presented by the Chancellor. Hitherto, he has been much more forthcoming than some previous Chancellors, but the statements he has made have tended to be rather piecemeal. Individual figures have been forecast and they have not always been for the same particular period. The essential point is that we need to know all the variables, because otherwise we cannot work out whether the forecast as a whole hangs together.<br/>
The crucial element is the forecast of consumption expenditure, for two reasons. The first is because this is much the largest element of demand for which the Chancellor may plan for using the regulator. Secondly, it is because it is the element of demand which the regulator affects. To get an overall picture we need to analyse the whole pattern of demand, consumption, investment, either current or capital, and Government spending and exports.<br/>
In winding up the Budget debate this year, the Chancellor, I think, was genuinely attempting to be more forthcoming. He said that he had been asked to give a forecast of incomes. It would be more accurate to say that he had been asked for a forecast of incomes and consumption. It is the relationship between these elements which is vitally important. One makes a first estimate of the gross national product and works out what it means in terms of personal incomes and relates that to disposable income and to a price index and real disposable income. This, after allowing for saving consumers' expenditure, gives the final consumption. This then gives the gross national product. Once one cuts out one part of the circle it is impossible to tell whether the odd statements which the Chancellor makes from time to time giving the individual components of demand are consistent and whether they hang together.<br/>
Therefore, it is very important indeed that we should have a figure for consumption both because it is the consumption which will be directly affected by the regulator if the Chancellor uses it, and secondly, because consumption is the main element in the demand which the regulator is designed to control either upward or downward. In this respect, we should give some attention to individual components. The Chancellor has always been concerned only with the overall picture, for example, the question of motor car sales on which I know the hon. Member will be particularly interested&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes.<br/>
Turning from consumption to the elements of demand we should consider also

the position concerning investment. This is an extremely gloomy picture. It seems that between 1966&#x2013;67 the fall in real terms will be something like minus 10 per cent. in manufacturing, distribution and services. We need to know what the expectations are in this respect. The pattern is certainly very sad indeed. Again, the Chancellor has been more forthcoming. In a Written Answer on 16th February he gave some information which suggested that the change in public expenditure investment would be plus 8&#x00BD; per cent. for 1966&#x2013;67 and again plus 8&#x00BD; per cent. in 1967&#x2013;68. Nevertheless, the overall picture will be something like plus 2 per cent. over 18 months, when public expenditure is getting an increasing emphasis as against private expenditure.<br/>
I turn for a moment to supply because, as I said, the regulator is designed to limit the resources of the economy or supply to the actual demand for those resources. We are still very concerned about the Chancellor's estimate of a 3 per cent. growth rate. I do not think that the Chancellor met this point in his winding-up speech on the Budget. He has said that he expects to see a 3 per cent. growth rate in capacity between December, 1966, and December, 1967, but he has not given us the figure for the year on year.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
In winding-up the debate on the regulator last year, the Chancellor suggested that I should have due regard for arithmetic. The relationship between these two is, I imagine, merely a matter of arithmetic, but we need some facts to go on. Therefore, I should be grateful if we could be told what the year on year figure for growth will be. Unless we are told this figure, we cannot tell whether the Chancellor's estimate, for which he has given us no real foundation, is consistent with those other outside forecasts which suggest that the rate of growth in capacity will be very much less.<br/>
The Chancellor's December to December figure of 3 per cent. compares with the figure of 1&#x00B7;8 per cent. which the National Institute published in its last review&#x2014;a difference of about &#x00A3;300 million. We cannot decide whether to give powers of the kind contained in the Clause, and which we seek to amend, unless we know where we are to a closer


degree than &#x00A3;300 million here or there. It is, moreover, &#x00A3;300 million of the taxpayer's money. Therefore, I hope that the Chancellor will tell us what the year on year figures are and whether he has any reason to suppose that his forecast has changed since that time.<br/>
Finally, I think that we need to decide, in considering whether to accept the Amendment, what the circumstances are in which the Chancellor will actually use the regulator and in response to what indicators he would propose to do so. The country is at present in an extremely difficult situation, which was summed up, perhaps, in the concluding paragraphs of the London and Cambridge Economic Bulletin for March, 1967 in this way:
<q>Clearly, he"&#x2014;</q>
that is, the Chancellor&#x2014;
<q>need not now add to the overall tax burden to choke off an excessive growth of demand. Equally he cannot, in our view, reduce taxes in any appreciable way without the danger of stimulating a more rapid growth of demand than the external balance (and our creditors' good will) can sustain. In spite of protestations to the contrary, we see no evidence that the existing policies and practices have as yet achieved any significant improvement in our underlying rate of growth of productivity or in our propensities to import and our ability to export.</q>
It would seem that the Chancellor is in a dilemma. It is right that we should ask this question: in what circumstances, if he cannot go up and he cannot go down, would he expect to use the regulator during the period of the next year or 18 months? If unemployment continues to rise, it would be a reasonable assumption, judging from previous Chancellors, that he would use the regulator to reduce Purchase Tax and to increase consumption. Or, if the balance of payments seemed less good to him than he was hoping, he might take measures which would increase taxation by use of the regulator and, therefore, divert resources, as he might hope, to the export markets.<br/>
But what will the Chancellor do if these two things happen together? Does he propose to put the regulator up, or does he propose to put the regulator down? At this point, we need to know very definitely what the Chancellor's objectives are. The general objectives of the regulator are set out in the parent Act. We are now in a situation where

we are not at all clear what the Chancellor's objectives are. Has he, as the popular Press and hon. Members have suggested in the past, been converted completely to the Paish doctrine, and does he propose to use the regulator to achieve the level of unemployment which has been advocated by Professor Paish? If this is so, when we come to consider the Amendment we need to have a clear statement upon this point.<br/>
Moreover, what does the Chancellor propose to do in using the regulator as to the relationship between private and public investment? He told us in his Budget speech that, if by any chance private investment should increase, he would rein back public expenditure. The fact of the matter is that the right hon. Gentleman will recognise that it is extremely difficult to rein back public expenditure in the short run. If the Chancellor finds in the next year that private expenditure increases and that public expenditure cannot be reined back, does he propose to use the regulator to reduce consumption and, therefore, provide a gap which can be used to increase investment; or does he propose to use some other means? The Committee has a right to know whether the Chancellor proposes to use the regulator in circumstances where he finds that private investment is rising.<br/>
I have asked the Chancellor a great many questions, but I do not think that it is unreasonable, when we are asked to approve a measure of this kind, and when we are considering an Amendment of this kind, which suggests that the Chancellor should not have the use of the regulator, that the Committee should examine very closely indeed what the Chancellor's views are, both as to his objectives and as to the circumstances in which he would use the regulator, and particularly what his views of the economy are. I hope that we shall have estimates from the Financial Secretary on the Chancellor's outlook for the future, and that we shall also have answers to the other various questions which I have asked, before we come to consider whether the Committee should or should not accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) certainly made a meal of that. He started by telling us that one reason why he and his right


hon. and hon. Friends have tabled the Amendment is that the regulator was used last year. This is a very weak argument, because the small difference in percentage has no bearing whatsoever as regards the use of the regulator on demand. It is hard to understand why right hon. and hon. Members opposite have tabled the Amendment other than that it is probing or searching, or whatever term the hon. Gentleman cares to use. If he really means to press it to a Division, I shall find it extremely difficult to understand. Then it will begin to look as though the Opposition are standing on their heads the arguments used by the right hon. and learned Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd) when he introduced this measure.<br/>
The crux of the argument on the regulator was put rather better by the hon. Gentleman from the Front Bench last year, when he said this:
<q>&#x2026; before the Committee approves the Clause it should look at the question in the light of what the economic situation is likely to be, because we should grant this power only if we consider it justified in the light of what is likely to happen both to the level of demand and resources in the United Kingdom."&#x2014;[OFFICAL REPORT, 16th June, 1966, Vol. 729, c. 1831.]</q>
The hon. Gentleman made that point very clearly last year, because it was a shorter speech made late at night.<br/>
The crux is whether we should grant this power for that reason, or whether we should have the additional regulator&#x2014;the Purchase Tax and excise regulator&#x2014;because it is a useful measure, as was outlined by the right hon. and learned Member for Wirral when it was first introduced.<br/>
I will take, first, the argument as to whether the hon. Gentleman is right in asserting that we should grant this power to the Chancellor only if the economic circumstances are such as would seem to warrant it. The hon. Gentleman and others opposite could congratulate themselves on the fact that they were right when they agreed not to vote against the measure last year because, they said, they knew that the Chancellor would need to use it. They were right in forecasting that the regulator would be used, but that is not exactly the same as saying that the fact that it was used is right. Nor does it mean that the Opposition have some

unique powers of forecasting, merely because they were able to forecast one or two months ahead of the debate which we had last year. It would take a much wiser man or woman than many here in the Committee, or, indeed, in the country, to forecast the pattern of demand and the general economic picture over the next 12 months, which is what the hon. Gentleman was waxing so eloquent about.<br/>
When the hon. Gentleman says that we should grant the power to use the regulator to the Chancellor, and that it should be used, only if there are unforeseen circumstances, I immediately ask: foreseen or unforeseen by whom? Who is able to foresee what circumstances are likely to be in the next 12 months? As I say, there are very few who could foresee whether we are likely to have to use the regulator, not that it is such a powerful weapon or a great power which we are giving to the Chancellor, although, as I shall try to show, it has considerable importance.<br/>
One can hazard a guess about what might happen in the next 12 months. Very many hon. Members and forecasters outside are keen to hazard guesses about what will happen. They are likely to be right as often as not, perhaps three times out of four or even nine times out of ten. Even an uninformed person could hazard a guess and be right about the use of the regulator. In a sense, it is an even chance whether we use the regulator or not. It is rather like guessing whether something is Stork or butter; without even tasting it, one has an even chance of being right.<br/>
One can guess&#x2014;and many do&#x2014;whether we are likely to have to use the regulator, but it would be a foolish man who said definitely that we should or should not need to use it in the next 12 months. It would, therefore, be most unwise to exclude use of this power from the Chancellor from the standpoint of our overall control of the economy. Guessing about the economy is a hazardous business. There are many factors apart from normal economic factors, which are difficult enough in themselves. When one thinks of what effect there could be on our economy from the Middle East situation, the Hong Kong situation, the Common Market situation or the Nigeria situation, one begins to appreciate how difficult it is to foresee&#x2014;and this is what the hon. Gentleman wants&#x2014;whether we


shall have to use the regulator in the next 12 months.</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman will find when he looks at HANSARD tomorrow, he has misunderstood my argument. Among the several points I made, the one relevant to the argument which he is now raising is that, unless we know what the Chancellor's view is, we cannot tell whether he proopses to use it for something which is foreseeable, or, at least, which he foresees, or for something which he does not foresee.</p>

<p>I think that even my right hon. Friend would agree that what he foresees as likely in the next 12 months is not likely to be any better as a forecast or guess than most other economists' guesses. This is a serious point. I doubt that there are many people who could be certain. They may make a forecast, as my right hon. Friend and others have done, but there are few who could be so certain as to say, "I shall only use the regulator if such-and-such happens". That is really asking too much of any Chancellor, no matter how able, as I believe the present Chancellor to be.<br/>
There is an important question here, a question more of principle. The hon. Gentleman referred to what was said in 1961 by my right hon. Friend the present Prime Minister, and reference was made to it last year as well. My right hon. Friend made a very important point on that occasion. Speaking of the regulator, he said:
<q>But it oversteps the margins of the relation between the Government and the House in the matter of taxing power."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 4th May, 1961; Vol. 639, c. 1641.]</q>
Should any Government have such powers at all? As the hon. Gentleman says, this is giving power to a Chancellor not to raise that amount of revenue, but to be able to do so quickly and very much more easily than he could otherwise.<br/>
As to amount, the hon. Gentleman is quite right to get away from some of the obscurities we had last year, with all sorts of figures mentioned&#x2014;&#x00A3;300 million, &#x00A3;200 million and &#x00A3;150 million. One understands some of the reasons for the differences. In the first place, the figure, according to the 1967&#x2013;68 Financial Statement, is based only from last July, so it is not a whole year, and the figure is

only &#x00A3;103 million because tobacco was excluded. But what is more important is how much the Chancellor can raise by the regulator, the total amount which he can raise. My understanding is that he could raise about &#x00A3;360 million. I would very much like to know precisely what the figure is. The Committee is entitled to know, if we are to give this power for use of the regulator, just how much money is involved in it.<br/>
4.45 p.m.<br/>
The next question is whether we should give power to use the regulator so that action can be taken quickly and easily, or whether we should leave it so that, other than for Purchase Tax, on Excise matters the Chancellor would have to come to the House with a new Bill. Nowadays, although, in theory, it is a matter for the House of Commons to decide, in practice it is one decided by the party with the majority in the House, so perhaps there is no great difference between giving this power under the regulator and insisting on the Chancellor bringing in a new Bill. Nevertheless, although that may be so in practice, I do not believe that we should give this power lightly. There is always a problem in a democracy in striking the right balance between the powers which the Executive should have in controlling a complex economy such as ours and adequate safeguards for this Committee and the House of Commons.<br/>
The majority party, in practice, ought not to give power to exercise the regulator too lightly or too easily to a Chancellor, but this is not an argument for not giving it at all. It is a dangerous argument, in spite of the way the House of Commons works in practice, to say that a Government, democratically elected, should not be given adequate powers to control the economy, and one of the useful weapons which any Government can have today is an additional power of regulator such as these provisions have perpetuated since 1961.<br/>
I have recently reread the 1961 debates. Some very good and cogent arguments were deployed by Conservative Members at that time. I cannot help wondering whether the present Opposition any longer accept those arguments. There were arguments of principle as to whether the regulator should be given at all. The right hon. Gentleman the


Member for Birmingham, Handsworth (Sir E. Boyle), then Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and his right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Wirral both made a powerful case, in my view, for any Chancellor having this sort of additional power to control the economy.<br/>
I am wondering whether the Opposition will now vote for their Amendment. The hon. Gentleman did not say one way or the other. If they were to vote in that way against the arguments which were presented so cogently in 1961, they would make themselves idiots in the process.</p>

<p>I agree very much with my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) that, if we are to make a clear and sensible judgment about the renewal of the regulator and this Amendment, we must give an airing to the question of the evolution of demand in the short and medium term, and press the Chancellor to be a little more explicit about the view which he takes.<br/>
I do not go along with the hon. Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett) in the rather tortuous argument which he put. It seems to me quite fair to say, "Let us at least have a general view about what would happen". No one expects the Chancellor to be 100 per cent. right, but it is a genuine asset in considering public policy and the development of business decisions in industry if we have a clear general view about what is likely to happen. Of course, it may well be overtaken by all kinds of events, but that does not destroy my hon. Friend's argument. Therefore, in examining the question of the regulator it is fair that we should look closely at the Chancellor's short-term strategy as it now stands in relation to the way he set it out a month or so ago at Budget time.<br/>
Whatever the Chancellor's views about long-term economic strategy, the long term which we curiously never seem to reach under this Administration, he can hardly be happy about the way the short-term strategy he outlined in his Budget is evolving and about the background to the regulator. The unemployment situation remains extremely tricky and dangerous, and it looks as though unemploy-

ment may be rising above the deadline or ceiling of 2 per cent. that was laid down. That seems to me an undesirable trend in our economy and economic policy.<br/>
Secondly, the export situation in the immediate short term, which is the relevant background to the use of the regulator and other demand controls, is not shaping up in the way some of the more optimistic forecasts from Ministers on the Treasury Bench indicated only a few months ago.<br/>
Thirdly, as my hon. Friend rightly emphasised, there is the critical question of the steep decline in private investment, which is supposed to pick up next year but is at present falling very fast. It is difficult to over-estimate the damage to the sensitive plant of private investment which that does to the whole shape of the economy and the present trend.<br/>
What is happening with this sharp decline in private investment is that the Chancellor is reducing the room in which the regulator or any other controls of demand in the short term can be used. One cannot just say that private investment will pick up again and assume that no damage will have been done. In the meantime the whole process of innovation is being slowed up, and processes and methods are not being installed that should be installed, which will have a direct effect on our export performance in the coming years.<br/>
That is closely relevant to the question of how the regulator should be used and the trend of demand in the coming months. The estimate from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research is that in 1970 private investment will be running at a rate of only 12 per cent. higher than in 1964. That is a tragic commentary on all our efforts to increase the efficiency of the economy and private investment, the elbow room within which the Chancellor must operate and control the economy and use the regulators, including that which we are considering.<br/>
That is the trend which the Committee will agree must be reversed, and there should be a measure of reflation. That was not the Chancellor's immediate judgment at Budget time, but the general hint which seemed to emerge from what he said, was that he looked forward in due


course to a measure of reflation. He said that he wanted:
<q>&#x2026; a steady run up to a higher rate of growth &#x2026;".&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 17th April, 1967; Vol. 745, c. 205.]</q>
The question we still face today, and will face on each Amendment dealing with this kind of matter, is how we have that steady run-up to a higher rate of growth without running into another balance of payments crisis in the next few weeks or months.<br/>
As we look at this judgment on the evolution of demand, we see that it is, as my hon. Friend said, a judgment and strategy based on some very fine arithmetic. I have very grave doubts, particularly when considering the regulator, whether we have the knowledge, statistics, skill or understanding in our economy at present to proceed on those fine arithmetical judgments in making our economic strategy. Basically what is needed&#x2014;this is a crude and not a scientific judgment&#x2014;is a big revival in private investment. That is the central point of an economic policy designed to increase efficiency, raise exports and achieve the other aims which hon. Members on both sides of the Committee are always outlining.<br/>
The question before us in examining the regulator and its renewal is how to fit into the jigsaw of the existing components of demand that essential boost to private investment. This subject has been raised before in the House and we shall have to follow it through in the Committee. How do we fit the boost to private investment into the unfolding pattern of demand within the overall limit which the Chancellor has given us as his estimate of a 3 per cent. rate of growth of productive potential? These are essential and relevant questions to our judgment on the renewal of the regulator under the Amendment.<br/>
We must again question, as did my hon. Friend, that 3 per cent. rate of growth of productive capacity. I accept the very important proposition that I read in the recent D.E.A. memorandum, "Future Work on Planning". The authors, from the Department of Economic Affairs, wrote:
<q>The greater the growth of demand the greater will be the increase in productivity, because, for example, of greater economies of

scale and because a faster growth of demand will justify the installation of a greater number of up-to-date machines.</q>
That is an extremely important policy statement, or statement relating to policy, coming from the Department of Economic Affairs, and it is very relevant to the question of immediate development of demand and regulators and controls to be used on it. It is saying that higher demand as from now and a higher rate of growth of demand will lead to lower costs and more efficiency. That drives a coach and four through the whole concept of fixed productive potential, divinely ordained and brought down on tablets from Mount Sinai. It says that where Government operates on demand it will influence the productive potential or capacity of the economy.<br/>
It would be unkind to harp on intellectual inconsistencies in the Government's economic policies at this stage, but I hope that less emphasis is put on the whole question of there being that 3 per cent. productive potential, the elbow room within which demand can be controlled and operated. That was the first point I wanted to make when looking at the question of immediate variations in demand in the coming months and the use of the regulator.<br/>
Secondly, as my hon. Friend said, there is the whole question of how the components of demand will move, I have already mentioned private investment and I do not want to go over the whole range of others but to deal with the one where we are supposed to know exactly what will happen and where it has been said that we know roughly how it will unfold&#x2014;the development of public expenditure. It is right in examining the use of the regulator and the Amendment that we should look fairly closely at that component. It may well be that if we can produce more sensible ideas in this sphere the elbow room for the Chancellor will be enlarged to that extent, and the need to run the economy in the continuous cliff-hanging drama of a sensitive touch here and a sensitive touch there will be correspondingly reduced, because I doubt whether we have the equipment or sensitivity to run an economy in that way.<br/>
A precise estimate has been made of the growth of public expenditure for the coming year. Throughout the coming


debates the Committee should ask itself whether that component need really be such a fixed and given quantity and whether we must be resigned to the tremendous growth of public expenditure, whether it is something we must grin and bear because basically it cannot be controlled. If that is so, instruments such as the regulator must, of course, be given closer consideration. But if it is not so and we can see ways of varying public expenditure within the general growth of demand we should do so.<br/>
That is the one real growth area in the picture of demand at present, it is the one area where demand is whizzing up. Unless we can make sensible suggestions on the cost of Government and the whole range of public expenditure we are dooming ourselves to the kind of economic policy which rely on the regulator.</p>

<p>I accept your Ruling, Sir Eric. I was trying to argue that, in order to assess the background against which the regulator must be used, we must have some idea of the way in which it is thought demand will move and the way perhaps in which the different components of demand could move with various changes in policy. I accept, however, that I may have been wandering into areas beyond that, and I shall try and confine my remarks to the question of the Chancellor's short-term strategy, movements of demand and the renewal of the regulator.<br/>
There is no doubt that the future trend of overall demand and the use of the regulator are much related to the question of the way in which different components of demand will move and, as I said in mentioning the cost of government and public spending, a major contribution could be made towards easing the situation in which the Chancellor has to operate, and, in particular, overcoming the conundrum of what to do about private investment&#x2014;given that public ex-

penditure is rising faster&#x2014;by a far more intensive and firmer policy in the public sector of cost reduction and management improvements than anything we have seen so far.<br/>
I know that there are those who say that policy determines expenditure and that no great economies can be achieved in the public sector except by changes of policy, but I believe that we could achieve our existing public policies by considerable improvements in our management of the public sector of a kind which would mean significant easement to the pressure of demand and give more elbow room to the Chancellor in the operation of the regulator. We have just had a very interesting report on the management of local government.</p>

<p>I will accept your Ruling, Sir Eric, and leave aside the questions which I wanted to deal with and which are relevant to the evolution of demand but are, as you rightly said, outside the scope of this debate.<br/>
The Chancellor has decided on orthodox strategy, as he said last month. He will now no doubt feel that the regulator is part of the equipment he needs. He has propounded the doctrine of what I call the "sensitive touch"&#x2014;constant intervention in the economy. No doubt he will be using the regulator as part of that doctrine. I believe that he will have the greatest difficulty, as have past Chancellors, in getting this fine arithmetic right.<br/>
I believe that the central aim of economic policy and the renewal of the regulator should be seen against this background and should be to get out of the cliff-hanging atmosphere in which our economic policy has to be conducted. I believe that, if we looked both at the questions I raised earlier and at the overall components of public demand, particularly public sector spending, we should be in a better position to make a judgment on the regulator and the Government would be better able to take some


initiatives in economic policy and move out of the situation of masterly inactivity for which they are so spendidly equipped.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Guildford (Mr. David Howell) is asking for a measure of reflation over the next few months. The Amendment, designed to remove the regulator, would remove not only the power to increase the revenue but the power to reduce it and thereby the power to initiate reflation of a particular kind at any time over the next 10 or eleven months.<br/>
I find the Amendment hardly serious. This power must remain with the Chancellor during the period between Budgets. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] I shall show why. The reference by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) to the increase in the amount that can be raised by the regulator, because of the 10 per cent. that has already been incorporated into Purchase Tax, was rather trivial. In the case of the 25 per cent. rate of Purchase Tax, by raising it to 27&#x00BD; per cent. one is increasing the amount that the regulator can raise by only one-quarter of 1 per cent. In the case of the 10 per cent. rate, it is 0&#x00B7;1 per cent. These are hardly great increases in the powers of the Chancellor.</p>

<p>No. If the hon. Gentleman looks at the financial statement, he will see that 27&#x00BD; per cent. is 2&#x00BD; per cent. more than 25 per cent. and that 10 per cent. of this is 0&#x00B7;25 per cent.<br/>
This fine adjustment my right hon. Friend will need to make use of, given the case, which is becoming more readily accepted, that annual Budgets are not enough, that economic circumstances change, as the hon. Member for Guildford pointed out, and that it is difficult to be sure in advance over a long period that one has the situation just right. The right hon. Member for Barnet (Mr. Maudling) got it disastrously wrong on one occasion and the right hon. and learned Member for Wirrall (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd) knew that he could not get it right. The hon. Member for Worthing, if the country were ever so unfortunate as to have him conducting its economic affairs, would not get it right either.<br/>
This Amendment would reduce the ability of the Chancellor to lower the amount of revenue raised as well as to increase it. But the downward use of the regulator is a weapon that my right hon. Friend may possibly have to use for the first time, because of the possible need for reflation between now and the next Budget.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hey-wood and Royton (Mr. Barnett) and I put down an Amendment which would have increased the amount of the regulator that could be of help in reflation. It would have allowed my right hon. Friend to increase the rates of Purchase Tax and Excise Duty by 10 per cent. and reduce them by 15 per cent. Unfortunately, that Amendment was not selected but I think that the Committee must accept that the ability to reduce taxation should be granted to a Chancellor of the Exchequer perhaps rather more easily than the ability to increase it.<br/>
This is a very pressing problem because the amount of deflation may well prove to be rather larger than is required, and it may well be that reflationary policies will have to be pursued fairly shortly. No Chancellor could forgo certain advantages of weapons at his disposal.<br/>
But the need to reduce the rates of Purchase Tax and Excise Duty may well be important for another reason&#x2014;that the Chancellor now has many other taxes at his disposal. The introduction of Corporation Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Selective Employment Tax, added to the taxes which were already in existence, has given him a much wider range of instruments to use. As a result, it is possible Purchase Tax could more easily be reduced over the next 12 months.<br/>
The hon. Member for Worthing pointed out that there were always certain unforeseeable emergencies and I assume from that that the Chancellor might be allowed by him to use the regulator on such occasions. Of course, it is largely for unforeseeable emergencies that the Chancellor needs some instruments. The hon. Member for Guildford doubted whether we had the equipment for so sensitive a control, but the whole point is that we need this sensitive control of the economy because of the very narrow constraints of our balance of payments position.<br/>
To remove what sensitive control we have at such a time would be extremely wrong. The Chancellor has very little room for manoeuvre because of the balance of payments situation. He will succeed in getting his 3 per cent, increase in growth rate only if exports expand at the rate for which we hope, if imports are restrained at about the present or even below the present level, and if improvements in productivity are obtained. In so tight a situation my right hon. Friend cannot be deprived of this very important instrument.<br/>
If he were to be deprived of it, the consequences would be that we would have to return to much more stringent hire-purchase restrictions with the far more difficult position into which they would put certain manufacturing industries, discriminating quite unfairly between one industry and another solely because it is administratively more convenient to operate deflation in this way. He would have to place far more reliance on monetary measures with great difficulties for increasing industrial investment which we want to see, and there would be certain other disadvantages if other kinds of taxation were introduced.<br/>
The regulator is required because in these sophisticated days we do not expect the Chancellor to get it all right. Even if he were to get it all right, the economy is not level throughout the year. The economy does not operate at a steady level from April to April. There are certain rises and falls. If he is to get any sensitive control, getting it right means getting it right over the whole of the period and not just at the end of the period when he has shown that his sums have all added up. This is not control. Budget totting exercises of this sort died long ago. What a Chancellor needs is to get it right throughout the whole of the 12 months. To deprive him of this weapon would be a very dangerous step.</p>

<p>I began to suspect that the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) was attempting to pull the collective leg of the Committee. It was only the serious expression on his face tha finally convinced me otherwise. He talked to us quite seriously about the Chancellor's unlimited opportunities for reducing taxation, as though the Chancellor had made a habit of it.

The right hon. Gentleman is distinguished for many things&#x2014;I do not want to go into such painful matters now&#x2014;but the Chancellor is not distinguished for the use he has made so far of the opportunities before him of reducing taxation.<br/>
The hon. Member went on to entertain us further with the cautionary remark that we do not expect in these sophisticated days that the Chancellor should get it all right. I do not think I am breaking a confidence in any way when I say that such advice to the Committee was not necessary, because it is not a question of expecting at all. We know very well the Chancellor will not get it all right. What horrifies us is that the Chancellor only too often does not get anything right. For the hon. Gentleman to get up and make serious remarks like that is astonishing.<br/>
There was another interesting touch. The hon. Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett) got sharply to his feet and castigated my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) for having made a meal of this somewhat indigestible subject. My hon. Friend may have had a fairly heavy lunch, but the hon. Gentleman himself went on to have a pretty substantial high tea off it and he was not the one to make accusations of that kind.<br/>
There is one serious question which we should ask ourselves. Can it be right to give such a power to such a Government when we know perfectly well that they have this ingrained habit of not making tax reductions but of increasing taxes? It is valuable for a Chancellor to have power to raise or decrease taxes in an informal manner, and no doubt we would be right to permit the regulator if the Chancellor's powers were limited and he could only reduce taxation. After all, he has put it on. By the standards of the Government, he has done only a minor piece of cheating. The Government slapped this bit on in the summer of last year and now they are incorporating it into the Finance Bill formally. This is not a proper use of the regulator which should be a temporary measure. Even if the tax is restored by some other legislative means, it is not right to confuse a temporary measure with the more permanent measures of taxation with which the Finance Bill deals.<br/>
I pause for a moment to think of the way in which the Government have gone on adding burdens on petrol, fuel oil, drink, and Purchase Tax, without pausing to think at all. I do not want to be distressingly funny on the subject, but we have recently read in a rather strange book, entitled "Pragmatic Premier", how the Prime Minister makes a habit of drinking gin out of a flower vase. Even the Prime Minister, well remunerated as he is, will not be able to continue to afford to consume his gin out of such large vessels if the Government continue in their present taxation habits.<br/>
5.15 p.m.<br/>
I am too defeatist to hope for any sensible answer to this question from the other side of the Committee, but the question which my right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) should ask himself before deciding whether we should vote on the Amendment is whether we can trust the Government with it. Viewing the Government's record in this respect, I have the gravest doubts. However, I bow as always to the wisdom of my right hon. Friend and if he decides that it would be wrong to vote against the Amendment, with reluctance I would not do so myself. But I hope that he will address himself seriously to whether it is not the height of folly for the Conservative Party, knowing the Government's form as it does, to repose this method of informally increasing taxation in the hands of such a Government once again.</p>

<p>I do not want to make a meal of this; just a little snack. I could not quite understand the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) but perhaps this was a defect on my part. When he intervened during the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett), suddenly I understood it in a flash, or at least I think I did. He wants the Chancellor to make more forecasts in order that he may determine whether the regulator is to be used upon something foreseen, or on something unforeseen. If it is to be used on something foreseen, he rebukes the Chancellor.</p>

<p>That is the little gap which he did not fill, although he has now. He says that there should be some other measure at the time, but surely the whole point of the regulator is that it is to deal with contingencies, not with things which are certain to happen. His argument is that there should be a provision in the Budget to provide for something which may or may not happen. The whole concept of the regulator is to be able to deal with contingencies. By this mysterious doctrine one is thereby debarred from using the regulator, which is designed to meet possibilities, and instead one must provide some alternative positive measure then and there for something that may never happen. I could not understand this argument and for that reason it seemed to me that the proposal to knock out the regulator altogether was entirely inconsistent with the arguments advanced.</p>

<p>There is now a well-worn tradition that, when, in considering the Finance Bill, we debate the regulator, it turns on some kind of compact, whereby the Committee agrees to the Government having these very considerable powers of potential taxation, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) says, can amount to about &#x00A3;300 million, in return for which we hope that we might have some indication from the Government as to what they think the fairly immediate future state of the economy will be, within which we can see the possible likelihood of the regulator being used.<br/>
It is not a lot to ask for. When we asked for the information last June, we suggested, in allowing the Clause to stand part of the Bill, that the regulator would have to be used in an upward direction because we believed that on the available evidence it would have to happen soon, and we were right. In July it was used, and that is the answer to the hon. Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett). Of course it does not lie in the mouths of any of us here to say whether the regulator will have to be used at some stage during the year, but it is perfectly reasonable to say, on the existing evidence, whether it is likely to have to be used fairly soon. The Chancellor must be conscious of the advice that he has been getting this afternoon from below his own Gangway, from the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne


(Mr. Sheldon), suggesting that the regulator would have to be used in a downward direction.<br/>
I have some genuine support for this Amendment because, if it is carried and the Government are denied the regulator, they will be unable to use it in a downward direction, and on balance this could be advantageous at present. Although I am absolutely at one with my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Mr. Burden) in looking for tax reductions, and I do not want to seem to be churlish in casting aside the possible benefits of the downward use of the regulator, it can only be a virtue if it is matched by reduction in public expenditure, and about that we cannot be certain.<br/>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will give us a little clearer idea of how he sees the potential use of these powers, if they are to be granted by our not pressing the Amendment, because of one very important omission from the Budget speech. It is an omission which has since, to some extent, been rectified in <i>Economic Trends,</i> which is an official indication of what was expected to happen to personal consumption. Although the Chancellor gave us a great deal of information from which we could make some deduction upon the likely course of the economy upon which the regulator might operate he did not give us any specific figures on personal consumption.<br/>
In <i>Economic Trends,</i> published within the last few days, there is reference to increases of personal consumption which:
<q>&#x2026; made possible an appreciable rise in the volume of consumers' expenditure, and this rise may amount to around 2&#x00BD; per cent. between the second half of 1966 and the second half of 1967.</q>
It is important for the Committee to bear those figures in mind when considering this Amendment, because the regulator must have its most direct effect upon the levels of personal consumption. There is no doubt that all the pressure that will come in its most strident form upon the Chancellor to do something about personal consumption will come from those industries such as the motor vehicle industry and the consumer durable industry, which have felt most harshly the effects of the credit restraint over the last twelve months.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Sir G. Nabarro) quite rightly, is championing the cause of the motor trade, as we would expect. It is quite clear that if any boost is required in that direction, it need not&#x2014;it probably should not&#x2014;come from the use of the regulator. Much more effective will be the use of hire-purchase controls. The hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Macdonald) looks surprised and aghast. That is the view of the motor industry. Does the hon. Gentleman wish to intervene?</p>

<p>It has just occurred to me that, as long ago as the Radcliffe Committee's Report of 1959, the concept of tinkering around with hire-purchase controls was strongly condemned as a measure for regulating the economy.</p>

<p>I would also observe that even such distinguished commentators as the members of the Radcliffe Committee do not have the last word on the subject. If the Chancellor would like to take this opportunity of saying that he fully accepts the observations of the Radcliffe Committee and that hire-purchase control regulations are out of the Government's range of weapons to reflate the economy, it will be news which would be noted with interest, to put it no higher, by people inside and outside of this House.</p>

<p>I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's argument, because I have always understood that he was an advocate of no interference whatever in the economy&#x2014;that we should leave things alone. Is he now telling us that he is advocating controlling the economy on this question of deflation or reflation through hire-purchase controls rather than any other method?</p>

<p>No. If I were to start a speech advocating control of the economy through hire-purchase controls, I would very rightly be brought to order. What I am saying is that the regulator has most effect upon personal consumption, but there is ample evidence that non-durable personal consumption was holding up very well and that restraint on personal consumption comes largely from consumer durables and the motor vehicle industry. In those particular industries


it is the impact of hire-purchase control which has more effect than the use of the regulator.<br/>
I am merely describing the situation which I believe to be of interest for the consideration of the Committee. May we leave it at that? One other point which I hope the Financial Secretary will comment upon is that touched upon by my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Mr. David Howell). I was concerned for his political virtue when he sought authority for his arguments by referring to the Department of Economic Affairs.<br/>
That aside, it is the whole question of whether the use of the regulator can be seen to have much relation to the quantum or profitability of manufacturing investment. The Chancellor quite rightly has been under considerable pressure about the present situation regarding manfacturing investment. I hope that we will not be told that it shall be the aim of the regulator to somehow or other contrive an almost unqualified increase in total resources devoted to manufacturing investment. What matters is profitable investment.<br/>
I hope, therefore, that when the Financial Secretary to the Treasury replies to the debate, he will indicate that his main concern is to use the weapons of economic policy which are being made available to the Chancellor by our possibly not pressing the Amendment, inasmuch as they can be effective to improve the profitability of industry, because I believe that it is through that method that we are most likely to see a much more successful outcome to our economic policy.</p>

<p>I am emboldened to intervene at this stage in the debate for no other reason than that after an hour and a half no one has yet seriously argued that the regulator should not be renewed. That is the issue which is raised, formally at least, in the Amendment.<br/>
The hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) pointed out at the beginning that it has in previous years been more usual to have a general discussion at this stage on the renewal of the regulator when

debating the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill", but he gave the reasons why the Opposition thought that it would be helpful this year to have a separate Amendment on the subject.<br/>
The hon. Member accordingly finds himself in, perhaps, what is for him unusual company in that, I think I am right in saying, the only person who has previously moved an Amendment against the renewal of the regulator was my former hon. Friend the Member for Ash-field, Mr. William Warbey, who is no longer a Member of the House.</p>

<p>I would not like there to be any misunderstanding about this. It is a purely technical point. The Financial Secretary will understand that a year ago the regulator power was the whole of the Clause and, therefore, we could take it on the Motion, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill." We could not do so this year because many other matters, including Purchase Tax, are involved and we could not be certain that there would be a debate on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill." Hence the necessity to do it this way.</p>

<p>I was not challenging the reasons which led the Opposition to have a separate debate in this way.<br/>
Although it has been the practice sometimes to have a general debate on this topic, it is important in approaching it to remember that what we are discussing is whether my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer should have the renewed power to use the regulator. We are not discussing whether, at this point of time, my right hon. Friend thinks that he will need to use the regulator and still less, if he had to use it, in which direction he would have to use it or for what particular economic purpose.<br/>
The hon. Member for Worthing asked my right hon. Friend many questions and I suspect that he expected an answer to some of them rather more than to others. I will begin by answering those which are susceptible of a plain and clear answer. First, the hon. Member asked what was our estimate of the effect in the coming year of the use of the regulator one way or the other. The figures are, in our view, rather less than 10 per cent. of the amount that it is estimated will be


received by the various taxes to which they relate during the coming year. The reason for that is that the very use of the regulator affects the consumption of the goods in question.<br/>
I will give the figures under the different groups to which the regulator can relate. They are now five groups. In Group A, tobacco, the estimate for the coming year is &#x00A3;1,020 million; Group B, which is spirits, beer and wine, &#x00A3;710 million; Group C, hydrocarbon oil, &#x00A3;950 million; Group D, Purchase Tax, &#x00A3;735 million; and Group E, other duties including those on betting, &#x00A3;80 million. These total &#x00A3;3,495 million.<br/>
Owing to the effect upon consumption of a 10 per cent. increase by means of the regulator, especially on the consumption of tobacco and spirits, we estimate that the likely yield now of a 10 per cent. increase on all groups together would be about &#x00A3;200 million rather than the &#x00A3;340 million which hon. Members have suggested.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.305.0" hansard_membership_id="942" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30068" speakername="Mr. Barnett" colnum="305" time="">
<p>Is my hon. and learned Friend giving figures for the year 1967&#x2013;68 or for the 12 months from now?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.305.1" hansard_membership_id="8529" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17661" speakername="Mr. MacDermot" colnum="305" time="">
<p>Those figures would relate to a 12-month period. It would depend upon when the regulator was introduced. One can answer only in those terms.</p>

<p>When the hon. and learned Gentleman says that his estimate is &#x00A3;200 million, does that figure apply whether the regulator is used upwards or downwards? I should think that it would be rather more if used downwards.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.305.3" hansard_membership_id="8529" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17661" speakername="Mr. MacDermot" colnum="305" time="">
<p>The estimate is given for a move upwards. I agree that the figure might be rather more for a move downwards.<br/>
The second question put by the hon. Member for Worthing concerned a drafting point and whether, in the form in which the Clause is drafted, future use of the regulator would include a power to increase or decrease 10 per cent. in the rates as they will be as a result of the Clause or merely on the rates as they were last year. Subject to any point which the hon. Member may draw to my attention, I think that the drafting achieves the effect. It merely extends the power to use the regulator under the

1961 Act. At any moment when it is used, the limit is 10 per cent. upwards or downwards on any one of the Groups on the rates prevailing at the time when it is applied.</p>

<p>I wonder why the Financial Secretary has not considered the effect of a downward move. This is something in which most people are extremely interested. Surely, the Government are thinking of removing or easing all taxes as well as increasing them. This should be considered.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member would like the precise figure, I will try to get it for him. All that we are discussing is the renewal of the power, which is for a move of 10 per cent. upwards or downwards.<br/>
The hon. Member for Worthing introduced what has been the general subject of the debate by asking some rather wide and general questions about my right hon. Friend's forecasts concerning the economic situation. As my right hon. Friend made clear in the Budget debates, he is anxious to assist the House of Commons and the public in general by forecasting and publishing his forecasts as far as he feels able usefully to do so. Indeed, in his Budget speech, as the hon. Member acknowledged, my right hon. Friend went a good deal further this year than Chancellors have done for many years past.<br/>
In doing so, my right hon. Friend issued a clear caution and warning and invited the House to treat those forecasts with the scepticism which he felt that they deserved, because forecasting is such an exceedingly uncertain science. I certainly do not think that it would advance the general purpose which my right hon. Friend wants to serve if with great frequency he started to give revised forecasts on topics of this kind.<br/>
It is only a few weeks since Second Reading and I have nothing to add to the information and general indication of trends which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor gave in his Budget speech and which my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary gave in opening the Second Reading debate. In addition, the Treasury publishes every month the article on economic trends to which an hon. Member has referred. That is as


far as we can usefully go by way of forecasting. Certainly, nothing has occurred since the time of my right hon. Friend's Budget speech to lead him to change the general advice which he gave to the House at that time or the forecasts which he made with the limitations which he placed upon them at the time he made them.</p>

<p>Commenting on this article in <i>Economic Trends,</i> the <i>Economist</i> suggested possibly that it was a quasi- or semi-official comment on the likely development of personal consumption. Will the Financial Secretary take this opportunity to state clearly that it is an official Government view that personal consumption is likely to rise by 2&#x00BD; per cent.?</p>

<p>This is an official forecast put forward on the basis of the information which is available to the Treasury month by month. It is making public such forecasting information as can be given by the Economic Section of the Treasury. The hon. Gentleman will find that the passage to which he referred is in line with and in accordance with the trend which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor forecast in his Budget speech. He made reference to the fact that he expected there to be an upturn in consumption expenditure towards the end of the year, particularly when not immoderate wage rises began again at the end of the period of severe restraint in the second half of the year.</p>

<p>The question which we are considering now, therefore, is not for what purpose the Chancellor requires the renewal of the regulator in the sense of the purpose for which he intends to use it. He has no present intention to use the regulator. As I think the right

hon. Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) said, if there was now a purpose for which these taxes should be increased or decreased, they would find their place in the Budget, and that occurs to some extent in that we are consolidating the increases made by the use of the regulator last July.<br/>
What any Chancellor is doing at this point of time is to say that the regulator is a useful and necessary weapon to have to hand in dealing with the management of the economy during the coming 12 months. When one looks back at the history of this power, it must become almost automatic now that, each year, any Chancellor will seek the renewal of it. If we did not have the tradition that our main taxes and taxation powers should be renewed annually, as we do with Income Tax, Corporation Tax, Surtax and so on, one might envisage a measure making it a permanent power. However, we do not do things in that way. We think it right that these main taxation provisions should be renewed annually.<br/>
This power, which was introduced in 1961, has been used only twice since. One occasion was in 1961 and one was last year. The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton), in perhaps not one of his more serious speeches, questioned whether this power could be entrusted to the present Government. All I would do is remind him that he, like the rest of the Opposition, supported the Government in using the power as they did last July. As a responsible hon. Member of the House, I am sure that he must realise that it is a necessary power for any Chancellor to have.<br/>
For those reasons, I hope and feel confident that the Opposition will not want to press this Amendment to a Division.</p>

<p>The most important point which the Financial Secretary made, which was accompanied by a point which he refused deliberately to make, was the assertion that nothing had changed very much in the last month to alter the Chancellor's view of the Budget judgement. However, if one looks at two recent statements, one made by the Chancellor and one appearing subsequently in <i>Economic Trends,</i> there is a contradiction in terms of the Budget judgment which he made.<br/>
The Chancellor said quite explicitly on 11th April, 1967, that the two main expansionary forces at work were higher exports and higher public investment. In his Budget speech, the right hon. Gentleman said that those were the generative forces at work for the forthcoming year. In the <i>Economic Trends</i> which came out about a calendar month later, we find that exports have been left out completely and that, under the heading "Aggregate Demand", over the rest of 1967, which means presumably the second, third and fourth quarters, we read:
<q>The main expansionary elements look like being private consumption and public investment.</q>
There could hardly be a more fundamental change in the assessment of the character of the economy within four weeks, switching from exports as the main expansionary force to private consumption.<br/>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
In those circumstances, one is bound to question whether the regulator, is relevant to the problem with which we shall be faced in the next few months. We all agree that the regulator is a useful and good instrument in itself. However, it is possible for the good to be the enemy of the best. If the pattern of the economy for the next 12 months is not to be exports leading the expansion accompanied by public investment, but private consumption and public investment, it is undesirable to have the regulator as the main determining weapon for adjustment, because it means that it will operate on the one sector&#x2014;namely, consumption&#x2014;which holds out some prospect for encouraging growth, in private investment, profits of firms, and so on.<br/>
The only instrument on which the regulator can be used here is this increase in personal consumption, but this increase I feel would be a good thing. I think that the prospects of getting back on target with our exports are at least partly dependent upon an increase in home demand for such things as motor vehicles, enabling industries to increase output and latter costs.<br/>
The most serious change in the approach of the Chancellor and the Treasury is to have substituted private consumption for exports as an expan-

sionary force. Is it really the Government's view that they will get out of their balance of payments difficulties in the period which we are facing on the basis of a moderate rise in private consumption and a very substantial rise in public investment? Is that really the formula for getting out of our balance of payments difficulties? It is extremely unlikely. The weapon which we need at this time is a far more fundamental reappraisal of the Budget judgment. The whole prospect of exports, now explicitly dropped as an expansionary factor is far too gloomy, and the impact of increased public investment will be extremely serious.<br/>
One of the items in the Financial Statement which struck me was the bland assertion that public investment would go up by 8&#x00BD; per cent. as a sort of substitute for the decline in private investment. They are not the same at all. They are two quite different animals, particularly when one reflects that half the increase in public investment is not on economic services but really on the social services. Though it may be desirable in itself, as a contribution to our balance of payments and making our exports more competitive, that sort of increase in expenditure will not get us anywhere in the short term.<br/>
The idea of an export led expansion is something to which the Government should get back. We want to know why it has been dropped. If it has been dropped and the whole emphasis is to be on public investment and private consumption, the one weapon which we do not want to use in the circumstances is the regulator.<br/>
The Financial Secretary helpfully gave us the categories in which the regulator can apply and the sort of scale of revenue which it can impose, but he is in great difficulty on at least two of them. Tobacco and wines and spirits are becoming increasingly less buoyant, particularly tobacco, and, if he uses the regulator, he will have to focus the main impact on the duty on hydrocarbon oils and on Purchase Tax, for example, for consumer durables. It is precisely this sort of stop instrument in the present juncture of our economic life which is likely not to contribute to exports but to reduce them, in the same way as the


cutback in economic activity has reduced motor vehicle exports.<br/>
If the pattern is to be public investment plus private consumption, we must avoid the use of the regulator to hold back private consumption thereby again reducing the output and activity of the main exporting industries. For these reasons I feel that the Chancellor, who invited us to be irreverent about his forecast, has given us as solid ground for irreverence as has ever been given. The enormous importance of an expansion in exports has been deliberately and explicitly replaced by a growth in private consumption with an unchanged, enormous increase in the scale of public investment. For this reason we feel that there is sound ground for questioning the whole philosophy of the regulator as a link in the "stop-go" apparatus at this juncture in our affairs, and we shall watch this very carefully during the next few months.</p>

<p>I confess that I have been interested in the way in which most of my hon. Friends have assumed that if the regulator is used during the next 12 months it will be used upwards. This is an understandable assumption for them to make in the light of the Government's record. But I should have thought that if the regulator was to be used during the next 12 months it would be used downward. It is for this reason that, while I sympathise with the reluctance of my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) to give the Government powers of this nature, I do not entirely agree with him. The Government's powers of economic forecasting as are so deplorably limited that it will be almost criminal to leave them without this power to adjust their forecasts of demand.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison) said, contrary to what the Financial Secretary said in his intervention, there has been a fundamental change in the Government's short-term economic judgment between the Chancellor's Budget speech and the latest issue of <i>Economic Trends.</i> My hon. Friend referred to the forecast in <i>Economic Trends</i> of aggregate demand. What it says about exports is that "there appears to be a pause in the growth of exports after the rapid increase in the

second half of last year", a pause "which was not unexpected". I do not know by whom it was not unexpected, but it certainly was not expected by the Chancellor when he made his Budget statement, because, as my hon. Friend said, the two pillars of reflation on which he was relying were the level of public sector expenditure and the rise in export demand.<br/>
I take the view that we should allow the Government to have the regulator powers, because I believe that they will have to use them, and use them in a downward dirction, before many months are out. In fact, I suspect that not only have the Government already had to adjust their forecast since it was made, but that it was adjusted at the last minute before the Budget statement was made. I say that because if one examines the reports of the City editors on their background briefings during the days immediately before the Budget, one gets the feeling that the impression was created that the Budget would have a slightly reflationary bias.</p>

<p>If the Chancellor says that, I accept it, and I shall not pursue the point any further, but there were to my mind indications of a change of judgment at the last minute before the Budget statement was made.<br/>
We still have not had any explanation from the Financial Secretary of what the forecast of a 3 per cent. growth rate year-end on year-end means in terms of growth of output, taking 1967 on


1966. I cannot see why the Government should be reluctant to give this forecast if they are prepared to give the other. On second thoughts perhaps I can see why. The forecast would be so modest. I suspect about 1 per cent. or possibly just over that, that they would rather not hand it to their critics on the back benches, and perhaps, also, as we have seen in recent weeks, their critics on their own Front Bench. This, I suppose, is the reason, but it seems to be an inadequate one. If they can give the forecast year-end on year-end I do not see why they cannot give the forecast calendar year on calendar year.<br/>
If, however, the Government's short-term economic judgment was right, I suspect that they might still have been better advised not to have taken the 10 per cent. surcharge into the Budget as they are doing on this occasion, because I suspect that there were such deflationary forces built into the economy by the time of the Budget that the Government were likely to be forced to undertake a fair amount of reflation during the coming autumn and winter, and by starting it earlier they might have been able to make it less panicky and less dangerous when it came.<br/>
But as my hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash said, I think that there are good reasons for believing that the Government's forecast is wrong. There are good reasons for thinking that the forecast of a 6 per cent. increase in exports is far too optimistic. This is hardly surprising, because if we look back at the mirror years of 1957, 1958, and 1962, we find that on each of these occasions there was either a positive drop in the level of exports, as in 1958, or a very much lower rate of increase than the trend figure would have led one to expect, as in 1962.<br/>
What is ominous on this occasion is that whereas in 1958 and 1962 imports dropped or failed to rise even more markedly than exports, during the first four months of this year imports have risen pretty sharply, and it is interesting, and to my mind a little ominous, to see the way in which the Chancellor has been adjusting his forecasts. On 1st December last, at column 674, he said that "we would swing into a large surplus in 1967." By 11th April of this year he was saying:
<q>We should move from last year's deficit of &#x00A3;189 million to a surplus in 1967 as a whole,

with an even bigger one in 1968."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 14th April, 1967; Vol. 744, c. 994.1</q>
By 9th May he was saying:
<q>As far as can be foreseen, the present position &#x2026; is that last year's deficit.. will be turned into a surplus during the course of this year &#x2026; I would expect a substantial balance of payments surplus in that year."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 9th May, 1967; Vol. 746, c. 1308.]</q>
I think that "that year", in that context, was 1968. It is fairly clear from that that the Chancellor has already been revising downwards his forecast of exports, and hence revising downwards the reflationary influence which he was expecting exports to have.<br/>
Therefore, it seems to me that on those grounds alone we should be expecting to see him use the regulator in a downward direction. I hope that I am not being too optimistic.</p>

<p>Does not my hon. Friend realise that there will be considerable wage increases when the squeeze is ended, and that it is, therefore, more likely than ever that the Government will have to mop them up by putting up the regulator to offset the increases in wages, which is what they have done for some time?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.314.4" hansard_membership_id="1801" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12922" speakername="Mr. Bruce-Gardyne" colnum="314" time="">
<p>I was about to come to that. I am not so sure about the effect that these wage increases will have.<br/>
The stagnation of exports is not the only factor in respect of which, I suspect, the Chancellor&#x2014;by no means for the first time this year&#x2014;has been over-sanguine about the prospects for the economy. Many of my hon. Friends have referred to the evidence that has come forward since the Budget statement&#x2014;the figures of new car deliveries, the very sinister underlying rise in the level of unemployment&#x2014;which directly contradicts the figures which the Chancellor gave us in the Budget statement&#x2014;and the figures for retail trade, which are not very encouraging.<br/>
My hon. Friend has just referred to the prospect of wage increases, but we now also have the prospect of substantial price increases in some sectors, such as electricity charges. If we have the degree of underlying deflation&#x2014;unemployment and short-time working&#x2014;which I would have thought we could expect by the autumn, the effect of wage increases plus the substantial price increases which are already in the pipeline might have an overall deflationary rather than inflationary effect, because prices would be tending to run ahead of earnings, and it is the figure of earnings that matters. I would think it open to question whether, on this ground, the Government are not going to have to intervene to use the regulator in a downward direction later in the year.<br/>
We have not heard any Government forecasts about the trend of international interest rates. There have been some recent indications that they may have bottomed out, and that there may even be a danger of their beginning to rise again during the summer. This, too, would obviously have an important impact on the Government's short-term economic judgment.<br/>
Another aspect which has to be in all our thoughts is the recent trend of unemployment and, in particular, unemployment in the regions. The Government have made great play of the fact that their regional employment policies have cushioned the effect of deflation in the regions. I was staggered to see some figures in the latest edition of <i>Economic Trends</i> contrasting the movement of percentage increases in unemployment in Great Britain as a whole and the regions during this period of deflation and during the comparable periods of 1961&#x2013;62 and 1957&#x2013;58.<br/>
The figures printed in <i>Economic Trends</i> are completely misleading. They put a very favourable complexion on what is happening. They suggest that the regions have been doing better than they have done before. They cover the periods, November 1957-November 1958; September 1961-September 1962; and July 1966-April 1967, which are not strictly comparable periods. I have made a quick calculation of the changes in unemployment in respect of the United Kingdom as a whole and Scotland&#x2014;the

region with which I am specially concerned&#x2014;between May-July, 1957 and March-May, 1958, the same thing in May-July 1961, March-May 1962 and, again, May-July, 1966 and March-May 1967.<br/>
One finds in the case of 1957&#x2013;58 an increase in unemployment in the United Kingdom of 57 per cent. and in Scotland of 53 per cent.; in 1961&#x2013;62 an increase of 58 per cent. in the United Kingdom and 27 per cent. in Scotland, and in 1966&#x2013;67 an increase in the United Kingdom as a whole of 109 per cent., and in Scotland of 60 per cent. There is no evidence here to suggest that the regions have in any way been sheltered from the effects of this deflation.</p>

<p>I can tell the Minister at once. If these trends are to be extrapolated and brought forward they mean that the Government would have to use the regulator, or some other intervention, to stimulate reflation of the economy. The level of unemployment in Scotland at the peak next spring, with normal weather conditions, will, I suggest, be at least 125,000 and in the United Kingdom as a whole at least 750,000.<br/>
Unless the Government have the powers of the regulator to intervene so as to stimulate the economy I suggest that we shall be facing intolerable levels of unemployment by next spring. If the Government delay using the powers which the House of Commons may decide to give them under the Clause I suspect that they will, as usual&#x2014;perhaps through the Chancellor's successor&#x2014;reflate too late and too much. Therefore, I would like to see the regulator used in a downward direction, and soon.<br/>
There may be balance of payments objections, but I cannot help suggesting that we are facing a classic devaluation situation with unemployment and imports rising and exports stagnating. However,


I accept that this is beyond the scope of this debate. But I am sure that we would be better advised to reflate on a small scale now than to reflate to a panicky degree later on and probably with very little effect on the level of unemployment at the peak next spring.<br/>
Therefore, notwithstanding the understandable reservations of my hon. Friends about giving these powers to the Government, on balance I think that we should agree to give them the powers because, in view of the uncertainties of their judgments, we cannot afford to do otherwise.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) has already explained why we found it necessary to table this Amendment. In view of the number of other Amendments tabled to the Clause there was a risk that when we reached the debate on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill", the Chair might rule that the Clause had been adequately discussed.<br/>
It has been a useful debate in many ways, although not for the information that we gained from the Financial Secretary. Apart from one figure&#x2014;the estimate of &#x00A3;200 million as being the likely yield if the regulator is used in an upwards direction&#x2014;there cannot be anybody inside or outside the Committee who is one wit the wiser for anything that the Financial Secretary has said.<br/>
Of course, we generally favour the retention of the regulator as one of the weapons in the Chancellor's armoury. It was introduced by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd) and was made more flexible in 1964 by my right hon. Friend the Member for Barnet (Mr. Maudling), but I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) that that does not mean that we should necessarily and automatically accord its renewal to whichever Government is in office&#x2014;certainly not without question or without searching the circumstances in which the Government might feel it necessary to use the power.<br/>
The Financial Secretary is right to say that the Amendment turns on the question whether or not the power should be accorded the Chancellor, but it will be use-

less to debate that question if we did not, at the same time, examine the factors which could bear on the Chancellor's decision on whether or not to use the power. The debate has demonstrated over this matter how correct was the leading article in <i>The Times</i> Business Section on 31st May, which said, referring to the House resuming after the Recess:
<q>Few returning holidaymakers can ever have been confronted with so disagreeable and baffling a spectacle.</q>
Indeed, rarely has the economic outlook been less certain or the prospects more gloomy. This is the background against which we must decide whether or not the Government should have this power.<br/>
One is bound to reinforce the complaint of a number of my hon. Friends about the paucity of the information which the Government have given, even now, on their thinking on the short-term forecast. This has been roundly condemned in the Press. A pungent leading article in the <i>Daily Mail</i> yesterday said:
<q>An Estimates Committee of the House of Commons asks a Treasury official for more information about how the Government bases its economic forecasts, and is told: 'It would not be possible for us to reveal the particular forecasts on the basis of which advice was given to Ministers'.</q>
It went on:
<q>No wonder practically every forecast given in official economic surveys and grandiose planning schemes has been wrong. The statistics are the cosy preserve of Whitehall and lack the corrective of outside knowledge.</q>
When the Government keep their cards close to their chest and disclose only here and there one or two figures, that is exactly the danger which they are courting.<br/>
I hope that the Chancellor will go further than he has&#x2014;he has begun&#x2014;in disclosing the facts and figures of the forecasts on which Government policy is based. In his Budget speech, he gave us the 3 per cent. end-year to end-year growth figure, but little explanation of the figures on which it was based and most commentators have regarded it as most optimistic. In the article in <i>Economic Trends,</i> to which my hon. Friend the Member for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen) referred, the curtain was lifted another inch or two and we were vouchsafed the Government's indication of personal consumption, an increase of 2&#x00BD; per cent. in the second half of 1967 over the second half of 1966.<br/>
But again, without any of the other factors, without the figures to close the circle to which my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) referred, it is difficult to see how this figure of 2&#x00BD; per cent. can be justified. Some of the factors which would bear on it&#x2014;these are the background factors to the question of whether or not the Chancellor uses these powers&#x2014;show that the trend of unemployment is still unmistakably upwards, if the figures are seasonally corrected.<br/>
Seasonally adjusted, the figures show that it was 10,000 up in May and that the average in the last three months has been 17,000 up each month. Those are substantial increases. Industrial production is only just creeping up. From the last quarter of 1966 up to the first quarter of 1967 there is an increase of only &#x00BD; per cent.<br/>
Individual sectors of production show that, for instance, engineering orders continue to decline. At the end of 1965, the index stood at 165; a year later it was 153; by the end of March it was 150. Machine tool orders are still drifting down. In July, 1966, at the time of the squeeze, outstanding orders were &#x00A3;111 million; at the end of March they were down to &#x00A3;93 million.<br/>
A number of references have been made to the level of car sales. All these are important indicators of how the economy will develop over the next few months. Car registrations in April were the lowest for five years and about 30 per cent. below those of the same month last year. This has been the worst month since the July measures of 1966.<br/>
6.15 p.m.<br/>
These indicators give little hope that the estimate of 2&#x00BD; per cent. increase in personal consumption is likely to be achieved, yet this is the Government's forecast, and one wants to know its basis. We hope that the Financial Secretary, in response to a number of requests, especially from my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, will give some of the facts and figures on which this forecast is based.<br/>
Has it been based on higher wages with prices not falling, so that there would be a real increase in purchasing power? This might have been so until a few days ago, with the announcement of the

electricity price increase, an increase which was justified solely by the Electricity Council's need to maintain the return on its capital. Every manufacturing industry will now justify a price increase for the same reason. Any stability of prices after the period of severe restraint is rapidly becoming a forelorn hope.<br/>
Will the increased consumption come from higher imports? We know very little of the Government's forecasts for imports, though there may be some evidence to suggest that they will increase. Certainly, the April trade figures for imports were very disappointing.<br/>
In the absence of any evidence to the contrary in these factors which I have been quoting, one must conclude that the Budget was wrong and over-optimistic and that the National Institute and the London and Cambridge Bulletin were nearer the mark. The National Institute's next publication comes out tomorrow and we shall see what it shows. They forecast a lower increase in the National Product than the Chancellor did and called for a mild measure of reflation.<br/>
That was the basis for my right hon. Friend's proposals in the <i>Financial Times</i> on 6th April. Once again, it seems that the Opposition are right and the Government are wrong. This has happened consistently over the last two and a half years and it looks like happening now<br/>
Thus, the use of the Regulator would rest on the possible need later for a measure of reflation. But that is only half the picture. As <i>The Times</i> said:
<q>The battleship is steering up the creek and it is likely to hit both banks at once.</q>
One must look now at the other bank, near which the Chancellor is steering the country. This is the balance of payments, on which there has been a remarkable shift of emphasis.<br/>
I have mentioned factors which give rise to gloom. The April trade figures were the worst since last July, and this was due not to imports of raw materials, but to those of manufactures, which must give rise to serious concern. Although there was a balance of payments surplus in the first quarter of this year, this appears to have been largely due to capital movements on major items like the take-over of Pye by Philips and the


increased stake by Chrysler in the Rootes Motor Company.<br/>
One hopes that this sort of thing will not be counted upon regularly as a means of writing off our balance of payments, because one cannot balance the house-holding budget by selling the furniture&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Member is being too clever by half. The question whether or not the power is used must turn on the trend of the economy for the time being, for which the balance of payments and the level of imports are crucial. On this basis one is bound to assume that the Government have very little room for manoeuvre and, therefore, it might appear unlikely that the regulator will be used either upwards or downwards.<br/>
It is hardly surprising that we are finding evidence of dissension in the Cabinet. When the Home Secretary addressed the London Labour Party conference on 13th May he called for
<q>&#x2026; a rapid rate of growth for the remainder of this Parliament".</q>
He said:
<q>We must make up the ground which has been unavoidably lost</q>
He was thereby clearly criticising the Chancellor's conduct of the nation's affairs and many newspapers assumed that the right hon. Gentleman was making a bid to take over the Chancellor's job. However he was swiftly slapped down, for the Chancellor, replying on 20th May when speaking to the Southern Regional Council of the Labour Party&#x2014;what these members of the Labour Party thought at having these two speeches in successive weeks I shudder to think&#x2014;said:
<q>&#x2026; the Government does not intend to be diverted from the path of maintaining a surplus and securing a steady rate of growth".</q>
The Chancellor indicated that he at any rate was determined to press on up the creek.<br/>
This is all the result of two and a half years of Labour Government. The situation, as <i>The Times</i> stated, is "disagreeable and baffling" and, meanwhile, the condition of the people deteriorates, with rising unemployment and falling earnings

in many important industries. Without going into the figures, I will merely say that in engineering, shipbuilding, chemicals and steel earnings are lower than they were in July of last year. Prices are going up, notably of electricity, but also the promise of increased gas prices. In addition, the Government have had a massive vote of no confidence in them from the electorate.<br/>
Speaking in a May Day rally in his constituency, the Foreign Secretary gave the answer to which we have become accustomed:
<q>The people originaly elected us, and reelected us in 1964, because they wanted a Government that would govern &#x2026; I hope they will accept the consequences.</q>
They have not and will not accept them and now we are faced with mounting incompetence and dissension in the Government. That being so, why in heaven's name should the people accept them?<br/>
It is clear, from what the Financial Secretary said, that the situation is as baffling to the Government as it is to many commentators in the Press. The hon. and learned Gentleman has given no hint of what is in the Government's mind to deal with this situation. However, we agree that if the Chancellor's ship of State is to have any hope of remaining on course in the months ahead, the right hon. Gentleman must have all the powers and weapons open to him to manage and regulate the economy, including the use of the regulator. For this reason, I have no doubt that my hon. Friends will not seek to divide the Committee on the Amendment.<br/>
This has been a useful debate, not because we have been given any information by the Government but because we have had an opportunity to air our views on a subject which is causing great concern to many students of the British economy.</p>

<p>Before explaining the purpose of this series of Amendments, I wish to tell the hon. Member for Manchester, Cheetham (Mr. Harold Lever), the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, how pleasant it is to see him on the Government Front Bench. Remembering the wisdom which we got from him last year, as opposed to what we received from his two neighbours at the Treasury, we naturally have the highest hopes that when he contributes to our debates this year he will give us some satisfaction, information and enlightenment. We have the highest confidence in him. I wish that I could bestow the same compliment on his colleagues.<br/>
I regret that at least in one respect the Government seem to have learned absolutely nothing. This discussion is germane to the whole fuel policy of the country. Despite that, we do not have on the Government Front Bench either the Minister of Power or his Parliamentary Secretary. If the Government will read the reports of last year's debate on this subject they will see that we raised precisely this matter.</p>

<p>I take no cognisance of what goes on below the Bar of the House. I am concerned only with the occupants of, or absentees from, the Treasury Bench. When debating a matter of this importance it is incumbent on Ministers to show interest and courtesy and to be here before the debate starts.<br/>
This matter is of great importance to the Ministry of Power and I find it disturbing that, for the second year running, we are being treated in this way. One can almost hear the sharp remarks that would have been made if those who are at present on the Government Front Bench, including the Financial Secretary, had been accorded this treatment when in opposition. Merely to be told that a Minister will be here within minutes or hours is not good enough. This is the way in which the Government habitually treat the House of Commons and, by doing so, they egg us on to make protests about the lack of concern Ministers show in our arguments.</p>

<p>How can I deny that?<br/>
In the absence of the Minister of Power and the Parliamentary Secretary, and assuming their lack of interest, I will explain the purpose of this series of Amendments, which is to abolish the tax on fuel oil. I admit straight away that this was originally our misdeed. However, it is the opportunity of parties when in opposition to have a look at their record and, where they find that they were wrong, to announce their intention to put the matter right in future. We did precisely that last year, when we voted in favour of an Amendment to reduce the tax of fuel oil. This year we are going further; we are proposing to abolish the tax altogether. If the Government cannot offer us some reduction, then I will probably want to take the matter to a Division.<br/>
I suppose that the Commissioners of Customs and Excise find complexity an agreeable thing. Whether or not they do, it is their constant companion. I wish that people would get things sorted out so that we would not be dealing with the increase in a rebate but with the reduction of the tax itself. We have this unnecessarily complicated business of a rebate on a tax on a substance such as oil, so that we must argue about the rebate being increased rather than reduced or the tax being reduced or abolished. I still live with the optimistic hope that at some time or another the party opposite will get over its pathological antipathy to the oil industry as a whole. We have had enough sermons


from the Government about the importance of our balance of payments. Very few industries make such a contribution to our balance of payments as the British oil investment. I hope that at some time hon. Gentlemen opposite will take on themselves the heavy task of educating their party in this matter.<br/>
I also feel that the proper arguments of the oil industry fall on deaf ears in the whole edifice of the Treasury, which is properly concerned with its own creatures, the nationalised industries. So concerned is it with the performance of this very difficult duty that it allows itself to be led into discriminatory and unfair attitudes towards the oil industry. I hope that at some time this attitude will come to an end. I will not deal with this subject at length, but I would instance the Government's whole treatment of the oil industry's overseas investment, which, I believe, in the long run, will be absolutely disastrous. The Government have never given an adequate explanation nor been fully alerted to the consequences of their own actions.<br/>
6.30 p.m.<br/>
The Financial Secretary will remember last year's debate on this subject, and I would remind him of some of the quotations I then made from the Government's White Paper on Fuel Policy. We read, in paragraph 17:
<q>Following this sudden reduction in demand for coal, a number of measures were taken to help the industry &#x2026; In the 1961 Budget, a duty of 2d. a gallon (about &#x00A3;2 a ton, equivalent to protection in the region of 23s. 0d. per ton of coal used for steam-raising) was placed on oil used for burning.</q>
In paragraph 44 there is a clear statement, with which I do not quarrel at all, that the purpose of the fuel oil duty was protection for coal and not for revenue. The paragraph states:
<q>The most important of the existing measures of protection, which are described in paragraph 17, are the duty on heavy oil (and other oil used for burning &#x2026;</q>
Later in the same paragraph we read this very interesting sentence:
<q>&#x2026; it can be argued that, on fuel policy grounds alone"&#x2014;</q>
and it was on fuel policy grounds alone that the tax stood&#x2014;
<q>a reduction of the oil duty, and hence of the cost of fuel to industry, is in principle desirable.</q>

Those were the Government's own words; their considered views as expressed in the White Paper. I find it very difficult in the face of that statement to accept that the Government are justified in retaining the tax.<br/>
The coal industry, because of a failure to contract it quickly enough, faces a most uncertain future.</p>

<p>It has already had one very substantial measure of assistance during this or the preceding Parliament when it was relieved of debt amounting to &#x00A3;450 million. That burden was passed to the taxpayer. That was the time when it would have been equitable, reasonable and fair to say to the oil industry, "We will relieve you of this handicap, which we put on you because we felt that the coal industry had handicaps enough of its own." We have not had that response at all.<br/>
Although we made this clear again this year, it is so very unreasonable that the Government&#x2014;I understood from the Financial Secretary's reply just now that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Power would be here in minutes, but, even now, though we are talking of purely fuel matters we have with us neither the Parliamentary Secretary nor the Minister. It is treating the House of Commons with singular disrespect. The problems we are now discussing are at the very heart of the responsibilities of the Ministry of Power, yet neither the Minister nor the Parliamentary Secretary can bother to turn up to take notice of arguments that we believe to be very important, and to which we had no satisfactory answer last year.<br/>
The question I should like to ask the Minister of Power&#x2014;and perhaps one of his colleagues will be good enough to pass it on to him&#x2014;is: what is to happen when North Sea gas becomes available? There is a very heavy royalty to pay on North Sea gas, but is there or is there not a proposal to tax this raw material? It is on that sort of thing that we want information. As it is, I find the retention of this tax a piece of inexcusable, old-fashioned, real dyed-in-the-wool reaction.<br/>
The Prime Minister is the great man, the great crusader of the technological


revolution, the man who was to prepare Britain for the 'seventies, the man who, in this House, instanced fuel as an especially fit subject for planning. Where are those words now? They have gone away on the wind&#x2014;useless and worthless. I hope that now the Parliamentary Secretary has come in&#x2014;</p>

I shall not repeat all that I was saying before the hon. Gentleman arrived, but I had said that the Prime Minister had always in this House instanced fuel as a proper sphere in which an exercise in planning could profitably take place. Nothing has happened.<br/>
We on this side always said that any dogmatic attitude to a fuel policy would be highly dangerous and misleading, because no one can foresee technological developments. We pointed out that if in 1956 anyone had made a hard-and-fast decision on which fuels should be developed and used, the gas industry would have been planned out of existence altogether. Yet here it still is&#x2014;quite apart from North Sea gas. There was the Algerian methane, and then the I.C.I. process.<br/>
The gas industry is now on the threshold of immense developments, with a capacity&#x2014;</p>

<p>I accept your Ruling at once, Mr. Mallalieu, but let me conclude my sentence by saying that the gas industry is on the threshold of a great opportunity to make a great contribution to our fuel policy. What we want to know is how the very valuable raw material from the North Sea is to be treated in comparison with or in contrast to fuel oil, which is taxed and which is its competitor.<br/>
I have always understood that the intention of the Government was to lower costs by increasing efficiency. They have not done it. Here is a splendid opportunity for them to take at least one measurable step along that excellent

road. We have constantly listened, in the House and elsewhere, to Ministers' pleas to increase industrial efficiency&#x2014;yet what kind of contribution do they make? All they do is first to impose and then continue the imposition of this kind of burden which, for the benefit of the Parliamentary Secretary, I repeat that I admitted quite frankly was something for which we on this side stand in the sackcloth of repentance for having originally introduced it. I believe now that it was a mistake.<br/>
The Government have the opportunity of rectifying the mistake that was made by a previous Conservative Administration. It is a tax which, during the years between 1961 and 1967, has yielded a total of &#x00A3;385 million. It is expected that in the current year that the yield will be &#x00A3;90 million. It is a quite unnecessary burden on industry. The steel and metallurgical industry has to find &#x00A3;11&#x00BD; million as its share of the tax, engineering has to find &#x00A3;7 million as its share, the bricks and pottery industry has to find &#x00A3;2 million, the glass industry &#x00A3;1&#x00BE; million, the textile industry &#x00A3;3&#x00BE; million, the food industry &#x00A3;4 million, agriculture &#x00A3;2&#x00BD; million, the building and contracting industry &#x00A3;1&#x00BE; million, home heating &#x00A3;5&#x00BC; million and electricity generation &#x00A3;17 million.<br/>
Only the other day the Electricity Council was faced with the necessity, under its masters, of putting up prices to meet its financial target. I do not quarrel with that, but would it not be a helpful thing to cease this discriminatory policy? The gas industry has at the moment no tax on its raw material, but the electricity industry has to face this tax. It seems absolutely wrong to tolerate these sort of burdens which the Government are now wantonly continuing on the shoulders of the industry which the Government constantly exhort to efficiency. The Confederation of British Industry has said:
<q>We continue to advocate that the duty on heavy oils be abolished.</q>
Yet, like most of the sensible advice offered to this Government, it is treated with contumely and turned away without result.<br/>
To impose discriminatory taxes upon any fuel is a mistake. Those who flatter themselves that by clever manipulations of fiscal and other methods they can


achieve a fuel policy are fooling themselves in a very big way. An efficient, effective, useful fuel policy depends upon flexibility and one of the principle aims should be cheapness of fuel. It may be that in certain respects we have to balance against cheapness the factor of security of supply, but I do not believe the Minister of Power should ever allow himself to become a social service Minister nor to act as the President of the Board of Trade has acted in respect of development areas.<br/>
The main responsibility of the Minister of Power is to organise and to produce a policy which contributes to the efficiency of British industry by ensuring that the supply of fuel is as safe and cheap as is reasonably possible. I find it intolerable that the Government should still be continuing these quite unnecessary and gratuitous burdens on industry. I am glad to have support on this Amendment by my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Sir G. Nabarro) with whom I have co-operated on a number of occasions. Nearly always in our campaigns we have had the goal of a reasonably cheap fuel very high on the list.</p>

<p>It is a very great pleasure to speak on this Amendment after the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton). He has covered all the general points very fully and his case has been extremely convincing. Particularly when we bear in mind that the Government have said on previous occasions that this tax was under review and they considered its abolition, in view of the other points made by my hon. Friend it will be very difficult for them not at least to give an indication that they are prepared to reconsider this tax.<br/>
My hon. Friend, with customary generosity and courtesy, he has left one aspect to be taken up by other hon. Members. That is the effect of the tax on Scotland, with which I propose to deal. Many of the measures which the Government have brought in by the Budget and previous financial legislation have not taken account of the implications in Scotland and other development areas. It is appalling that while many Ministers have said that Scotland has been sheltered from the freeze and the

Government's economic measures, at the same time we have received figures from the Minister of Labour which show that in the first quarter of this year unemployment in Scotland increased at twice the rate of that in the rest of the country. This tax, which we hope to abolish by this Amendment, may have been largely responsible for that fact. There has been no indication of the effect in Scotland. Even the small marginal increase which took place with the regulator could have a profound effect.<br/>
The main purpose of the tax is to get industry and commerce to change from the use of oil to coal. If the price of coal were the same throughout the country there would be no discriminatory effect but that is not the case. I plead with the Financial Secretary to bear in mind the effect of the tax on areas where the price of coal is unreasonably high. For several years the Government have adopted a policy of differential prices for fuel. My hon. Friend mentioned the effect on the steel industry where the high cost of oil is a very considerable burden. In Scotland, we have a vital steel industry employing about 40,000 men. Unfortunately, a considerable tax on fuel oil results in the industry having to change to coal and if the price of coal is high that has a very significant effect.<br/>
Steel works in Scotland have to pay about 133s. a ton for coking coal. This is the highest figure of any region in the country. In South Wales, where there is S.C.O.W., R.T.B., and Guest Keen, the price is 115s. 4d., almost &#x00A3;1 a ton less. If we have a tax on fuel oil which encourages industry to change over, it will have a dramatic effect on the Scottish producer who has to pay &#x00A3;1 a ton more than is paid in Wales. In Yorkshire, the price is 100s. a ton. So long as we retain the tax on fuel oil it has a discriminatory effect on Scotland and other areas where alternative fuels to which industry is channelled are very expensive.<br/>
The same happens with regard to gas. It was pointed out recently in Answers to Questions put by me that the price of gas in Scotland is considerably higher than in the rest of the country. Since then there has been a 19 per cent. increase while other areas have had an increase which is not even half that amount. So long as the tax remains it has a very serious effect.<br/>
Quite apart from the Scottish aspect, which is very important, there is the general effect of the tax on prices. It is alarming to find the Government continually exhorting industry to restrain prices and not to allow inflation to go ahead while at the same time almost every financial measure the Government take has the effect of raising prices. There has been much inflation and there will be much more essentially because of actions by the Government. Before the Financial Secretary agrees to allow this tax to go on for one more year, I ask him to look at the implications and to try to get the facts and figures to see how it affects the regions. I believe that the information on which policy should be based is just not available in the Treasury, in the Ministry of Power, or elsewhere.<br/>
I will give just one example. I am concerned with the future of the steel and coal industries in Scotland, particularly in view of the implications of our joining the European Coal and Steel Community, where chaos seems to reign at present. I have, therefore, tabled some detailed Questions to try to get figures. At the end of January I asked what information the Minister had about fuel prices in Scotland affecting the steel industry. The answer was that the Minister had no information more recent than that which I quoted during the Committee stage of the Iron and Steel Bill on 1st December, 1966,<br/>
We are asked to agree that this tax on fuel oil should continue for one more year on the basis of inadequate information. It is on the basis of an inadequate appreciation of what the implications will be for the development districts and for the steel industry in particular. In view of the assurances which have been given in previous years about the Government's reconsidering this tax, now is the time to abolish it. We need a substantial boost to try to bring prices down throughout the country. This is one thing which would help. It would help the regions in particular, because they have been so shockingly neglected by the present Government.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Edward M. Taylor) asked

what the effect of this tax is on Scotland. My own writ does not run north of the Border, but I should like to put this question to the hon. Gentleman, through you, Mr. Irving. What effect would the Amendment have, if carried&#x2014;I would hope that that is a big "if"&#x2014;on the Scottish coal industry? Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the National Coal Board, Scottish Division, or the Scottish Division of the National Union of Mine-workers, would support the Amendment? I think that the hon. Gentleman has a fair knowledge of Scottish affairs. If he thinks that the Scottish miners would welcome the Amendment he has a big think coming.<br/>
The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) said that part of the business of the Minister of Power should be to look after security of supply&#x2014;I think that we would all agree with that&#x2014;but that his main purpose should be to provide low-cost power. As the Minister of Power is a member of the Cabinet, does not the hon. Member for Yeovil think that he should also pay regard to the effect on our balance of payments and to the effect that an Amendment such as this would have on our national fuel policy?<br/>
I hope that the Government will give no consideration to this proposal. The arguments as to low costs may be attractive in the short term, but, if we are to have a national fuel policy based, to a large degree, on British indigenous fuels, this levy on imported fuels, which is the equivalent of 27s. a ton on the cost of coal, should be maintained for another 12 months.</p>

<p>I shall deal with the contribution of the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Ogden) later in my speech. I shall not directly follow him.<br/>
I wish at the outset to go back to the peroration of the Financial Secretary on 15th June of last year, when we debated a very similar Amendment in Committee on the Finance Bill. That Amendment was also in the names of my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton), who led, and myself, who followed him, with a number of supporting speeches from others of my hon. Friends. The Financial Secretary then said this:
<q>I hope that what I have said will be sufficient to assure hon. Members that the


whole question is open, and will be considered in the review and also by the Government in deciding what action to take after the completion of the review. It is because the review is in hand that I cannot say anything more specific and it would have wasted everyone's time to expect the Minister of Power to be able to contribute to our discussions."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 15th June, 1966; Vol. 729, c.1530.]</q>
The hon. and learned Gentleman almost did not arrive today. Only after the most clamorous protest could we secure the presence of a junior Minister in the Chamber to listen to this debate which is concerned with fuel and power economics.<br/>
The Minister of Power inaugurated nearly two years ago the review to which the Financial Secretary alluded last June. A few days ago we opened our morning newspapers to see a grinning Minister of Power, with a grinning Chairman of the National Coal Board, with a grinning Chairman of the Electricity Council, with a grinning Chairman of the Gas Council, having a weekend junket on their departmental expenses. What were they doing? They were trying to reconcile the conflicting interests of coal, gas and electricity.<br/>
But the review has already taken nearly two years, and still the Minister of Power will give no indication as to the date of its completion. Meantime, this highly unsatisfactory position persists, with the coal industry being heavily protected against fair and commercial competition by oil. The degree of protection is variously estimated. It cannot precisely be assessed. It depends on the respective calorific value of the fuels, on transportation costs and other considerations, the one being an imported fuel and the other an indigenous fuel; but very roughly the degree of protection for coal is 23s. per ton.<br/>
Last year, in my speech in Committee on the Bill, though we were then only half way through the year, I was shouted at in derision by coal mining Members on the benches opposite when I said that the bituminous coal output of Britain would drop from 186 million tons in 1965 to 175 million tons in 1966. In the event, I was 1 million tons out, or about &#x00BD; per cent. The final figure for coal output was 174 million tons. It will be much lower this year. The miners are leaving the pits in droves. I expect that the coal mining labour

force may come down to 400,000 before this year is out.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Irving, but coal and oil are very closely related, and the output of coal this year is likely to be down to 160 million tons.<br/>
My case is that it is no longer necessary to protect our coal industry by heavily taxing the principal commercially competitive fuel, which is fuel oil. The reason why it is not necessary to protect the coal industry any longer is that put into my mouth by the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey). He said a few moments ago, "The pits are being closed in droves". Of course they are. In the words of the late Mr. Aneurin Bevan, I would never subscribe to a policy of keeping open obsolescent coalmines as ancient monuments. My case today is that coal production is concentrated in efficient pits, most largely, and, therefore, the coal industry no longer needs the protection of taxation placed on fuel oil.</p>

<p>Will not the hon.

If his Amendment were accepted now, there would be immediate and wide-scale closures without the opportunity to take alternative employment to the mining areas.</p>

<p>I do not want to be drawn too deeply into the economics of coal mining, and I reply to the hon. Gentleman in two sentences. Six years have passed since the fuel oil duty was imposed to protect the coal miners. The rundown has been steady and progressive, and there has been no heavy unemployment in the coal mining areas. Credit for that goes to the Tory Government


most largely because the Labour Government have merely carried on Tory Government policies to prevent unemployment in the coal mining areas.<br/>
There is now no longer need to protect the coal industry. For almost six years we have suffered&#x2014;my hon. Friend gave a magnificent figure here&#x2014;the aggregation of revenue collected from this tax at &#x00A3;385 million. That has happened since the time when my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd), then Chancellor of the Exchequer, imposed the tax. He did not say that he was protecting the coal industry. Oh, no&#x2014;he said that he wanted the revenue. I was then a Tory Member sitting on the Government side&#x2014;corner seat, second bench below the Gangway&#x2014;and I was aghast at his action. I divided the Committee against my own party. I took a ragbag of Members with me into the Lobby&#x2014;one other Tory only, my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop), a couple of Liberals&#x2014;</p>

<p>No doubt, the hon. Gentleman would have been with me. There were one or two Liberals and one or two Socialists with me then in 1961. I was castigated by the Whips in characteristic fashion for having voted against my own party, but, in the following year, 1962, when my right hon. Friend the Member for Barnet (Mr. Maudling) was Chancellor of the Exchequer, we did it again. My right hon. Friend, in his pronouncement, changed the reasons for the policy. He said quite candidly that it was temporarily to protect the coal industry; and he re-emphasised that&#x2014;"temporarily to protect".<br/>
It has gone on year after year, and now, with the removal of the regulator, the 2d. per gallon on fuel oil is to be made 2&#x00B7;2d. per gallon. Thus, wehavetwo considerations on this Amendment. My hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil and

I are opposing the consolidation of the regulator into the former level of fuel oil duty, and we are grateful to the Chair for combining in your selection new Clause No. 24, by which my hon. Friend and I seek the total abolition of the fuel oil duty.<br/>
This year, I add one further and important reason to all the reasons which I have canvassed in speeches during the past six years about the iniquity of this form of taxation. It is highly inflationary for industrial users, but it is now very damaging in the context of electricity for domestic consumers. I shall be very careful here, Mr. Irving, not to incur your wrath, for I should not like you to check me again and suggest that electricity would be out of order. I have very respectable statistical precedent to quote.<br/>
From the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31st March, 1966, of the Electricity Council we learn that 5,819,000 tons of fuel oil were used in electricity generating stations during the year to 31st March, 1966. I repeat that for the benefit of the Financial Secretary&#x2014;I should not like him to laugh it off as irrelevant&#x2014;5,819,000 tons. The duty levied at &#x00A3;2 a ton means that the Treasury is charging this nationalised industry &#x00A3;11.6 million. It is nothing for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Power to grin at. He ought to be crying not grinning.<br/>
On 12th May, the Minister of Power made his startling pronouncement about electricity prices. He said that, on average, they would rise by 10 per cent. all over the country. Today, during business questions, I asked the Leader of the House when we were to have a debate about it. It is highly inconvenient for the Labour Party to have a debate on this issue, which touches the pocket of every elector in the country. This is why the Minister of Power announced it on 12th May, one day after the borough elections.</p>

But had he announced it before the borough elections, the Tory gains would have been even bigger than they were. Electricity charges touch 97 per cent. of


the electors. They are fed up with the area boards. I take the Midlands Electricity Board, the worst of them all, as an example. The Midlands Board is putting up its charges, but not by an average of 10 per cent., in Dudley, in Stourbridge and in Coventry. It is nice to see the Paymaster-General listening to me. The right hon.

<p>The Midlands Board is worst of all. It is putting up its charges by 15 per cent., according to the consultative council. I am not talking about industrial supplies alone; I am talking about the domestic as well.<br/>
What does the Electricity Council think about this? It is paying &#x00A3;12 million of duty. If it did not have to pay the &#x00A3;12 million, it would not have to put up its charges so much, would it? I must hang my argument on the Amendment, Mr. Irving, so I return to the Report and Accounts of the Electricity Council for the year ended 31st March, 1966. In paragraph 12, on page 8, we read:
<q>Apart from these unavoidable difficulties, which can broadly be categorised as problems of growth, the industry has throughout the quinquennium had to bear the burden of fuel oil duty, which cost nearly &#x00A3;12 million in 1965&#x2013;66; over and above the fuel oil tax, it has also borne the extra costs involved in affording a degree of preference to coal over other fuels.</q>
That is why electricity charges are going up&#x2014;the mismanagement of the Socialist Government, who cannot run their own nationalised industries.<br/>
In the context of fuel oil again, in paragraph 67, the same Report continues:
<q>At present, Electricity Boards are handicapped in competition (<i>a</i>) by stiffer financial objectives than the Gas Boards; (<i>b</i>) by the oil duty which the Generating Board pays but the Gas Boards do not; and (<i>c</i>) by the limitation of the Generating Board's freedom in the choice of fuel for new stations.</q>
Further, on page 22, paragraph 70, we read:
<q>&#x2026; the Electricity Council believe that the economic welfare of the nation demands

that the special cost of supporting coal should be borne by the community as a whole and not by electricity consumers, who include industries upon whose efficiency we are dependent for improving the nation's balance of payments.</q>
To whom is this Report addressed?&#x2014;to "The Rt. Hon. Richard Marsh, M.P.", the Minister of Power, by the chairman of a principal nationalised industry appointed by the Minister of Power. Here is this chairman castigating and clobbering his own Minister&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is no good the hon. Member nodding dissent. The chairman is clobbering his own Minister for a policy inimical to the interests of electricity generation in this country. Really, the person he should be castigating personally and privately, in Select Committees and upstairs and by every means at his disposal is the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is the principal culprit in pursuing a policy inimical to the interests of British industry, to domestic consumers for they use large quantities of fuel oil, and to our national economy.<br/>
This will be the fifth time I have voted during the Committee stage of the Finance Bill on the abolition of fuel oil duty. There is hardly a Member who does not privately agree with me. Only the Whips on the Labour Government benches prevent hon. Members opposite voting with me, save only the 37 Members of the National Union of Mineworkers, who, of course, owe an allegiance to the union which sends them here. Dreadful!

<p>You kindly said that you would allow me to speak to Amendment No. 90, Mr. Irving. I hope that the Financial Secretary will note as I speak and confine myself to that Amendment that it is substantially different from, and more specific than, the points we have so far debated. I hope that he will therefore be in a slightly more flexible and liberal frame of mind than he would otherwise be in dealing with a more sweeping proposal.<br/>
I apologise for the rather wordy nature of the Amendment, but it is wordy because I have "lifted" it almost verbatim from the Finance Act, 1961, when it applied to a similar relief given in that Act in respect of the fuel oil duty to horticultural producers. That is a useful precedent. Here we are dealing with a sector, the electricity generating industry, which is immeasurably more relevant to the economy than the horticulture sector, to which relief has already been given.<br/>
I briefly remind the Financial Secretary of the special relevance at the present juncture of our economic affairs, when productivity is the key to our progress and expansion, of the need to promote and encourage the consumption of electricity and not to discourage it in industry. One of the most pertinent points here is that Britain is not very well placed in the amount of electrical energy which we put at the hand or elbow of working men in industry at the work bench. The latest figure suggests that the United States operative in manufacturing industry has at his elbow three times the quantity of horse power, which largely means electricity, compared with the British operative. In Germany the operative has about 25 per cent. more. In the interests of expanding the economy and raising producivity, we need to encourage industry to put more machinery, which, in the last analysis, means more electrical power, at the disposal of the operative in manufacturing industry.<br/>
7.15 p.m.<br/>
It is against that background of the need to increase electrical power per operative that the Financial Secretary should remind himself of the paragraph in an interesting article in the latest issue of <i>Economic Trends</i> entitled, "International Comparisons of Costs and Prices", where we read this statement about the rising costs of energy as between the United Kingdom and Common Market countries. It says:
<q>There is a substantial body of evidence to show that whatever the absolute level the United Kingdom's prices of energy have tended since 1958 to rise relatively to those in the Common Market countries and the United States.</q>
That is a Treasury statement from the Minister's own Department, published only yesterday. It is clear evidence that energy prices in this country are tending to rise compared with those in the United States and the Common Market.<br/>
I need hardly remind the Financial Secretary that rises in electricity costs and prices have a very persuasive and permeating effect on the economy. The cost of electricity comes into the Index of Retail Prices and therefore tends to be a factor in wage claims based on the cost of living, and may very well enter into labour costs per unit of output in manufacturing industries. There is also the direct impact of higher electricity costs in industrial use and there is a further indirect result upon commercial users and users in the distributive services. As my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South (Sir G. Nabarro) pointed out, they are probably the most pervasive cost factor in the economy, applying directly or indirectly to the private consumer and to industry.<br/>
It is against that background that one must register the shattering news which the Minister of Power broke to the House and the country on 12th May that the Government now propose to allow the Electricity Council to increase the energy costs of this country by increasing the price of electricity by an average of 10 per cent. next September. For some area boards that means an increase of 15 per cent. <i>The Times</i> estimated &#x00A3;50 million as the likely increase in industrial costs coming into effect in September, at the worst possible juncture for the economic performance of this country.<br/>
The simple Amendment provides an immediate and concrete opportunity to


mitigate that substantial increase in costs which the Central Electricity Generating Board and the Electricity Council have been permitted to place upon the consumer. By reducing the fuel oil duty to the users of oil for generating electricity, there would be an immediate relief to the Central Electricity Generating Board, apart from the Scottish Boards, of &#x00A3;13 million. That is confirmed in an explicit statement given to me by Mr. Brown, the Chairman of the C.E.G.B. that the fuel oil duty for 1966&#x2013;67, on the basis of 6 million tons of oil burnt, will be &#x00A3;13 million. That is the duty it will have to pay if the Amendment is not accepted, and one must add to that the Scottish figures.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend is talking about Central Electricity Generating Board figures, there are two points. First, they would not cover any oil burnt in Scotland. Secondly, they would not allow for the effect of the regulator over the full year&#x2014;that content of the figure my hon. Friend is quoting would only come from August last year to March of this year.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for pointing out that I have underestimated the burden placed by the fuel oil duty on the electricity generating industry at the present time.<br/>
If the Government were to accept Amendment No. 90, they would immediately relieve the burden of electricity costs by &#x00A3;13 million to &#x00A3;15 million and possibly more. That is about a quarter of the debit which the Minister of Power said on 12th May was to be incurred as a result of the drop in electricity sale. He said that the gap would have to be closed by this sensational increase in prices. Thus, to reduce that debit by about &#x00A3;15 million is not something to be sniffed at. The burden can be reduced in this way simply by a stroke of revenue reform and my Amendment should therefore be given careful consideration.<br/>
I hope that the Financial Secretary would agree that there are really no solid grounds on which the Government could object to relieving the generating authorities of this fuel oil duty. But I will deal with two of the grounds on which the hon. and learned Gentleman might possibly level objections. First, there is the revenue aspect. The revenue would be

reduced by about &#x00A3;15 million but the revenue from hydrocarbon oil, including light oils, is &#x00A3;880 million to &#x00A3;900 million a year, so surely to relieve electricity generation of duty to the extent of &#x00A3;13 million to &#x00A3;15 million&#x2014;under 2 per cent. of the duty from hydrocarbon oils&#x2014;would not make a serious dent in the revenue. It could easily be made up by the mere buoyancy of the revenue. There are plenty of places, shown in the Financial Statement, where the loss could be balanced by a cut in expenditure&#x2014;for example, the proposal to spend &#x00A3;50 million this year on acquiring company securities. If the Government reduced that to &#x00A3;30 million or &#x00A3;35 million, they could offset the loss in revenue.<br/>
Secondly, it may be that the Government consider that my proposal would contravene the explicit policy, set out in the White Paper on Fuel Policy and elsewhere, to afford a measure of protection to the coal industry. I remind the hon. and learned Gentleman, however, that, so far as the generating authorities are concerned, the question of a preference for coal does not in any way hinge upon the presence of the fuel oil duty. It is wholly irrelevant. The duty, in so far as it protects coal, does not apply in the case of the electricity generating authorities, because there is perfectly clear statutory authority vested in the Ministry of Power, to require the Central Electricity Generating Board and the Electricity Council to use coal as a fuel rather than oil. The Government can thus enforce the preference in that way.<br/>
There is the obvious case of the Electricity Act, 1957, which explicitly gives the Minister power of a general character to give the electricity authorities a direction in the national interest if necessary to use coal instead of oil. But perhaps more directly relevant are the words of Mr. F. H. S. Brown, Chairman of the C.E.G.B.:
<q>We are required to get Ministerial consent under Section 2 of the Electric Lighting Act, 1909, before we can build a power station. The Minister can, quite properly of course, and does use that statute, which requires us to get his permission to build a power station, also to define what fuel that power station should burn and to veto any proposal of ours to change the fuel of that power station.</q>
Thus, the &#x00A3;13 million to &#x00A3;15 million imposed on electricity generating in fuel


duty has nothing to do with the protection of coal and the idea that it has is mistaken. It is simply a revenue source.<br/>
And it is obvious that the idea of taxing the electricity generating authorities, with the result that it is passed on in higher industrial costs and the cost of living, could hardly be more irrelevant to the economic needs of the country. I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to weigh carefully whether he cannot accept my modest Amendment to relieve electricity generating of the need to pay fuel oil duty, just as the gas industry, horticultural users and the chemical industry have been relieved.</p>

<p>We are discussing three separate but related topics. The first is the proposal that we should exempt heavy hydrocarbon oils from the consolidation of the regulator. The second proposal, in New Clause 24, is that we should abolish these duties completely. The third proposal, in Amendment No. 90, is that we should exempt it in relation to the electricity production industry. I will deal with these in turn, but perhaps, first, I could group the general proposals relating to hydrocarbon oils, because the arguments I put against New Clause 24 are basically the same as those against exemption from the consolidation of the regulator.<br/>
The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) began by asking whether the Customs and Excise likes complexity for its own sake and has to make a rebate of a tax it has already levied. I was surprised to hear him say that, since he is a former Minister in the Ministry of Power. It is for purposes of effective control that it is necessary that all these oils shall be taxed before they are released and distributed, otherwise it would be impossible to check evasion. This is done; and a rebate is needed to deal with those oils which are entitled to bear a lower rate of tax.</p>

<p>Or perhaps even of all the practices of the Minister the hon. Gentleman served. I do not know.<br/>
Secondly, the hon. Gentleman urged that we should get rid of what he called our pathological antipathy to the British oil industry and cease the continuation of a policy which he abhors but which was pursued by the Government of which he was a member. I have noticed some reluctance among the supporters of these Amendments to recall the history of the duties they are now attacking. They say that, although the duties were introduced originally for revenue purposes, they were retained solely for the purpose of protecting the coal industry. That is not correct.<br/>
It is true that these duties, when originally introduced in 1961 by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, were said by him to be on revenue grounds, but, in fact, Ministers in the last Government made it clear that they were being retained both for revenue purposes and for protection of the coal industry. Therefore, one has to look at this both from the point of view of fuel policy and from the point of view of revenue policy.<br/>
We had a debate on this subject last year and, as we have been reminded, I said then that the whole question was open in the review of fuel policy which was taking place. This is a much pro-founder review of this extremely complex subject than has previously been carried out. As the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Sir G. Nabarro) pointed out, the review has continued for a considerable time, but my right hon. Friend the Minister of Power has given an assurance to the House that he will make a statement on it before the Summer Recess, and that a White Paper will be published later in the year. The Committee will, therefore, not expect me today to deal with the fuel policy aspects which have been raised.<br/>
7.30 p.m.<br/>
I entirely agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Ogden) that it would be quite wrong and most disturbing to make an alteration of the kind which has been proposed quite independently and separate from and in anticipation of the results of that fuel policy review. It may be&#x2014;I say


nothing one way or the other&#x2014;that the outcome of this review will result in some changes of taxation in relation to fuel policy. Certainly that aspect will fall for consideration in the review. In something which was created to make a balance between different fuels, it would be wrong to make alterations in anticipation of the outcome of the review.</p>

<p>The Financial Secretary will bear in mind that no firm date has been given for the presentation of the fuel review. Meanwhile, a firm date has been given&#x2014;September, this year&#x2014;on which electricity charges are to rise. I hope that he will address himself to that point when discussing taxation relief for electricity.</p>

<p>I will deal with electricity charges in a moment. I will deal, first, with the general argument of the new Clause.<br/>
The first and primary consideration which leads us to reject this new Clause at present is the heavy revenue cost involved. The return from these heavy hydrocarbon oil duties is estimated now to amount to &#x00A3;88 million in a full year. As my right hon. Friend said in his Budget statement, this is not a year in which he feels able to make any major changes of taxation and a change of that order would be major.<br/>
While dealing with the cost aspect, I can give the figures of what is involved in the consolidation of the regulator in relation to this duty. If we were to exempt these fuel and other duties, we estimate the effect would be a loss of between &#x00A3;7 million and &#x00A3;8 million directly. I say "directly" because one of the factors involved here is that one cannot separate completely this duty from other duties which are involved. If we were to grant an exemption here, there would be pressures for extending exemption to other duties which are the subject of the consolidation of the regulator increases.<br/>
The duty was imposed primarily to raise revenue and produces a major yield. It would not be appropriate to abolish it on revenue grounds except in the context of a full Budget review in which the claims of other candidates for tax reduction would have to be weighed and we would have to consider and survey

alternative means of recouping the revenue loss.<br/>
It has not been argued that the existence of this duty acts adversely on our industry's competitive position for exports in relation to other countries. That could not be argued, because this is one of the duties which qualifies for rebate under the export rebate scheme. The effect of the duty is extremely widely and thinly spread over industry as a whole and is estimated to represent only 0&#x00B7;2 per cent. of the gross output of manufacturing industries.<br/>
The existence of this duty is not something which is exceptional in relation to other countries. We have heard a lot in recent debates about the prospect of a need for harmonisation of indirect taxes between this country and the E.E.C. countries in the event of our application to join the E.E.C. being successful. To state it generally, our present level of fuel oil duty is about the same as the average of the Community as a whole. We reject this proposal, first, because any major alteration in the duty on fuel oil must await the outcome of the review of fuel policy, and, secondly, purely from a revenue point of view, we cannot in the present Budget treat separately a duty which is producing a revenue of this order.</p>

<p>A point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) and myself which is a matter of fundamental principle. We are all agreed that it is undesirable to tax food or fuel. There is no other case known in this country of taxing fuel other than this fuel for production purposes. The only other form of fuel which is taxed is motor transport, which is an entirely different consideration.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.346.1" hansard_membership_id="8529" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17661" speakername="Mr. MacDermot" colnum="346" time="">
<p>Although the hon. Gentleman is consistent in the campaign which he has always waged against any form of taxation of fuel, very many of his hon. Friends are urging us to change our indirect taxation system in a way which would model it on that prevailing in the E.E.C. countries.<br/>
All I am pointing out is that in this respect what we do is already in line with what is being done in the E.E.C. countries. Whereas up to now it has been a general article of taxation faith in this country that we should not tax food or fuel&#x2014;and there have been rare


exceptions to that, of which this is one&#x2014;this is something which we shall have to review if we are asked to bring our indirect taxation into closer harmony with the systems which apply on the Continent&#x2014;unless on entry into the E.E.C. we are able to persuade others to our way of thinking.<br/>
On the Amendment of the hon. Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison), dealing with the effect of the duty on electricity generation; I begin by confirming his figure. The burden of this duty on the industry amounts to about &#x00A3;13&#x00BD; million. He is arguing that, whatever be the position in relation to the duty as a whole, this industry ought to be relieved of that burden. Purely from a revenue point of view, our objection is that in what is basically a taxation standstill year, we would not feel able on those grounds to accept an Amendment which would involve a reduction in revenue of &#x00A3;13&#x00BD; million.<br/>
If it were to be argued that some concession should be given, but at the price of recoupment elsewere in taxation, then a very strong case in these circumstances has to be made for singling out this industry for preferential treatment compared with other possible candidates for tax reduction, including, in particular, other users of heavy oil. The elimination of heavy oil duty in this respect would in itself undermine to some extent the protection afforded to the coal industry; but, more important, it would give rise to claims for exemption by other users of heavy oil and oil subject to duty leading ultimately to a complete extinction of that protection.<br/>
To give an example. It would be argued that there is really no reason why oil burned to generate electricity to provide domestic heating should go free, when oil burned to provide central heating in the home should continue to be taxed.</p>

<p>I do not think that the hon. Gentleman has taken the point, that there will be compensating reductions in costs to consumers in practically every sector, including the domestic users of oil for central heating, through the reduction in electricity lighting bills.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.347.1" hansard_membership_id="8529" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17661" speakername="Mr. MacDermot" colnum="347" time="">
<p>The hon. Member has somewhat exaggerated the likely effect

of his proposal upon electricity charges. This point was also raised by the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South. The heavy oil duty element in electricity is a very small amount. It amounts to about 0&#x00B7;02d. per unit or just over 1 per cent. on average, of the revenue from sales of electricity. It is so thinly spread over industrial, commercial and domestic consumers of all kinds that elimination of the duty completely would not have any significant effect on electricity prices or industrial costs.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.348.0" hansard_membership_id="9702" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18749" speakername="Sir G. Nabarro" colnum="348" time="">
<p>I did not make any assessment, I quoted from the Report of the Chairman of the Electricity Council. He gave the figure as &#x00A3;12 million a year for fuel oil duty charges and that has to be set directly against the &#x00A3;100 million recoupment envisaged by the Minister of Power in his statement on 12th May last. That is one-eighth, 1&#x00BD;d. in the 1s., 12&#x00BD; per cent. and it is totally irrelevant to talk about 0&#x00B7;02d. per unit unless the Minister tells us what is the cost of electricity per unit against which he is setting off this tiny reduction.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.348.1" hansard_membership_id="8529" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17661" speakername="Mr. MacDermot" colnum="348" time="">
<p>I am telling the hon. Member what is the potential reduction in electricity charges that could come from accepting the proposal of the hon. Member for Barkston Ash and pointing out that it is fallacious to think that it would have any significant effect on prices or that it could in any way affect the forthcoming price increases, which are attributable in the main to the need to make provision for heavy capital cost of building in the power stations.<br/>
In this connection, the same points apply as I made earlier, about the competitiveness of British industry in relation to its competitors abroad. To sum up, a major alteration of this kind in the incidence of heavy oil duty could not be made prudently on fuel policy grounds in advance of the outcome of the review, on which the Minister has promised to make a statement in July. From a revenue point of view&#x2014;and the duty was primarily introduced as a source of revenue and it has produced a major yield&#x2014;it would not be appropriate to alter the duty except in the context of a general Budget review, in which these tests could be weighed and considered, together with the claims of other candidates for tax reduction.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.349.0" hansard_membership_id="7559" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29301" speakername="Mr. Lubbock" colnum="349" time="">
<p>I am tempted to intervene as a result of the Financial Secretary's remarks on the electricity supply situation, because I thought that there was a great deal of force in Amendment No. 102, in the name of the hon. Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison), if not for the case of removing fuel oil duty. I can understand what the Financial Secretary has said about the impossibility of reducing the revenue by &#x00A3;88 million in a stand-still year, but this cannot be applied to the case of the electricity industry, where, he has been telling the Committee, the amount is an extremely small one, so small that it would not have much effect on the price increases due to be placed upon the consumer in the middle of this year.<br/>
I could not help thinking, as the hon. Gentleman spoke, that the consumer is never in a winning position. A few years ago we were told that price increases in the electricity supply industry were necessary because we had to keep old plant in commission to meet the demand which had been under-estimated. Now we are told that these price increases are necessary because of the vast programme of capital expenditure which has been undertaken by the generating boards. Whatever happens, we have to face these enormous price increases every year, and even if this does not go a long way towards eliminating them it is at least a step in the right direction.<br/>
On another occasion we could argue for a relaxation of the financial targets of the electricity supply industry, but at least the hon. Gentleman could accept this Amendment and deal with a part of this increase which hangs over the consumer's head, and make it unnecessary. I wish that he had adopted a rather more accommodating approach towards this particular Amendment. I would not endorse his statement that an alteration in fuel duty affects the electricity supply industry, and that he must await the outcome of the fuel review later in the year.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
This is a complete nonsense because the capital expenditure programmes of the generating boards have been determined for many years in advance. The hon. Gentleman will probably know that under construction or planned at the moment we have over 25,000 megawatts

of coal-fired electricity, whereas we have only 4,000 megawatts of oil-fired electricity, and 2,000 megawatts of dual. So, whatever decision is made now will not affect the amounts of coal and oil respectively which are burned in these Central Electricity Generating Board stations over the next five to 10 years, because the stations are already planned and will be brought into commission, notwithstanding any changes in taxation policy by the Government in the meanwhile.<br/>
I would refer to the comment of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Worcestershire, South (Sir G. Nabarro) about an increase in coal prices. This is a serious matter for this country. If one looks at the comparison between Britain and the United States, one finds that since 1950 our prices have increased by something over 75 per cent., whereas in the U.S.A. the cost of coal has remained absolutely constant. I am taking this information from a paper by Mr. Donald Clark, the Chief Planning Engineer to the Central Electricity Generating Board. Here we have a situation in which oil has remained constant in price, or has been reduced in the last few years, whereas the Central Electricity Generating Board has had to pay 75 per cent. more for the coal which it is using.<br/>
This means that electricity prices have had to go up practically every year. A very illogical situation will obtain in a short while when we start using natural gas, because then, as has been pointed out, we shall have coal, and natural gas, which are not subject to taxation at all, and oil which is. Yet oil and natural gas are both hydrocarbon products. I do not see how one can make this distinction between them in logic. That is a matter which remains to be settled&#x2014;whether the electricity generating boards will be able to use natural gas in their power stations.<br/>
I very much doubt whether the Minister will be able to withstand the pressures of Mr. Brown and his colleagues for such use, because it obviously makes economic sense today. It is a matter of some disappointment that the hon. Gentleman has not felt able to accede to this modest Amendment, which would put our electricity supply industry in a better financial position. It would help to mitigate the vast increases which are to be demanded of the consumer, and would have been


a step towards a more sensible fuel policy in the long term.</p>

<p>I recollect that last year, when I intervened in the debate at this stage, on this subject, I had the misfortune to provoke the Financial Secretary. He put it down afterwards to his Irish temperament. I can assure him that I will avoid doing anything of the sort tonight. I intend to be extremely brief.<br/>
The speeches made by my hon. Friends the Member for Worcestershire, South (Sir G. Nabarro) and Yeovil (Mr. Peyton), were characteristic and above all, as the Financial Secretary has acknowledged, were completely consistent with everything that they have been saying for many years in relation to the fuel oil tax. There is a very great deal in their argument in favour of the eventual abolition of this tax.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Barkston Ash (Mr. Alison) initiated a sub-debate within the debate which hon. Members on both sides have found interesting. They certainly found his speech persuasive. The figure of &#x00A3;13&#x00BD; million as the cost of meeting his Amendment is certainly not large by the standards of the yield of the tax as a whole and of the Budget. As I listened to my hon. Friend, however, and to the hon. Member for Orpington (Mr. Lubbock), it was impressed upon me that almost the whole of the arguments which they were addressing about the type of fuel oil used in the electricity industry were equally relevant to the type of fuel oil as used in any industry. One is bound to say that this is a tax which puts up industrial costs. For that reason, it is a tax which sooner or later, and sooner rather than later, should be abolished.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.352.0" colnum="352" time="">
<p>The Financial Secretary gave the cost of total abolition in reply to new Clause 24 as &#x00A3;88 million. One begins to wonder whether this will be yet one more tax which reaches the point that it becomes too expensive ever to abolish it. For that reason, we support entirely Amendment No. 102 to avoid its consolidation. At least, let us lay down a marker and say that the tax must not at this stage be increased and state firmly that when circumstances allow, it must be progressively reduced and eventually abolished.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.352.1" colnum="352" time="">

<p>I intervene only briefly to say how obliged I am to my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Patrick Jenkin) for his advice that we should divide in support of the Amendment. On this occasion, I am more than usually pliable and open to advice from such quarters and am very willing to accept it.<br/>
I felt extremely sorry for the Financial Secretary. He stood there, pale and loitering, at the Dispatch Box, hesitating, most unlike himself, for words, ashamed that he had once again, on behalf of his wretched masters, to come here and expose the same unfortunate, negative, bankrupt case that he tried to defend before us last year.<br/>
Neatly, and humbly, I accept the advice of my hon. Friend and will certainly divide the Committee in favour of the Amendment.<br/>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 4, in page 3, line 29, to leave out "27&#x00BD;" and to insert "16&#x00BD;".<br/>
It will be well known within the Committee that it is not in order to seek to raise any level of Purchase Tax. An hon. Member may only seek to reduce a level of Purchase Tax, and I am thus confronted with considerable technical difficulties in the fact that this Amendment relates itself to the three existing rates of Purchase Tax after consolidation which become, including the regulator, 11 per cent., 16&#x00BD; per cent. and 27&#x00BD; per cent. I contend myself technically therefore, with seeking to reduce the 27&#x00BD; per cent. rate to 16&#x00BD; per cent. in order to precipitate a general debate on all Purchase Tax matters.<br/>
You will note, Mr. Irving, that new Clause No. 1, though not selected by the Chair for association with the present Amendment, in effect deals with the same matter but in the context of the motor industry only; for motor cars pay Purchase Tax, after consolidation of the regulator, at 27&#x00BD; per cent. New Clause No. 1 seeks to reduce the rate to 16&#x00BD; per cent., and therefore I shall deal largely with motor cars this evening.<br/>
There are, of course, a large number of other goods which are subject to the 27&#x00BD; per cent. rate and which my hon. Friends may like to mention in the course of their speeches. They include furs, haberdashery, jewellery, fur rugs, mirrors, sewing machines, lighting fittings, hand lamps, garden ornaments, radio and television sets, musical instruments, gramophones and radiograms, gramophone records, umbrellas, smokers' requisites, luggage, cameras, diaries, calendars, stationery, road vehicles and bicycles, hair treatment materials, toilet requisites, perfumery and certain drugs and medicines.<br/>
The aggregation of the revenue collected at the rate of 27&#x00BD; per cent. from all those chargeable items would be &#x00A3;450 million in the year 1967&#x2013;8. The aggrega-

tion of the revenue collected at the 16&#x00BD; per cent. rate of Purchase Tax in 1967&#x2013;68 is estimated at &#x00A3;75 million, and the aggregation of the revenue from the 11 per cent, rate at &#x00A3;210 million, making a total revenue from Purchase Tax after consolidation of regulator, of &#x00A3;735 million.<br/>
It does not take any great mathematical acumen to work out that if the whole of the 27&#x00BD; per cent. items were reduced to 16&#x00BD; per cent., the cost to the revenue would be &#x00A3;180 million, and the total yield from Purchase Tax would be reduced from &#x00A3;735 million to &#x00A3;555 million.</p>

<p>I am glad to see the Financial Secretary nodding assent at this early stage.<br/>
The element of Purchase Tax revenue in respect of motor cars is by far the largest of any of the goods on which Purchase Tax is chargeable. At the full rate of 27&#x00BD; per cent., motor cars account for a revenue in terms of Purchase Tax of &#x00A3;148 million. Were the rate of Purchase Tax on cars reduced from 27&#x00BD; per cent. to 16&#x00BD; per cent., the loss of revenue would amount to &#x00A3;59 million, and the residual revenue in respect of motor cars would therefore be &#x00A3;89 million.<br/>
I confine myself to motor cars because, as an hon. Member representing a Midlands constituency, I am concerned with the impact of the economic and financial measures of 20th July, 1966, on the motor car industry, which is largely though not entirely centred in the Midlands. These measures have had a dire effect there, as elsewhere, and we may have been reminded of it only this evening, because tonight's <i>Evening Standard</i> headlines the decline in motor car production during March of this year:
<q>Sales of new vehicles during the month of March were 25 per cent. below the level of March, 1966, and sales of secondhand vehicles were down by 12 per cent. For the first quarter of this year, sales of new vehicles were 16 per cent. down on the first three months of last year.</q>


If anything, the April figures are worse. The Daily Mail had this to say on 16th May:
<q>Car sales in Great Britain fell last month to 96,735, almost 30 per cent. below the same month last year. This is the lowest April figure for five years.</q>
The <i>Financial Times</i> reported on the same day:
<q>New car registrations in April fell to 96,735, the lowest April figure for five years and nearly 29&#x00BD; per cent. below the same month last year. This was the worst month for the car industry since the squeeze began last July, and some industry leaders are putting heavy pressure on the Treasury and the Ministry of Technology for early relief.</q>
In fact, though no official pronouncement was made, it was reported that the motor car leaders went to the Treasury on 24th May. The <i>Financial Times</i> of 25th May said:
<q>Representatives of the motor industry, led by Sir George Harriman, president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, met Treasury representatives again yesterday in an extension of the discussions started last week.</q>
It went on to say:
<q>It is believed that the Government has, in fact, conceded the industry's case for early relaxations of hire-purchase and/or purchase tax restrictions on car sales and that the negotiations are now concerned with details.</q>
There may be hon. Members of this Committee who, in their innocence, will argue that the home sales of motor cars have no bearing on export performance. There are a few naive creatures of that kind in the Ministry of Technology at the present time. It is interesting to recall that when the present Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour, the hon. Member for Birmingham, Spark-brook (Mr. Hattersley), was on the back benches he used to attack his Front Bench and the Minister of Technology on this very point, because, as a private Member, he took my view, that we cannot export motor cars successfully unless there is a buoyant home market. The Minister of Technology always denied that.<br/>
I shall not go into this in depth at this stage, but I want to bring out for the first time in this House the figures supplied to me by the industry&#x2014;and they may be confirmed from Board of Trade statistics&#x2014;of the dramatic differences between Tory policy for the motor industry in this country, and Labour policy. During the 13 wasted years which the Prime

Minister and his helots talk about endlessly, they always omit to note that it was very difficult to get a motor car in 1951 for one's own use, but in 1964 one family in four in this country owned a motor car. Cars proliferated. A car was no longer a sign of affluence, it was a household necessity, and in every year that passed the motor industry of this country produced more cars for export and for domestic sales. The achievement was magnificent, and the curve of production was ever upward.<br/>
When the Labour crowd got in, that was the end of those halcyon days, because 1965 and 1966 show a very dismal story by comparison, and I shall quote the figures both for exports and for home trade. If anybody doubts the importance of this industry to Britain, let me tell him that the vehicle industry, not motor cars only, now exports about &#x00A3;800 million worth of goods, representing about 16&#x00BD; per cent. of all Britain's exports. I do not believe that motor car exports can continue to grow unless there is a steadily increasing demand from the home market, and not a downward trend of domestic sales of new motor cars.<br/>
Here are the figures which seem to support my views: In 1964 the home production of motor cars was 1,161,886. In 1965, the first year of Labour Government it declined by 5&#x00B7;6 per cent. to 1,069,374 motor cars. In 1966 there was a further decline, a 10&#x00B7;6 per cent. reduction compared with 1964, and home sales were down to 978,684, so in 1964, 1965, and 1966, as a comparison, there was a steady downward trend in home sales.<br/>
8.15 p.m.<br/>
I now take the export figures, because the whole purpose of the squeeze, the tire-purchase restrictions, the increased taxation on cars, the increased taxation on petrol, and the remainder, was to get exports up. The following figures represent the measure of the failure of the Government's policy: In 1964 car exports were 705,754. In 1965 car exports declined by 7&#x00B7;5 per cent. to 652,671. In 1966 there was a further calamitous drop to 624,995, or a drop of 11&#x00B7;2 per cent. compared with 1964. That is the measure of the Government's failure to promote exports of motor cars. The squeeze at home on the motor car trade, on this narrow front, which has caused so much hardship in


the Midlands, so much dislocation of labour, and so much unemployment and short time working, has had no success whatever in the export field.<br/>
Now let me consider overall production, for this is not only a matter of the Midlands. Let us consider the national resources entailed in building new motor car plants on Merseyside, in building new plants in Scotland, or at Luton, or Dagenham, or elsewhere. It is surely a question of the national resources entailed. Here are the detailed figures, which are even more illuminating: In the last year of Tory rule, in 1964, 1,867,640 motor cars were produced. In the first year of Labour rule that figure declined by 7&#x00B7;8 per cent. to 1,722,045. In the second year of Labour rule, in 1966, it further declined by a very large margin to 1,603,679. There was a 14&#x00B7;1 per cent. reduction in motor car output between 1964 and 1966. I say that that is the measure of the failure of the Labour Party to secure more vehicle exports by their policies.<br/>
They said that they brought in all measures of 20th July last to get exports up, and to remedy the deficit in the balance of payments. At least on one-sixth, that being the vehicles industry of Britain, they have failed dismally in their motor car and motor vehicle policy to secure an increase in exports. The Midlands today are turgid. The Midlands are the industrial hub of Britain, and industrial activity there revolves around the motor trade. The Midlands are turgid because motor car output has gone down, and the culprit is, of course, the policy of Her Majesty's Government.<br/>
I do not believe that Sir Patrick Hennessy, the President of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, is a good Tory. He may vote Labour for all I know. He has never done me any kindness, nor my party, but from time to time he makes speeches which approximate to what I say in the House of Commons at regular intervals about the motor industry. I quote him tonight for the benefit of the Financial Secretary. At the annual general meeting on 20th April Sir Patrick Hennessy said:
<q>True, we earned a record &#x00A3;800 millions&#x2014;or over &#x00A3;1,500 for every minute of every day&#x2014;through the export of our various products; true, too, that we are the world's largest exporters of commercial vehicles and agricul-

tural tractors. All this is good and our ascendency must be retained. But we are not exporting nearly as much as we could, and this is especially the case with motor cars. For this there are a number of reasons quite apart from labour problems at our factories.</q>
Then he said:
<q>The restrictions on our home market, by preventing the spread of production costs over maximum output, have already promoted price increases here and are threatening competitive price levels abroad. In addition, diminishing profits are tending to curtail essential investment. Because of the external duties, the lights are changing from amber to red at the valuable frontiers of the Common Market countries. Rhodesia is no longer open to us. The Commonwealth nations are more and more interested in local production and there are a number of developing countries outside the Commonwealth where this comment also applies. And lastly, E.F.T.A. is not, so far, what we hoped it would be. None of these factors is within the control of the industry. And our manufacturers are to be left to linger in low gear. That is clearly the message of last week's Budget proposals. It was a barren Budget, bereft of any encouragement whatever to industry. But we are, of course, still supposed to export to more and more.</q>
Let those words speak for themselves. I can do no better. They are far more eloquent, coming from a leader of this great industry, than any words I could pronounce in this Committee. But I give the Financial Secretary a warning from the Midlands. He is hardly a Midlander, perched on a branch at Derby. The motor trade is centred in and around Birmingham, and the motor workers live largely in Worcestershire, which is why they elected me as their Member. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I said "largely". I agree that there are a few motor car workers in Coventry. If I were the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence), who is a good "Brummagen" citizen, I would not draw attention to Coventry. There are three Coventry Members&#x2014;all Labour. Where are they? Not one of them is here to hear me talking about the motor car industry.</p>

<p>They are not busy. They should be supporting me in trying to knock the Treasury down in respect of the Purchase Tax on cars.<br/>
I have alluded to the drop in home sales of motor cars in March&#x2014;down by 20 per cent., and in April&#x2014;down by 30 per cent. What the Committee has to


remember is that the first half of every year is the best and the second half the worst. Therefore, there may be far worse to come in the second half of this year than we have experienced in the first half, notably in March and April. I quote from the <i>Financial Times</i> of 17th May under the heading
<q>The worst car slump since 1929?</q>
<q>This end-year slump has grown sharply in recent years. Over the past five years the percentage split first half year and second half year has been as follows: 1962, 59 per cent. in the first half of the year and 41 per cent. in the second; 1963, 55 per cent. and 45 per cent.; 1964, 58 per cent. and 42 per cent.; 1965, 62 per cent. and 38 per cent. and 1966, 66 per cent. and 34 per cent.</q>
So if for 1967 the figures are 66 per cent. for the first half year and 34 per cent. for the second half year and the figures follow the trend of March and April, the motor car industry will be in a dreadful condition during the off-season period&#x2014;the second six months of the year.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. The Labour crowd were in. I had forgotten that. I must say, in fairness to the Labour crowd, however, that in 1929 motor cars did not loom so large in the economy as they do today.<br/>
I want the Treasury to reinvigorate the motor trade. I do not say "invigorate" because we did that between 1951 and 1964. Let the Treasury bear in mind the fact that there are only two ways of doing it. One is by the relaxation of hire purchase, which is a relatively quick and relatively mild way, and the other way is by a reduction in Purchase Tax. If the Treasury reduces Purchase Tax on cars it takes a long time to have effect. We have had recent experience of that. I remind the Financial Secretary that my right hon. Friend the Member for Barnet (Mr. Maudling), when Chancellor of the Exchequer, gave us all a Guy Fawkes Day bonus on 5th November, 1962, and brought about the biggest single reduction in Purchase Tax on any commodity in one swoop. He reduced the Purchase Tax on cars from 50 per cent. to 25 per cent. But it took seven months for the Purchase Tax reduction, dramatic as it was, to work its way through the entire economic system.</p>

<p>I well remember the episode to which the hon. Gentleman refers. It had the effect of taking &#x00A3;50 away from everybody who owned a car and also seriously jeopardising the prosperity of car hire firms, as I know very well. I have heard many bitter complaints about the abruptness of that reduction.</p>

<p>The hon. Member is a latter-day fiscal Scrooge. Who has ever heard of the community being unhappy when taxes are reduced? Only the hon. Member, and he is a fiscal Scrooge. I am not unhappy when that kind of thing is done.<br/>
But I am being utterly serious in saying that there is a fundamental cleavage in our respective approaches to these matters. The Treasury Ministers take the view that it can get more exports by damping down and depressing the home market. I take precisely the opposite view. Until the home market is reinvigorated in motor cars&#x2014;the most expensive and most sophisicated of consumer durables&#x2014;it will not be possible substantially to increase our exports.<br/>
I point out to the Financial Secretary the results of Government policy upon the British Motor Corporation, as shown in its accounts for the last six months, published a few weeks ago. The company lost &#x00A3;7&#x00BD; million in half a year. I agree that some of the loss was due to industrial disputes, but it was most largely due to the freeze since 20th July last.<br/>
I make no apologies for concentrating on the motor trade, because new Clause No. 1 is the motor trade, and although, Sir Ronald, you have not called it with the Amendment, it amounts to the same thing. I want what is in new Clause 1&#x2014;a unilateral relief of Purchase Tax on motor cars&#x2014;as infinitely the preferable recourse to relaxation of hire purchase as a means of raising once again home sales of cars and thereby reinvigorating an industry which, it should endlessly be repeated, is worth &#x00A3;800 million a year of British exports, or 16&#x00BD; per cent. of the total.<br/>
I hope that I shall have some support from Scotland. The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East was a neighbour of mine in the Midlands 15 years ago. We lived a few hundred yards apart, and we were always interested in the motor industry. Scotland is interested in the industry today. Bathgate is not doing so


well. Let the hon. Gentleman speak for Scotland and for British cars, for this is the means of driving the Volkswagen and the Mercedes and all these other wretched foreign vehicles off British roads.</p>

<p>The traditional outlook of light engineering in Britain goes back to the nineteenth century&#x2014;that the basis of successful exports is a sound home market. This was the traditional concept not of Liberalism, but of Conservatism&#x2014;that a vast, protected home market gave the chance to market surplus products at a low price in world markets.<br/>
I have always strongly advocated our joining the European Economic Community, on the grounds of the twentieth century demand that to satisfy a home market with an economic product one must manufacture for the world. I would reverse the proposition of the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Sir G. Nabarro). I believe that, to give the British consumer a good product, a manufacturer with all the latest techniques of automation must be able to market his product in the rest of the world.<br/>
To think solely in terms of a huge production for a home market to get exports is to fail lamentably. The success of Japan, America and West Germany is that they have built up not a solid home market, but a good foreign market. Therefore, their manufacturers give the home consumer a better product than we can. This is the result of the twentieth century technical change.<br/>
I was employed in the motor industry in the West Midlands for some years. This change is the reason that many of us advocate the breaking-down of tariffs to extend world trade so that we can manufacture for world markets instead of our own narrow national markets. I am very proud of the motor trade, which I think has made a great contribution to the world's economy, especially with the social revolution wrought by the internal combustion engine. I went into the trade in 1918, from which time we have made a great contribution in that way.<br/>
One of the greatest problems in marketing many consumer durables, but especially the motor car, in the world, whether Europe or America, is the system of franchise established between manufac-

turers and distributors. It is almost impossible for a British manufacturer to get a franchise in France or Germany. N.S.U., in Germany, controls practically all the service stations. It is difficult to get agencies in Europe for B.M.C. or Rootes products.<br/>
In our country, the manufacturers&#x2014;B.M.C, Ford and Vauxhall&#x2014;give a franchise to garage proprietors as sole distributors. This is done in the United States, Canada and Australia, also. Holdens are getting almost complete control in Australia. This is done in Europe. Through Total and N.S.U. and other agencies, garage proprietors in France have the same system. One of the difficulties for a British manufacturer is to distribute and service his product through a chain of service stations in world markets.<br/>
The hon. Member for Worcestershire, South quoted figures for the export of motor cars, but they did not include the vast trade under what is called "C.K.D.". B.M.C. has an assembly plant in Europe, Canada and America where crated components are sent not as motor cars, but as light engineering products and assembled under this system of "complete knock down". That form of traffic has increased considerably because of the development of container terminals and container traffic. It is becoming more economical to export the 3,000 or more units that go to make up a motor car in containers and to assemble them in the countries in which they are to be marketed, where local labour can be employed&#x2014;</p>

Second Reading about the purpose of the Amendment, because he then indicated that his intention was not to seek the wider adoption of 16&#x00BD; per cent. as a rate which he described as being monstrously complicated. He said that his object was to get a major debate on T.V.A. and the means of rebating it for exporters. Perhaps he has transferred that intention to another Amendment.</p>

Gentleman began by saying that the Amendment is in its present from because he is able to make proposals only to reduce taxation and not to increase it; and he has, therefore, tabled an Amendment proposing to reduce the 27&#x00BD; per cent. rate to the 16&#x00BD; per cent. rate as a peg on which to hang a debate about the motor industry. In replying to that I must, however, look at the substance of the Amendment.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman gave his estimate of the cost of the Amendment, if accepted, as &#x00A3;180 million. I think that, in making his calculation, he ignored what would be the effect on consumption if the tax change proposed in the Amendment were made; and our estimate is that the cost in a full year would be about &#x00A3;165 million. As to the effect of this rate of duty on the motor industry, he began by saying that the rate&#x2014;and I believe that he meant, in particular, the regulator increase&#x2014;had had dire effects on the motor industry. It is a matter for argument how much the effects of which he is complaining are due to the effects of the Purchase Tax duty and how much to the hire-purchase restrictions included in the July measures.<br/>
The hon. Member for Worcestershire, South went on to give figures about the

decline in the sale of motor cars both in the home market and overseas. He described that as the measure of the failure of the Government to get car exports and to assist the motor industry. I am sure that he would be one of the first to assert that when any industry does well, be it in home sales or abroad, this is due, and due alone, to the wonderful efforts of those in the industry. It is only when an industry does badly that the whole responsibility for the achievement, or lack of achievement, of the industry is laid at the doors of the Government, particularly a Labour Government.<br/>
I thought that the fallacy of the hon. Gentleman's position was exposed by the letter which he read from Sir Patrick Hennessy, which gave a much fairer appraisal of all the difficulties that have been confronting the motor industry's exports. As Sir Patrick said, very many of those factors are outside the control of the industry. Equally, they are outside the control of the Government.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mr. Bence) pointed out, to a very great extent these are marketing problems which the motor industry has had in other countries. One knows, for example, of the great efforts&#x2014;and, a few years ago, the immensely successful efforts&#x2014;of this industry in increasing its sales in the American market which is one of the markets that has been disappointingly hardening for the industry.<br/>
In these circumstances, and in a situation in which the Government have had to take severe economic measures to reduce demand at home, it is very questionable whether to have attempted to exempt the motor industry at home from the restrictive effects of those measures would have assisted it materially to overcome those difficulties it has had in these foreign markets.<br/>
I can see, and the Government understand, that from the long-term point of view, a large and prosperous home market is an extremely important factor for the industry's export trade, but it is not the only factor of which the Government could take account when they were having to contend, as we still are having to contend, with the balance of payments problem that has been confronting the country now for some considerable time.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman referred to a report that had appeared in the <i>Financial Times</i> alleging that Sir George Harriman had been received recently by the Treasury and that it appeared that the Treasury's attitude to Purchase Tax on cars was weakening. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman did not see, but that story has been corrected in the Press. It was incorrect. Sir George Harriman was not received at the Treasury. That may be some indication of the accuracy of the prediction that was contained in the report.<br/>
It is true that, naturally, representations have been made by the motor industry to the Treasury, and these will be considered, as are other representations received about the effect of taxation and the other July measures upon different industries. In particular, the Treasury keeps under continuous review the effect of those measures upon an industry occupying as important a part in our economy as the motor industry does. The hon. Gentleman will not expect me, therefore, in a debate on whether the 27&#x00BD; per cent. rate of Purchase Tax should be reduced to 16&#x00BD; per cent., to comment any further upon that. I must advise the Committee that in present circumstances it would be quite inconcievable to accept an Amendment the cost of which to the Revenue would be at a rate of &#x00A3;165 million a year.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties of giving advice to my hon. Friends the Members for Worcestershire, South (Sir G. Nabarro) and for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) is that if one advises them to divide, they always do so&#x2014;and do so with enthusiasm&#x2014;while if one advises them not to divide one has much less certainty about the response one will get.<br/>
On this occasion, however, I must say that I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South will not press his very cogent arguments to a Division. That hope is based on the point of cost alone. A sum of &#x00A3;165 million is most formidable, and, although we shall with enthusiasm at the appropriate time suggest a reduction in direct taxation, we feel that this can be and should be balanced by reductions in transfer payments and Government expenditure.

Nevertheless, I think that this short debate has been very well worth while because of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South and because it has shown clearly that there is a fundamental difference between the two sides of the Committee.<br/>
Indeed, there are two fundamental differences. The first is the one to which my hon. Friend referred which concerns the belief held by hon. Members opposite that the royal road to increasing exports is to damp down the home market. I agree with my hon. Friend that that is nonsense, particularly in relation to car manufacture. Car exports will come only from a buoyant home market, and it would be wise for the Government to take this into account.<br/>
The other fundamental difference goes wider and I touch only briefly on it now. We are from time to time urging what one might call moderate reflation on the Government and, in my judgment, slowly the Government will give way to us. The reason, and this is the fundamental difference between us, is that we on this side take a gloomier view about it than do the Government Front Bench. We are not as optimistic about the 3 per cent. growth and we do not take the particularly complacent view about unemployment. The relevance of this to the Amendment before the Committee is that here is the tap which the Government can turn if they wish and the tap which always first leads into deflation and can lead out of deflation into renewed growth.<br/>
I am very much more worried&#x2014;I have said this many times&#x2014;about the level of unemployment than the Government seem to be. I have prophesied, and I repeat it, that the June figures&#x2014;we shall see whether I am right or wrong in less than three weeks&#x2014;will probably be higher than in any June since 1939. If that is so, and succeeding months are like that, the Government must consider whether they are wise to be as obdurate as they are to suggestions which come from this side of the Committee.<br/>
There are these two fundamental differences in relation to this matter, the one outlined by my hon. Friend and that which lies behind all these Budget debates. I quote from a Press notice dated today, issued by the Board of Trade, on the turnover of the motor


trades in March. It has come into my hands since my hon. Friend spoke on this Amendment. The first sentence is:
<q>The total turnover of the motor trades in March was 13 per cent. lower than in March, 1966.</q>
It goes on to say:
<q>This fall compared with a year earlier is considerably greater than any recorded during the last twelve months but trading in March last year was moving up to the peak recorded in April which included some pre-budget buying; in addition the comparison may be affected by the Easter holiday this year being within the March period whereas last year it was in the April period.</q>
Those qualifications are fair enough, but they do not take away the impact of the opening sentence that the turnover in March was 13 per cent. lower than in March 1966, and that the fall compared with a year earlier is considerably greater than any recorded during the last 12 months.<br/>
I urge the Financial Secretary to reflect on this debate even if my hon. Friend the Member for Worcestershire, South decides not to press the Amendment to a Division, because here is a way to relieve the employment situation. I do not say that it is necessarily wise, because I understand the Government's position, but if they are as worried as some of us are about unemployment they should reflect very much on the statement made by my hon. Friend. If we agree to pass soon from this Amendment, I hope that the Government will not pass from it in their thoughts, because I believe it is later than the Government think.</p>

<p>I had not intended to intervene in this debate, but I have been distinctly upset by the rather pious arguments advanced by right hon. and hon. Members opposite about the sanctity of the level of demand in the car industry, because, if I recollect correctly, in October, 1958, right hon. Members opposite removed all hire-purchase restrictions on cars, to create a 30 per cent. boom in car sales, to create a pre-election boom to enable them to win the 1959 General Election.</p>

<p>"Rot", says the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South (Sir G. Nabarro). This is the level of con-

tribution we have come to expect from the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
If it is rot to say that that was a carefully created boom, why, hire purchase restrictions having been removed 12 months before right hon. and hon. Members opposite held a General Election, were hire-purchase restrictions re-imposed six months after they had won that General Election on the boom created in the car industry? So let us not have any of the pious nonsense we have had from right hon. and hon. Members opposite. They do not care about the car industry. They merely care about a few petty political points they might be able to make at the moment.</p>

<p>I had not intended to intervene in the debate again. The hon. Member for Swansea, West (Mr. Alan Williams) has referred to a few petty local difficulties. If he thinks that the troubles of the motor industry in the Midlands today are a few petty local difficulties, he should resume his place on a parish council, where he would be in a more appropriate setting than in the House of Commons.<br/>
I will answer his gibe about the Tory Party as a matter of historical fact. The Tory Party reduced the Purchase Tax on motor cars from 50 per cent. to 25 per cent, on 5th November, 1962, 23 months before the General Election held in October, 1964. Had it been an election gambit, the reduction would have taken place a few months before the election. The hon. Gentleman did not do me the courtesy of even listening to my speech. He has just entered the Chamber. He spoke from ignorance, innocence and inexperience of the House of Commons.<br/>
With those few words of admonition to the hon. Gentleman, may I thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) for his propitious and happy advice as to my behaviour at the end of this debate on this important Amendment. I readily accept that advice. I shall continue my efforts on behalf of the motor trade during the next few months, which, I believe, will be critical to it.<br/>
The Financial Secretary had not been briefed properly by the Treasury, save only as to the harmonisation of taxes. He displayed his lack of knowledge of the motor industry in what he said in his reply. Despite the inadequacy of the


reply, I shall on this occasion beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 5, in page 47, line 12, to leave out '16 1 3' and to insert'14 12 0'.<br/>
The effect of the Amendment would be to reduce the proposed duty on British spirits per proof gallon to a figure corresponding to that which obtained before 20th July, when the 10 per cent. regulator was imposed. I am especially concerned with a spirit known as "Scotch whisky", a wholesome beverage, all of which originates in Scotland. It is also a commodity factor in this country's exports, particularly to the dollar area.<br/>
Translating the proposed rate of duty to the bottle, it is 37s. 6d. as opposed to 34s. 1d. before 20th July, and as it would be again if the Amendment were accepted.<br/>
The Bill was designed to consolidate the extra charge brought in last July into the Statute. My hon. Friends and I oppose this for two main reasons. The first is that recent increases in tax on Scotch whisky are producing very little extra revenue. The second is that, by imposing these heavy duties at home, we set an unfortunate example to other countries, which then raise their taxes also on Scotch whisky and make exporting more difficult.</p>

<p>I shall come to that point&#x2014;I was intending to take the first reason first&#x2014;but, in a sentence, I can reply to the hon. Gentleman in this way. After the increase in the Budget in April, 1965, 20 other countries, in the following weeks and months, increased their duties, and the relationship between these events was such that it was clear that they had their eye on what the Chancellor of the Exchequer had done in Britain.<br/>
Our first reason is based on the revenue which the Chancellor has been receiving. I say at once that the Amendment would help him to raise more revenue. In the financial year following the raising of the duty in the Budget of 1965, there was a fall in home sales of nearly 1 million proof gallons. That is measured by the home clearances from bond, the appropriate way to measure home sales.<br/>
This was the first time for many years that there had been a reduction in volume at all, but the reduction was 900,000 gallons, from about 9&#x00BD; million proof gallons in the previous year to about 8&#x00BD; million. The amount of extra revenue which the Government received was derisory, and it could be argued that it was hardly worth putting up the tax, having regard to the consequent reduction in home sales and the very limited amount of extra revenue received.<br/>
In trying to explain this fall in revenue during the financial year, the Government kept saying that it was because of Budget forestalling, that before April, 1965, the whisky trade had been making extra moves of whisky from bond because it thought that the duty would be increased. But the same thing applied a year later also. Taking a period of 12 months, one covers two periods of Budget forestalling when comparing two years. Therefore, that argument falls. Perhaps the trade thought that in one Budget there would be more of an increase than in the other, but nowadays, when there is Budget forestalling, everyone guesses what the Government will do and, with a Labour Government, the assumption is always that taxes will go up.</p>

<p>Reverting to the point which the hon. Gentleman made earlier, about other countries putting up the duty, is it his case that there should be a reduction of duty here in the hope that other countries will reduce theirs?</p>

<p>I shall deal with that point later, leaving it until I reach my second argument.<br/>
I now turn to the more recent event of the imposition of the regulator last July. The Chancellor replied to Questions of mine on this point as recently as 4th May. I inquired what had been the


reduction in volume of home sales of Scotch whisky since the regulator was used, that is, from August to February, the latest month for which figures were available, compared with the equivalent period of the previous year. The Chancellor's answer, less than a month ago, was that there had been a reduction of 8 per cent. in the number of gallons, and that only &#x00A3;1 million extra in revenue had resulted.<br/>
In this case the Chancellor cannot sustain the argument that there was Budget forestalling, because he and the Government were saying only a short time before the 20th July measures that there was nothing wrong with our economy and everything was all right. The crisis blew up very quickly; to suggest that the whisky trade could have foreseen those measures in the weeks before would be to ascribe to it powers of second sight. It would have needed a phenomenal prescience to predict the sudden measures by the Government last July, if it is suggested that Budget forestalling for the emergency Budget last July could account for so much of that reduction.</p>

<p>As I was speaking I noticed out of a corner of my eye that there had been an accident with some water on the Table. I was glad to note that it was water and not a more valuable spirit which had been spilled in that way. Whether the Financial Secretary has the same sort of views in his attitude to the Amendment we shall learn later.<br/>
It has been demonstrated during the past two years, as I have shown, that when the duty is raised at its present level it reduces home sales. In the other direction, if the Government reduced the duty now the sales would be increased to a much greater extent. In the general euphoria which would thus be created it would undoubtedly lead to extra revenue for the Exchequer. I therefore hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman will recognise that the Amendment is a revenue-raiser and is not intended to cause the Government to find more money.<br/>
I cannot believe that the Government put whisky into the category of cigarettes,

where there are medical considerations, and where it could be that the Government are trying to discourage consumption. I hope that the Financial Secretary will make it clear that there is no question of the Government's making a deliberate attempt to restrain the home consumption of Scotch whisky. If he does that, as I assume he will, his object in putting up the duty can only be to increase revenue, and, as I have shown, the amount of increase after last July and the previous increase of duty has been derisory.<br/>
I now come to my second argument and the questions that have been asked about it. That is, the effect abroad of increasing the duty at home. Every time Britain has increased the duty, some other countries have followed suit. I do not suggest that in their legislation or in other ways they have directly tied themselves to what has happened in the United Kingdom, but it is clear to those who have been observing that the fact that Britain has increased taxation on her own product has had an important effect on Finance Ministers in the countries concerned. Because Scotch whisky is a remarkable dollar-earner, the Chancellor is taking very serious risks if he appears to penalise the industry in this country.<br/>
The hon. Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Macdonald) asked about the effect on other countries of a positive reduction. The Amendment would not so much make a reduction as keep the duty where it was last July, preventing the increase proposed by the consolidation.<br/>
If the Chancellor were to make this reduction, I would hope that other countries would do likewise, but we have not had recent examples by which to test this. I would encourage the right hon. Gentleman to find out by putting it to the test. But that does not alter the argument that, when Finance Ministers abroad see us increasing the duty here, they use this as an easy excuse to increase it in their own countries.<br/>
There is no conflict here between the home market and these important export markets as regards supplies and, as a result of my inquiries, I am glad to be able to inform the Committee that there are plenty of supplies of whisky maturing in Scotland to provide the reserves for large expansion in the home market and abroad. I ask the Chancellor&#x2014;indeed, I challenge


him&#x2014;to be bold and accept the Amendment. If he did, he would gain, in my view, welcome additional revenue that might well surprise him.</p>

<p>I am delighted to support my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell). He is one of the most persistent campaigners against the penal increases in taxation which the Government have imposed upon the whisky industry and I hope that on this occasion, the Financial Secretary will show himself more amenable to an Amendment which should command the sympathy, if not the support, of all hon. Members, as it is a matter which concerns many of us very closely&#x2014;one could almost say, intimately.<br/>
My hon. Friend has admirably exposed the effect that the surcharge imposed last year has had on withdrawals from bond since August&#x2014;the 6 per cent. drop in the period August to March as compared with the previous year&#x2014;and has dealt effectively with the hon. and learned Gentleman's argument that there had to be a forestalling of the emergency in July by the wielding of an axe which the Government had protested all along that they had no intention of using.<br/>
There is reason to think that the drop in home sales has been somewhat masked and that the real effect of the surcharge may have been greater than the figures suggest because of the big spread of cut-price sales since last August. One would normally have expected to see this leading to a substantial increase in withdrawals from bond. In other words, the 6 per cent. drop probably under-estimates the real effect of the 10 per cent. surcharge.<br/>
Moreover, we see already the very serious effects of these constant increases in the burden of taxation on the whisky industry in Scotland. In the last two months, we have had the reports that the Distillers Company has decided not to go ahead with plans to build expansions to distilleries in Kincardineshire and Ross-shire. All the information suggests that this may be the beginning of an alarming trend.<br/>
Thus, by accepting the Amendment, the Government would not only be giving themselves an opportunity to increase revenue from whisky through higher sales but doing something to reverse the dam-

age they are doing to the whisky industry and the economy of Scotland. These are substantial arguments in favour of the Amendment. I draw the Committee's attention to a book published today, "The Whiskies of Scotland" by Professor R. J. S. McDowall, of London University. In the course of this book, he reminds us of a minute by Sir Winston Churchill to the Minister of Food in 1945 when he said:
<q>On no account reduce the amount of barley for whisky. It takes years to mature and is an invaluable export and dollar earner. Having regard to our difficulties about export, it would be improvident not to reserve this characteristic element of British ascendency.</q>
Those are sentiments which we would all support and I hope the Financial Secretary will say that he is prepared to support them.<br/>
It would be wrong to suggest that the effect of the surcharge so far has been drastically to reduce the prospect of investment in the whisky industry in Scotland. My attention was drawn to an item which appeared in <i>The Times</i> Business News of 18th May about a series of television interviews&#x2014;which I did not see&#x2014;with the merchant bankers. The item appeared under the headline:
<q>&#x00A3;500,000 for The Speaker</q>
I hope that I am not trespassing on dangerous ground here. I am merely quoting from <i>The Times</i> Business News and if there is any breach of privilege, it is <i>The Times</i> Business News which must bear responsibility. It goes on to say:
<q>Those who saw Leslie Kaufman, chairman of the wine and spirit merchants Block Grey and Block, discussing a loan over lunch at Hambros, in the A.T.V. programme on merchant bankers, will no doubt be relieved to learn that he got his money&#x2014;&#x00A3;500,000. It will be used to build a new whisky distillery with a capacity of 750,000 gallons of malt for blending with his firm's product, The Speaker. Great secrecy surrounds the exact location of the site, which has been selected, along with the vital burn.</q>
<q>Block Grey and Block already own a distillery, the MacDuff. in Banff, providing 500,000 gallons of malt a year for the blending of The Speaker. Although the whisky is not tremendously well known in this country, a recent pilot campaign in California has revealed that it goes down well in America, and it is largely for this market that the new distillery will be producing.</q>
This is an example, and we are very glad to see it, of a capital project going ahead essentially for the export market. This is very much what we should have


in mind when considering the burden of taxation on the industry, and about that I agree very much with my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn.<br/>
It is worth noting that since the 10 per cent. surcharge there have been demands for a countervailing duty in the United States on imports of Scotch whisky, and I suggest there is a clear connection between the two. Equally, in 1965 the Budget increase led to an increase almost immediately afterwards of &#x00A3;1 l1s. per gallon in the Australian duty, and this resulted in a drop of one-third in exports of whisky to Australia last year. These are some of the repercussions of the way in which the Government constantly raise the burden of Excise Duty on whisky.<br/>
There is another aspect which I find totally incongruous. Whisky is charged at a rate of 3s. 2&#x00BD;d. per degree of alcoholic strength. By contrast, imported sherry is charged at a rate of 1s. l&#x00BE;d. per degree of alcoholic strength. If we have any doubt about the effect of this remarkable bias against the home product, we should look at the figures for imports of wine, brandy and rum over the year ending April, 1967.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
Wine was down by about 3 per cent. in volume, but that meant up in price and in the cost of imports. Brandy was down by 1&#x00BD; per cent. in volume, and again substantially up in terms of the cost of imports. For rum there was a 70 per cent. increase in volume between May, 1966, and April, 1967, compared with May, 1965, and April, 1966.<br/>
This is over a period when home sales of whisky were down by 6 per cent. It is hard to conceive of any clearer indication of the way in which the burden of taxation on home-produced Scotch whisky is now diverting people to the purchase of imported wines and spirits. For a Government who are still labouring with an extremely awkward balance of payments problem could there be any greater irresponsibility? On all these grounds I find it hard to believe that we will not have a forthcoming answer from the Financial Secretary. If he accepts this Amendment he will get a substantial increase in revenue. He will help an export industry vital to Scotland and at the same time give enormous satisfaction to the vast majority of hon. Members of this Com-

mittee, and our electors in the country at large.</p>

<p>I should like to support very warmly the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) and supported by my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne). They have put the facts quite explicitly and even to Members opposite it must be obvious that this is an extremely good case. I am speaking with no constituency problem&#x2014;unfortunately there is no distillery in my constituency. I am taking a dispassionate view, looking at it from the point of view of the Scots first and Britain secondly. Obviously the country is losing not only in exports but also in revenue.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Moray and Nairn has given us the figures. Following the years of steady rise and expansion we are very concerned to stop the likely fall in exports. This is partially due to the price in the European market. It is a very valid point that, when the price goes up in Britain, it is only logical for the European countries to say "Well, if they are prepared to have an expensive drink in Britain, we will have an expensive drink in France, Germany, Scandinavia and so on." It is very true that taxation abroad has followed increases in taxation here.</p>

<p>There is also the point that by increasing the price of whisky in those countries, they are endeavouring to cut consumption down and to improve their balance of trade position by forcing people to buy wine and brandy.</p>

<p>This is very true, and we are doing exactly the reverse by encouraging sales of wine at the expense of whisky No doubt with the appalling turnover of whisky the Chancellor will be losing the profits of the whisky companies. My hon. Friends have touched on the concern in the Highlands about the expansion in the building of distilleries. There is no doubt that there is a slowing down at a time when we are desperately in need of expansion in that part of the world, where there is very little alternative employment and where the service industries are being seriously hampered by the Selective Employment Tax. Not only in the Highlands is this so, but even in the Southwest, in Girvan and Wigtownshire, there


are distilleries, and they need employment just as do those further north.<br/>
There is no doubt that this trend of falling consumption has been accelerated by the rising taxation over the past year. The sum of 36s. a bottle taxation has put a very severe handicap on consumption, and the dangers are very obvious. There is no doubt, as my hon. Friends have pointed out, that the unfair burden of duty as between imported wines at 114s. 9d. per gallon at 35 degrees and 321s. per gallon for proof whisky is extremely unfavourable to one of our most important home industries, and, indeed, for exports.<br/>
Why do the Government give this favourable treatment to wine at the expense of our industry in Scotland? The increase in duty last July seems to have failed in its intention of increasing revenue, which is what all logical people can only assume is the reason for increases in taxation. It is essential for the Government to accept the Amendment and reduce the burden of taxation on the whisky industry and give it encouragement to expand and to export.</p>

<p>I should begin my brief remarks by declaring a personal interest, because, although some people might think otherwise, I have an interest in whisky matters and it is, therefore, right I should state this before I start.<br/>
In reinforcing some of the remarks which have been made by my hon. Friends, I would like to address myself to the effects of this tax on what, I think we would all agree, is one of our most important export industries. The whisky industry accounts for about one-quarter of Scotland's exports. That is an important proportion of the exports of the United Kingdom as a whole.<br/>
In considering the remarks which have been made in this debate, which has been held in one form or another many times in the past few years, I ask the Financial Secretary to grasp the essential fact that tonight we are discussing this matter against the background of a completely new situation. Over a period of many years, the duty on whisky has been increased on a considerable number of occasions. Much as most of us may have regretted that continual increase, one

factor which has always remained constant throughout that time is that the increase has nevertheless failed to prevent sales of whisky in this country from continuing to rise. All through the years, the arguments which have been presented by those who know this important industry have been made that much weaker because, despite the increases in duty, the sales of whisky have still continued to rise.<br/>
The important thing tonight is that we are discussing this matter not merely against a failure of sales to rise since the last increase in duty, but against the background of a fall in sales which it would be fair to describe as drastic. A product which has been accustomed to increase its sales by a considerable percentage every year and which has benefited greatly, as the consumer also has done, from the economies which this has made possible, suddenly finds that it is crippled by a drastic reduction in sales due to the fact that, at long last, what so many of us have always feared has happened and the last increase of duty to the present staggering figure has resulted in the consumer giving up the struggle and deciding that it is altogether too difficult to go on paying such a terrific rate of duty on this drink.<br/>
I hope that the Treasury Ministers will take this matter seriously. If they do, they will, no doubt, be reinforced by the fact that they have for once not enjoyed a substantial increase in revenue following the last increase in duty. Although I do not, perhaps, put that argument as high as the Treasury representatives may do, it might bear more strongly upon them than the argument which I am making. It is important that we should realise that we are debating this subject against a new background.<br/>
Another matter which has not been covered fully in my hon. Friends' remarks and with which I agree entirely is that it is not sometimes realised by those not involved in it that the whisky industry requires a very long-term investment programme. It is well known that whisky has to be matured for at least three years before it can be blended and marketed and that the more important malt whiskies are matured for a good deal longer. As a result, the scale of capital investment is quite tremendous in terms of building, insurance and the cost of the


product sitting for a number of years unable to be sold but having to be looked after under careful and expensive conditions.<br/>
In those circumstances, it is particularly worrying for an industry which has to look ahead three, four, five, six or more years suddenly to be faced with a drop in home sales last year of 6 per cent. because, as one of my hon. Friends said, probably this masks a real drop in sales of considerably more.<br/>
The drop in sales and the latest increase in duty has not only resulted in a reduced consumption but is likely considerably to embarrass the industry in its future plans for expansion and development. It means, also, that the ability of one of our main exporting industries to sell abroad is likely to be threatened.<br/>
I have always felt that the Treasury and successive Governments generally do not give enough weight to the fact, about which there is no doubt, in the minds of those who export whisky, that there is a definite relationship between increases in duty at home and increases imposed by foreign countries. Countries abroad which import whisky look to the home market as an example in many ways. It is a known theory in the industry that it is difficult to sell a product abroad successfully in the long term unless it is known to be successful at home. There is a link between home and export sales and, having been involved in this industry in a small way, I have no doubt that, when duty goes up at home, although other countries do not increase their duties by the same amount, within a few months one can detect a trend in other countries to raise their duties.<br/>
I hope that the Financial Secretary will take note of these. points and bear with us in stressing that, although we have debated this matter many times in past years, we are debating it today against a new background. It is time for some new thinking from the Treasury, and I hope that the Government will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>It is an unhappy task for a Celt to have to advise the Committee to reject an Amendment which seeks to reduce the duty on whisky. Although I am not a Scottish Celt, I suppose that I have an interest as an Irish Celt. I must explain to the Committee the rele-

vance of that, because it would not be possible to accept the Amendment as it stands alone. To do so would involve a breach both of the E.F.T.A. Agreement and of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement unless the Customs duties on spirits imported from E.F.T.A. countries and from Eire were reduced at the same time and to the same level.<br/>
But even if we were to do that it would not be the end of the story, because that would introduce a reverse preference of &#x00A3;1 9s. 3d. per proof gallon against other Commonwealth producers, for example, Jamaican rum and Canadian whisky. The introduction of a large reverse preference of that kind would give rise to serious objections, so the fact is that, as has been found in the past, there is no practical alternative to moving the various Customs and Excise rates in parallel together. This was done when the regulator was imposed, and it is embodied in the consolidation in the Schedule which we are discussing, and which the Amendment seeks to alter.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
Representations were made before the Budget both by the Scotch Whisky Association, which suggested the removal of the surcharge, and by the Wine and Spirit Association, which asked for reductions of duty on wines and spirits and stressed, in particular, the claims for spirits. Both Associations drew attention to the reduction in consumption which has taken place, and which has been referred to, I think by nearly every hon. Member who has spoken to the Amendment.<br/>
The hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. G. Campbell) challenged the contention which has been made by Government spokesmen that the figures of the clearances since the introduction of the surcharge somewhat overstate the actual fall in consumption which has taken place since the introduction of the regulator. The hon. Gentleman thought that our argument about forestalling was false, but I assure him that there is clear evidence that there was heavy forestalling by withdrawals in June before the introduction of the regulator, and these contentions have, I think, been borne out by the figures which are becoming available of the actual fall in consumption. Whereas the level of clearances showed a


reduction of 8 per cent., it seems that the figure for the fall in consumption is about 5 per cent.</p>

<p>There is clear evidence&#x2014;and others anticipated that measures would be required&#x2014;that the June clearances were abnormally high.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked me to confirm that there was no intention on the part of the Government to reduce the consumption of whisky. That is not our intention. The intention of the measures, of which this forms part, was to restrain demand, and that is an operation which is bound to affect consumption, and to affect it particularly in matters such as this.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman went on to argue from the effect of these increases in consumption that to accept this reduction in the duty would produce an increase in revenue. This is a contention which we cannot accept. The estimate which we have is exactly to the contrary. The estimated revenue in 1967&#x2013;68, at post-Budget rates, from spirits is &#x00A3;275 million. We estimate that the loss of revenue which would result from a reduction of the kind proposed in the Amendment, with the consequential reductions in Customs duty which I have explained would have to come with it, would be about &#x00A3;12 million in a full year.<br/>
Indeed, if it were practicable to confine the reduction to Excise spirits and spirits imported from E.F.T.A. and the Irish Republic, the cost would be about &#x00A3;9 million to &#x00A3;10 million, depending on the extent to which the consumption was switched to British, E.F.T.A. or Irish spirits at the expense of the more heavily dutied brandy, rum, and so on, from other countries.</p>

<p>Are the estimates that the Financial Secretary is giving us based on the assumption that home consumption of whisky would not be affected by a change in the level of duty? If so, how can he produce such an argument when he has admitted that even home

<p>I should need notice of that question in relation to whisky.<br/>
Some hon. Members argued that the increases in duty on spirits made by other countries were in some way a retaliation for the increases in duty which took place in this country. One hon. Member used the phrase "a countervailing duty". With respect, there is no evidence for that. Other countries may have experienced the fact that has been experienced by Chancellors in this country, that whisky is an article that can bear a high rate of duty and sustain a high level of consumption. Other countries may be guided by considerations similar to those which guide Governments here. There is no evidence that it is in any way a retaliatory measure. If any view of that kind were taken we should know about it and receive representations from other countries. Nothing of the kind occurs.<br/>
One hon. Member raised the question of the Selective Employment Tax in relation to this matter. I thought that that was an odd argument, because the production of whisky is a manufacturing activity which attracts the premium. This industry benefits rather than suffers from the introduction of that Tax.<br/>
The main argument has been put forward on the basis of the pattern of consumption as it is affected by the duty. We shall certainly watch this. I undertake that that will be done before my right hon. Friend frames his next Budget. But for this year the item forms part of the total decision for the consolidation of the regulator increases. The total amount involved is about &#x00A3;150 million. We see no reason to make an exception here, or to take the view that a sufficient case has been made out for an exception


to be made in respect of the whisky industry. As the cost of making such an exception would be about &#x00A3;12 million, together with the other consequential reductions which would be necessary, it is not something that I can advise the Committee to adopt.</p>

<p>I think that, just now, when the water was spilled on the Table, a voice with a Scottish accent behind me said, "Water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink."<br/>
I do not wish to curtail the debate, but want to support the Amendment and add to the comprehensive case put forward by my hon. Friends, which was a clear example of our complaints earlier that the regulator is being used by the Government to introduce a general increase in taxation. It is significant that we are debating this increase after it has been imposed for a number of months. The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for South Angus (Mr. Bruce-Gardyne) about the balance of payments is important, and should not be overlooked, but the Financial Secretary failed to cover it.<br/>
We should not assume that all increases under the regulator which are made and then consolidated justify a claim later that one cannot discriminate between increases in duty on different items. If the proposals had been made as individual increases, we should have considered them on their merits. It is right that my hon. Friends should put forward this Amendment so that this case can be made.<br/>
The Financial Secretary's answer was not satisfactory, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Sir D. Glover) clearly brought out. Our experience of reductions in taxation on spirits is extre-

mely limited. We need to probe&#x2014;if not now, in the future&#x2014;the exact extent to which the Government feel that a change in taxation is likely to effect the sales of whisky and the Chancellor's consequent revenue&#x2014;</p>

<p>Indeed it did.<br/>
One point which is worrying us is the way in which any increase in competition which leads to a reduction in the price of a product tends to be offset by an increase in taxation imposed by the Government. The effect of the ending of resale price maintenance has been to reduce the cost of whisky on retail and increase sales, but this favourable effect, which might have given increased encouragement to the Scottish whisky industry to expand has been largely offset.<br/>
Then we come to the important question of regional development. A total of 95 per cent. of those employed in this industry, both in distilling and packaging, are in Scotland, and whisky accounts for one-quarter of all Scotland's exports. This surely makes it a very important factor in the consideration of the kind of regional policy which the Government say they wish to advocate.<br/>
It is not good enough to say, on the one hand, that perhaps we could have a regional employment premium&#x2014;this, clearly, will not get industry from elsewhere to move to Scotland in the whisky trade&#x2014;and, on the other, that there must be a serious effect on the Scottish industry by the imposition and perpetuation of this kind of tax.<br/>
The Government appear to be following an inconsistent policy towards Scotland, a policy which my hon. Friends are absolutely right to oppose. For that reason I trust&#x2014;naturally, after this matter


has been further discussed because I have no doubt that other hon. Members will wish carefully to consider the issue&#x2014;that my hon. Friends will press this matter to a Division unless we are given a more satisfactory answer by the Government.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends will join with my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) in regretting the reply of the Financial Secretary. I go further and say that it was not only a disappointing reply but an alarming one, for the hon. and learned Gentleman sheltered behind such feeble defences. He said that it would be unthinkable for the Government to remove this surcharge because of the effect it would have on our imports of drink from E.F.T.A. and Commonwealth countries. This is a sudden recognition of a delicacy of feeling which did not exist in the Government's heart some months ago. I recall how the Government threw aside our E.F.T.A. rules soon after they took office in 1964. Wht effect does the hon. and learned Gentleman think that our application to join the Common Market may have on imports of spirits and drink from Commonwealth countries? The hon. and learned Gentleman was not advancing a reasonable argument, particularly at this time.<br/>
The Financial Secretary also adduced other astonishing arguments. He said that the whisky trade had, in some clairvoyant way, anticipated the Prime Minister's statement of 20th July of last year. That is one of the most remarkable tributes I have ever heard paid to the Scotch whisky industry. I recall how we were told day after day, before 20th July, that there was no need for the Government to take emergency measures. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was no need for them; but the Scotch whisky industry, in its wisdom, knew that such measures were coming. The Prime Minister openly&#x2014;and, I understand, in other ways, too&#x2014;let it be known a few days before his statement in July of last year that there would be no emergency measures because there was need for them. Now the Financial Secretary tells us that the Scotch whisky industry knew all about these measures a month or more before they were taken.<br/>
When the Prime Minister appeared in the House some days before the statement of 20th July was made he confessed, in effect, that he was so surprised at the need for such measures to be taken that he could not tell the House just then what they would be&#x2014;and then he went to Moscow. For the Financial Secretary now to suggest that the Scotch whisky trade shaped its commercial judgment and forestalled the measures of 20th July because it knew in advance about the temporary surcharge is to make a completely bogus argument.</p>

<p>Would not my hon. Friend agree that the only conclusion to be drawn, if one accepts the Financial Secretary's argument, is that the Scotch whisky trade knew that there would be an emergency Budget on 20th July simply because, under a Labour Government, we need an emergency Budget every 20th July?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend advances a good argument. The Financial Secretary has been assuring us that the surcharge was well known to the Scotch whisky trade&#x2014;an argument which, to put it mildly, makes nonsense.<br/>
I emphasise that we are in a new situation. The Financial Secretary knows that year after year the Scotch Whisky Association and hon. Members on both sides state, at the time of the Budget and in discussing the Finance Bill, that the duty on whisky must come down. This is a natural and perfectly proper exercise Over the years it has become something of an annual ritual, but I hope that the hon. and learned Gentleman recognises that in the last year or two the ritual has become something more serious in nature.<br/>
The whole nature of the market has changed, and the Minister himself recognised this. Although he quibbled with some of my hon. Friends about the figures they quoted, he said that domestic sales had fallen. The reason is that consumption is falling, and it is falling because the duty has gone up yet again&#x2014;it has gone up several times during the lifetime of this Government&#x2014;yet the increase in the yield has been derisory.<br/>
I ask the Minister to pay more attention than he has done so far to what my hon. Friends have said about the way in which foreign countries follow our


pattern. I have spoken to a number of people abroad, in the whisky trade and outside it, and I am satisfied that foreign Governments watch the trend here. Whisky is one of our great national drinks, and if the British Government find that the revenue is increased by increasing the duty more and more foreign Governments feel that they can follow our lead and increase the duty domestically.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman may dismiss this agument, but I ask him to ponder it carefully. Whisky is not the only drink available to the foreign drinker. Fashions change. An area which today is a whisky drinking area because whisky has become fashionable may not be a whisky drinking area tomorrow, under the pressure of competition, under the pressure of changing tastes, and under the pressure, above all, of changing fashion.<br/>
Fashion changes very often because of pressure of price, and if the price of whisky goes much higher we will find it very much harder to convert drinkers from their native whisky, or vodka or whatever the fashionable drink may be, to the Scotch whisky which we sell to them, and which we must continue to sell to them in ever-increasing quantities if we are to retain the enormous contribution that this great trade makes to our balance of payments.<br/>
I ask the Financial Secretary to reflect on this further point. If, in the national interest, he is, as I hope, to give some consideration to the position of the consumer abroad&#x2014;who is not compelled to buy our whisky, who is influenced by fashion and changing tastes and, above all, by the price of the product he is asked to buy&#x2014;will he give some thought also to the consumer at home, who has been mentioned very little in this debate?<br/>
There is in Scotland widespread resentment, and this resentment has continued for years under successive Governments, at the way in which the Scottish people feel their national drink is flogged by Governments year by year. This has now reached an intolerable situation. The Scots, who produce this great drink, are largely unable to afford it any more. This is quite wrong. They see it as unjust, and as yet another insult to Scotland. It may or may not be&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman knows that a very great event occurred in Scotland last Thursday night. It was celebrated in Scotland, in England and Wales, in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland, in America, Canada, Malta, Cyprus&#x2014;even in Portugal.

<p>I suspect that more and more beer was drunk, because beer is not subject to the same swingeing and increasing rate of duty. I know that the hon. Member for Coatbridge and Airdrie (Mr. Dempsey) leads a very sober life, but if he were to look at some of the public houses in his constituency, and some of the hotels in the country districts, he would find, as I have, that more and more Scottish people are not any longer able to afford what they quite rightly regard as their national drink. That is because the rate of duty has been increased so steeply. I therefore ask the Financial Secretary to give some thought to the consumer at home, and particularly to the consumer in the country which produces this great drink.<br/>
One important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Mr. Monro) was completely misunderstood. He reminded the Financial Secretary that several hon. Members had referred to the way in which these increases in duty have affected the expansion programmes of the Scotch whisky trade. My hon. Friends have reminded the Committee that several important ventures are not going ahead because of the increase in duty and the effect which this has already had on domestic consumption. This is yet another problem which the people of the Highland have to face on top of the other problems they face as a result of Selective Employment Tax. Of course the distilling trade gets the premium. I wish that many more industries would get the premium. But there is very little manufacturing industry in the Highlands and the people there will suffer if the Scotch whisky trade declines.<br/>
I ask the Financial Secretary to reflect on the fact that the position has changed because consumption is falling. Will he also consider the indisputable evidence that foreign countries follow our lead? Will he remember in that connection that


fashions and tastes change, and that an important part is played in this by the price of the product. If by the duty he forces up the price he is damaging the prospects for a great currency earning product.</p>

<p>Tonight, the Financial Secretary made the weakest reply we have heard in a debate on a Finance Bill for a long time. He has apparently accepted advice from the Customs and Excise and from an officer who, if he were only 23 at the time when the duty was last reduced, must be at least 95 today. I am glad to know that the Government are accepting the advice of a nonegenarian, but it is ridiculous to say that a reduction on the duty in spirits would not affect consumption.</p>

<p>We shall all read HANSARD and perhaps we shall have another debate on this matter later.
<q>Whom God wishes to destroy, he first makes mad.</q>
We know that we have a mad Government, but they do not need to be quite so mad. We have done with retail price maintenance. The one great imaginative reduction in price in all the shops in the price of whisky made the public realise that this policy was biting, and then the Government immediately increased the duty so that it cost the public as much as before the abolition of retail price maintenance. What encouragement have other firms and other lines to reduce prices when they can expect the Government to increase the tax? This cannot be a sensible way of running our affairs.<br/>
The most important point I have not heard made is on the question of international sales. I suppose that Members of Parliament go abroad probably as

much as any other section of the population. We go to Mauritius, or to Turkey, or to some other country. What we do first when we get there is to try the local drink. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I am being serious. This is the general thing. Tourists visit a country and say, "What is the local beverage?", and they try it. If they like it, that country then gets an export market here.<br/>
10.0 p.m.<br/>
The sales of French, Italian and Spanish wines have increased enormously during the last 15 years because of the number of British tourists who have gone to those countries, tried their wines, liked them, and on their return to this country bought them here. Five to 6 million people each year visit this country as tourists. On reaching here, they find that what they had always thought was one of our national drinks is so expensive that not only can they not afford to buy it themselves, but none of the English friends they make can afford to buy it for them. Many of them, when they return to their own countries, instead of having gained a liking for Scotch whisky, have never tried it and never experimented. That makes it far more difficult for our salesmen in those countries to increase the sales of Scotch whisky overseas.<br/>
I ask the Financial Secretary to think about the question of duty. There is now a reduction in consumption. I do not believe that the whole of this reduction is accounted for by decreased consumption on the part of nationals. I believe that many tourists who come here now decide, on entering a bar, that whisky is far beyond their reach and they are not even trying it. This means that we lose a potential export market in the countries these tourists come from.<br/>
If the Government keep the duty at its present level, with home consumption beginning to drop, not only will fewer people here drink whisky, which will mean that home turnover will decrease, but many of our nationals who go abroad will not drink whisky. If they do not drink whisky when they go abroad, the demand for it will be reduced in the countries they visit and whisky will be relegated to the backs of bars and hotel shelves. As a result, turnover amongst the nationals in those countries will decrease. Our best export&#x2014;Scotch


whisky&#x2014;then faces a declining market overseas. Of all the things that we export, the one that shows the greatest profit is Scotch whisky. It is an almost entirely home-made product. There is no import to counterbalance its export potential. It is an easily exported item. It does not weigh a great deal. It is easily handled. It brings us an enormous amount of foreign currency, compared with the activity which is involved in its production.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Mr. MacArthur made clear, the Government are making it far more difficult in the long run for us to go on exporting Scotch whisky, because the price in foreign countries is very much governed by the price which obtains here. If the price in this country rises, I notice that the price rises overseas as well, because they alter the duty. If the Government carry on with this policy, the sales will begin to drop and it will become less fashionable to drink Scotch whisky, because the price will be too high.<br/>
I have seen this happen in foreign places. People then begin to talk about something else&#x2014;perhaps vodka. They begin to talk about something else because that then becomes fashionable. Once it gets a grip upon the public, people will be surprised how quickly a big market such as we have will almost disappear. It will disappear far more quickly than the Financial Secretary thinks. because once its price rises beyond that which the vast majority of people can afford to pay, and once they suddenly take a dislike to the price and are no longer willing to pay it, the sales will immediately decrease, and not by 5 per cent. They could begin to drop very rapidly, and, if they once begin to drop in this country, they will begin to drop in all the countries to which we export whisky, not only because English tourists will not be drinking it but because it will have lost that fashionable <i>cachet</i> which, let us face it, is one of the biggest reasons why Scotch whisky is sold all over the world.<br/>
I urge the Government again to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman said that the agreements with the Irish and E.F.T.A. precluded this re-

duction in duty. I suggest to him that he gives due notice and asks for an alteration in the agreements.<br/>
Second, will he explain why this Socialist Government, by their vicious tax on whisky, should put it out of the reach of the ordinary working man in the United Kingdom?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.394.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Earl of Dalkeith" colnum="394" time="">
<p>I am extremely disappointed that the Financial Secretary's Celtic spirit has become so diluted by his over-long association with his own Front Bench that he is forced to give such thoroughly unsatisfactory excuses for rejecting this Amendment.<br/>
If the Government are genuine in their desire to help regional development in places such as Scotland, this Amendment gives them a heaven-sent opportunity to do just that. If they wish to prove themselves, this is the moment when they could do so.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Sir D. Glover) made a most important point about tourists coming to this country and finding the price of whisky as it is now. It occurs to me that, when one goes to Italy, one can apply for special cut-rate petrol coupons. Even if the hon. and learned Gentleman will not accept the Amendment in its entirety, would he, perhaps, consider issuing tourists with coupons for cut-rate whisky&#x2014;and, if I may extend the suggestion a little, perhaps he would have such coupons made available to the local inhabitants as well? If anybody looks as though he really needs a stiff whisky at the moment, it is the hon. and learned Gentleman himself.</p>

<p>I had hoped that the Amendment would receive sympathetic consideration by the Government, and I have been shocked by the Financial Secretary's feebly reply. The most important point which my hon. Friends and I have made is that last year, for the first time for many years, there was a fall in home consumption of Scotch whisky, a fall recorded last year after the period of 12 months following the 1965 Budget increase. The Government must recognise that this is a new and serious situation for the industry.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman rejected the Amendment largely on technical


grounds, one being that the increase in duty is inextricably linked with the increase in other Excise duties and the regulator. When the regulator was brought in the home sales of Scotch whisky were expanding. It was a different situation. It is the new situation which requires the Government to look at the matter in a different light.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman also mentioned the E.F.T.A. and Irish agreements. The time has come for the Government to look at them and make arrangements to enable the Scotch whisky position to be considered separately, so that decisions can be taken in the light</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.396.0" colnum="396" time="">
<p>of the merits of its own case. I hope that the Government will immediately set in train arrangements for doing that.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.396.1" colnum="396" time="">
<p>This is a matter of great concern for Scotland. The product is of high quality coming from Scotland only, and it provides valuable employment in parts of Scotland where manufacturing industry cannot easily settle. I therefore hope that in view of the importance of the matter my right hon. and hon. Friends will join in dividing the Committee upon the Amendment.</p>

<p>I do not want to prolong my remarks on the subject. I want to make the point that, as a result of their persistent policy of increasing duties, the Government are putting a penalty upon the cheaper wines. This is not a policy which can be pursued indefinitely with credit to themselves, or benefit to anyone else.<br/>
The words of this Schedule reduce an otherwise interesting and engaging subject to a fairly prosaic level. What worries me about the Government's attitude to these things is that persistently they take the view that there must be something wrong with anything which affords pleasure. People should have been warned that that was part and parcel of the Socialist creed. Unfortunately, shortness of memory being a more or less constant human failing, it has turned out to be substantially on the side of the Government and people forgot when they made their decisions at the last two elections.<br/>
But here, laid down in language which one immediately associates with the prose which always comes from the Commissioners of Customs and Excise, lacking inspiration but nevertheless firm and de-

pressing in its effect, we have the whole spirit of Socialism condensed into dull words. I am sure that the Financial Secretary's personal tastes do not lead him in these dreary directions.<br/>
Seriously, I wonder whether the Government ought to go on loading these burdens on wines. My hon. Friends from north of the Border have made a very eloquent plea that Scotch whisky should be treated more mercifully. That plea fell on deaf ears and it is unlikely that any plea from this side of the Committee, however eloquent, will receive much better attention when it is made on behalf of wines from foreign sources. Nevertheless, I hope that, some time, the House of Commons will rise in its wrath against the Government, who seem to be permanently against anything which can afford any pleasure or joy to any one. They are in favour of a sort of endless, dull vista of gloomy austerity of their own making, and I find it abominable.<br/>
Not only that, but I think that in the exercise of their discretion they may be wrong, in that there will come a time when the rates upon these things impose such a burden that the consumption goes down and the return through duty diminishes. Looking at the benches opposite the only things of beauty are the empty spaces. [An HON. MEMBER: "There are plenty of those."]<br/>
I do so hope that before it is too late the Government might show some signs of repentence, some signs that they are not determinedly and for ever opposed to anything which will give us pleasure. So often we have heard their eloquent pleas on behalf of those who are not so well off. Can they not see that these added burdens bar for ever those who are not well off from the enjoyment of small quantities of wines or spirits from time to time? I hope that the hon. Gentleman will at least let humanity creep in for a moment.</p>

<p>The speech to which we have just listened by the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) is one of the best arguments that I have heard for a long time for sending the Finance Bill upstairs. The hon. Gentleman did not really direct any arguments to the Schedule against which he was speaking,


other than to say at the outset that he throught that it imposed too heavy a duty on the cheaper wines. But the increases recorded are proportionately the same for all different types of wine, and this is not altering the relative burden of taxation of one kind in relation to another.<br/>
For the rest of his speech, all that he did was to expound the fallacious thinking on this subject of many ignorant people, and I would not have thought that he was one of them, who believe that any article which is the subject of revenue taxation is being visited with some moral judgment by the Exchequer. Quite the contrary. The Exchequer is not concerned with passing moral judgment on the way in which people spend their money. Through indirect tax, one levies a certain amount of revenue on people's expenditure. It is by the choice that people make in their expenditure that they decide which are the things upon which they want to spend their money and, not unnaturally, they become the target of indirect taxation.<br/>
The Revenue does not regret the fact that people spend their money in this way, and therefore enhance the Revenue. I, as a non-smoker, rejoice when I see people smoking. I do not pass any moral judgment on them. The hon. Gentleman is confused in his ideas as to what constitutes Socialism.</p>

<p>I should like to support the remarks in the excellent speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton), which brought forth such an immoderate reply from the Financial Secretary. Every year both sides of the House&#x2014;although not on this occasion I regret to see&#x2014;ask for the duty on imported wine to be reduced. Every year the same arguments are put forward, and every year, with certain wonderful exceptions, of course, when the Conservatives governed the country, the Chancellor has turned a deaf ear to our pleadings. Indeed, only one thing, in my experience, ever seems to move the Chancellor, and that is the law of decreasing returns.<br/>
10.30 p.m.<br/>
With the enormous increase in our population today, revenue from the consumption of wines ought to be increasing. What is actually happening? Let us take

the example of port. In 1966 the import of port wine was only 1&#x00B7;29 million gallons. In 1938&#x2013;39 we were importing nearly three times as much as we are importing today. We have already had examples of how the consumption of whisky is going down, but let us take the example of light wines. That, I think, is pretty stable, but let us take the price of light wine in bottle. The value of the wine in a bottle of white wine retailing at 7s. or 8s. a bottle cannot be more than a few pence, but what is the result of this huge charge put on a bottle of wine? The result is that comparatively few people can afford to drink it. The consumption of all wine imported into Great Britain still amounts to barely three bottles per head per year. Compare that with France, where they consume well over 100 bottles per head per year. Why should the poor people of this country be denied the pleasure of drinking wine?<br/>
I should like to repeat what I said about the deplorable Budget speech of the right hon. Gentleman the Chancellor on 11th April, when I said that we often hear of Chancellors of the Exchequer talking about the law of diminishing returns, but I do not think that I have ever heard a Chancellor of the Exchequer of any party talk about the law of increasing returns.<br/>
I should like to give an example which I gave then regarding indirect taxation in Germany. I am informed that a firm called Henkel Trocken, in Wiesbaden, turned out an excellent sparkling wine on which the tax was three marks a bottle. As a result, 13 million bottles were sold in the market. But then the shrewd German Chancellor of the Exchequer reduced the tax to one mark per bottle and as a result they sold not 13 million but 85 million bottles. In other words, the tax was reduced by two-thirds, and six and a half times as much wine was sold. Not only did the German Treasury get more revenue, but think of all the poor people who were able to enjoy the wine. Here we work on different principles. We have high taxation so that comparatively few people can afford to drink it.<br/>
Therefore, my final plea is that the duty should be reduced on imported wines and spirits. What would be the result? We would give more pleasure to everyone, rich and poor alike&#x2014;and nowadays,


under the present Government, people want to drink as much alcohol as they can to forget their troubles. Secondly, not only would everybody be as happy as people can be under existing conditions, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer would get more revenue.</p>

<p>We must judge the Schedule on two grounds: the rates of tax which it imposes, on which I need not add to what my hon. Friends have said, and its effect on imports and on alternative consumption. Comparing the figures for heavy wines&#x2014;those above 27 degrees of proof spirit&#x2014;at the last Budget and now, we find that as a result of the 10 per cent. regulator and the Chancellor's rounding-off, the duty on foreign imported wines has gone up in the last year by 7&#x00B7;5 per cent. and on heavy wines from the Commonwealth, which the Schedule also covers, it has gone up by 10 per cent., but on home-produced heavy wines the Chancellor has increased it by 16 per cent., by more than twice as much as the duty on foreign wines and by more than half as much again as increase in duty on wines originating in the Commonwealth.<br/>
It is important, therefore, that the Chancellor&#x2014;if I may have his attention for a moment; perhaps the Chief Whip, to whom he is speaking, is wondering how the debate is going. If he listens to the debate, he might find out. I wonder, in passing, whether it is the Financial Secretary's intention to intervene on each item rather than at the end of the debate, which is the more conventional practice.<br/>
I was endeavouring to draw the Chancellor's attention to the way he has written the Schedule compared with Schedule 4. It is now more attractive comparatively than it was after the last Budget to drink foreign, imported heavy wines than heavy wines emanating from the Commonwealth or produced in this country. This is an extraordinarily bizarre way of contributing to our balance of payment problems or to our level of employment at home. I ask the Financial Secretary to comment on why his right hon. Friend has achieved this somewhat bizarre result.</p>

<p>We are discussing, in a sense, four Schedules concerned with

spirits, wine and beer. On Schedule 1, my hon. Friends from north of the Border in particular made what we regarded as an extremely convincing case, on which we registered our view on the Division Lobby. Schedule 2, relating to beer, we let pass without comment. Obviously, the regional argument does not apply. We are discussing Schedule 3, and we are coming to Schedule 4, on British wines.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop), speaking on Schedule 3, has been allowed to refer to the point which he hopes to make presently on Schedule 4. I suggest to my right hon. and hon. Friends that it would be consistent both with our action on Schedule 1 and our lack of action on Schedule 2 to have our vote expressing our views on this matter on Schedule 4, which deals with the rates of duty on British wine, and not on Schedule 3, which is now before us.</p>

<p>With respect, we would agree with that course. I take the point which the hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) has been making.

<p>The Financial Secretary said when he intervened in the debate that he did not think that moral judgment had anything to do with the rate of tax on wines and spirits. I am not blaming him or the Chancellor, because this is something which runs through the thread of British history. There is no doubt that the original reason for the heavy burden on wines and spirits had a great deal to do with moral judgment. It came from the Nonconformist conscience. But we are now living in a freer society, and the Government should realise that they have not the support from the country which they would have had 50 years ago.<br/>
The rate of tax is a severe burden on the enjoyment of ordinary people who, as the world gets smaller, go overseas for their holidays and become more used to drinking these wines. Any Government should begin seriously to look at the problem. It has nothing to do with moral judgment, though it certainly had originally. Wine drinking is becoming


a much more accepted practice among the ordinary people of this country and is no longer the privilege of the wealthy.</p>

<p>I want to draw the attention of the Committee to a major point of substance. In the Chancellor's Budget speech. he said something which, taken in conjunction with Schedule 4, grossly misled the House and, had it not been for that statement, I should certainly have divided the House on one of the Budget Resolutions.<br/>
In the course of his Budget speech, the right hon. Gentleman referred to the economic regulator, and said:
<q>I therefore propose broadly to consolidate the surcharges at the existing rates with effect from tonight and, at the same time, to bring the current surcharges themselves to an end.</q>
Here are the important words:
<q>The final result will be roughly the same, and there is nothing in the changes that I am making which would justify any increase in the price level."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th April, 1967; Vol. 744, c. 1003.]</q>
That is quite specific, I think. What the Chancellor has done is to slap on a tax increase of 1s. 0&#x00BD;d. per gallon on home-produced heavy wine, which represents more than 2d. a bottle, contrary to the statement which he made in his Budget speech.<br/>
I know of one firm producing heavy British wines and, for that firm, this represents over &#x00A3;100,000 a year. It cannot possibly carry that extra load. If it puts up its price by 2d. a bottle, when the Chancellor has told the country that he has done nothing to the duties which would justify a price increase, naturally the public will think that the firm concerned is breaking the price freeze and profiteering.<br/>
It is grossly wrong for the Chancellor to put an individual firm in that position. In addition, it must be remembered that hon. Members never have time to study the figures in the Budget Resolutions before they are put to the Committee. It means that hon. Members have been mis-

led into thinking that, inside that mass of figures, there is no significant increase, when the Chancellor has made an increase quite deliberately. Not only has he made a significant increase, he has picked out the British producers for the largest single increase of any of the ones in the Third and Fourth Schedules.<br/>
The Chancellor owes the Committee an explanation why he misled the House so grossly, and he owes the House the opportunity of honouring the words which he used in column 1003 by agreeing to the withdrawal of the Fourth Schedule and then coming back to the House at a later stage with a new Schedule adjusted to make it compatible with the undertaking which he gave. This is the only respectable thing that he can do, and if he does not do it he has no right to expect either the courtesy or the co-operation of this Committee.</p>

<p>I want to remind the Committee of some immortal words which the Chancellor of the Exchequer spoke in June, 1964, when he said:
<q>That really began from 1961 and the pay pause and although I know that the Government are acting purely in the knowledge that there is nobody left who wants to drink their health, they are now making it more expensive for us to drown our sorrows."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd June. 1964; Vol. 695, c. 945.]</q>
I think that nothing could be more satisfactory from our point of view than to hand those words back to the Chancellor tonight on a plate and say that we only wish they were worth a drink to him, but they really are not. It shows how dangerous it is for Ministers who believe and think as the right hon. Gentleman does to get up and say the sort of things he did then.<br/>
I am sorry that the Chancellor now finds himself in a position in which he cannot give way at all, either to the pleas of those who, like my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Knutsford (Sir W. Bromley-Davenport) have spoken on behalf of imported wines, or my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) who has spoken on behalf of British wines and rightly pointed out the vicious swipe which the Chancellor and his colleagues are taking at British beverages.<br/>
It really is sad to think that we can extract nothing from the Government, and that no assurances they can ever give will carry any weight until we have some indication from the Front Bench opposite that they will engage in policies which will make a reduction in taxation profitable and welcome to themselves. We are coming increasingly to regard their opposition to tax reductions as stemming from two things: first, their obstinate adherence to policies which cannot work because they are too expensive, and secondly from a dreary, dull conviction that all enjoyment is wrong, a conviction with which we had to live in the almost endless twilight of war, and which arose from the close companionship which they mentally keep with austerity and dullness.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) quoted a passage from the Chancellor's Budget speech and suggested that my right hon. Gentleman had misled the House and the trade in what he said. I hope to satisfy the Committee that that is not the case, and to explain the reason for the distinction which there is between the steps taken in this Consolidation Measure in the Fourth Schedule in relation to British wines, and those in the Third Schedule which we have just been discussing.<br/>
Shortly after the passage which the hon. Gentleman quoted my right hon. Friend said:
<q>As regards alcoholic drink, I propose to incorporate the surcharge into the substantive rates of duty with the least possible alteration, taking account of international commitments."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th April, 1967; Vol. 744, c. 1003.]</q>
There are a number of international obligations affecting the duties on wines and British wines which were disturbed by the imposition of the 10 per cent. surcharge last July. The revised rates which are contained in these two Schedules are designed to restore the differential between the full, Commonwealth and British rates without causing any substantial loss in the total amount of revenue. That is in accordance with the policy stated by the Chancellor in the passage which the hon. Member quoted.<br/>
This has been effected by rounding the surcharge-inclusive Commonwealth rate to the nearest 3d. and applying the

differential margins to determine the other rates. This results in a reduction in the surcharge-inclusive full rates and an increase in the British wine rates. The new rates involve increases amounting to 1s. 0&#x00B7;6d. per gallon on heavy wine. The reason is the combination of the need to comply with these international commitments and the need to avoid a substantial loss of revenue.<br/>
Some representations have been received, including one, I believe, from the company to which the hon. Member was referring, saying that the effect would be a consequential increase in cost of 2d. a bottle for certain of its wines. In reply the Chancellor reiterated that he saw no reason for any overall increase in the price of wines as a result of these measures in the regulator, and that if the company feels that it can and wishes to make out a case for a specific increase during the period of severe restraint that is a matter for it to take up with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.<br/>
But these measures do, as I hope the Committee will now accept, follow the statements of policy made by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in his Budget speech. The increase in the duty on British wines is an unfortunate and unavoidable consequence of the consolidation measure.</p>

<p>If what the Financial Secretary says was accurate there might be some merit in it, but it has not even the merit of accuracy. He says that we wanted to restore the ratios to what they were before the 10 per cent. regulator was put on.</p>

<p>To restore the differential, certainly. If we take the basic rate of 17s. for home-produced wines before the regulator was put on as 100, the index for wines of Commonwealth origin would be 156 and the index for foreign would be 214. If we take the rates in Schedules 3 and 4 on British heavy wines as 100, the rate for Commonwealth wines has been reduced from 156 to 148 and the rate for foreign from 214 to 199. That is not restoring the differential.</p>

<p>It is the difference between the ratio and the differential.


The hon. Member is still thinking and speaking in terms of ratios, but the differential which exists by agreement with Australia is that the difference between the Commonwealth and British rates may not exceed 9s. 6d. a gallon. It is a flat sum, and it is in order to restore that differential that the difficulty arises.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.409.0" hansard_membership_id="9052" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18079" speakername="Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop" colnum="409" time="">
<p>If so the Financial Secretary needs to explain why it was possible to distort the differential by the use of the regulator and not possible to maintain the distortion subsequently. The Committee is entitled to an explanation why it is right to do it in July and wrong to do it in April.<br/>
Secondly, the Financial Secretary has not yet fought his way out of the definite commitment given by the Chancellor:
<q>The final result will be roughly the same, and there is nothing in the changes that I am making which would justify any increase in the price level,"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th April, 1967; Vol. 744, c. 1033.]</q>
unless he is putting forward the proposition that an increase in Excise duty does not justify an increase in price to the consumer. If he is putting that argument forward it is an entirely novel doctrine, which has not been put forward in the Committee before. When petrol duty, cigarette duty and beer and whisky duty go up under the regulator, that justifies an increase in price. Thus, when the right hon. Gentleman puts 1s. &#x00BD;d. a gallon on home-produced heavy wines, he wants us to believe that they are in some strange category in which, for imperceptible reasons, no increase is justified. He may make such a bizarre case if he wishes, but he should not ask the Committee to take it on trust&#x2014;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.409.1" hansard_membership_id="8529" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17661" speakername="Mr. MacDermot" colnum="409" time="">
<p>The hon. Gentleman still does not understand. In the passage he quoted, my right hon. Friend was referring not just to the surcharge on alcoholic drinks but to the whole range of surcharges and he was saying that the consolidation measures would bring the total revenue to the same position as it was before consolidation, and that, therefore, these measures would not justify an increase in the price level, which is, of course, an average of many different prices&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>]&#x2014;of course it is. He said later that there was a particular difficulty in relation to alcoholic drinks.<br/>
I do not want to say anything which might be thought to prejudge the matter,

but I have explained that if, because of this measure&#x2014;I have explained why it had to be taken in relation to British wines&#x2014;a company felt that an increase in the price of some of its products was justified, it should take that matter up with the Minister of Agriculture. But this would be no justification for an overall increase in prices, which would affect the price level.<br/>
On the hon. Gentleman's first point, whereas other countries, in a temporary matter like the introduction of the Regulator, will accept a slight and temporary breach of the agreement, when we are consolidating them into a permanent measure, of course they will not.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.410.0" hansard_membership_id="9052" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18079" speakername="Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop" colnum="410" time="">
<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman, therefore, is stating an obvious proposition, that an increase in tax on one item does not justify an increase in the price of another. I concur utterly, although I should not have thought that it needed saying. His other proposition was that the statement that there is nothing in the changes meant that there is something in them. This also is a somewhat unusual construction. And the phrase about justifying any increase in the price level means, he told us, that one may increase prices but that this does not mean that one has increased the price level. This is a naive interpretation.<br/>
I do not see the point of making this general proposition if all it meant was that, when duties have been put up, we expect prices to go up and <i>vice versa,</i> and that, as the overall sum is neither plus nor minus, the overall effect will be neither. But hon. Members who heard the Budget speech certainly did not think that the right hon. Gentleman intended to put 1s. 0&#x00BD;d. a gallon on British heavy wines; nor did the public take that statement to mean that duty would be increased substantially.<br/>
None of us realised this until we heard from the manufacturers who had listened to the Budget on the radio that the Commissioners of Customs and Excise had notified them that 1s. 0&#x00BD;d. was to go on at midnight. Although his junior Minister tried to talk his way out of it, it is because the Chancellor presented this increase in such a way that it was concealed from the Committee that anyone


who values accurate presentation, if nothing else, would do well to vote against Schedule 4.</p>

<p>The purpose of Clause 3 is to permit disclosures of goods imported to this country for the benefit of the D.E.A., amongst others, which can thereby find out that certain goods are imported and so come to certain decisions in that respect. The purpose of the Amendment is to achieve a consistency which is at present not in the Clause.<br/>
Subsection (3) states:
<q>The Secretary of State may by order add to the descriptions of information to which this section applies any further description of information contained in any document &#x2026; other than the price of the goods &#x2026;</q>
In fact, what can happen already is that this information can be deduced from the information given under the Clause in conjunction with that given in the Overseas Trade Accounts of the United

Kingdom or other sorts of official returns. This can be very important in a number of cases. The Amendment seeks to give the Commissioners the right to withhold this information which subsection (3) says should be withheld.<br/>
If one looks at the Overseas Trade Accounts in conjunction with Clause 3 we are able to deduce information about goods, including a detailed description, quantities, name of the maker, country of origin and&#x2014;this I find difficult to understand and it is the reason for Amendment No. 13&#x2014;the country from where the goods are consigned. This Clause together with official returns might disclose the price. From last January's Overseas Trade Accounts I give an example of how this might be done. Under division 71 machinery other than electrical, metal working machinery, we see that physico-chemical machines imported in January, 1967, were imported at a cost of &#x00A3;12,000 and the total number was six. It does not need much deduction to come to the view that the machines were &#x00A3;2,000 each. This information is at present available, but very few categories are quoted by number. Most are quoted by tonnage and this sort of information is not then available.<br/>
By passing Clause 3 unamended we shall be providing precisely that kind of information and anyone who has the returns will be able to deduce exactly the cost in those cases where the quantity is small; he can accurately judge the value of each machine imported. I am not against this disclosure. I think that


Governments and civil servants have been far too secretive and their atmosphere of secrecy has perhaps spread to the private sector, but the way to overcome the secrecy is not through permitting an oversight in legislation. To make the Clause consistent we put forward this Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.415.0" hansard_membership_id="7796" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30606" speakername="The Joint Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (Mr. Harold Lever)" colnum="415" time="">
<p>I am sure that we welcome the constructive approach of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) in moving this Amendment. He and I have often moved Amendments together from the position he now occupies and as everyone, particularly the Chancellor, is aware, we always did so in a most constructive spirit. Therefore without any surprise I note the moderate way in which he put the Amendment and argued in its favour.<br/>
I am glad that he welcomes the Government action, taken at the request of the E.D.C.'s for the machine tool and the mechanical and electrical engineering industries to give some information to our own manufacturers and some means of assessing the demand which they should try to meet which at present is met by imports. My hon. Friend is in favour of that, but he feels that we should not give information of such a detailed kind as to give the actual cost and price of imports in appropriate cases. The Government have no intention of breaching in any way the confidentiality of import documents on which they will rely, and upon which alone they will rely, for this information to be provided.<br/>
11.15 p.m.<br/>
Secondly, there will be not merely the protection incorporated in the Clause, which strips away anything which is confidential in the individual documents so that in the aggregate nothing confidential is disclosed. But in addition, the Government, who will not automatically operate the power to give this information, will vet every category of information before operating the power and ensure that there will be full and adequate consultation with all the relevant trade and industrial representative bodies before they authorise release of any category of information. That will be a check in addition to the careful stripping

of confidential matter from what is publishable under the Clause.<br/>
To be quite sure that even in such odd cases as that which my hon. Friend cited nothing unfair or unwise will result, we have made this not mandatory but subject to individual examination by the Government, and in every case there will be consultation with the relevant trade bodies. In the kind of case my hon. Friend mentioned of an import of six articles amounting to &#x00A3;12,000, there is no question that the Government would authorise the provision of this information in any event. What we are trying to do is to communicate to our own manufacturers where there is a very substantial and repetitive demand which they should be trying to meet. We are not interested in picking up bits like &#x00A3;12,000 and six articles. Whether my hon. Friend thinks the inference could be accurately drawn or not is open to argument.<br/>
The first great protection is that the release is not automatic. The second is that the trade bodies will be consulted in every category of information before any is released. The third is that the Government are instituting very careful machinery for vetting each of these categories before any information is released. That machinery will be very thorough and my hon. Friend can rest assured that in no circumstances will information be given which would amount to the kind of damaging, trivial breach of confidence implied in the kind of figures he cited.<br/>
Finally, I emphasise that the Government has a vested interest in maintaining the trust that industry has in the confidentiality of all matters communicated to the Government. This would be seriously damaged if the Government were to authorise any information to be given that was a breach of the confidence entrusted to it.<br/>
In all these circumstances, I -think that my hon. Friend's fears are hypothetical, and he need not be so anxious as to be disabled from withdrawing the Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.416.0" hansard_membership_id="3750" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21296" speakername="Mrs. Margaret Thatcher" colnum="416" time="">
<p>I wish to say a few brief words on the Amendment, but to reserve one or two comments for the debate on the Question, "That the Clause stand part of the Bill".<br/>
May I also say how delighted I am to see the hon. Member for Manchester, Cheetham (Mr. Harold Lever) on the Government Front Bench? I imagine that the rest of the Front Bench is very relieved that he is there and not on the back benches. I hope that he is urging the same sort of advice behind the scenes as he would be urging if he were still on the back benches.<br/>
The Minister has sought to say that the Clause offers great protection, particularly with reference to the Amendment. In fact, the Clause does not offer great protection. It is drafted very widely and I believe that that is the reason for the Amendment. I have no doubt that the Minister would operate it strictly in accordance with the assurances he has given. But that is no guarantee that anyone else would operate it in that way.<br/>
I have particularly in mind the case of a company importing goods to test the market before setting up in manufacturing itself. It might import goods to test the market and make considerable inroads into that market. But a company would probably be readily identifiable and the information as to its importing, the catalogue number and the deduction that it was going to set off into manufacturing would be useful to any competitor.<br/>
It is not enough in such a case to say that the Government would consult the industry. Some of this information would be unfair to any particular firm. Many companies in an industry would like to have more information about other firms in that industry. I think that the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) would be well advised to press the Amendment, if not now then on Report, on the Government, so that the Clause may offer greater protection than it does.</p>

<p>It is nice to see my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Cheetham (Mr. Harold Lever) on the Front Bench, although it was pleasant to have him back here with us. I hoped that he would accept the Amendments in the same constructive spirit that he suggested that we withdraw them because, if the assurances he gave are valid, they would surely be equally valid and appropriate for him to accept the Amendments. He has not really presented any arguments for not accepting

them. All he has said&#x2014;although, of course, we accept it&#x2014;is that they will be dealt with.</p>

<p>Although I think that this matter can be examined further, possibly on the Report stage, as a token of my friendship for my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, my former colleague on these benches, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</p>

<p>I would not like it to be thought that there was universal acclamation for Clause 3. I have grave doubts about the virtue of this kind of Clause because I suspect that it results from the activities of the economic development committees. That does not of itself render the Clause necessarily unacceptable but it puts into my mind some suspicions.<br/>
These arise from a belief that we are obsessed with the supposed problem of import substitution. In fact, we should be much more concerned with the competitive environment in which British industry should operate, and far from encouraging people like the Machine Tool Trades Association to try and get the Government to hand things to them on a plate about the kind of competition they are meeting, we should be hoping that the Machine Tool manufacturers should themselves be aware of the kind of competition they are facing.<br/>
There is no doubt that the Clause arises in part as a result of representations by a number of economic development committees. The Economic Development Committee of the machine tool industry was foremost amongst those pressing for this kind of legislation. I have here the progress report for the first two years, 1964&#x2013;66, published by the Committee. It says:
<q>The study of imports generally is considerably hampered by the lack of detail in the published import statistics, which at present show only the broadest categories. The E.D.C. has confirmed that details required can be obtained from existing information in the Government's hands, and has made strong representations to the Government for it to be made available to the machine tool manufacturers so that an effective attack on imports may be mounted.</q>


The hon. Member for Manchester, Cheetham (Mr. Harold Lever) has just been talking about consultations with the relevant trade bodies. What is the relevant trade body if we are dealing with machine tool imports? Is it the British machine tool manufacturers, or the machine tool importers? In many instances, the companies are one and the same. However, I took the precaution of discussing this Clause with a machine tool importer this morning and he was very eloquent on the disadvantages which he thought would flow from the Clause. I share his scepticism about the extent to which this provision will encourage a protectionist attitude among industrialists in this country.<br/>
We have some signs of the extent to which the incipient protectionism which exists in this country, an attitude which is encouraged by bodies such as the economic development committees, is causing concern among our trading partners in that in February a good deal of concern was expressed by the Swiss machine tool manufacturers' association.<br/>
<i>The Times</i> of 15th February said that the Swiss machine tool manufacturers' association had issued a statement saying that official policy in Britain was against the letter and the spirit of the E.F.T.A. treaty. The burden of their argument was that the Government had urged British users of machine tools to buy British. The statement referred to the 1965 "Little Neddy" programme which, it contended, could be interpreted as an invitation to British manufacturers to copy foreign machines and thus reduce imports.<br/>
It is particularly undesirable that this country, the Government and British industry should be exposed to charges of that sort, but I have a sneaking sympathy with that kind of charge against the average British machine tool maker who on the whole knows all his customers or potential customers and who is not dealing with a vast market which he cannot conceivably encompass with his own sales organisation&#x2014;if he has a sales organisation worthy of the name.<br/>
At one stage I worked for a body called the Economist Intelligence Unit and I remember talking to the managing director of a very large machine tool company in this country who laughed at the thought

of someone like the E.I.U. doing a market survey for him. He said, "We know the market", and I am sure that he was right. It was a company with an extremely good reputation in the machine tool industry, not a company to be held up to ridicule. It happened to be Alfred Herbert.<br/>
My concern is that once we start having this kind of disclosure we encourage the worst element in British management, which is to ask, "If we are subject to competition from imports, what will the Government do to help us?" It is not as though this information is not within the scope and ability of any competitive manufacturer to find out for himself and if we believe that we increase the competitive efficiency of British manufacturers by trying to pass this kind of information to them via the Customs and Excise, we underestimate the kind of environment in which we are operating.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is better that I should intervene on my feet than interrupt the hon. Member for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen), who has just spoken about the machine tool industry. His argument may be valid in a general sort of way with a smaller circumference industry like the machine tool industry where individual units are identifiable within the trade, but it does not apply generally to every industry in this country. I have never appeared as any sort of crude protectionist, but I hope that it will be recognised that the machine tool industry is a very different kettle of fish from the textile industry, of which I have some local knowledge as a Lancashire Member of Parliament.<br/>
I have noticed recently that leading members of the Conservative Party, impressed by the cases that we have occasionally put up on behalf of the industry, are beginning to make very friendly noises towards the Lancashire textile industry, which has never asked for any kind of protection, but which has asked, and this is the proper occasion to raise the matter, not for less disclosure, but for more.<br/>
11.30 p.m.<br/>
This is an industry which has been more than two-thirds destroyed within the last decade by the unrequited imports coming into the country, willy-nilly, under our present system of import controls. I am entitled to remind the Committee


that the textile industry has, through its official bodies, asked for more disclosure because of the very grave practices which are going on, and which do not represent fair international trade, as some of us understand it.<br/>
While I disown any charge of being a protectionist in the narrow sense, I also disown any charge of being a crude <i>laissez-faire</i> man, who wants to let the free play of the market settle everything, because that leads to all kinds of happenings that Members on both sides of the Committee know perfectly well every civilised state in the world, except ours, takes very stern measures to deal with.<br/>
I would advise my hon. Friend the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, who has appeared in this new r&#x00F4;le for the first time&#x2014;the poacher turned gamekeeper&#x2014;and who is sitting there looking very pleased with himself, to bear in mind, as a Lancashire Member, that there is a case for Lancashire that does not equate with the sort of consideration that has been put to us in support of this Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1967-06-01a.421.0" hansard_membership_id="7796" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30606" speakername="Mr. Harold Lever" colnum="421" time="">
<p>It is apparent from what my hon. Friend the Member for Westhoughton (Mr. J. T. Price) says, that anxiety often disguises itself in the most remarkable ways. He implies that I have the appearance of being exceedingly pleased with myself. I welcome the very kind comments which have been made upon the responsibility which has been cast upon me. I think that the hon. Lady the Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) was a little mistaken in thinking that my colleagues on the Front Bench are relieved by my presence. Their full attendance is, I think, to be attributed to anxiety rather than relief.<br/>
The hon Member for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen) carries his normally attractive support for the principle of self-help beyond the bounds of what is reasonable on this occasion. When he says that the average machine tool manufacturer ought not to be helped in this way, ought not to be handed this information on a plate, he is really caricaturing his own position as an ardent admirer of virile businessmen.<br/>
I do not really think that he would, on reflection, believe that machine tool manufacturers should institute a national survey in order to find out what kind of

machines are selling well, so that they might get a full appreciation of the market that is being supplied by imports, and compete accordingly. There is nothing shameful, either in seeking to find what are the best selling items that are sucking in imports to the country, which could well be met by existing capital equipment and existing U.K. manufacturers. It is an entirely competitive, non-protectionist situation which we are seeking to encourage. We are not giving them a price advantage, or a tariff advantage.<br/>
What we are doing is to assist them, with reasonable information, stripped of all its confidential aspects, of the kinds of machinery and goods which are coming into the country. We are saying to them: "This is what is coming in; can you match it competitively by your energy?" The hon. Member said that they know their own customers. Of course they do. What we are trying to do is to tell them what people who are not their customers are buying from abroad and what they might well supply from their own capital equipment, "know-how," intelligence and work force.<br/>
I welcome the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Westhoughton (Mr. J. T. Price), although some of them were not directly related to the powers which we are seeking. I assure the Committee that the undertakings which have been given against breaches of confidentiality will be effectively honoured. The Clause has been drafted with the intention that all the figures which would be given, even if there were no supervision from the Government's point of view, would not in any event result in a breach of confidentiality, because they would be aggregates and not individual figures, and the aggregates would be stripped of the name of the importer and the prices of individual items of goods. Consequently, even if the Government exercised no further supervision they would involve nothing which was confidential.<br/>
To give a simple example, if it were desired to know how many Renault 1&#x00B7;5 litre cars were being imported into this country in a quarter, this could be announced and the figures given. There is nothing confidential in that information, which is given in every country in the world about manufactured imports. It is


right that we should have that information, but to make sure that in no instance will anything which is confidential be disclosed, the Government will not automatically disclose the information and will maintain consultations with the relevant trade representative bodies.<br/>
I was asked which bodies they would be in respect of machine tools. Clearly, they would be the machine tool importers, not solely those who have an interest in finding out this information. Before we would authorise this information we would consult the kind of people who might be affected if there were any breach of confidentiality. The Committee's fears ought to be laid at rest, therefore, and I hope that the Committee will accept the Clause.</p>

<p>I should like a little more information about the Clause, which is rather wide. I am, in part, asking for information and in part making comment, and I hope that the Minister will correct me if I say anything which is incorrect.<br/>
The normal position is that the information in these documents is given for one purpose only&#x2014;to ensure that the right amount of tax, imposed by Statute, is collected on that class of goods. Information given for that purpose is normally absolutely confidential and is not disclosed for any other purpose. Between that information and the ordinary statistical information in the trade return there is a wide gap. The hon. Member is seeking to bridge that gap in this Clause, which I think is a far-reaching Clause, and I want him to define more closely than he has defined so far what are the objectives which he hopes to achieve, as they are not at all clear.<br/>
If we are to breach confidentiality, there must be a good reason for doing so and we should know what we are hoping to achieve. I understand that "Neddy" thinks that if every manufacturer in this country knew what was being imported he could create, or would be more likely to create, a competitive substitute for that import. Going through the trade and navigation returns, I earnestly hope that every country in the world will not go in for import substitution because that would have a very damging effect on much of our export trade.<br/>
I know the chemical industry very well, and I know that we could go through the list and cut out export after export if other countries adopted the policy which I think is inherent in the Clause. If that is not the purpose of the Clause, then I do not know what is its purpose.<br/>
The implication is that if a manufacturer knows what is being exported and where it is being exported from he is more likely to produce a competitive substitute. That is not necessarily the case. Hon. Members will see that if they go through the list of basic chemicals. Sodium chlorate is one example and potassium carbonate is another. Everyone knows that they are produced in this country, but they are, nevertheless, also purchased from other countries for very good reasons. They are sometimes purchased and converted into other chemicals which are exported.<br/>
Cut glass is another example. Many women buy Czechoslovakian cut glass. It is well known that we produce excellent cut glass in this country, but the knowledge that it is produced both in Czechoslovakia and here does not cut down the amount of imports. Indeed, the increase in world trade has come from an increase in trade between importers of manufactures, and I think the N.E.D.C. Report was operating on an outmoded view of trade. I think we should go for an increase of manufactured imports and exports between countries.<br/>
Now I ask the hon. Gentleman, therefore, what is the purpose of this Clause? Is he saying that he is giving more knowledge to manufacturers on the basis that if they have that knowledge they will produce similar goods? If he is not, why does he so particularly want this Clause? I do not accept his assumption at all, and I do not think it is borne out by the facts.<br/>
We may wish to return on Report to subsection (3), because I think it is most important that the hon. Gentleman and the Secretary of State should not have powers of the kind taken in subsection (3) which, again, are extremely wide. The subsection enables more information to be given to anyone; not just N.E.D.C.; give it to N.E.D.C. and it can be given to anyone. For example, I know a good many manufacturers in the chemical industry who


would be delighted to have more information about the quantities and countries of origin; then they would trot along to the Board of Trade with a flimsy application for anti-dumping duty. I shall be very interested to see if the number of applications for anti-dumping duty goes up.<br/>
I am very suspicious of this Clause. I hope the hon. Gentleman will give us more information about its purpose. Also, will he give us a strict account now of the precise powers which exist to give information and what is the source of those powers? If not, we shall wish to return to this on Report.</p>

<p>I am encouraged to make a few more brief comments by the answer from the Government and particularly by the remarks by my hon. Friend the Member for Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher), remarks which I fully endorse. If we are asked to pass a Clause which will give greater disclosure to the Government we must know the purpose to which this policy is directed. One does not need to be congenitally suspicious to have some considerable reservations about extending the area of Government intervention and Government knowledge. We are here as protectors of our constituents against this kind of activity, and the philosophy which prompts us is specially prompted by this kind of Clause and the coalition between departments like the Department of Economic Affairs and trade associations, an unhappy coalition if ever there was one.<br/>
Let us suppose that the purpose of the Clause is to encourage import substitution, to encourage British machine tool manufacturers, British chemical plant manufacturers, or even British textile manufacturers, to make the kind of products which are now being imported. Will the vital information of price also be revealed to those companies who wish to compete against the interests of their fellow citizens who act as importers? Because if this vital factor of price is not also to be included, will they not be back in the same difficulties in which they now find themselves, where they do not know about this factor?<br/>
It is still, in my opinion, the legitimate function of the machine tool manufacturer to get out and know his market, and not have this kind of information passed to him.<br/>
If this information is passed to him and still excludes the vital factor of price, of how much more value is it?<br/>
11.45 p.m.<br/>
If, however, the vital factor of price is also to be included, I suspect that we may find that in the Clause we are stumbling across far greater degrees of disclosure than we ever imagined. All the pressures from now onwards, particularly from the trade associations which proliferate around the new Government Departments&#x2014;which have given many of them cause for existing, whereas often in the past they found it damned difficult to justify the subscriptions for which they called from their members&#x2014;will be to know more and more, including descriptions and designations, and to try to fill out our statistical knowledge, so that we will no longer be conducting the economy with the crude and imperfect weapons of the past.<br/>
I feel deeply suspicious about this development. Nothing which has been said so far disarms those suspicions other than the charm and urbanity of the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, but even that cannot cover up what, I suspect, is a thoroughly bad case.</p>

<p>I would not wish to intervene at this late hour, but I am concerned about one aspect of this disclosure. As I have said, I am in favour of much greater disclosure, but I am doubtful why this disclosure is being required. There are far better methods for manufacturers to get the information which they require rather than the statistical returns which come a few months later when they should have the information. What should matter to a machine tool or any other manufacturer is information of what is going on now and what customers will do in the future and not about what happened a few months ago.<br/>
I am also worried about the whole question of import saving. This may well turn into a discussion to see what competitors are doing and trying to copy them. That is not the r&#x00F4;le of a country like ours. It is a r&#x00F4;le of underdeveloped countries or countries which want to imitate. That imitative r&#x00F4;le is suitable for a country which is starting to industrialise, for a country like Japan in


the 1920s, and it is what is happening in certain African countries today. It is hardly a r&#x00F4;le for us. Our r&#x00F4;le is that of innovation. I am disturbed at this concentration on what other people are doing and why they are buying rather than on what we ourselves should be doing.</p>

<p>First, let me say with unmistakable clarity that the purpose of the Clause is to allow the Government to provide information to our manufacturers of the size and nature of certain manufactured imports, with the intent that those manufacturers, being apprised of the larger-scale imports of manufactures, shall be alerted with precision to the nature of demand which exists at home which they might well satisfy in many cases by their own efforts and their own production.<br/>
It is not, of course, the Government's intention to pursue this in detailed minute quantities, but where there is a major scale of imported goods which manufacturers believe that they can replace by home production, or where they can make a contribution to replacing by home production, it is well that they should have at their disposal the kind of information concerning the nature of imports that is available in most other countries and which alerts and apprises domestic manufacturers of the areas where the market for their own products might be extended.<br/>
There is nothing shameful or backward in this. There is nothing here in terms of talking of copying and imitating backward nations. Many hon. Members would be well advised not to adopt patronising expressions about the industrial production and habits of countries like Japan. There is much that we might learn from other countries.</p>

<p>This is not a matter of reducing the total imports of this country.

It is a matter of alerting our own manufacturers to possible markets which are being satisfied, in some cases unnecessarily, by imports of foreign manufactures which we would seek to replace, so far as reasonably and competitively can be achieved, by our own manufactures.<br/>
There is no mollycoddling of British manufacturers. There is no question of giving them an improper preference. They will have to fight for their markets. We are arming them in the fight with information which is available in almost every other country in the world. It is information which will enable the British manufacturer to conduct his battle for the domestic market with the best possible knowledge of what is being imported into the country. That is not improper, undesirable or protectionist, and I cannot see why the hon. Members for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen) and Finchley (Mrs. Thatcher) are so anxious that British manufacturers should be deprived of the information.<br/>
Information will be given to them, and nothing else. It is quite ill-advised to suggest that the response of British manufacturing industry to full statistical information of this kind will be to run bleating and moaning to the Board of Trade for further protection. That is an unfair inference, and I am sad to find the Opposition Front Bench so ready to imply that there will be such an unsatisfactory reaction from British industry if we provide them with more information of this kind.<br/>
At any rate, British manufacturers can be satisfied that, whatever lack of confidence some hon. Members opposite have about their reaction to getting fuller information on what is selling in the way of imports, this Government are confident that the provision of this information will add to the efforts and zeal of British manufacturing industry to play a full part in competing for its own domestic market. I do not know why the British should think that there is something shameful or hangdog in encouraging their manufacturers to supply their own domestic market with manufactured goods in competitive conditions.<br/>
We have heard a number of conflicting criticisms. The hon. Member for Oswestry thinks that we go too far, and then implies that the information which


we produce will be of no use because we do not intend to breach confidentiality by giving prices of goods or names of importers to British manufacturers. The point is that they must find these facts out for themselves in the ordinary course of commerce, but there is no reason why this perfectly proper information should not be available to them for the purpose of encouraging them to make their maximum effort to supply the domestic market in manufactured goods from their own manufacturing capacity.<br/>
It is a perfectly legitimate objective. It is not in conflict with our international obligations or with our pride. It is very much in the interests of the economy of the country that our manufacturers should be successful, and that we give them all proper and reasonable aid, purely by way of information, to support those efforts.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the Chairman do report Progress and ask leave to sit again.</q>
It is nearly midnight, and we have had a long day. The House expressed itself quite clearly about our arrangements, agreeing that the Finance Bill should be regarded as falling within the compass of an ordinary day's business. We have gone well over the top of that. I confess that I had hoped that we should have made more progress, but there it is. It is a Thursday night, and, therefore, I hope that the Committee will accept this Motion.</p>

<p>This is a rather unusual state of affairs. Normally these Motions are moved by agreement. I make it quite clear that there is no agreement of any sort here. Naturally I do not advise the Committee to reject the Motion. If the Chancellor wished to report Progress at 3.45 in the afternoon I would accept a Motion to that effect, but the right hon. Gentleman's notion of progress seems very odd.<br/>
I make no secret of the fact that no more Divisions are likely to be called from this side of the Committee. A number of drafting Amendments&#x2014;little more than that&#x2014;lie ahead of us, and we could have made progress and reached, as we all try to do on these occasions, a real

natural break, which, of course, might have been the big debates on Income Tax and Surtax which lie ahead.<br/>
The Chancellor may say that if these are trifling points&#x2014;perhaps not trifling points, but drafting ones&#x2014;they can be taken quickly next week. I should have thought that he had too much experience of the House to suggest that that is possible. Next week, when my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Knutsford (Sir W. Bromley-Davenport) comes back refreshed after a weekend's sleep, and my hon. Friends return from Yeovil and South Worcestershire, these points, which could easily be dealt with at this time of night, could take very much longer to deal with.<br/>
However, if the right hon. Gentleman wishes us to adjust to this pace, who am I to object to it? We note that he thinks a day's work is three Clauses of the Finance Bill. There are 47 Clauses in the Bill, and if the Chancellor thinks it appropriate we can occupy a suitable amount of time, but I seriously suggest that this is a mistake. This is a very unusual way of doing things, because it is normally the Opposition who want to go home and the Government who feel that we should push forward a little. I think that in order to save three-quarters of an hour tonight he will lose a day on the Bill.<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman wants to handle the Finance Bill in that way, who am I to stop him? I think, however, that he is making a very serious mistake in treating the Committee in this way and treating the Opposition in this way at the end of the first day. I do not suggest that we should carry on this debate. We can accept the Motion and go home, but I regard this as a sad start to the Committee stage of the Finance Bill.</p>

<p>I do not regard three Clauses as a satisfactory day's work. What I am taking into account is what the House itself thinks to be a satisfactory day's work. The House believes, and has so expressed itself in a Motion, that sitting from 3.30 to 10 or 11 at night is a satisfactory day's work. We have sat until midnight, and in the light of that direct expression of the House I think that we have done a satisfactory day's work. It is not the number of Clauses which has been covered.<br/>
We are going to be in some difficulty about this. I do not want to break any confidences, but there is no agreement between the right hon. Gentleman and myself about the conduct of the Finance Bill. There is a Motion which has been passed by the House which might lead one to think I should have endeavoured to obtain it, but I have not done so. I have understood that the Opposition and ourselves will operate, without agreement, within the general basis of the Motion passed by the House, namely, that we should expect to finish somewhere between 10 o'clock and midnight every night. That is what I had understood was the Opposition's view, and I am operating completely within that agreement.<br/>
It is now two minutes to midnight. If the right hon. Gentleman really believes that these Amendments, which have yet to be moved&#x2014;and there are four or five of them&#x2014;can all be covered within a quarter of an hour&#x2014;</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour from now would go well beyond what I understood to be the general agreement of the House, namely, that the House did not want to finish at a quarter to one but wanted the Finance Bill to be regarded as an ordinary Measure. I am trying to operate within the wish of the majority of the House, and I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman should reconsider his position in the matter.<br/>
There is no doubt that we can make very rapid progress on these Amendments. They should be given no greater and no less consideration whether they

come at the beginning of the day or at the end of the day. I understand that the right hon. Gentleman wanted to start the Income Tax debate. I certainly was not out to prevent him starting on that. I always think it is the right of the Opposition, and I always took it myself, to adjust the Clauses so that we started on the ones on which we wanted to start. But the concomitant of that was the cooperation of hon. Members to ensure that we got through the Clauses broadly agreed within a reasonable period of time on the previous day. We cannot have it both ways. On this I am operating on the general basis of the understanding certainly expressed by the House, and the right hon. Gentleman ought to reconsider his position.</p>
