	<p pid="b.1.8/1">The last available figures, which are for the financial year ending March 2008, show that Remploy received &pound;195.8 million of direct funding from the Department, comprising &pound;145.8 million of grant in aid and an additional &pound;50 million of modernisation payments to help with the restructuring of the company. Managing the level of funding for Remploy is one of the key aims of our modernisation plan, which was why we secured a &pound;555 million modernisation fund over the five-year period.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.9/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that reply. In the response to my parliamentary question 270816, Members were able to see that, over the last three years, Remploy's senior managers have claimed &pound;4.3 million in bonus payments, including &pound;1.7 million in last year alone. That is six times the amount of money paid out in bonuses in 2000-01. Given that Remploy is losing money, that factories have closed and that job numbers are falling, does my hon. Friend not agree that it would be more appropriate for no bonuses to be paid until Remploy is making money, not losing it?</p>

	<p pid="b.1.10/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend. She will know that there are two parts to Remploy: the enterprise operation that runs the factory of about 3,000 employees, and the employment services, which got more than 7,000 people into jobs last year. Part of the bonus programme was that those managers whose pay is about &pound;30,000 got a bonus of about &pound;5,000 for getting disabled people into work. Their pay and performance terms compare favourably with those of other companies or comparable organisations. The bonus scheme is for the company, but it needs to be seen in perspective, in the context of the overall organisation.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that question. He will be aware that we are doubling the access to work fund, which has seen some 44,000 disabled people into work. Using access to work as an indicator, we are not seeing any of those who benefit from the fund losing their employment. I am sure that he would also welcome the learning disability employment strategy, which I and the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" name="Phil Hope">the Member for Corby (Phil Hope)</phrase>, launched last week. The hon.

	<p pid="b.3.3/1">It is good to see you in the Chair, Mr. Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/2">The Department is continuing to help people from incapacity benefit and income support back into the labour market and jobs. Despite the recession, and although unemployment has risen, the number of people on inactive benefits has not risen over the last year, which is in contrast to what happened during the recessions in the early '80s and early '90s.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.3.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" speakername="Tom Harris" colnum="3"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0001.htm#0906296000483">
	<p pid="b.3.4/1">High levels of economic inactivity inevitably mean high levels of poverty, particularly child poverty. Over the past decade in Glasgow, we have seen incremental reductions in the number of people claiming incapacity benefits, but if that incremental approach continues, we are going to see those levels of poverty inflicted on yet another generation. Does my right hon. Friend share my impatience? Is it not time that we moved from an incremental approach to a step change in moving vast numbers of people off benefits and into work?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.3.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="3"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0001.htm#0906296000484">
	<p pid="b.3.5/1">My hon. Friend is right that huge problems can be created for the families of those on incapacity benefit and those left out of the labour market for a long time, even though they may be able to come back into work. He will also know that after the numbers on sickness benefit rose for more than 20 years, they have, in fact, been falling since 2003. I think that some of the measures in the Welfare Reform Bill will help prepare people for work in the future as well as helping those who can get back into work do so in the short term.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.6/1">Does the Secretary of State agree that the best incentive to get people into work would be a serious increase in the minimum wage?</p>

	<p pid="b.3.7/1">The minimum wage has played an important part in making work pay for a huge number of people who were previously stuck on poverty pay. We take the advice of the Low Pay Commission in setting the minimum wage so that we can support the economy more broadly, but there is no doubt that, along with tax credits and other measures, it has helped to ensure that people are better off in work.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.0/1">Given that the number of workless claimants under retirement age has fallen only from 5.6 million to 5.2 million at a time when 3 million new jobs have been available&mdash;nearly all of them taken by people coming to this country to seek work&mdash;what plans does the Secretary of State have to free up local offices and give them their own budgets so that they can find more effective ways of moving people from benefit into work?</p>

	<p pid="b.4.1/1">As my right hon. Friend will know, we are introducing the flexible new deal, which will provide more flexible and personalised support. We are also seeking, both though the Welfare Reform Bill and through pilot programmes, to introduce more flexibility, focusing on individuals' personal problems and the reasons why they may not be able to return to the labour market. I hope that he will recognise that important progress has been made to reverse what was an inexorable rise in the number of people on sickness benefits, and that there have been no increases although the labour market is under considerable pressure as a result of the recession.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.2/1">I am afraid that the Secretary of State simply is not correct. The Government's target is to remove 1 million people from incapacity benefit and employment support allowance by 2015. The last set of official statistics showed an increase, as do early estimates from the Secretary of State's own Department. Let me return to the question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">the hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase>. How exactly will the Government hit that 1 million target, given that they have been singularly unsuccessful in doing so thus far?</p>

	<p pid="b.4.3/1">I am sorry to hear the hon. Gentleman ask that question, but the answer is clear: we will invest additional sums to help people back into work. Conservative Front Benchers have opposed that investment. It is tragic that they should oppose &pound;5 billion of additional support to help people to return to work during a recession. It should also be recognised that in the early 1990s, between 1990 and 1991, the number of people receiving inactive benefits rose by more than 200,000, and that it has not increased over the past 12 months.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.4/1">I was told by a very experienced individual who had been a job centre manager during the 1990s about the really tough targets for moving people from employment benefits to incapacity benefits at that time. We also discussed the fate of the cohort who have failed their employment support allowance medical and who have not so far turned up again on the jobseeker's allowance rolls, although they might have been expected to do so. Either they have found jobs, which would be a good thing, or they have fallen out of the system altogether, which would be a bad thing. What research is the Department conducting to ensure that no one who needs help and support is losing out as a result of the new system?</p>

	<p pid="b.4.5/1">My hon. Friend will know that we are monitoring all the changes to ensure that we support the most vulnerable, and that we help people back into work. He will also know that some people have managed to find work for themselves. However, we should also focus on more individual problems. We should examine the individual reasons why people may not be receiving the support that they need, and ensure that we can provide it.</p>

Does she also agree that when the state provides a safety net it is important that that safety net is not so gold-plated that it creates perverse incentives for employers to close down schemes, and that it is extremely important, too, that the state safety nets that this Labour Government have introduced are maintained?</p>

	<p pid="b.5.9/1">May I congratulate the Minister and the Secretary of State on their new appointments? Does the Minister not accept that the FAS pensioners feel like the poor relations because they are told there is not the money to give them full compensation, when there was money, for example, when building societies were bailed out to put 100 per cent. of the shortfall of those pension funds in at the time? So this is clearly a matter of priorities. Does she also accept that this 90 per cent. figure that she uses is highly misleading&mdash;I am sure not deliberately so&mdash;because it is not just capped, but there are big issues about the inflation protection? Does she accept that many pensioners will get much less than 90 per cent., and that over the years they will see annual falls in their real pensions? Will she look at those cases again?</p>

We have also extended early access for those with ill health who have had to retire within five years of retirement age, and for those with a progressive disease we have introduced early access which is unreduced. This is more than we promised to do when the FAS was created. I am happy to keep looking at this, but I think the hon.

We saw what happened not only in the early '80s, but the early '90s, when effectively we lost a generation to work because of the long-term unemployment among young people. That is why, as well as the future jobs fund, which will provide more than 100,000 additional youth jobs across the country, we want training at an earlier stage. Young people can also benefit from the additional training provided at six months that was introduced in April. It is an additional help to people who need support at this time, in the middle of a recession.</p>

It is good to see that she has maintained her interest in these issues. On the question of what training support is provided from day one, people who have lost their job can already get up to 16 hours of part-time training and support from the skills for life qualifications and from the employability skills programmes. Last year alone, Jobcentre Plus referred just over 1 million people for skills and training in the first six months of their claims. A lot of support is provided already for training for people in the early months when they lose their jobs. She asks why we cannot introduce her policies. She would not be able to introduce her policies or most of ours because she opposes the &pound;5 million additional investment that we are putting in to support the unemployed this year.</p>

We have already introduced additional support that is stronger than the new deal in many areas since April. After someone has been unemployed for six months they can get additional job subsidies and additional training support; they can get all kinds of further help that is better than the new deal for adults, which was offered across the country. We are going further; we are introducing the flexible new deal. I must say to her that she can talk as much as she likes about &quot;hollow words&quot;, but the hollow words come from her party, which will not fund additional help for people whom it previously abandoned. We are determined to help these people get back into work, whereas she simply opposes the funding for them.</p>

	<p pid="b.10.4/1">Everyone, even the hon. Gentleman, must understand that in the current economic circumstances meeting the 2010 target is a real challenge. However, in the middle of a recession we are continuing to take action, which is why we published the Child Poverty Bill this month. Our approach contrasts starkly with the policies that his party pursued. Had we continued with those&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.10.6/1">The increase in child poverty in each of the last three years would seem to justify the Treasury Committee's belief that the Government will miss their 2010 target to halve child poverty by a significant margin. Many of us were hoping to debate the Child Poverty Bill today, but can the Minister tell the House how it will foster enterprise in those areas in which more than half of the working age population are not in work, and what it will do to strengthen families, given that we know that the children of parents who separate are more than a third more likely to be unemployed themselves?</p>

I am aware that the profile of many of those jobs is professional, technical and managerial. Through our rapid response service, we have made contact with Corus in Scunthorpe and we will go in to offer help, including signposting older workers into training so that they can refresh some of their skills prior to becoming redundant, so that they can get back into work as quickly as possible. Apprenticeships for older people are an interesting idea. I am meeting the Minister for Further Education, Skills, Apprenticeships and Consumer Affairs later this week and I will have a chat with him about it.</p>

	<p pid="b.11.6/1">My hon. Friend is very knowledgeable in this area, and she knows that it is important that we pay particular attention to the problems that older workers may have in getting back into work and to any age discrimination that may exist. We need to work with employers to break down some of their misunderstandings about the business gain that may result from employing workers from the rich pool of talent of those aged over 50. Part of the more personalised approach that we are taking to advice in Jobcentre Plus is to understand what talents are available in individuals and how some niche training can help them. That can be available from day one, but it is certainly available as part of the six-month offer, in which we offer a training allowance to all workers. That is a vast improvement on the situation under the new deal.</p>

One of the issues raised at the meeting was the fact that many voluntary sector bodies, charities and small businesses employ only a handful of people, and therefore would not be eligible to apply individually to the future jobs fund. South Ribble seeks to bring a number of partners together to support small businesses and bodies in the charitable and voluntary sector that employ people in ones and twos. Will my right hon.

We want partners to come together to put forward proposals. That includes drawing on not only small businesses but small charitable organisations and other kinds of small groups that may be able to provide help. We set up the programme as we did in order to be able to deliver very rapidly more than 100,000 youth jobs, with a further 50,000 for the most deprived areas. It is an ambitious programme, but we think it is the right one, given the need to support people through a difficult time as a result of the world recession.</p>

	<p pid="b.12.3/1">What response will the Secretary of State make to the Centre for Cities report, published last week, which shows that the future jobs fund is quite inadequate for dealing with the likely number of youth unemployed, which will rise to approximately 350,000 by the end of 2011?

	<p pid="b.12.4/1">It is exactly in order to prevent long-term youth unemployment, and long-term unemployment across the board, that we are investing in measures such as help for people who have been out of work for six months, and additional support for people from the very day they lose their job. If we can start bringing unemployment down faster than it came down in the early '80s and early '90s, it helps not only families who would otherwise be scarred by long-term unemployment but the wider economy and the public finances. That is why it is right to make that investment. The hon. Gentleman's comments would be rather more credible if he and his party supported the &pound;1 billion future jobs fund, which is so critical to giving opportunities to the young people he mentions.</p>

	<p pid="b.14.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is clearly right: as a result of the global recession&mdash;the first global recession for many years&mdash;unemployment has risen, but he will of course have noted that long-term unemployment has fallen by 94 per cent. in his constituency, and long-term youth claimant unemployment has fallen by 73 per cent. in his constituency. The important thing for us is that we have a sufficiently active welfare state to turn people around when they become unemployed and get them back into work as quickly as possible. Thanks to the welfare reforms that the Government have put in place, we have made good progress on that. As for getting his constituents to the front of the queue, I continue to meet my colleagues at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and work through some of those interesting issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.15.1/1">That figure of 963 has increased faster than the comparable figure in almost any other constituency in the land, principally because of the large number of small businesses that are located in the New Forest, many of which have very good order books but have cash flow problems.

On his substantive point, it is important that the Government support small businesses. I, myself, ran a small business for 10 years before entering Parliament, and he will of course have noted and been pleased that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs helped more than 100,000 businesses by allowing them to delay their payments to it.

What more are Ministers going to do to ensure that those pensioners get the money they are entitled to?</p>

	<p pid="b.18.5/1">Take-up of pension credit is close to 70 per cent., and that has taken 900,000 pensioners out of poverty. Since 1998-99, there has been a reduction from 29 to 18 per cent. in the proportion of pensioners on relative low incomes. We continue to do all we can to encourage take-up of pension credit among those who are entitled to it. I would be happy to assist my hon. Friend in doing what he can in his own constituency to get every single pensioner who is entitled to claim pension credit claiming it.</p>

	Building Britain's Future
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.21.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1997" speakername="Gordon Brown" speakeroffice="The Prime Minister"  colnum="21"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0004.htm#0906296000598">
	<p pid="b.21.1/1">With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the draft legislative programme&mdash;our plans to build a stronger, fairer and more prosperous Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/2">In the past year we have taken action to prevent a collapse of banks, to protect home owners against recession and to maintain vital investment in public services at the time when people need them most. Now, as we seek to move our economy out of recession, we are setting out the steps that we propose to support growth and jobs in the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/3">In the last two recessions, tens of thousands of young people were written off to become a generation lost to work. That is a mistake that this Government will not repeat. So today we are announcing new measures, to be paid for from the spending allocations made in the Budget and from switching of spending, to meet new priorities that include creating new growth, new jobs and new housing. Targeted investments to support jobs and strengthen growth are also the surest and fastest way to reduce deficits and debt in every country.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/4">So my first announcement is about new jobs for young people. Starting from January, every young person under 25 who has been unemployed for a year will receive a guaranteed job, work experience or a training place. In return&mdash;I believe there will be public support for this&mdash;they will also, from next spring, have the obligation to accept that guaranteed offer. This is the first time that any Government have guaranteed that jobs and training will be available to young people and, crucially, made it mandatory for young people, if there is a job available, to take that work up or have their benefits cut if they do not do so. To underpin that guarantee, as part of the investments that we announced in the Budget, &pound;1 billion is being set aside for the future jobs fund, which will provide 100,000 jobs for young people, with another 50,000 in areas of high unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/5">From this September we will also realise our pledge to all school leavers that every 16 and 17-year-old will receive an offer of a school or college place, or a training place or apprenticeship. Also from this September, we will offer 20,000 new full-time community service places. That will complement the help for adults who have been unemployed for six months, who will get access to skills training or a jobs subsidy&mdash;part of about &pound;5 billion that we set aside in the Budget and pre-Budget report for targeted support for jobs and training in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/6">In total, through the action taken so far, and by rejecting the view that Government should cut investment in a recession, we are preventing the loss of about 500,000 jobs. Our continued investment in giving immediate help through Jobcentre Plus to people made unemployed is already making a difference, with each month about 250,000 people moving off unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/7">New jobs for the future will also come through making the necessary investments in low-carbon energy, digital technology, financial services, bioscience, advanced manufacturing and transport. Those are the building blocks of the competitive economy of the future, so we will use the Queen's Speech to ensure that the British economy is best placed to take up those opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/8">First, the new energy Bill will enable us to support up to four commercial-scale carbon capture and storage demonstration plants for Britain. The Bill complements the &pound;1.4 billion of public investment provided in the Budget for low-carbon energy, and up to &pound;4 billion now on offer from the European Investment Bank. In addition, following our reforms to the policy, planning and regulatory regimes in this country, we will see between now and 2020, as we meet our renewable energy targets, around &pound;100 billion invested by the private sector. Those investments will make Britain a major global player in low carbon, with another 400,000 green jobs by 2017, taking British employment in the sector to well over 1 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/9">Secondly, the digital economy Bill will help underpin our commitment to enable broadband for all by 2012, working towards a nationwide high-speed broadband network by 2016, with additional Government investment unlocking new jobs and billions of additional investment from the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/10">Thirdly, a new innovation fund will be announced today by the Minister for Science and Innovation. It is &pound;150 million of public money, which will, over time, lever in up to &pound;1 billion of private sector investment in biotechnology, life sciences, low-carbon technologies and advanced manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/11">Over the coming weeks, the Transport Secretary will set out plans to advance the electrification of transport, cutting rail carbon emissions on newly electrified lines by around one third. Lord Davies will lead a new drive to improve the country's infrastructure, thus increasing the efficiency with which projects are taken forward, with the establishment of a new body, Infrastructure UK. An asset sales board will work with the shareholder executive to achieve our &pound;16 billion assets sales target&mdash;money that can be redirected to public investment. Those investments will strengthen our economy and create new jobs. We believe that investment by the Government and the private sector will enable the economy to create 1.5 million new skilled jobs in Britain in the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/12">In every part of the country, there is an urgent need for new social housing and for new affordable home ownership. So the Minister for Housing is announcing that in the next two years&mdash;from the re-allocation of funds&mdash;we will more than treble the extra investment in housing: from the &pound;600 million announced in the Budget to a total of &pound;2.1 billion from today. That will finance over the next 24 months a total of 110,000 affordable homes to rent or buy and in doing so create an estimated 45,000 jobs in construction and related industries.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/13">By building new and additional homes we can now also reform social housing allocation, enabling local authorities to give more priority to local people whose names have been on waiting lists for far too long. We will consult on reforms to the council house finance system to allow local authorities to retain all the proceeds from their own council house sales and council rents. We want to see a bigger role and responsibility for local authorities to meet the housing needs of people in their areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/14">We will continue to take forward the far-reaching reforms of financial supervision, upon which we have embarked, domestically and globally, since the financial crisis hit in 2007. For those who argue that that issue is falling off the agenda, let me make it clear: sorting out the irresponsibility and regulatory weaknesses that led to the crisis remains an urgent imperative, to which we will continue to give priority at home and abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/15">The financial services and business Bill will ensure better consumer protection, including a ban on unsolicited credit card cheques. In addition, the Financial Services Authority is taking action to ensure that there can be no return to the old short-termist approach to executive pay in the banking sector. <i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.23.1/1">To help tackle tax avoidance, the Treasury is publishing today a new tax code for banks.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/2">Alongside our strategy for growth and jobs, we will introduce new legislation: for education, to address child poverty, and for policing. In doing so, we will create a new set of public service entitlements for parents, patients and citizens&mdash;securing for them more personal services tailored to their needs. For patients in the health service, that will mean enforceable entitlements to prompt treatment and high standards of care: a guarantee that no one who needs to see a cancer specialist waits more than two weeks; a guarantee of a free health check-up on the NHS for everyone over 40; and a guarantee that no one waits more than 18 weeks for hospital treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/3">The Health Secretary will bring forward proposals later this year to focus the NHS further towards prevention and early intervention; to extend the choices for people to have treatment and care at times that suit them and, whenever possible, in their own homes; and to reform and improve maternity and early-years' services. We will shortly consult on far-reaching proposals for how we need to modernise our health and social care systems, so that our country can meet the challenge of an ageing society.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/4">The second set of public service entitlements will be for parents, with a guarantee of individually tailored education for their children, as part of far-reaching reform in the schools system. I want all our children to have opportunities that are available today only to those who can pay for them in private education. It is right that personal tutoring should be extended to all who need it, so there will be a new guarantee for parents of a personal tutor for pupils at secondary and primary schools and catch-up tuition, including one-to-one tuition for those who need it.<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090630/corrtext/90630c0001.htm#column_3MC"><i> [Official Report, 30 June 2009, Vol. 495, c. 3MC.]</i></a></p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/5">So that every school in our country is a good school and so that we meet the national challenge to eliminate underperforming schools by 2011, we will see the best head teachers working in more than one school, as we radically extend trusts, academies and federations to increase the supply of good school places throughout our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/6">The third set of new public service entitlements is the offer that neighbourhood police teams can make to all citizens in every community. Already&mdash;since last April&mdash;there are 3,600 teams in place, offering to every part of the country policing tailored to the community's needs. We will now go further and give guarantees to local people that they will have more power to keep their neighbourhoods safe, including the right to hold the police to account at monthly beat meetings, to have a say on CCTV and other crime prevention measures and to vote on how offenders pay back to the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/7">Our policing, crime and private security Bill will give the police more time on the beat, by changing and reducing the reporting requirements for police officers on stop-and-search forms, as well as new rights to ensure that women are better protected against violence. That will take account of recommendations made in response to our consultation on violence against women and girls, which will be published this autumn. We will also legislate to ensure protection for children, with a new and strengthened system of statutory age ratings for video games.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/8">Because British citizenship brings responsibilities as well as rights, we will now require newcomers to earn the right to stay, extending the points-based system to probationary citizenship. The more someone contributes to their community, the greater their chance of becoming a citizen.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/9">The Foreign Secretary will introduce legislation to prohibit the use, development, production, stockpiling and transfer of cluster munitions, bringing into British law the international agreement that we led the way on signing last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/10">Building Britain's future must clearly start here in this Parliament with our commitment to cleaning up politics and establishing a new and strong democratic and constitutional settlement to rebuild trust in politics. I can announce today, on the House of Lords, that we will legislate in the next Session to complete the process of removing the hereditary principle from the second Chamber and provide for the disqualification of Members where there is reason to do so. We will set out proposals to complete Lords reform by bringing forward a draft Bill for a smaller and democratically constituted second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/11">There is a real choice for our country: driving growth forward or letting the recession take its course; creating jobs for the future or doing nothing. We will not walk away from the British people in difficult times. Our policy is to build the growth, the jobs and the public services that we need for Britain's future. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.24.0/1">The Prime Minister talks about building Britain's future, but is it not time that the British people were asked whether they want him to be part of it? There was no recognition in that statement that Labour has been in office for 12 years and no recognition of the catastrophic state of the public finances. The Prime Minister is living in a dream world where spending is going up, investment is going up and infrastructure is being boosted. When is someone going to tell him that he has run out of money? He talked, for instance, about housing. Let me give him just one figure: house building today is at its lowest level since 1947. People are entitled to ask: simply what world is he living in?</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/2">I expect that, like me, Mr. Speaker, you will have been thinking that you had heard a lot of that statement before&mdash;and not just because the Prime Minister ignored your injunction and leaked most of it in advance. It is because we have heard most of it before. How many times has the country been told to expect the Prime Minister's vision? How many times have we been told to expect a string of policy announcements that was going to involve bold reform? Every single re-launch collapses, and did that not happen more quickly than usual today? At 7.50 am, Lord Mandelson took to the airwaves and promptly sank the whole thing by cancelling the Government's spending review. So, is not what we have today a package without a price tag? It is just a combination of rehashed initiatives, ideas taken from the Opposition and some timid, bureaucratic, top-down tinkering.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/3">I have to admit that there are some good things in the statement&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Ah!&quot;] Yes&mdash;that is because we thought of them. The future fund, carbon capture and storage demonstrations&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.25.1/1">At least they can read and take dictation. For example, the Government are saying, &quot;If you don't take the job, you won't get the benefits.&quot; We announced that at our party conference two years ago. Every year, the Prime Minister says that we do not have any policies, yet every year he fills his draft legislative programme with them.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/2">Much of the rest of the programme has been rehashed from previous years. The simplification of our immigration rules, for example, was announced in last year's programme. The floods Bill was recommended in 2007, announced in 2008 and re-announced again this morning, in 2009. One-to-one tuition and the NHS check-ups were both announced last year&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;We are doing that.&quot;] Well, you should be doing it by now.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/3">The Constitutional Renewal Bill is now back for the third time in a row. This time, it is apparently going to include Lords reform&mdash;but the Prime Minister has not been reforming the House of Lords; he has been stuffing it with his cronies. I stuffed it with one of his cronies, too; he is on our side now. Is not the real renewal that our country needs not a Bill but a general election?</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/4">Where is the Heritage Protection Bill that was announced last year? Where are the regulatory budgets that the Prime Minister announced as a way of cutting red tape on business? We have heard not a word about the legislation on the Royal Mail. That was to be the great virility test for the Prime Minister's reforming zeal&mdash;remember? Where is it? Stuck in the post? We were promised a Second Reading before the summer recess. Where is it? Lord Mandelson said in today's <i> Financial Times</i> that he was finding himself &quot;jostled&quot; out of the programme. I cannot believe that Lord Mandelson of upgrade has ever been jostled out of anything, but there we are.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/5">Let me make the Prime Minister an offer. If he has not got time in his packed parliamentary schedule to get his Royal Mail reforms through, would he like to use the time allocated for our Opposition day debate next week for the Bill's Second Reading? Would he welcome that? Just nod&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Is there anybody out there? Is there anybody in there? So much for all his talk about tough decisions: he has bottled it once again.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/6">The Prime Minister claims that there are three themes in his statement: the economy, public services and political reform. Let me ask him a couple of questions about each. First, on the economy, he talks about what he is doing for the unemployed. Will he confirm that the number of young people who are not in employment or training was higher than a decade ago even before the recession began, and that there are now 1 million of our fellow citizens in that situation? On banking, do we not need to recognise that the whole system has failed? That is why we are planning to end the whole tripartite system, to give new powers to the Bank of England and to let the Bank call time on debt. Is not what we have got from the Government just tinkering with a system that does not work, from a Prime Minister who set it up and cannot afford to admit that he got it wrong?</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/7">On public finances, when will the Prime Minister address the fact that Britain is heading for the worst budget deficit in the developed world? To listen to his statement, one would think that the Treasury were rolling in money. When is someone going to tell him that it has run out? Let me read out what the OECD said only this morning. It said that the Government had to be more &quot;ambitious&quot; and more &quot;explicit&quot; about the need for spending cuts. The OECD is joining a growing list&mdash;from the Institute for Fiscal Studies to the Governor of the Bank of England, and, in private, half the Cabinet&mdash;of those who admit that he has got to be straight with people on spending. So let me ask the Prime Minister a very simple question: will there be a spending review before the general election? This morning, the First Secretary said that there would not, then the Treasury said that there might be. Who speaks for the Government? Any household or company faced with that level of debt would start to get it under control. Is it not essential to start reviewing spending now?</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/8">If the first big failure of today's announcement is the lack of honesty on spending, the second is surely the lack of real reform in our public services. I suppose, however, that we should be grateful for one thing: year after year, this Government and this Prime Minister have promoted and defended their targets culture; today, they have finally admitted that they were wrong all along. But let us make no mistake: the proposals are about top-down, bureaucratic tinkering, not real reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/9">On schools, the Prime Minister talks about putting power in parents' hands, so why is he replacing the raw data of school league tables with manufactured report cards? On the police, why is the Prime Minister just talking about empowering citizens, rather than giving them the chance to vote for their elected representatives? On health, why is he restricting people's choices rather than letting them and their GPs choose where they get treated?</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/10">Then there is the addiction to the initiative. Let us take just one&mdash;the parenting order. It is apparently the big, new idea on school discipline, but it was actually announced in September 2004. In the past five years, how many pupils have been disciplined in that way? A big fat zero. That is the truth behind the Government's announcement. The truth about today's statement is that it serves only to highlight the decline of this Government. Their money has run out, their political capital is running out, and now their time is running out.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/11">Will the Prime Minister answer two specific questions? First, will there be a comprehensive spending review? Secondly, will he bring forward the legislation on the Royal Mail before the summer recess?</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/12">What we have seen today is yet another re-launch&mdash;a re-launch without a price tag. Is it not clear to the whole country that the only way to sort out our finances, to get real reform of our public services, and to build Britain's future, is to change this wretched Government?</p>

	<p pid="b.27.0/1">The big question in this country is how to return to growth and secure extra jobs in the economy. The right hon. Gentleman has made not one policy suggestion that could get us moving in the right direction. We have announced that unemployed young people will get jobs after they have been unemployed for a year, and that is mandatory. His policy is to do absolutely nothing. We have announced an autumn guarantee for school leavers so that they can get jobs or training. His policy is to do absolutely nothing. We have announced help for unemployed adults in a way that no other Government have done before. His policy is to do nothing. We have announced new help for social housing today. His policy is to do absolutely nothing and to leave people without homes. We have announced new help for owner-occupiers today. His policy is to do nothing.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/2">In every area in which the country is looking for a Government who will bring growth and jobs, the policy of the Opposition is to do nothing but cut public spending this year, next year and then by 10 per cent. in future years. That policy will neither create jobs and growth, nor reduce debt and deficits. It would bring worse debt and worse deficits.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/3">As for public services, the Government were right to set targets for the future. Cancer waiting lists would not be down to two weeks had we not set a target and invested in the future. Hospital waits would not be down to a maximum of 18 weeks had we not set the targets and made the investment. GP surgeries would not be open in the evenings and at weekends had we not been prepared to make tough decisions. We will not build the health service of the future without the necessary investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/4">The right hon. Gentleman wants to move from targets to a simple free-for-all. We want to move from national targets to personal entitlements, which people will see delivered as a matter of course, for shorter waiting lists, better treatment and, in schools, for parents to have more rights. But the Conservative party wants to cut spending and to cut the responsibility on public servants to deliver the service.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman agreed with us on one&mdash;<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.27.2/1">As for the Royal Mail, let me make absolutely clear that the Bill that we have put forward is to do a number of things. The first is to save the pension fund of the Post Office; the second is to ensure better regulation of the Royal Mail; the third is to ensure that the universal service obligation is maintained, whereas in other countries it is being reduced; and the fourth is to introduce more capital&mdash;more investment&mdash;into the Royal Mail. The right hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well what is happening to the market for investment in this country at the moment. We will continue to push forward with our plans to modernise the Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.2/2">As far as the comprehensive spending review is concerned, the right hon. Gentleman knows that there was a spending review in 2004 and one in 2007. We have set out plans for 2009-10 and 2010-11. No Government have given more detail on their spending allocations, and we have moved from the annual spending plans that were a feature of the previous Government's way of doing things. We will not make the mistake of pre-announcing ideologically driven public spending cuts&mdash;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Yes, 10 per cent. public spending cuts irrespective of growth, irrespective of employment, irrespective of inflation and interest rates. The Conservatives are now ideologically committed to 10 per cent. cuts in public services. That is not the policy of this Government. We are the party of growth; we are the party of jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.2/3">The Leader of the Opposition has only two policies: one is to cut public spending, and the other is to cut public spending even more by giving inheritance tax cuts to the very few&mdash;300,000 people in this country. For two years, he has been up against me as the Opposition leader. He has put forward no policies for growth, no policies to tackle the recession, no policies for jobs and no policies, but cuts, for our public services.</p>

	<p pid="b.28.0/1">The Prime Minister and the leader of the Conservatives have just perfected their fake debate on public spending, yet both are treating voters as if they are children, too young to know the truth. This morning, the Government have reneged on their promise to hold a comprehensive spending review before the next election, and the Conservatives are not going to decide on their cuts until the day after it. Neither is willing to come clean on the difficult long-term savings we will need to make to balance the nation's books. It is like a big hoax&mdash;they trade insults and numbers, but hide the truth.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/2">There are some announcements&mdash;or, rather, re-announcements&mdash;that I welcome, not least the ongoing consultation to give local authorities control over housing rents and revenues, the proposals for an elected House of Lords and the commitment to give all young people under 25 a guaranteed job or training place. As ever, however, the devil will be in the detail. This is the 11th announcement on housing since September. The Government's consultation on housing revenue has been grinding on since January, yet 1.8 million people are still waiting for a decent home.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/3">We have been debating reform of the House of Lords&mdash;the other place&mdash;for more than a century, so now is the time for action, not simply more proposals. The Prime Minister is still silent on some of the wider more radical political reforms we need to clean up British politics once and for all. The hopes of young people to avoid the scrapheap of long-term unemployment must not be dashed in practice once again.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/4">In the drum roll of advance media leaks, we were promised a vision of the future from the Government based on decentralisation and personal entitlements. I welcome any recognition from a party and a Government of arch centralisers that they have got it wrong and that the levers of Whitehall do not provide all the answers. Yet many of the so-called personal entitlements are, on closer inspection, just the recycled versions of the old targets. Suddenly, the target to receive an operation within 18 weeks of seeing a GP is called an entitlement. Last week, the Prime Minister called the cuts an investment; this week, he is calling a target an entitlement, so can he tell us exactly what is the difference?</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/5">When one scratches beneath the rhetoric, the long screwdriver of Whitehall is still in place, because the Prime Minister, the great godfather of big government still cannot really let go. Even as we speak, his Government are giving his Education Secretary&mdash;where is he? He is not here&mdash;153 new powers in the Apprenticeship, Skills and Learning Bill, including the power to hand-pick children's school books. Is that what he calls &quot;giving power away&quot;? If the Prime Minister really wanted to make sure investment followed individuals, he would have announced a school funding premium tied directly to the most disadvantaged pupils so that they can get the personalised support and tuition that they need on their terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/6">Given the likelihood that many of the Prime Minister's proposals will not make it off the pages of the Government's press release and are unlikely to work in practice, does he agree with a senior Government official quoted in today's <i> Financial Times</i> who admitted that this Government have</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/7" class="indent">&quot;a fixation on producing endless policy documents&mdash;a total lack of interest in delivery&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/8">All in all, the Prime Minister's statement was a hotch-potch of unrelated Whitehall schemes&mdash;a ministerial cut-and-paste job scraped together by a Government without a unifying vision and a Prime Minister running out of steam.</p>

	<p pid="b.29.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman recognises, as we do, that employment is a huge issue. The question is, does he support our proposals or not? We have presented specific proposals for unemployed young people, for adults who need help and for school leavers this summer. The proposals are very precise, and they will give help to people in different communities of this country. The hon. Gentleman could not tell us whether he supported them or not, but I feel that this is the right way forward, and I hope that on reflection he too will consider that those are the right things to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.0/2">In the case of the health service and education, it is right that individuals should now have personal entitlements. We could not have achieved the 18-week maximum wait for hospitals without the investment that we have made and the targets that we have set. It is right that individuals can now be sure that they will have that entitlement when they go to their hospitals wanting health service treatment. It is equally right that parents who need tutoring help for their children who are unable to read or unable to write, or are finding it difficult to count, should receive it when we can give it to them. The hon. Gentleman should support that.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.0/3">As for the House of Lords, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will now support our proposals for change.</p>

Britain wants to be, and will be, a leading global player in low-carbon industries, and the innovation fund is one means by which we can help the companies my hon. Friend mentioned.</p>

Please can we spend the section 106 money held in bank accounts across the country by local authorities, as that could create the housing that we need now?</p>

	<p pid="b.36.2/1">My hon. Friend is right: we want to do more to help people who are worried about their jobs, as well as people who have lost their jobs. That is why we gave extra money to Corus last week to help the firm through difficult times. That is why, at the same time, we have introduced more places on Train to Gain, so that people who do short-time working can get help with training to ensure that they are ready with new skills for the upturn. The working tax credit is giving money to people on short-time working, so that they are kept out of poverty. We are taking whatever action we can to create jobs and to help people who are in jobs.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.0/1">My hon. Friend is right. The announcement today about housing is for energy-efficient as well as affordable homes. Therefore, the guidelines that will be laid down will require low-carbon buildings that are better for our future. On apprenticeships and training, we now have a national apprenticeship service that can link young people who want apprenticeships to the firms that have them available. Previously, apprenticeships were very local and often depended on who the young person knew. Now, we can help to direct people to the career of their choice through the national apprenticeship service.</p>

I am quite happy to deal with the points that he has raised and to deal with them with you, Mr. Speaker. However, that point of order is a trick that the hon.

In addition to the leaking of the statement that we have just heard by the Prime Minister, we have had four days' continuous leaks by the Minister for Children, Schools and whatever it is&mdash;Families and Schools&mdash;about a change in education policy on literacy and numeracy.

	<p pid="b.44.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">As the House will be aware, this Bill has been presented by my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House. She greatly regrets that she cannot be present either this afternoon in this Second Reading debate or in tomorrow's proceedings. She is attending the memorial service and then the funeral of Sir Henry Hodge, the husband of our right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" name="Margaret Hodge">the Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge)</phrase>, who tragically died 11 days ago. I am sure that the House will accept my right hon. and learned Friend's apologies in those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.2/3">As every Member can personally testify, the expenses scandal has profoundly affected the public's trust in us as individuals and in the House as the heart of our democracy. In almost equal measure, it has seriously damaged our confidence in ourselves. Many actions to right the situation and begin to restore trust have had to be taken. Some of the alleged abuses of the system have been so serious that careers have been prematurely terminated. There are police investigations.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.2/4">But above and beyond any serious individual failings, the reputation of the House as a whole, and of Members whose conduct has been beyond reproach, has been undermined. This terrible saga has, in turn, revealed a collective failure by this place effectively to regulate itself and to put in place systems that would have highlighted abuses before they started&mdash;rules and practices that, once the harsh spotlight was shone on them, withstood, rather than crumbled, in the face of public scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.4/1">Of course I agree. As I shall explain to the House, all the way through the series of negotiations, I have been very alive to the need to focus on the immediate problem&mdash;that of parliamentary expenses&mdash;and to ensure that, as I shall make clear, I am open to suggestions in respect of other matters. Of course it would be inappropriate to introduce wider constitutional reforms in an emergency way, and I hope that we are not proposing to do so.</p>

From interventions that insisted on clean water or safety systems in the mines or in factories, to increasingly tight external regulation of finance, business and professions, this House and Parliament has been unrelenting in its view that, however well meaning the individuals and venerable the institution, self-regulation is rarely, if ever, enough.

	<p pid="b.45.6/2">To answer those and many other questions, the Leader of the House and I have engaged in intensive cross-party discussions over the past three weeks, as I have said. All recognised parties in both Houses have been represented, as have the Cross-Bench peers, the Chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee and the Clerks department. I should like to record my thanks to all those who were involved. The discussions were not a substitute for, but a complement to, a proper examination of the Bill here and in the other place. The fact that the Bill before the House is different and, in my judgment, better than in its earlier drafts is testament to the willingness of everyone in the group to put aside partisan interests.

For example, the offence in clause 9(1) is already an offence under the Fraud Act 2006, which itself brought up to date the offence in the Theft Act 1968 of obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception. Why do we need to keep on increasing the number of laws when there are already laws that deal specifically with this sort of criminal behaviour?</p>

I spent 18 years in opposition, and the Government of the day showed me no mercy in this respect.

	<p pid="b.47.5/1">Of course I agree with that. Although we may not have got the provisions exactly right, I think that we are pretty nearly there in that respect. I will listen carefully to my hon. Friend's points about the amendments, which I have already studied.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/2">The fundamental purpose of the Bill is to replace the self-regulation of expenses, allowances and financial interests with external statutory regulation. The Bill will therefore establish the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and a separate Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigations. Those provisions are in clause 1 and the schedules. Clause 6, to which I shall return, provides that the House is to continue to have a code of conduct. Clauses 7 and 8 set out provisions for investigations and enforcement, clause 9 prescribes three offences and clause 10 is intended to ensure that the system of external regulation can be operated effectively without falling foul of article 9 of the Bill of Rights on the privilege of this Parliament. I shall return to that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/3">Of course, I recognise that the Clerk and distinguished right hon. and hon. Members have raised serious concerns, particularly about clauses 6 and 10, which will have an impact on the privilege of Parliament. I have already explained how I intend to approach the debates about that. I will make specific comments about those clauses later, but I wish first to make three general points to set the context.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/4">First, this House has long acknowledged that in principle, external non-statutory regulation of aspects of the House's business and the conduct of its Members may be insufficient, so the House of Commons Commission is established in statute. Freedom of information is a good example of what can happen. The Government's original proposal was that Parliament should be excluded from the operation of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Parliament, and specifically the Public Administration Committee in a 1998 report, said that such an exclusion</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/5" class="indent">&quot;may well convey the wrong impression to the general public, given the purpose of this legislation...we recommend that the Government re-examine the exclusion of Parliament in the light of&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/6">a report that had been produced by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege. In the light of that pressure, which would have been impossible to resist, although I did not wish to, the Government accepted that recommendation. Famously, we are now subject to FOI legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/7">Secondly, once it is agreed that there should be independent, external regulation of our allowances and much else, certain consequences follow as night follows day. Such regulation will be in statute, and interpreting statute is a fundamental purpose of our courts. There is nothing frightening or unacceptable about what then follows, which is that courts may judicially review the way in which statutory bodies, among others, operate. They will do so against long-established principles. Contrary to popular belief, the courts are slow to substitute their substantive judgments for the judgments of the relevant authority. Instead, they are there as a check against unfair process or wanton irrationality.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.5/8">Thirdly, and again contrary to myth, judicial review is in no sense a challenge to the sovereignty of Parliament. The Bill will put the regulation of allowances, financial interests and the code of conduct on a statutory footing. It will not affect the balance in our constitution between Parliament and the courts, as I shall explain in more detail later. We can expect the courts to continue to acknowledge the fundamental constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers in any proceedings that arise from the procedures in the Bill. Also, what Parliament does, Parliament can undo. That is a fundamental and very unusual feature of our system.</p>

The process was continuing when my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House spoke about the matter, and her comments were therefore accurate at the time and, as I shall explain, will be accurate in future. There is a separate issue about clause 10, and my view is that it must make some provision, even if not in the current wording, for adducing in court proceedings evidence that arises in the House or in parliamentary proceedings. There is nothing unusual in that&mdash;indeed, the House has accepted that for the draft bribery Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.49.0/1">Of course, I appreciate the Secretary of State's points. Indeed, perhaps the goalposts must be moved in the case of parliamentary privilege, which is little understood outside the House. However, is it not right that the system of enforcement&mdash;even specifically for the allowances aspect, which will go to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority&mdash;gives rise to the possibility of any conflict between IPSA and the Standards and Privileges Committee being judicially reviewable? That is how I read several clauses, particularly clause 8(6). The Bill also provides that IPSA can make specific recommendations to the Standards and Privileges Committee about the disciplinary powers that the latter should exercise. It would be helpful if, either now or in Committee, we could have some clarity about those important issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.50.9/1">I will explain why not to the hon. Gentleman. He asked me a question and I would now like to answer it, if I may. Sir Christopher Kelly and his committee will come forward with proposals for the scheme of allowances, which will come before this House. As far as I know, all the party leaders have indicated that unless those proposals are in the realm of complete irrationality, which I do not anticipate, they will be accepted in full, and so they should be. However, that is about the content of the scheme. The Bill is about the operation of the scheme, which includes, for example, who runs the Fees Office, who adjudicates in respect of the scheme and so on. Our plan&mdash;we can go into this in more detail in Committee tomorrow and on Wednesday&mdash;is that in the early autumn Sir Christopher Kelly will make his recommendations, which will be subject to approval by this House. Those recommendations will be the platform for the scheme that the new authority will operate. With luck, they could all come into force by <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January</phrase> next year if we have the authority in place, so the two will work in parallel and then merge together.</p>

Sir Christopher Kelly and his committee, the Committee on Standards in Public Life, are doing an important job of work. However, that is a one-off study into the future allowances system. This new body will, once and for all, on a permanent basis, ensure that the administration and supervision of what we call the Fees Office are separated, so that never again will staff in the Fees Office feel under the kind of pressure that they evidently have done, as some of us have now discovered, to bend or manipulate the rules. That has been very unfair to them, and I pay tribute to the overwhelming majority of staff in the Fees Office who have been trying to do the best job that they could in incredibly difficult circumstances. That is quite a separate issue from the recommendations about the kind of scheme that is needed, however. For the future, we need a process that is separate from this House&mdash;and separate from the Government, I suggest&mdash;for periodically setting the scheme of arrangements for allowances as well as administering them. That is what the new authority will do.</p>

	<p pid="b.52.3/1">No, I want to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.3/2">Clause 5 places a duty on IPSA to prepare rules relating to Members' financial interests. How it does so is also set out in the clause. No such rules can come into force unless approved by a resolution of this House. Clause 6 goes wider than this, and says that the House is to continue to have a code of conduct incorporating the seven Nolan principles on conduct in public life, and any other matters determined by the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.3/3">The starting point for any code of financial rules developed by IPSA will, necessarily, be the existing code of conduct of the House, which was most recently revised and published last <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-22">Monday 22 June</phrase>. It runs to 52 pages. As many Members may not have had reason to examine the code in detail before the expenses scandal broke, they might have assumed what was on the tin marked &quot;Code of Conduct&quot; was in the tin, in respect of all 52 pages. But if one examines the document, one finds that the code of conduct itself is couched in very general terms at the beginning of the document. It covers just three and a bit pages in all, of which one page is a recital of the Nolan principles. In contrast, the rules relating to the financial conduct of Members, and the guidance on those rules, run to 33 pages plus appendices, and almost all those rules and guidance concern Members' financial interests and conduct thereto.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.3/4">We have been clear that, if the new independent authority is to have teeth and achieve the public confidence so urgently needed, it must, among other things, be able to propose the rules on Members' conduct in the areas related to its functions. That means that it will take over responsibility for the whole of the guide relating to the conduct of Members, although, as the Bill makes clear, the content of any clause 5 rules will be subject to approval by the House. Some amendments have been tabled to clause 5, and they will be discussed tomorrow, but none is in any way fatal to it, and I believe that the clause generally carries the approval of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.53.0/1">This is one of the most difficult parts of the Bill. Does the Secretary of State recognise that, if the code of conduct were to become justiciable, that would constitute a questioning of proceedings in the House? The House has already shown that it is capable of producing a code of conduct, and Members can discuss with any outside body the improvements that should be made to it. It is therefore unnecessary to include this provision in the Bill in this way.</p>

	<p pid="b.53.1/1">The&mdash;<i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> Hold your breath! All those involved in the cross-party talks will confirm that my right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House of Commons and I worked hard to achieve consensus, sometimes revisiting draft clauses in the meetings to make them more acceptable. It was a genuinely collaborative process, and I am glad that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> acknowledges that.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/2">The original draft of clause 4 combined the scope of the current clauses 5 and 6. That clause was regarded as too wide. So to answer the points raised, the redrafted clauses 5 and 6&mdash;which are now in the Bill&mdash;were brought forward and, though time was pressing, raised little objection in the cross-party talks. That said, I always made it clear that everyone involved in the cross-party talks was entitled to further reflection on the Bill and its contents. The result of that further reflection is that considerable concern has been expressed by the learned Clerk of the House about the possible impact of clause 6, and two distinguished senior Members, the Chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1713" name="Stuart Bell">the Member for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell)</phrase>, have jointly tabled an amendment to delete clause 6.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/3">I supported clause 6 because I believed&mdash;and still do&mdash;that it provides belt-and-braces reassurance to the public that we will continue to have a code of conduct covering the issues, which are not many, that are not covered by the financial rules. It is fair to say that I am more sanguine than others about the effect of clause 6 and its interpretation by the courts. My officials, on advice from first parliamentary counsel, are providing a memorandum on the matter for the benefit of the Justice Committee. That said, the Clerk is the adviser to the House on matters of privilege, and much else, not me. This is emergency legislation, on which all parties are committed in principle to a speedy passage.</p>
	<p pid="b.53.1/4">Clause 6 is not essential to the Bill, so in the interests of consensus I will accept the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire and my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, and I will not move clause 6 when we reach that part of the Bill. There will be some consequential amendments to clause 5 and elsewhere in the Bill&mdash;<i> [Interruption.] </i>Well, there are bound to be. The issue is not whether the relevant sections of the code of conduct are covered by the scheme of the Bill, but how. I hope that what I have said has the approbation of the House, in the spirit in which we have approached the Bill from the start.</p>

	<p pid="b.55.3/2">We can go into these offences in more detail on Wednesday when we debate clause 9 in Committee. I will be happy to listen to what hon. Members have to say but, in my judgment, having offences in the Bill and in the scheme is fundamental to its proper operation and, above all, fundamental to ensuring public confidence in this scheme. That is precisely what we have insisted on in respect of local authorities, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. Neither local authorities nor the Welsh Assembly and Scottish Parliament have had a scandal around their ears, to put it frankly, of the kind we have faced for our failure properly to regulate ourselves.</p>

I understand and appreciate the concerns expressed by the learned Clerk, but our view, building on the recommendations of the 2003 Joint Committee on the draft Corruption Bill and further discussions that I have had on the latest Bribery Bill&mdash;which contains a similar exclusion in respect of article IX&mdash;is that such an exclusion is acceptable. However, I understand the sensitivity of the issue, and I promise that I will listen carefully to the concerns that are expressed.</p>

	<p pid="b.57.4/3">We shall engage in detailed examination over the next three days. As the House will acknowledge, I have already shown considerable flexibility.

	<p pid="b.58.0/1">The past few months have been desperate ones for Parliament: the reputation of this House has taken some pretty heavy knocks and Members of all parties have been left reeling. The crisis has arisen from the fact that Parliament has stood still while the world moved on. For more than 30 years we have worked under a system of remuneration that would never have stood up to scrutiny in the commercial world, and while political cowardice at the top maintained the headline rate of pay at an artificially low level, political deceit&mdash;I think it is fair to call it that&mdash;has invented an allowance scheme that was less than acceptable, lacked any transparency and was corrosive to public trust. One of the most important political trends of the past two decades has been the movement towards greater openness, so when the facts came out, as they were bound to do, it was always going to end in tears. The truth that now must haunt us all is that when the House had the opportunity to fix the system, it signally failed to seize the moment. We must not fail this time around.</p>

	<p pid="b.58.1/1">The Secretary of State implied several times that the Bill is the result of an agreement between the parties. Will my hon.

	<p pid="b.58.2/1">I think that fairly summarises the position, but I also think it is fair to say that the Secretary of State for Justice and the Leader of the House have been very open throughout the consultation and discussions we have had in trying to put together a Bill that is in many respects workable&mdash;and is far more workable than the original draft we saw.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.2/2">I would like to set out the context in which this Bill has emerged, and then say something about the principles that we should bear in mind as we go forward over the next couple of days. We support the principle behind the Bill of outsourcing the Fees Office, but it is not an overstatement to say that the Bill also touches on the fundamentals of our constitutional architecture. While Conservative Members appreciate that there is pressure to pass this legislation quickly, if we get it wrong it could have a devastating effect on our democratic process and our procedures, which could seriously disadvantage the interests of voters.</p>

The first action was taken by the Committee on Standards in Public Life and Sir Christopher Kelly, who initiated the report into our expenses and to whom we have entrusted the task of designing an alternative system.

I say that with respect&mdash;we have had a useful process, I do not deny that&mdash;but I still think that that avenue should have been preferred.</p>

	<p pid="b.61.1/1">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that comment.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/2">The central provision in this Bill&mdash;clause 1&mdash;will create what is, in essence, the independent Fees Office that we have been discussing. Conservative Members welcome that, because we support the principle that MPs should no longer determine their own pay and allowances. The public anger to which Members have been exposed originates, in part, from taxpayers' increasing alienation from a political system that is seen to waste money&mdash;that feeling has intensified during the recession. While many people are losing their job and seeing their income reduced, MPs are seen to be being paid in luxuries. We feel that people will never have confidence in Parliament if we continue to vote on our own remuneration.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/3">It is true that in recent months the House has adopted a much more rigorous regime. I chair the Members Estimate Audit Committee, and it is good that significant progress has been made on creating three levels of audit and assurance and on ensuring that all the standards that we set are akin to those of any public body or the most strictly regulated plc. However, as such decisions are still viewed by the public as made by MPs for MPs, we think it better that there should be a dedicated external body to determine our pay and rations.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/4">I should make another point in passing. The House has just elected a new Speaker. All sorts of labels were given to the contest by the press; particular mention was made of the desire to promote a Speaker who would &quot;reform&quot;. If this Bill goes through&mdash;let us leave aside the Speaker's involvement in the selection process for IPSA itself&mdash;the framework of the new body would have a significant bearing on the office of Speaker and his ability to have any say in reforming this side of our parliamentary life. All the arguments about expenses would be removed from his responsibility. Likewise, there are consequential implications for certain Committees of the House, for instance in relation to the function of audit. The Bill might result in my having to relinquish the chairmanship of the Members Estimate Audit Committee and retain only the audit function for the House estimates, which deal with the parliamentary buildings and the wider estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/5">Having established IPSA, the Bill, through clauses 2 to 5, would provide that body with the powers to set our allowances&mdash;with reference to the inquiry by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which I have mentioned&mdash;to administer our allowances and our salaries and to codify and maintain the Register of Members' Interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/6">Clauses 7 to 9 would create a Commissioner for Parliamentary Investigation, who would work with but separately from the authority, to look into alleged misuse of allowances or breaches of the registration of financial interests. The House will be aware that that would create duplication with the work of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards&mdash;currently John Lyon&mdash;so we will need to give detailed examination in Committee as to exactly how to untangle those roles.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.1/7">In just these respects we would like the Bill to go further. The historic response to the continuing controversy about our remuneration has always been safety valve politics; it has always been about letting just a little more air out of the system in order to buy a little more time. However, by fending off a bad headline one day, we have not avoided 10 bad headlines the next. We have delegated both pay recommendations and a review of our pensions to the Senior Salaries Review Body, and the Committee on Standards in Public Life is investigating our expenses. Those are ultimately three elements of the same overall package, and what has been depressing about the past few months has been the lack of public debate about what impact the final package, whatever it might be after those bodies have made their separate reports, will have on the make-up and identity of Parliament. We need someone to piece together all those fragments and draw together all those different threads. Perhaps if we equip IPSA properly and make it capable of taking rigorous intellectual decisions, it might one day be the authority that succeeds in taking a comprehensive, overarching view to determine our entire pay and rations.</p>

	<p pid="b.62.0/1">Perhaps we need to go a couple of steps further and talk to the people whom we represent, identify what they want us to do, and then create a structure of pay, reimbursement and pensions that reflects that.

	<p pid="b.62.1/1">Many hon. Members may think that the hon. Lady has got things the wrong way round. We need a body that can be independent and responsible, which detaches us from any association with determining what we are paid or rewarded. If this is the body that will do it, and it looks as though it will be, the question of who sits on it becomes critical.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/2">The Bill establishes, in schedule 1, an appointments process that is virtually the same as that for choosing the chair of the Electoral Commission. Nobody doubts the integrity of that selection process, or the impartiality of the appointee. Commissioners will be selected by a Speaker's Committee and their appointment will be sealed with the imprimatur and authority of the House. This is a crucial process, and it would be completely unacceptable if members of the new body were, for instance, hand-picked by the Executive. The origin of the problem that we are discussing has been the interference of the Government of the day at all stages of the determination of our pay. Any further interference from, say, the Prime Minister would serve only to compound the problems that we are today trying to address.</p>

In principle, we are today setting up the architecture that would allow what my hon. Friend suggests to happen. I think that in practice the Bill allows for subsequent amendment or revision. I think that we are all thirsting for some kind of total, comprehensive and, dare I use the word, holistic approach to all the various strands that are, at the moment, fragmented.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.0/2">The men and women who become commissioners will need to be distinguished and of unimpeachable character. They will also need to be confident, so I am pleased that the Bill makes it clear that there should be someone on the board of IPSA who has had direct parliamentary experience. That is not because we wish to give ourselves an easier deal; it is to ensure that there is someone on the board who knows and understands what it is to work in this place, who can ground IPSA in the gritty reality of the House of Commons, and who will not be seduced by any of the popular myths about what an MP does or does not do. Equally, the legal complexities of establishing the body call for someone who has reached the highest plains of the legal profession. We suggest that an experienced accountant should be on the board, too.</p>

	<p pid="b.64.7/1">I declare an interest, as my wife is involved.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.65.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1795" speakername="Alan Duncan" colnum="65"  time="017:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0011.htm#09062925000244">
	<p pid="b.65.0/1">Indeed. They were asked to stand down from the investigation. In a way, that is against many of the principles under which Lord Nolan set up the committee in the first place. One of those principles was that, in order properly to decide anything to do with this place, knowledge of it was necessary. Sir Christopher Kelly decided that the parliamentarians should stand down from the inquiry; whether that was right or not is for others to judge.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/2">We do not have a serious problem with the investigative functions of the new body. We have to hope that Sir Christopher Kelly's committee comes up with sensible, simple proposals later this year that will make any new system virtually impossible to manipulate. However, the public's view of politicians is so low at the moment that we must be prepared for what I can only imagine might be rare instances of outright fraud. In doing so, we should ensure that there is a real, and not just a cosmetic, separation of powers between the administrative and investigative competence of IPSA.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/3">Without wishing to cast any aspersions on the staff of the Department of Resources, who do what is at present a very tough job, part of the reason for our current problems has been that the Fees Office was for a long time both the administrator and the adjudicator of allowances. This clearly can no longer continue. If we are to avoid falling foul of any further elephant traps, we will need to look carefully at what the Justice Secretary has called the &quot;firewall&quot; between IPSA's administrative and regulatory functions. I am sure we will examine that in Committee. I refer Members particularly to schedule 1, part 2, paragraph 17.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/4">These parts of the Bill are, we would argue, the least controversial, unless one is opposed to the entire principle of contracting out our pay and allowances, although at present the new body will look only at our allowances. But there are other elements of the Bill that appear to be designed purely to satisfy the prime ministerial press release. One of the reasons we find ourselves in this mess is that we have suffered from the most trivial form of gesture politics. The Government must understand that we will not resolve the problem with yet more gestures. We can get away with some bad legislation, but if we put a foot wrong in this case, we might end up not just with an expensive inconvenience, but with a constitutional nightmare that will haunt us for decades.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/5">Although we remain cautiously relaxed about transferring powers on allowances, we are not so comfortable about the provisions in the Bill that allow IPSA to regulate the system and create new offences for false claims or failing properly to declare financial interests. That view is nothing to do with giving MPs special favours. It is about making sure that in fixing the Commons, we do not unfix the parts that are not broken. The Government must listen, and I hope they will be prepared to accept some amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/6">The House had particular concerns about clause 6, which would have created an obligation on the House to have a statutory code of conduct, or at least by statute it would have required the House to have a code of conduct, which is slightly different. That would have created all sorts of conflicts between us and the courts. We still have concerns about clause 10, which creates a formal provision to allow proceedings to be admissible in court proceedings against an MP, regardless of parliamentary privilege. We will have to examine this in depth in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/7">What is at stake here has been expertly explained by the Clerk of the House in a powerful analysis of those aspects of the Bill that touch on questions of parliamentary privilege and our freedom as Members. That document is already public, and I know that the Clerk will be before the Justice Committee tomorrow night. He had two central concerns&mdash;first, that swathes of the Bill are or would have been justiciable and would set Parliament on a direct collision course with the courts; and secondly, that this could undermine the basic principle of free speech in the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/8">The sovereign independence of Parliament from the judiciary has been one of the fundamental pillars of our constitution for centuries. As the Clerk interprets it, had the Bill gone through unamended, we would have seen an endless merry-go-round of litigation and judicial reviews. We cannot end the culture of blank cheques to MPs, only to open up a culture of blank cheques for lawyers. Members&mdash;we&mdash;are already subject to the law of the land, just like anyone else. We are also already subject to a parliamentary code of conduct, and to the judgment of the electorate.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/9">Inasmuch as IPSA has power over our allowances, we are largely content, but inasmuch as it muddies the water and empowers the courts to intrude on our independence of action, it must be resisted. Even more dangerously, as the Clerk goes on to suggest, the casual disregard for parliamentary privilege in the Bill, particularly in clause 10, could cause permanent damage to parliamentary proceedings. As he says, it could have a</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/10" class="indent">&quot;chilling effect on the freedom of speech of Members, and of witnesses before committees, and would hamper the ability of House officials to give advice to Members&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/11">As has already been said, responding to me at business questions last week, the Leader of the House said:</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/12" class="indent">&quot;He will see from the face of the Bill that the question of parliamentary privilege is not an issue in that Bill, so that is not a question that hon. Members need to concern themselves with.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-06-25.950"><i> Official Report</i>, 25 June 2009; Vol. 494, c. 950</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/13">It is difficult to see on what basis she made such a statement. It is in obvious contradiction to the expert advice from the Clerk. We are glad that clause 6 has been withdrawn, but we are still concerned about other aspects.</p>

	<p pid="b.67.3/1">My hon. Friend has made that point in the House a number of times. The loose use of the phrase &quot;full-time MP&quot; is increasingly vacuous. It does not mean much. The Prime Minister and other Ministers are Members of Parliament, working for their constituencies, and have very busy jobs as Ministers. Members who are paid as Chairmen of Select Committees also have that as an extra job. So the notion that we are either full-time MPs or not requires us to help inform people about how this place works. If ever there was a time when educating people and helping them understand this place were needed, now is such a time.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.3/2">We will have to consider all these issues very soberly over the next few days. One issue that has been discussed and is of great importance is the question why we need to create special new offences for MPs, as in clause 9, for example, for providing &quot;false or misleading&quot; information when making an expense claim. As my hon. and learned Friends the Members for Harborough (Mr. Garnier) and for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve) said earlier, and as was pointed out by a QC in the letters page of <i> The Times</i> last week, such behaviour is already punishable under section 15 or 15A of the Theft Act 1968&mdash;dishonestly obtaining property by deception&mdash;or perhaps under the provisions for false accounting in section 17.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.3/3">There has been a perverse consequence of the Government's attempt to define a special offence for us. I suspect that it was not the Government's intention to limit the maximum sentence for which an MP could be imprisoned to 12 months, rather than the 10-year sentence that can await members of the public found guilty under the Theft Act, but that is how it appeared to the correspondent in <i> The Times</i>. Creating different rules just for Members of Parliament cannot hope to fill the public with confidence in the new system. The Government's unworthy briefing to the press today suggests that they are more interested in propaganda than in a proper Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.3/4">A Second Reading speech is to do with the principle of the Bill. The key principle at stake here is not only the external determination of our allowances, but the relationship between Parliament and the courts. As mentioned before, we had concerns about the obligation to have a statutorily enforced code of conduct; we were perturbed that the justiciability of the code would move our focus away from the legitimate concerns of our constituents towards the vexatious concerns of litigants.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.3/5">These are tough times for Parliament, but they are also times in which the House needs to keep its collective head. We need a simple Bill that deals swiftly and effectively with the problem of our expenses. Let us not try to solve that problem by creating other problems, whose magnitude might dwarf even the hideous situation of the past two months.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to follow the shadow Leader of the House. He reads the same newspapers as I do, and he referred to the letter in <i> The Times </i>last week that noted that under the Theft Act 1968 one receives a 10-year sentence, rather than the one-year term that might be set down in our Bill. The Justice Secretary has pointed out, however, that there will be a new offence and that there is a difference between &quot;knowingly&quot; and &quot;dishonestly&quot;. We lawyers understand perfectly well that there is a difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/2">The shadow Leader of the House also mentioned the Bill's principles, which I fully support and always have supported. I refer simply to something that I learned many years ago from Ernie Marples, a former Conservative Minister for Transport, who said that a time of crisis is a time of opportunity. A crisis has certainly engulfed the House in relation to the public's perception. There is a phenomenon among the public, in that everyone seems to relate to Members' expenses. I have an aunt in Newcastle who is 92 years old, and when her son visits her from Spain she does not ask how he is, how the children are or how the journey was; instead, she says, &quot;I cannot get a communal garden seat, but those MPs...&quot; And so it goes on up and down the land. We created a crisis and the Bill is dealing with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/3">The shadow Leader of the House said that there was a low opinion of politicians; I have to tell him that in 1974 we were behind estate agents in such popularity stakes. We have not moved very far since then, so it is not true that Members have ever been popular in our land. However, we are certainly more unpopular now.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/4">I am glad to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> still in his seat. He, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase>, who made an intervention, and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> were all concerned about salaries and whether they were also part of the Bill. I read a number of briefing notes on the Bill, and I was under the impression that, should the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority ask the Senior Salaries Review Body for a recommendation on salaries after a review, the issue would fall within the same category as expenses and, as the Justice Secretary has said, be laid before the House without a vote. If that is to be the case, it will be the first time since 1971 that MPs' salaries as recommended by the SSRB have been approved. The late Sir Edward Heath did so, but since 1975, when the Leader of the House was Michael Foot, no Prime Minister or Government&mdash;through the Thatcher, Major and Blair years&mdash;have ever accepted a recommendation from the SSRB. That has given us the current disequilibrium between allowances and salaries, so I hope that, in the future, salaries, like allowances, will be covered by IPSA.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> said in her intervention that we should listen to the public. I think that, through this Bill, the Kelly recommendations on MPs' allowances and the four-year review of all our expenses and allowances, which will begin very soon and is being carried out by independent auditors, we are listening to the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/6">I think that it was the shadow Leader of the House who had the good fortune, or the misfortune, to mention <i> The Daily Telegraph</i>, and I repeat what I said at the time: it is a matter of great regret that a CD-ROM was stolen from the House, that it was bought for a tremendous amount of money&mdash;possibly &pound;250,000&mdash;and that it led to the revelations that came to the public's attention. Voltaire once said, however, that out of some ill, some good can come, and the good that has come out of the revelations is the Kelly review, the Bill and our review of four years' expenses and allowances. So, when people ask, &quot;Why the rush with the Bill? Why the haste?&quot;, I answer that the haste is to respond to the public's opinion, which we created. We have created a terrible public opinion of this House, and the House as an institution, as well as its Members, must respond. That is what we are doing today.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/7">Sir Christopher Kelly has been mentioned on a few occasions, and those who have given evidence include <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase>, who gave evidence today, and myself. I gave evidence last week, just before the Bill's First Reading, and I tried to explain to the committee, and I think that it understood, that IPSA is not being set up as another quango. It will separate the work of the Fees Office from Members. I repeat on the Floor of the House what I said to the committee: an incestuous relationship had developed between Members and the Fees Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/8">Many people&mdash;the Justice Secretary, the shadow Leader of the House and my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead&mdash;have said that the Fees Office does a sterling job. No one is criticising members of the Fees Office; we are all responsible, because, over the years, we right hon. and hon. Members have made our claims and they have responded. They tried to help us. When the difficulties arose with the media, Members said, &quot;Well, it was agreed by the Fees Office,&quot; and the Fees Office said, &quot;You are hon. Members,&quot; and the relationship became rather unstable, leading us into our current situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">The hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> referred to the Committee on Standards in Public Life, and to whether the Justice Secretary had referred the Bill to the that committee's chairman. I have to say, again, that the Bill is entirely separate from the work of the Kelly committee. We are still a sovereign Parliament for a sovereign people, and it is up to us in this House to set the framework. Within that framework, the Kelly committee can respond and give us its recommendations, but it is up to this House to approve or not to approve those resolutions. All three main party leaders have said that they will support them when the time comes. We hope and expect them to be appropriate; we expect them to be transparent and to take into account the public interest; and, therefore, we hope that we are in the process of supporting them.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/10">The reason why I think so many of us have given evidence to the committee, notwithstanding the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> made about his wife and two others not being able to sit on it at this time, is that we are there to educate the committee, to tell it about the feelings of the House and of Members and to explain to it the things that we think are significant to this House. It is a two-way process with the Kelly committee, and I had no difficulties with my evidence and the evidence that others in the House gave last week.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/11">The shadow Leader of the House said that if we get the Bill wrong we can always reverse it. The Justice Secretary said that we got the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 wrong&mdash;possibly&mdash;but we have not amended it. This House is sovereign, and if the Bill is not right there will be time to change it; but we have three days for consideration, which is quite a period in which to discuss the Bill not only on Second Reading but in Committee. It is therefore up to this House, as it is doing tonight, to hold the Executive to account&mdash;it is a Government Bill&mdash;and to press, probe and see whether there is a response. Up to now, the Justice Secretary has responded. He has listened carefully to Members, and he is still listening. We are in listening mode.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/12">This is a matter for the House of Commons. This is about how we put to the people of our country a new framework for dealing with our expenses and allowances through an alternative fees office, and to get rid of a cosy, incestuous relationship. We must be careful, however, not to show a kind of parliamentary drag&mdash;some Members still say, &quot;We should be in charge of our salaries, expenses and allowances; we should not give them to a quango.&quot; Those days are over, as any of us who speaks to the public will know. We have ceded our authority on such issues, and we should accept that; I hope that all in the House fully accept it.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1695" name="Peter Tapsell">The hon. Member for Louth and Horncastle (Sir Peter Tapsell)</phrase> referred to the Kelly committee, and I refer to it again now. The Secretary of State went through the various stages of reform that the House has seen over many years. During my years in opposition, the noble Lady Thatcher never reformed the House of Commons. She reformed many things, including the judiciary and the legal profession, but she never touched the House. Now we are reforming the House&mdash;in the interests not of MPs, but of the people of our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/14">The Secretary of State is perfectly right not to extend measures to the House of Lords at this time. Many years ago, Richard Crossman wanted to reform the House of Lords. He saw the then Leader of the Opposition, Edward Heath, and made his reform dependent on reform of the Commons&mdash;but we never got reform of the Commons or the Lords. If we wait for the House of Lords to come on board, we will never get the reform here. It is important that we reform here first; the House of Lords can follow. I am sure that it would wish to, for the sake of its reputation.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/15">I fully support the Bill. I have argued for it; I have argued for the Fees Office to be independent from Members of Parliament. I cast no aspersions over members of the Fees Office and how they work and have helped us over the years, but it is in their and our interests that the separation should take place. I echo the words of the Prime Minister himself. He said that the Bill will end the system of self-regulation and that we would have independent statutory regulation. He went on:</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/16" class="indent">&quot;That will mean the immediate creation of a new Parliamentary Standards Authority, which will have delegated power to regulate the system of allowances. No more can Westminster operate in ways reminiscent of the last century, whereby Members make up the rules and operate them among themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/17" class="indent">The proposed new authority would take over the role of the Fees Office in authorising Members' claims, oversee the new allowance system, following proposals from the Committee on Standards in Public Life, maintain the Register of Members' Interests, and disallow claims, require repayment and apply firm and appropriate sanctions in cases of financial irregularity.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-06-10.796"><i> Official Report</i>, 10 June 2009; Vol. 493, c. 796</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.68.2/18">The Bill is a major step forward in restoring the reputation of the House and in carrying the institution forward. It is the institution that has suffered, although Members of Parliament might be severely damaged in their constituencies. I give the Bill my full support, because I want the reputation of the House to be restored.</p>

	<p pid="b.71.0/1">The Secretary of State started by explaining the absence of the Leader of the House; I should explain that in the normal course of events my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> would speak for my party in this debate. However, he is elsewhere on parliamentary business, so the pleasure falls to me. I hope that Members will accept me, although as an inadequate substitute.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.0/2">The Liberal Democrats welcome the Bill, although with significant qualifications to which I shall turn in a moment. As we debate it, it is important for us to be mindful of its political and public context. As the Secretary of State and others have said, there has been a substantial effort among all the parties to move forward by broad consensus, and that has a lot to recommend it as a modus operandi. The Bill provides for the contracting out of the administrative functions of the Fees Office and the removal of ourselves from the invidious position of being judges of our own cause in respect of pay and allowances. To that extent, it is uncontroversial.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.0/3">Unfortunately, however, there is a great deal more to the Bill than that, and others have already aired their concerns in that regard. I have particular concerns about the timetabling of the Bill. Towards the end of last week, we were favoured with a helpful memorandum from the Clerk of the House, who is to give evidence to the Justice Committee tomorrow. An effort is being made to enable his evidence to be available to Members the following morning. I have heard word that the Joint Committee on Human Rights may have something to say on the Bill in the next day or two. As always, its intervention would be welcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.0/4">Given all that, why is it so urgent to force the Bill through by Wednesday? I do not say that two days are not sufficient, but why do the Committee and other stages have to take place on two consecutive days? There is no reason why we could not deal with them on Monday or other days next week.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.2/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman.

	<p pid="b.72.3/1">From one point of view, that would be an eminently sensible procedure to follow. However, I have to say that my experience of pre-legislative scrutiny is that even when we have it, the Government have a propensity to disregard the whole lot and bring forward a Bill that deals with the press release of the day rather than with the substantial body of work that has already been done. The Leader of the House is particularly culpable in that respect.</p>

In the short time that I had to acquaint myself with the issues, I looked at the report published in 1999 by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, on which he sat. It is a formidable piece of work and its conclusions are exceptionally well argued. However, the report has sat here since 1999 and now, in three days, we have to pass a Bill that deals with substantive issues of privilege. The issues should have been dealt with years ago, as part of a much more measured process.</p>

	<p pid="b.73.3/1">The hon.

	<p pid="b.73.4/1">That is an entirely different point; the hon. Gentleman seeks to conflate two separate issues. I remind him that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1812" name="Nicholas Clegg">the Member for Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Clegg)</phrase> is on record as saying&mdash;he was not greatly supported in many parts of the Chamber&mdash;that the House should sit until all the necessary work had been done. This is a prime example of something that, if necessary, we could have sat through until we got it right.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.4/2">In my intervention on the Secretary of State, I asked him whether he was satisfied that the provisions of the Bill would comply with article 6 of the European convention on human rights, and he replied by reference to the declaration in the Bill concerning compliance with the Human Rights Act 1998. I have no doubt that that was not a difficult declaration for him to make, because of course the Human Rights Act does not apply to Parliament. The fact remains, however, that offences under the Bill and any processes that flow from them would have to comply with article 6 of the convention. That point was dealt with in the report by the Joint Committee in 1999. Paragraph 283, on page 75, refers to the case of Demicola <i> v.</i> Malta, in which the editors of a satirical magazine had been found guilty of contempt of Parliament. It was held by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg that they had not been given a fair process. The Court observed that</p>
	<p pid="b.73.4/3" class="indent">&quot;the person charged with contempt was a non-member&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.73.4/4">of Parliament</p>

	<p pid="b.73.5/1">Although section 6 of the Human Rights Act excludes its operation as regards Parliament, we cannot exclude Strasbourg jurisdiction under article 6 of the convention. It is therefore inevitable that, sooner or later, a Member who is not treated fairly will take their case to Strasbourg. In this respect, we have not brought human rights home for Members of Parliament, although we may have done for the general public.</p>

	<p pid="b.74.0/1">The Committee goes on to make that point at some length in paragraph 284. I would say to the hon. Gentleman and to the Secretary of State that if there is one thing that is more dangerous than this House not acting, it is this House acting in a way that is seen to be deficient and is subsequently open to challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.0/2">The interface that we reach between judicial and parliamentary proceedings is absolutely fascinating, and the Clerk of the House deals with it in his memorandum to Members. Let me draw the House's attention to his observations on clause 10:</p>
	<p pid="b.74.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Clause 10(c) allows any evidence of proceedings in Parliament to be admissible in proceedings for an offence under clause 9. This is a very wide qualification of the principle under Article IX of the Bill of Rights that such evidence is not admitted. It would mean that the words of Members generally, the evidence given by witnesses (including non-Members) before committees and advice given by House officials on questions, amendments and other House business could be admitted as evidence in criminal proceedings. This could have a chilling effect on the freedom of speech of Members and of witnesses before committees and would hamper the ability of House officials to give advice to Members.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.74.0/4">One must therefore imagine that if the procedures that flow from the implementation of offences under clause 9 are to be in accordance with the normal principles of fairness in relation to admissibility of evidence, it will not be the case, for example, that somebody who is being investigated by the parliamentary authorities will be given a caution. Will they be told that they are not required to say anything before they answer questions from the parliamentary authorities?</p>

	<p pid="b.74.3/1">I think it would be helpful to get some clarification from the Liberal Democrats on the issue of offences. This House, with the support of the Liberal Democrats, supported the Scotland Act 1998, from which several of the offences that are now part of the Bill were lifted. Is the hon. Gentleman concerned about their inclusion in relation to the House of Commons, and not the Scottish Parliament, or does he think that they operate in completely different ways?</p>

	<p pid="b.74.4/1">The hon. Gentleman allows me an opportunity to explain. I am not arguing against the offences per se&mdash;offences of this sort may be very necessary&mdash;but their creation has a particular implication for the operation of parliamentary privilege. That comes back to another point made by the Clerk in his memorandum: the 1999 report gave us an opportunity to take a holistic approach to dealing with questions of privilege. The draft Bribery Bill is before the House&mdash;I sit on the Joint Committee that is scrutinising it&mdash;and now we have this Bill. We are taking what the Clerk terms a &quot;piecemeal&quot; approach to privilege, and that is where the danger lies.</p>

	<p pid="b.74.5/1">The hon. Gentleman may agree with me about two things. First, the offence under clause 9(1), which is the general offence of providing information to make a claim that is known to be misleading in a material respect, does not, as far as I am aware&mdash;he may be able to confirm this&mdash;apply in Scotland, where people are subject to the general law, whereas the Bill applies a particular law to this House. Secondly, as regards the prohibition on paid advocacy being turned into an offence, it is a little strange that this is happening just as the Bribery Bill is going through the House, whereby a great deal of attention is being paid to parliamentary privilege and it seems that paid advocacy and bribery are almost synonymous. In those circumstances, why should this particular offence be required without the safeguards that are being debated in respect of the other Bill?</p>

	<p pid="b.75.0/1">With regard to the latter point, yes, what the hon. and learned Gentleman says has an undeniable logic that reinforces the argument about the piecemeal approach to reforming the law of privilege. With regard to his first point, as he says, clause 9(1) does not apply in Scotland. Neither does the Theft Act 1968&mdash;or the Fraud Act 2006; I cannot remember which. In any event, we have a very different body of law. Scots law is a quasi-Roman principle-based system, and we do not concern ourselves with the need for things like theft Acts and fraud Acts. I declare a fascination with that principle, and I commend it to other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.0/2">I have one final concern that I wish to bring to the House's attention, which again relates to the rather piecemeal approach that is being taken. Yet another body is being created that will concern itself with one small area of parliamentary activity. We already have the Standards and Privileges Committee, the House of Commons Commission, the Members Estimate Committee, the Members' Allowances Committee, of which I am a member, the Administration Committee and the Public Administration Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.0/3">As a member of the Members' Allowances Committee, it was apparent to me in the days following the early disclosures of our expenses by <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> that there were already a large number of fishers in a rather small pond. I fear that the creation of IPSA will mean another body fishing in that pond. Perhaps the Secretary of State and the Leader of the House should have considered the existence of all those different bodies, which overlap slightly although they have different jurisdictions, to see whether the time had come to rationalise them and make them more logical and coherent.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.0/4">Today's debate is just the start of our proceedings, and we will have opportunities to speak about some matters in greater depth in the course of the next 48 hours. As far as Second Reading is concerned, should there be a Division my party will do nothing to impede the Bill's further progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.75.1/1">I am pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase>, because if an opportunity arises, I will vote against the measure, and I wish to use this short contribution to explain why.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/2">The Bill fundamentally changes what we mean by representation, and we should move carefully before we change what has been built up over a long period and what the British people generally trust. Of course, there is the question of expenses. There is another side of that tale to be told, but perhaps this is not the place for that. There may be huge demand outside the House for us to deal with that issue as quickly as possible, but despite the hundreds of e-mails and letters that I have had from around the country, nobody has said that we should rush into legislating on it, let alone change our constitution in the fundamental way that I believe the Bill will.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/3">The words of the Justice Secretary that the Government were open and listening would have had more effect in the House if we were not whipped on the Bill. We have to decide on it in a couple of days, and the Government will whip us through the Lobby if they can, to get the desired effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/4">The Bill will make a fundamental change to representation as the British public have seen it in the past. I refer specifically to clause 5(8). I will not be much affected by it, which may make it easier for me to speak about it than it will be for other Members. Twin principles govern our understanding of democracy and freedom in this country: representative government and responsible government. We have a crisis in both parts of that understanding of our constitution, because to gain responsible government we need a party system so that a group of people can be held accountable for the programme that they believe the electorate have given them a mandate to carry through. Yet we live in an age when political parties are dying, and we have not yet come to terms with that when considering what responsible government means.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/5">The concept of representative government means various things, but partly that in some genuine way this House should represent the people whom we are elected to serve, in the sense that we should somehow mirror them. In my 30 years in the House of Commons, the pool from which MPs are drawn has become narrower and narrower. Unlike 50 years ago, we now have no senior trade union figure in the House. We have no senior business figure, no outstanding entrepreneur and no great musician. No one who has played a part in the IT revolution that has shaped our world is represented in the House and part of our affairs. Clause 5(8) will make it even more unlikely that such people will ever seriously consider coming into the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/6">The subsection is not only about listing our outside interests, it is about listing how much time we spend on them. In a moment I shall explain how impossible it will be to enforce that, other than by encouraging Members to be untruthful in the returns that they provide. I shall give a number of examples of the problem. The provision suggests, although of course this is not stated, that all our time is somehow purchased by our being Members of Parliament. It suggests that there is something wrong and unclean about our having outside interests for which we are paid, and that we need to justify that.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.1/7">What sort of world are we creating if it is not thought unnatural for me to go to sleep, play golf or watch a football match&mdash;I do not have to make an entry about that, as it is considered totally proper for a Member to have a rounded view&mdash;but if I earn any money outside the House, not only do I have to declare it, which is quite proper, but I should somehow have an egg timer and calculate how long I spend on each activity?</p>

	<p pid="b.77.1/1">Would the right hon. Gentleman concede that a lot of us spend an enormous amount of time on appointments and engagements with outside charities, for which we are not remunerated? Perhaps we should declare the amount of time that we spend doing that as well.</p>

	<p pid="b.77.2/1">Of course we could put all that into the requirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/2">Clause 5(8) is unfair and unworkable; moreover, it will begin to change the nature of the House of Commons. It comes from the Nolan report, which I know everybody is supposed to bow down to and worship, but I thought it was an appalling report. It misinterpreted what this House is about. It is not about the 19th-century view that we represent purely ourselves. Over the centuries, it has been about representing interests. In one fell swoop, Nolan said that that was wrong, and that somehow the great interests in this country should not be represented here, and that if we started to represent them, we might find ourselves expelled or imprisoned.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/3">My first concern about the clause is therefore that it will change the nature of the House. My second is that it is unworkable. I shall give an example from this morning. A merchant banker, a good guy who has not been disgraced and whose bank has not caused any of the problems that we are in, came in to talk to me about some ideas that he has had. One of his ideas was local communities buying, in a mutual way, their services from public utilities. I immediately realised that that would be relevant to a body on which I sit&mdash;a mutual based in Liverpool, about which I declare an interest and from which I gain remuneration as a non-executive director. I realised that offering such services to our members might infuse new life into the mutuals. We could not only cover health products, but ask whether members wanted to buy gas, water, electricity and other fuel, telephone services and so on through that mutual arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/4">How do I declare what happened this morning? I thought that I, as a Member of Parliament, was meeting somebody who wanted to develop ideas, but, during the conversation, those ideas became relevant to an outside interest for which I am paid. How do I sub-portion the time between listening to that banker and answering his questions, and then seeing the relevance of his points to the mutual associations in this country and my particular interest in that?</p>

	<p pid="b.77.3/1">The Bill is even worse than the right hon. Gentleman suggests. Under the measure, the conversation that he outlined could be used as evidence against him in a court, which could be the result of a litigant&mdash;a private individual from outside the House&mdash;who does not like him perceiving an opportunity to pick on him. That is invidious and restricts freedom of speech in the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.77.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" speakername="Frank Field" colnum="77"  time="018:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0013.htm#09062925000282">
	<p pid="b.77.4/1">That is why I am confessing my bad behaviour to the House. Before reading the Bill, I thought that what I was doing was a noble activity; I believed that one of the reasons for which I was sent here was to think laterally and gain cross-fertilisation of ideas, which would make my role more effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/2">The third reason for my opposition to the Bill is that those who we know have outside interests, who represent the Executive and who are paid handsomely for it, do not have to declare their time. I appreciate that extending patronage has been taken to the absurd conclusion whereby one can be an unpaid Minister, but one also, presumably, spends a great deal of time fulfilling functions. That group, which has helped strangle the House of Commons so that it cannot carry out its historic functions, goes scot-free. They do not have to declare anything about the time that they spend on sometimes making it difficult for us to carry out our functions as representatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/3">There is another reason for opposing clause 5(8), which I believe will distort this place. We had to vote for a collection of ideas&mdash;we could not simply vote on whether to declare our interests, part-time earnings and time. We had to vote for four issues at once. The major one was clearing up abuses, for which one wanted to vote. Many Labour Members wanted to vote for the measure because they deeply resent the large sums of money that some Members may earn from outside interests. The rewards system in our society is deeply offensive to my constituents who work jolly hard, get &pound;11,000 a year, are messed about by tax credits, are brilliantly raising two or three children on that sum and then see the sums that Members, let alone bankers, earn. There was a feeling that we could, to some extent, abate the gross inequalities in the rewards systems by passing the measure. I believe that we should tackle those inequalities through taxation and other methods, not by trying to distort the functions of the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/4">There is one last reason for my opposition to clause 5 as it stands. I will not support it in the Lobby; I hope that I shall have a chance to vote against it. It makes a mockery of what I thought public service was about, and what I have tried to fulfil in my 30 years as a Member of Parliament. Of course, not every minute of my waking day is spent thinking about how I can be effective&mdash;and dare I say more effective?&mdash;in that role, but it is the driving force in my existence. I am now confronted with this wretched little Bill, which provides for my setting egg timers every time I might undertake an activity that is not of primary concern to my essence as a human being. The Bill asks me to spit on a record that I have tried to build over 30 years. It is a disgraceful little measure. While making a mockery of what we believed to be public service, it will&mdash;much more damagingly&mdash;affect the nature of representation in the House. For that reason alone, it should be rejected.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/5">The guts of the measure could deal with the expenses abuse. If that was the Government's main intention, we could have got agreement and passed it today. However, there are other elements in the Bill, which have profound constitutional implications. I do not believe that we should have a set timetable to consider them or that we should be whipped through the Lobby to support the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> made a powerful speech that commanded respect from hon. Members of all parties. He focused specifically on clause 5(8). In one respect, it is innocuous, in that it simply provides that one has to declare a financial interest if one makes a speech&mdash;that has always been the case. However, it is worrying because, in April, the House changed the rules. The problem is not so much the content of the Bill as what we did in April, when we resolved to demand of Members that they register how much time they spend on outside interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/2">At the same time, the Government put a complexion on outside interests, which I regret&mdash;I do not think that it existed previously. They suggested that we should not have outside interests. I agree with the right hon. Gentleman's comments that outside interests can enrich the House and inform debates, and that it is sad that we have begun to follow a path that discourages them. I was heartened by his remarks and I shall join him in the Lobby on the timetabling aspects of the Bill if there is a Division.</p>

	<p pid="b.79.0/1">I hope that I am not pre-empting my right hon. Friend, but does not another aspect of the Bill dovetail with the regulations? The new regulations, which we introduced in April, have blurred the distinction between a gift and a payment in kind. Consequently, the draconian sanctions, which the Bill imposes, that apply to paid advocacy make unclear the point at which an hon. Member should consider that a gift prohibits advocacy thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="b.79.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1579" name="Bernard Jenkin">the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)</phrase> made a similar point in an intervention. My Committee is worried about the matter and I wrote to the Leader of the House at the beginning of the month, asking if she would revisit the new rules on earnings precisely because of that problem. I await a reply. In my view, the new rules are almost unworkable.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/2">The Bill is being rushed through. The cross-party consultations were welcome, and it was a courtesy of the Justice Secretary's to include me in them as Chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee. However, four meetings on Chatham House rules on a fast-moving text is no way to legislate for important changes, some of which go to the heart of how we are governed.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/3">We are told that the Bill responds to public concerns, but there has been minimum public consultation on it. In his statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-19">19 May</phrase>, the then Speaker said:</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The meeting also received a paper from the Prime Minister, which was endorsed by the other party leaders, calling for a fundamental reform of allowances&mdash;moving from self-regulation to regulation by an independent body. The Government will consult widely on this proposal.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-05-19.1422"><i> Official Report, </i>19 May 2009; Vol. 492, c. 1422</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/5">They have not. In her statement the following day, the Leader of the House spoke of</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/6" class="indent">&quot;The proposal on which we seek to consult&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-05-20.1506"><i> Official Report, </i>20 May 2009; Vol. 492, c. 1506</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/7">Following which there have been minimal consultations.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/8">At the end, she said:</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/9" class="indent">&quot;We must now seize the opportunity to promote a debate that will see proposals to change and strengthen our democracy&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-05-20.1506"><i> Official Report</i>, 20 May 2009; Vol. 492, c. 1506</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/10">Quite frankly, there has been no such debate, and the Bill was published but a few days ago. I looked at the Ministry of Justice website, which said:</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The paper that was tabled at the meeting the Speaker held of all party leaders and subsequently debated by Harriet Harman in the House the next day is now available on the Ministry of Justice website. Members of the public are now invited to comment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/12">I wonder whether the Minister who will wind up this debate can tell us what members of the public have said about the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/13">As others have asked, do we know what the views of the Committee on Standards in Public Life are on what is proposed? Presumably not, because it is in the middle of an inquiry into that very subject. The Justice Secretary's rather narrow interpretation of its terms of reference is misguided. Like other hon. Members, I have given evidence to that committee, whose members are interested in much broader issues than the simple mechanics of allowances. They are interested in the whole architecture and in the philosophy and ethics behind the allowances. He was wrong to rule out their commenting on some of the broader issues. It is not inconceivable that the committee could come up with a different solution from the one in the Bill. As the Government have already indicated that they are minded to accept Kelly, we could find ourselves repealing or amending the Bill in the autumn. That seems to be bad government.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/14">All stages in three days is too fast. The view of the Standards and Privileges Committee was that we should have had a draft Bill that went through due process, in order to get it right. Rushing the Bill through this House is an open invitation to the other place to look at it more carefully. I commend to the House the wise words of Peter Riddell in <i> The Times </i>today:</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/15" class="indent">&quot;But, not for the first time, speed is the enemy of adequate scrutiny, risking the type of consequences raised by Mr Jack&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/16">the Clerk of the House. He continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Gordon Brown is determined that this Bill to 'clean up politics root and branch' should become law before Parliament starts its long summer recess in three weeks. It would be far better for Parliament to return for a couple of weeks in September to allow time for proper debate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/18">On that theme, I invite the House to contrast the care with which we assembled part of our regulatory structure with the haste with which it is being dismantled. The appointment of the first Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards followed inquiries by the Nolan committee&mdash;the Committee on Standards in Public Life&mdash;and our Select Committee. We came to a considered view after a rational debate and put in place an investigatory system in 1995 that has been modified from time to time since and has worked quite well. In giving evidence to the Kelly committee earlier this month, Anthony King said as much, pointing out that that part of the system had worked well. The independent investigatory system is not part of the current problem. However, the rush to abolish it and replace it with a new system risks creating new problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/19">The Bill dismembers the existing complaints machinery, transferring its functions relating to allowances and registration to IPSA and the investigator. However, the Bill leaves the rest of the system in a heap here in the House, with no plans for putting it together again. Will the House retain the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to investigate complaints that do not relate to allowances and registration, of which there are some? If not, who will do the work of investigating those complaints and reporting to the Standards and Privileges Committee? Which independent person will keep our code of conduct under review and make recommendations to the House? Or will we keep our Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to investigate complaints that do not relate to finances, but have a new investigator-commissioner to deal with those that do? What do we do about complaints that are a bit of one and a bit of the other? The proposal has not been thought through and has the potential to create an unholy mess.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/20">The Bill has some good points. Giving the Fees Office function to an outside body is welcome. The retention by the House of its powers to apply sanctions against errant Members is important. We could not have a quango suspending or expelling Members who had not committed a criminal offence. However, there are genuine concerns about aspects of the Bill relating to parliamentary privilege. Like my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase>, I do not know how on earth the Leader of the House could assert at business questions last week that</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/21" class="indent">&quot;the question of parliamentary privilege is not an issue in that Bill, so that is not a question that hon. Members need to concern themselves with.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-06-25.950"><i> Official Report</i>, 25 June 2009; Vol. 494, c. 950</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/22">No sooner had she said that than up popped in my inbox five pages of a paper from the Clerk of the House entitled &quot;Privilege Aspects of the Parliamentary Standards Bill&quot;. The title of that paper sat uneasily with the assertion made by the Leader of the House. The Clerk of the House very tactfully says at the beginning:</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/23" class="indent">&quot;I should stress that I make no comment whatever on the merits of the Bill's policy proposals&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/24">However, page three says:</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/25" class="indent">&quot;This could have a chilling effect on the freedom of speech of Members and of witnesses before committees and would hamper the ability of House officials to give advice to Members.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/26">That sounds to me dangerously like a comment on the merits of the Bill's policy proposals, but of course the Clerk would make no such comment.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/27">I welcome what was said about clause 6. I am glad that it is not being pursued, although there are some other aspects of the Bill, particularly in clause 10, where there are still some residual issues. If the Justice Secretary was minded to accept the Clerk of the House's views on clause 6, that prompts the question why he chose to reject them on clause 10.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/28">The Standards and Privileges Committee has been described as a &quot;gentlemen's club&quot;, which is an inaccurate and unfair characterisation. It is indeed a Committee composed entirely of parliamentarians who, at the moment, all happen to be male. However, as I told the Committee on Standards in Public Life in giving evidence this morning, the Committee would welcome the appointment to it of some lay members to correct any misperception that it is a club and to introduce an element of external involvement in its work on standards. I look forward to seeing what the Committee on Standards in Public Life says about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/29">However, there is something close to a gentlemen's club, and its members are Ministers of the Crown. There is no proposal in the Bill from the Government to place the ministerial code of conduct and the investigatory apparatus that goes with it on a statutory footing, unlike what we are doing as far as Members of Parliament are concerned. The Bill therefore creates a new disparity between the status of the two codes. Perhaps the reason is that the combined owner, doorkeeper and bouncer of the ministerial club is the Prime Minister. Anyone can complain to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards about any one of us. If he investigates and there is substance to the complaint, his report will be published. Let us contrast that treatment with the ministerial code. Complaints are pursued only if the Prime Minister so decides, and there is no guarantee that any report will be published.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/30">There are a number of questions that the Bill does not answer or that it does not wholly answer. For example, when do the Government intend to commence the main provisions of the Bill? Will we have an opportunity to debate the relevant commencement orders? Do the Government mean to extend the role of the new commissioner to include investigating complaints that relate to matters other than financial matters, which I have mentioned, and if so, when? Do the Government intend to transfer the other registers to IPSA, and if so, when?</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/31">Do the Government intend to transfer investigations by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards that are already under way to the new commissioner? If so, when will that happen? Will the new commissioner be able to use the work already carried out by the present commissioner or will he have to start investigating those complaints afresh? Finally, what are we going to do with the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, who was appointed for a fixed term only last year? Normally, questions of this kind could be raised in Committee, reflected on and pursued on Report. However, there is no opportunity to do that with this Bill. I therefore hope that the Government can provide some answers up front today.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/32">I do not like this Bill. I do not like the haste with which it is being pursued. I hope that the other place will subject it to proper scrutiny. I am minded not to vote against the Bill on Second Reading, but to vote against it on Third Reading if the objectionable bits are still there, although I am also attracted by the idea of voting against the timetable motion.</p>

	<p pid="b.82.0/1">It is an honour to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Standards and Privileges Committee. I have served on the Committee for eight years, and I am by a long way the longest-serving member on the Government side of the House. I much endorse what he said about the Bill and the questions that he raised. Also, the intervention by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1579" name="Bernard Jenkin">the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)</phrase> on my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> about his self-incriminatory statement to the House, which currently enjoys privilege, but would not do so if the Bill went through, was very telling.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/2">I want to raise issues relating to my role as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, particularly those matters relating to due process. As the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire and others have said, the legislative timetable for the Bill is highly problematic because it makes it virtually impossible for Committees such as the Joint Committee on Human Rights to perform our important role of subjecting Government Bills to careful scrutiny and reporting to Parliament in time to inform the debate. While I understand the political imperative to act swiftly in response to widespread and acute public concern about the present system of allowances and the regulation of standards, public confidence in the institution of Parliament is the lifeblood of our democracy. There is therefore a certain irony that a measure designed to restore public confidence in Parliament is being rushed on to the statute book in a way that makes it impossible for it to receive the proper scrutiny and deliberation that such an important measure deserves by the very institution in which we wish to restore public confidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/3">I shall turn to the issue of due process. A significant human rights question raised by the Bill is whether it provides sufficient safeguards to enable it to be compatible with the right of Members to a fair hearing under long-standing common law principles of natural justice that are now also incorporated and developed in article 6 of the European convention on human rights and in our own law, through the Human Rights Act 1998. It is often erroneously observed that human rights are only about unpopular causes. At present, there is probably no more unpopular a cause than ourselves in this context. Nevertheless, when subject to disciplinary proceedings, hon. Members are entitled to the same protection of due process as anyone else in the outside world.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/4">The explanatory notes to the Bill acknowledge that the provisions might engage the right to a fair hearing under article 6. However, the Government argue that there is no incompatibility with article 6, for two reasons. First, the explanatory notes state that</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/5" class="indent">&quot;there are arguments that the direction or recommendation functions of the IPSA do not involve the determination of civil rights or obligations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/6">Secondly, the notes state that, even if IPSA's functions of giving directions or making recommendations determined a Member's civil rights, so that article 6 applied, there is no incompatibility with the article because there is</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/7" class="indent">&quot;a range of safeguards in place to ensure the fairness of the procedures of the IPSA.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/8">I have carefully considered the Government's analysis of the Bill's compatibility with the right to a fair hearing under article 6, and I have to say that I do not agree with their analysis. However, because of the timetable, I have not had a chance to engage in correspondence with the Government, as I would normally do as Chair of the Joint Select Committee on behalf of my Committee, to discuss the issues and thrash out the arguments in detail. The Government's view that article 6(1) of the convention does not apply to the disciplining of Members is untenable in the light of the very serious consequences that might result for the individual concerned. The available sanctions include expulsion from the House, suspension, the withholding of salary and the ordering of the repayment of money. Any of those sanctions could also have a serious impact on the Member's reputation. That was expressly recognised by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in 1999, when it stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/9" class="indent">&quot;in a particularly serious case a member faces the prospect of suspension and significant financial loss and, which may be more worrying for him, the destruction of his political career.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/10">Indeed, we have seen that happen in recent cases before the Standards and Privileges Committee. The Joint Committee went on:</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Even when a member is not suspended, the electorate may react adversely to his conduct as revealed during investigation of the complaint made against him.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/12">The Committee on Standards in Public Life, in its eighth report in 2002, also recognised the serious consequences for an accused Member.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/13">As Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, it is my view that article 6(1) of the convention applies to the disciplining of Members by the House of Commons. Sometimes the nature of the allegation will be such that its determination amounts to the determination of a criminal charge&mdash;for example, when the complaint is that the Member has acted fraudulently. In such cases, the criminal limb of article 6 will apply, complete with its higher procedural protections.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/14">In other cases in which the allegations are less serious, a Member's civil rights will be determined by the proceedings, particularly in view of the seriousness of the consequences for the Member concerned. Not only will this often have financial consequences for the Member, which in today's Strasbourg case law is often seen as sufficient to qualify as a civil right, but it will always have serious consequences for the Member's reputation and might affect their ability to pursue their livelihood. The Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege pointed out in its reports that several witnesses had drawn its attention to the application of article 6, including Lord Bingham, the then recently retired senior Law Lord who was then Lord Chief Justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/15">The Government argue that, even if the right to a fair hearing as stipulated in article 6 applies&mdash;as I say, it does&mdash;the procedural safeguards in the Bill are sufficient. However, the only procedural safeguard in the Bill is the right of a Member who is the subject of an investigation or complaint to make representations to the commissioner and to IPSA about that investigation or complaint. That falls well short of the set of safeguards that the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege described as the &quot;minimum requirements of fairness&quot;. It also falls well short of what is required by article 6, and of the common law principles of natural justice set out in case law going back over decades.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/16">The Joint Committee concluded, in the light of the seriousness of the consequences for a Member, that it is important that the procedures followed in the investigation and adjudication of complaints should match contemporary standards of fairness. The Committee stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/17" class="indent">&quot;While fairness is fundamental to any disciplinary procedure, the more serious the consequences, the more extensive must be the safeguards...In dealing with specially serious cases, we consider it is essential that committees of both Houses should follow procedures providing safeguards at least as rigorous as those applied in the courts and professional disciplinary bodies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/18">The Committee is trying to create a system that somehow mirrors the way in which outside professional bodies are regulated. We should have the same safeguards and procedures as those that are expected for outside bodies such as the British Medical Association, the Law Society or the Bar Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/19">Those principles are set out in common law, in article 6 and in the Joint Committee's report, which includes reference to a</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/20" class="indent">&quot;prompt and clear statement of the precise allegations against the Member...adequate opportunity to take legal advice and have legal assistance throughout...the opportunity to be heard in person...the opportunity to call relevant witnesses at the relevant time...the opportunity to examine other witnesses...the opportunity to attend meetings at which evidence is given, and to receive transcripts of evidence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/21">None of that is in the Bill as it stands, but it is all required under long-standing principles of our law, as laid down by the courts and, more recently, by article 6. It is required by public bodies generally.</p>

	<p pid="b.85.0/1">I am following carefully the hon. Gentleman's arguments, which seem to be well founded. Does he also agree that another oddity of the enforcement provisions is that there will be a requirement on IPSA to prepare a protocol on how it operates with a number of other bodies, including law enforcement bodies such as the Director of Public Prosecutions? In the absence of that protocol being available for consideration by the House as we are debating this legislation, how can we determine whether it would be compatible with the provisions of article 6? The sanctions could come not only from IPSA but from other bodies as a result of IPSA's inquiry.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.85.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="85"  time="018:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0014.htm#09062932000121">
	<p pid="b.85.1/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman makes an important point, with which I agree. A subordinate point relates to double jeopardy, which is dealt with under the present arrangements by the commissioner suspending his inquiry pending the outcome of police investigations. Indeed, that has happened in relation to the recent allegations. However, there does not appear to be any provision for such suspension in the new system. Without proper scrutiny of the protocol to ensure that investigations would be suspended pending the termination of criminal proceedings, there would be a risk of double jeopardy.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/2">The Joint Committee's report went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/3" class="indent">&quot;In determining a member's guilt or innocence, the criterion applied at all stages should be at least that the allegation is proved on the balance of probabilities. In the case of more serious charges, a higher standard of proof may be appropriate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/4">The standard of proof is not mentioned in the Bill either. That could be contrasted with what happens now in inquiries by the commissioner and by the Standards and Privileges Committee, in which a higher standard of proof is applied as the allegation becomes more serious. That is entirely appropriate. Indeed, the Committee on Standards in Public Life subsequently endorsed the view of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/5">The procedural safeguards in the Bill therefore fall well short of the minimum requirements for fairness identified by the Joint Committee, by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, by article 6 and by the principles of natural justice. They are insufficient to prevent breaches of the right to a fair hearing from occurring in practice. The Government argue that the Bill is compatible with the right to a fair hearing because IPSA is independent. I assume that they are arguing that IPSA itself satisfies the right in article 6(1) of access to an &quot;independent and impartial tribunal&quot; in the determination of civil rights and obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/6">However, IPSA is not capable of constituting the sort of &quot;independent and impartial tribunal&quot; to which an individual Member is entitled under article 6(1). Its functions include devising the rules, designing the procedural safeguards&mdash;which are now at large&mdash;referring for investigation, and various enforcement powers. Such a body is not capable of providing the &quot;independent and impartial tribunal&quot; required by article 6. In his evidence to the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, Lord Bingham, that great jurist, expressed unease about the lack of access to any independent body&mdash;some right of appeal&mdash;regarding disciplinary decisions of the House. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/7" class="indent">&quot;I have an inherent unease at a situation in which anyone can be held to have committed what I think you might call a quasi-criminal offence and perhaps subjected to some penalty where there is no means of challenge at all...in the courts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/8">He went on:</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I am always rather uneasy if any decision by anybody, however wise and authoritative, is final and immune from any challenge...it would be desirable to have a route of challenge available...I would not expect the right to be exercised at all often&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/10">In his written evidence to the Committee, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/11" class="indent">&quot;But I can...see force in the argument that the Houses should not be the sole and final arbiter in such matters. There would be scope for undesirable conflict if those aggrieved could resort to the ordinary courts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/12">He then goes on to make an important recommendation:</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/13" class="indent">&quot;But if an issue arose...the Judicial Committee&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/14">of the Privy Council&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/15" class="indent">&quot;would be a very suitable body to rule. Article 6 of the European Convention might have some bearing here.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/16">Without getting too bogged down in the issue of privilege, a decision of the Standards and Privileges Committee could be subject to appeal to the Privy Council, with the House taking the decision in the last eventuality, as is the case now with recommendations from the Standards and Privileges Committee. An appeal level could be added to the process without compromising privilege too much.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/17">I therefore agree with Lord Bingham's analysis that both the minimum requirements of procedural fairness and article 6 require access to a truly independent and impartial tribunal, with a limited degree of judicial supervision. Lord Bingham suggested that either House would make its own decision in the first instance, and that any party who did not accept that decision would have a right to petition the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council by way of challenge. The right of appeal would be similar to that which already exists against disciplinary decisions of professional bodies such as the General Medical Council, where the right of appeal is to the Privy Council. Why should we be any worse off than a doctor who faces severe disciplinary consequences that could jeopardise his professional future? The Privy Council is expert at ensuring that that right of appeal is only used sparingly, and that is the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/18">Under the law, UK courts have no jurisdiction to entertain complaints of breaches of convention rights by either House or a person exercising functions in connection with proceedings in Parliament. As I said in an intervention, the effect of section 6(3) of the Human Rights Act 1998 is that Parliament is not a public authority for the purposes of domestic claims under that Act. Although proceedings for breach of article 6 are excluded by the Human Rights Act from the jurisdiction of the UK courts, in so far as they relate to Parliament, they remain within the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. If the Bill is enacted in its present form, it is only a matter of time before Strasbourg makes a finding of a violation of a Member's right to a fair hearing under article 6(1).</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/19">I welcome the move from the old system of self-regulation to independent statutory regulation as one that, in principle, is not only likely to enhance public confidence in Parliament, but has the potential to improve the fairness of the treatment of individual Members. However, the Bill as currently drafted is incompatible with the right to a fair hearing under article 6 and at common law as far as the principles of natural justice are concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/20">To render the Bill compatible, it needs to be amended in at least two ways. First, it should at least have inserted into it the minimum requirements of fairness identified by the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in its 1999 report and endorsed by the Committee on Standards in Public Life in 2002. Secondly, the Bill's acceptance of independent regulation should be extended by providing a right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council against decisions of both IPSA and the House&mdash;in my view, the Committee on Standards and Privileges&mdash;that amount to the determination of a criminal charge or of a Member's civil rights. I have tabled two probing new clauses to that effect for the Committee stage, and I look forward to the Government's response. I hope that both will be debated, as it would be a travesty if, under the tight timetable, the guillotine were to prevent discussion of such important principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.1/21">To conclude, although I welcome the principles behind the Bill, there is a lot to be done to ensure that Members are treated fairly under it.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.2/1">I was not criticising the Justice Secretary in any way, but merely drawing to his attention some very important speeches. He heard some of the speech of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>, but he should read all of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/2">Every speech made this afternoon, including the admirable one by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase>, has had one theme: this legislation is being rushed unnecessarily. No one in the House is against the setting up of an independent body to administer our pay, allowances and expenses. There is a difference between allowances and expenses, which has not always come out in recent weeks. I find it slightly strange that Members who very properly&mdash;I stress this&mdash;have claimed the whole allowance for a very large mortgage, have come in for very little criticism, whereas some of those who might not be so well off, and who have claimed for certain items of furniture and perhaps a modest rent, have been crucified. We ought to bear those points in mind, and I hope that Sir Christopher Kelly will do so; a lot rests on him.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/3">We are having this debate because the Prime Minister has panicked over the bad publicity in the past few weeks. He has been responsible for some of that bad publicity. I have been in the House for 39 years, and I have never known a time when morale has been so low, when Members in all parts of the House have been so depressed, and when their families have been so depressed. We owe it to those who sent us here to put our house in order as quickly as we can, as far as pay and allowances are concerned. When two or three Members gather together, the talk is not of recession, Afghanistan, health or education, but of pay, allowances and expenses. We need to get away from that, and to become a Parliament again, in the fullest sense of that word.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/4">I could not help but think of Horace Walpole's diaries of 1759&mdash;the annus mirabilis&mdash;in which he said that every time one went down to breakfast, one had to ask for news of the latest victory; it was a wonderful time of rejoicing. Some years ago, the Queen said that she had had her annus horribilis. We have had ours this year: every time one gets up in the morning, people ask what is in the paper and which colleague has been fingered. We need to move away from that, but not by panicking into bad and unnecessary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/5">I repeat that it is right that we give the responsibility for the financial matters to an outside body. I have always felt that the salary, allowances and expenses for parliamentarians should be fixed at the end of a Parliament for the whole of the next Parliament, perhaps with some index for inflation. No Parliament should then be in the position even of being tempted to adjudicate on its own remuneration. I hope that Sir Christopher Kelly and his committee will come up with a recommendation along those lines.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/6">However, we must concentrate this afternoon on the other clauses of this extremely hastily drafted Bill. It really is monstrous that it should be pushed through with such indecent haste. At the very least, as the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said, we should have had another two days next week. We could quite easily have divided the Bill into two and dealt with its financial provisions this week, allowing for some proper scrutiny, in which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> and the hon. Member for Hendon, as Chairmen of their respective Committees, could have taken part, and in which the privileges report&mdash;extensively quoted from earlier&mdash;could have been studied by Members. We could then have come back in the autumn&mdash;in September if the Government preferred, or in October&mdash;and dealt with the other aspects of the Bill if, by that time, we felt that a Bill of that sort were necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/7">At the heart of this debate is the very purpose of Parliament and the function of Members of Parliament. We are sent here by our constituents, and in the immortal words of Burke, we owe them not just our industry but our judgment. When we have fulfilled the term of the Parliament, it is up to them to decide whether they wish us to return. The privilege that we enjoy is not a personal privilege that belongs to me as the Member for South Staffordshire or to my right hon. Friend as the Member for North-West Hampshire; it is the privilege of the electors of North-West Hampshire and of South Staffordshire that enables us to speak without fear or favour in this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.2/8">All that is at risk because of this Bill. I have never known a time when the Clerk of the House thought it proper to send round the sort of letter that we received at the end of last week.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.3/1">I am starting to run out of time, so I simply respond by saying that that does not invalidate the proposition that I have made. It is all germane to this Bill and we should have a chance to reflect on what the Clerk says. However the Clerk produced this paper, I have never before seen anything like it circulated so widely beyond the Committee that commissioned or asked for it, and it makes some extraordinarily important points.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/2">Thank goodness the Secretary of State has at least listened to the Clerk's strictures on clause 6; we are grateful for that. Clause 8 is also significant, and the Clerk states that</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/3" class="indent">&quot;if the Committee declined to act on a recommendation, that could presumably become the basis of legal proceedings in which the Commissioner (or anyone else) sought to require the Committee to comply.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/4">That section is important, and my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire has already quoted what the Clerk said about clause 10:</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/5" class="indent">&quot;This could have a chilling effect on the freedom of speech of Members and of witnesses before committees and would hamper the ability of House officials to give advice to Members.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/6">I have already referred to the Clerk's comments on our Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which have not been tagged for this afternoon's debate but, frankly, should have been because they are highly relevant.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/7">I end where I was not going to end, but I am tempted to do so by the perceptive, thoughtful and, frankly, very compelling speech of the right hon. Member for Birkenhead, who talked about the implications of clause 5(8), which deals with outside interests. Those of us who have some outside interests have been put in a position recently whereby we are almost ashamed to talk of them. Well, I am not. I think it important that one should sometimes share these things with colleagues in the House, and I am tempted to do so by the frank way&mdash;no pun intended&mdash;in which the right hon. Member for Birkenhead shared his experiences.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/8">For many years, I have been involved in helping to run an annual reward for responsible capitalism. It must be thought to be a good thing, as the first award was presented by the current Prime Minister when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Two years ago, it was presented by the present Chancellor and last year by the Foreign Secretary. It is a highly respectable and, I think, a good thing; the chairman of our judges is the former Lord Chief Justice, who succeeded the late great Lord Dahrendorf, who sadly died just a couple of weeks ago. I believe that this is immensely worthwhile and I think it good that Members of Parliament should be involved in it. I am proud to be involved with it. Where does my parliamentary interest begin and end? It is very similar to what the right hon. Member for Birkenhead said about his egg timer in his conversation this morning.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/9">It would be very sad indeed if the regulations that we pass and are supervised by this new body were so interpreted and applied that Parliament became an assembly of nerds, anoraks and the very rich. That would be an extremely bad development for Parliament. It is important that we have people who have interests outside&mdash;relevant interests, interests that help to inform their contributions to debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/10">We are all answerable to our constituents for the time we spend on our parliamentary work and in our constituency. I do not think anyone would ever suggest that I was less than a &quot;full-time Member of Parliament&quot; or a &quot;full-time constituency Member&quot;, and yet I find a little time to do other things, and I believe that it helps me&mdash;and, I hope, indirectly&mdash;helps my constituents and the House. It is most important that we recognise this and that any body set up to look after our interests recognises it, too. I hope that the Kelly committee will recognise it.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/11">Above all, I hope that the Government&mdash;or, if not this Government, a future Government&mdash;will put aside the oppressive parts of the Bill before us today. To have parliamentarians in a free country answerable in any way to an appointed quango is to diminish Parliament and to diminish those who sit in Parliament and to deter people from coming into Parliament in the future. What we want is an institution that truly attracts the best, and not just the best from the young but from those of all ages. A parliamentary intake that includes men and women in their 50s and 60s, as did the 1970 intake when I first entered Parliament, is all the better for that. It should not be composed only of those who come here motivated by the ambition to carry a Dispatch Box and be driven in a ministerial car&mdash;it is good that some should do so&mdash;as there is no higher calling than representing a part of the United Kingdom in this place. I fear that the Bill militates against that.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.3/12">I thus beg the Secretary of State and Lord High Chancellor&mdash;both of them!&mdash;to recognise what has reasonably been said about the amount of time that Ministers have to spend, quite properly, on their duties, but to concentrate too on the financial part of the Bill and have it ready for Kelly so that his committee can indeed supervise and implement. Most of all, however, I beg the right hon. Gentleman to shy away from the establishment of an organisation that can in any way seek to dictate either directly or indirectly to the elected representatives of the people of the United Kingdom in Parliament assembled.</p>

	<p pid="b.91.2/1">It is a privilege to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase>, who is the only man in the House who pronounces &quot;Parliament&quot; properly. I am still learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.2/2">I want to make some general points about the establishment of an Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. They will be much wider than the points that have already been made today, although those were extremely important. Like others, I am concerned about the fact that the Bill is being rushed through in this way. Given that it is being dealt with in a mere three days and that we were told only last week that it was to be debated, I do not think we are being given enough time to debate a measure with such potentially far-reaching consequences not just for the House but for those outside.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.2/3">Understandably, we all feel that we must act decisively to deal with what has been revealed about our discredited expenses system. An absolute scandal has been caused by the way in which we make our claims and the way in which they are agreed, and we all understand the public outrage that that has prompted when we go back to our constituencies and talk to people about it. What angers them so much is that we make rules by which they must abide and then seem to make separate rules for ourselves, and what worries me about the Bill is that we seem again to be making rules for ourselves that are different from the rules that we require our constituents to observe. They used to be more lax, but now they are much more severe. We should not make rules that are different from those applied outside the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.2/4">What got us into this mess in the first place was our failure to recognise that, as many other Members have pointed out, what we do here is about representation. Much of the expenses scandal has concerned the way in which we represent people. Like a number of other Members, I have taken the opportunity to talk to people about what we do on their behalf, and I have been staggered by how little they know about it. It has been good to go out and discuss that, but it is clear that we have not been good enough at doing it. Unless people know what we do here in their name, how on earth can they understand the basic facts that we need second homes, that we need to furnish them, and that we need travel expenses?</p>
	<p pid="b.91.2/5">When I intervened on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1795" name="Alan Duncan">the hon. Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan)</phrase>, I was trying to make the point&mdash;I do not think I made it very clearly&mdash;that if people really do not understand what we do here on their behalf and find it hard to comprehend how they influence the decisions that we make, we are putting the cart before the horse if we discuss tweaking the expenses system, how we are paid, who pays us and how much we are paid. If Parliament is about anything, it is about our representing people in constituencies in the United Kingdom. We should be talking to them about what we do, but we should also be hearing from them what they want us to do. Until we know what sort of Parliament the people out there want this to be, it will be much more difficult for us to create an appropriate system of remuneration and reimbursement. We have had any number of opportunities to go out and talk to people, but we have failed at every turn.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.0/1">The hon. Lady attaches great value to giving the public an opportunity to talk to us and learn about what we do. Will she explain to whom the new authority will be accountable? It is being vested with a vast panoply of powers, and will handle huge sums of public money. If a member of the public is not confident that the money is being handled competently, or even thinks that the chairman of the authority is being rather lavish in his expenses claims, to whom will that person be able to make a complaint? It seems to me that we are replacing a very imperfect system of representative democracy with a system that will be accountable to nothing and no one.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.92.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" speakername="Natascha Engel" colnum="92"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0015.htm#09062932000133">
	<p pid="b.92.1/1">That is at the heart of what I was going to say. There is currently a very good and direct link between the people whom we represent, their Members of Parliament, and the system under which we exist. The people still have a direct say, and the ability to vote us in or out every four or five years. Setting up what is effectively a quango will remove that next step of accountability.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/2">I think that all Members would agree that the administration of our expenses and our pay should be put into independent hands. I have no problem with that. However, it is vital to establish the way in which such a body would be independent, to whom it would be accountable, how it would be paid, and how it would claim its own expenses. I am happy to discuss those questions, but we should not go much further at this stage, especially in a climate in which everything that we do to try to improve the position will be scrutinised in far more detail than before. Nevertheless, I entirely agree with what the hon. Gentleman has said.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/3">In focusing on the establishment of a new body, we seem to be overlooking the bodies that already exist. For instance, we have any number of committees. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> gave a long list of committees, along with their different functions. He also mentioned the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. There is clearly a conflict between the present roles of those committees and the roles that they will have following the establishment of the Parliamentary Standards Authority, and that worries me very much.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/4">There is, I think, a level of complexity and detail that is not entirely necessary. Last week, when we had another opportunity to make things a bit better, the Fees Office published massively blacked-out receipts and claim forms. That did not just make us look ridiculous; it was another smack in the face for people outside. One of the things that we could do today is decide that addresses could be exposed. We could regain overnight people's trust in what we do and the way in which we make claims by revealing the houses where we claim and where things are delivered.</p>

	<p pid="b.93.0/1">The hon. Lady may not recall that the present position is a result of a statutory instrument laid on the very last day before the summer recess by the Justice Secretary&mdash;interpreting, theoretically, a motion passed by the House, but bearing very little relation to the substance of that motion.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.93.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" speakername="Natascha Engel" colnum="93"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0015.htm#09062932000135">
	<p pid="b.93.1/1">I was making a point of principle. I think that everyone agrees that, today and this week, we are trying to address public outrage at a discredited and abused expenses regime, but I also think that there are better ways of doing that than adding another layer of complexity to what is already a very complex system.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.1/2">One of the most popular words that we have used in recent weeks is transparency, but complexity and a lack of clarity lead to a lack of transparency. We should have another look at what all the different committees do and what the commissioner does. We have undoubtedly got a problem. Despite all the committees we have, we have not prevented the abuse of the expenses system. Therefore, although we obviously must do something, we must also be much clearer about what we want at the end of it, rather than just tinkering about with what we have and creating new levels of complexity. It would help if we were clear about what we wanted, and then proceeded from there. We want a much clearer and simpler, and thereby a much more transparent, system. As a part of that transparency, we should agree to get rid of the blacking-out of addresses. I hope that that answers the question of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1370" name="Richard Shepherd">the hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr. Shepherd)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.1/3">The people who have elected us do not merely want us to stand up for their beliefs. Although I may hold different views from those of some of my constituents, many of them want me to represent my views here in Parliament. What they fundamentally want from every Member of Parliament, however, is for us to be honest. That goes back to the point about our creating an extra level of complexity. We must not fudge the fact that what people really want is for us just to be honest. We must do what they want in that regard by, for example, publishing as much as we can. Regardless of what the law may be, we can choose to publish all the addresses that we want. That must be done collectively, however.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.1/4">Another point that Members have made today bothers me. We only recently decided that the review of MPs' expenses should be handed to Sir Christopher Kelly and the Committee on Standards in Public Life. We have heard today from any number of Members who gave evidence to that committee this afternoon, yet here we are trying to legislate on a Bill that will have consequences for the outcome of that committee. That worries me. I also made a submission to the committee. It prevents the committee from being as considered and thoughtful as it would like to be if we are either pre-empting its outcome or saying to it, &quot;Whatever you do, we have already legislated for this. Therefore, whatever comes out of your review could be in some way restricted.&quot; I think that that is wrong, and I wish that we had allowed the Kelly committee to report before we had moved on to consider this Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.94.0/1">May I reassure my hon. Friend on this? We have worked out the structure of this authority in such a way as to fit in with the recommendations of Sir Christopher Kelly's committee, which will come to this House first. The Bill deals with structure, administration and adjudication in respect of the allowances system, and Sir Christopher's committee is principally concerned with the content of those allowances. There is no reason, particularly given the timing, why those two should conflict. We have got to do this now for reasons that I think my hon. Friend understands.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.94.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" speakername="Natascha Engel" colnum="94"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0015.htm#09062932000137">
	<p pid="b.94.1/1">I do not entirely agree with that. The motivation behind introducing the Bill is to address the problems that have been very well documented and to say to the people outside this Chamber, &quot;We understand and agree with your outrage, and we are doing something about it.&quot; On the timing, I do not think hat there is any mad rush. We do not need to have something on the statute book within a week. We want to take responsibility and accept the consequences of what we have done, but agree that we need to sort this out for the next generation. Regardless of whether they have made a claim, every incumbent MP is tainted by this expenses scandal. We need to make sure that, as far as possible, the next Parliament can start afresh.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.1/2">Democracy is a messy business and Parliament is messy, and there is no system that is not open to abuse in some way&mdash;and there are some very creative people in Parliament. However, we need to accept collective responsibility for what we have done, and say to the next generation, &quot;The systems that put the checks and balances on Parliament are as good as we can make them.&quot; Therefore, I do not think there is any mad hurry, and that instead we need to do things in sequence.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.1/3">The Sir Christopher Kelly committee should be given the time to interview as many people and to take as many submissions as it wants, and to go out and talk to members of the public and ask them what they want, and take some submissions from them. I do not know how many members of the public made a submission to the Kelly committee, but I would like to know. I suspect that a lot of parliamentarians made submissions to it, however. All of this is about saying, &quot;This is the sequence in which we are doing this job. This is the right way to do it.&quot; We should not push forward in an unseemly hurry just to make it look like we are doing something. We have done that time and again before, and every single time we have really messed it up.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.94.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" speakername="Alan Beith" colnum="94"  time="019:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0016.htm#09062932000138">
	<p pid="b.94.2/1">My intervention in this debate as Chairman of the Justice Committee follows contributions from the Chairmen of the Standards and Privileges Committee and the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and all three Committees have serious concerns about aspects of this Bill. If that, combined with speeches such as that which we have just heard, does not make the Government realise that they have got to rethink substantial parts of it and step back from this great rush, I do not know what will.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.2/2">It was the Justice Committee that sought the memorandum from the Clerk of the House that has been at the centre of the debate, and we will take evidence from him and others tomorrow at 5 o'clock. As the Lord Chancellor has pointed out, the programme motion defers some of the relevant clauses until Wednesday and we intend to see that Tuesday's oral evidence is printed overnight so that it will be in the hands of Members on Wednesday, but that is still not a satisfactory way of dealing with a matter of this kind.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.2/3">I welcome the transfer of responsibilities for allowances and pay effectively to what is at this stage a combination of this new body, the Senior Salaries Review Body and the Committee on Standards in Public Life. We need to put that work outside Parliament&mdash;to contract it to somebody else&mdash;as it should not be done by us. The new body needs to be a more effective paying and withholding body for pay and allowances. I say &quot;withholding&quot; because I do not regard the refusal to pay an allowance as a disciplinary measure. I think that is the proper application of a scheme of allowances and expenses. The role I see for the body set up under the Bill is to operate the scheme, to pay allowances when it considers they have been appropriately claimed within the rules and not to do so otherwise, and to be in a position to be entirely firm about how it handles such matters, which has not always seemed possible for the Fees Office in the past, and has led to this very unsatisfactory situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.2/4">Protection, however, needs to remain around the rights of Parliament. That protection is underpinned in one respect in the Bill by the recognition that Parliament should take any disciplinary processes that arise from things going wrong in the system once the existence of a possible disciplinary offence has been identified. I am glad that principle is recognised, as it is a very important one, but that does not solve the problems. The inclusion of new criminal offences has raised the problem of double jeopardy, which needs to be considered seriously, and several aspects of the drafting impinge on rights in the European convention on human rights, as the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights has explained. Several clauses appear to infringe the principle that Parliament and the courts do not call into question each other's decisions, as stated in article 9 of the Bill of Rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.94.2/5">I want to turn to the constitutional areas that the Clerk identified in his evidence to us. Happily, I can dispense with what I was going to say about clause 6 because of the Government's welcome decision not to proceed with it. Clause 7 raises questions, however. As the Clerk says, for example:</p>
	<p pid="b.94.2/6" class="indent">&quot;If the House were to punish for a failure in respect of a requirement which was found by a court to have been unreasonable&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.94.2/7">a Member might have taken the matter to court, the court might have found the initial reference to be unreasonable and Parliament might have then taken action on it&mdash;we would be a short step from</p>
	<p pid="b.94.2/8" class="indent">&quot;review by the court of the exercise of disciplinary powers by the House.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.94.2/9">Even clause 7 presents a problem.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.95.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" speakername="Dominic Grieve" colnum="95"  time="019:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0016.htm#09062932000139">
	<p pid="b.95.0/1">I agree with the right hon. Gentleman's analysis. Is there not another problem? There has been some discussion about the existing powers of the House to discipline its Members. Of course, they are outside the European convention on human rights, but they are also quite rough and ready. I suppose the extreme sanction is expulsion, and there is an acceptance that it is then a matter for the electorate to decide what it will do. However, we are creating through the Bill an entire architecture of punitive measures, all statutorily vaguely defined, that might impinge on a person's reputation in a way that parliamentary sanctions never would have in the past.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.96.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" speakername="Alan Beith" colnum="96"  time="019:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0016.htm#09062932000140">
	<p pid="b.96.0/1">Yes. To some extent, the reputational damage is inevitable, because of the nature of the issues and the way in which they have been highlighted in the press. To some extent, that might seem to be justified, but it means that we have to pay rather more attention than we have hitherto to the human rights dimensions and the need for due process, for example. I shall come on to another aspect of that before I conclude, but I also want to mention clause 8 and the enforcement powers, with which I do not think we should be proceeding at this stage. I believe that, as the Clerk makes clear, they give rise to considerable concern. He says:</p>
	<p pid="b.96.0/2" class="indent">&quot;Clause 8(5) appears to make the exercise by the House of its disciplinary powers a matter of statute, since it seems to confer a statutory permission on the House to exercise those powers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.0/3">That might&mdash;and probably will&mdash;then make them open to challenge before the courts. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> mentioned earlier, the whole protocol business, with a list of bodies that, as far as I can see, is unlikely to be the permanent list because of the changes that keep taking place in the structure of government and the criminal justice system, is a puzzling element and one that could further draw us into proceedings in the courts, with potential for litigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.0/4">I suppose I must concentrate on clause 10 because, after clause 6, that is the area that gives rise to the greatest constitutional concern. Clause 10(c) leaves us in no doubt that it is a head-on attack on the Bill of Rights. It directly quotes the Bill of Rights in order to define the area with which it is dealing:</p>
	<p pid="b.96.0/5" class="indent">&quot;No enactment or rule of law which prevents proceedings in Parliament being impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament is to prevent...any evidence from being admissible in proceedings against a member of the House of Commons for an offence under section 9.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.96.0/6">In other words, notwithstanding the Bill of Rights, things will now be different. That is such a fundamental assault on a long-standing and accepted principle that I do not think that we should be rushing it through in three days of proceedings, especially when it is not necessary to do so in order to set up a body that can administer pay and allowances. If there is a rush, that is probably what the rush is for&mdash;to be seen to be setting up that body and, indeed, enabling it to start work and to be in a position to implement the detailed Kelly proposals. I can see that there is a case for trying to get that body set up during the forthcoming parliamentary recess, but none of that requires some of the other features that have been so rightly criticised in the Clerk's analysis.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.0/7">In his reference to clause 10, the Clerk points out the difficulty that is</p>
	<p pid="b.96.0/8" class="indent">&quot;caused by admitting evidence of proceedings in Parliament&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.0/9">Either one does so in a narrow way, in which case one creates an injustice under the ECHR, creating a situation in which evidence drawn from proceedings in the House can be used against the Member but not material that might be exculpatory to the Member, or one does so in a wide way, in which case one imperils free speech, people's ability to give free evidence before Committees and all the other things that such procedures are designed to protect. We ought not to be proceeding with clause 10. Of course, we ought to be proceeding, as the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges said some time ago, with a privileges Act to ensure that we have a proper range of protection that can cater for some of the things that have now arisen.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.0/10">It is abundantly clear from today's debate that there is so much unease about those features of the Bill that we should not proceed with them in that way.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.1/1">The unease among the general public is more than unease&mdash;it is anger, and a very real anger. It is not successfully addressed if what we do in the end is to create a process that undermines the rights of the public in other ways in the future without addressing that grievance. Rushing into legislation that would have the effects that I described earlier does not deal with the public anger. The setting up of an independent body to determine what pay and allowances we should receive and to police the paying of them and the claiming of them goes some way to addressing that anger, and I welcome that. The House must ensure that it deals appropriately and effectively with those who break its rules, but it should not in the process take away the rights of our constituents. If it is going even to contemplate doing so, it should give the matter serious consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/2">At the end of the day, there is what I like to think of as a sort of Bradlaugh principle at stake here. The ultimate judge must be the electorate. Bradlaugh found that his colleagues in Parliament repeatedly refused to accept his insistence that a rule of the House was an unfair constraint on him&mdash;in his case, the rule requiring him to swear an oath that he as an atheist did not believe it right to swear. If a Member, like him, found that his colleagues in the House were unwilling to accept him as a Member on those terms, ultimately it would be the electorate who must be allowed to judge and to insist on sending him back to Parliament, saying, &quot;We wish this man to represent us, notwithstanding the fact that he appears to have broken a rule that others find important.&quot; That is a pretty fundamental principle. Of course, it is not an easy principle even for the Member affected, who might have to fight or even finance an election without the support of his political party, under procedures that we have seen operating in recent weeks in this House. However, it is the ultimate protection and the ultimate principle.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/3">Before we get to that point, there must be proper due process as far as any person&mdash;in this case, a Member of the House of Commons who is accused of behaving improperly&mdash;is concerned. The processes that we create should not also, in themselves, take away protections that are designed to ensure that people can give evidence to Committees of this House without fear of a penalty for doing so and without fear that the evidence they give can be adduced in court in circumstances that they did not envisage.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/4">The Government have been presented with a very strong case today. First, they should get ahead with the creation of a body that can administer pay and allowances and, secondly, they should not rush into things that would undermine some of the most basic freedoms, which go back to the Bill of Rights.</p>

Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>. It seems to me that everybody&mdash;apart from those on the Front Bench&mdash;is unanimous in their opinion. That does not happen very often, but it seems to be the case today. I would hope that the Secretary of State will appreciate that that is not because of any politicking, but because we are all concerned about the purports of the Bill. We are concerned about the way in which it is phrased and about various sections of it. We have heard from the Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Chair of the Select Committee on Justice and so on. We have heard from the Clerk of the House. Voluminous objections have been raised about the Bill. That must count for something, otherwise what are we doing in Parliament? What is the point of our existence in this place if those fundamental points, which we have driven home time and time again in this important debate, are not adhered to?</p>
	<p pid="b.98.0/2">Why is there such haste to deal with the issue? I shall tell the House why. It is a political imperative. On the day that the former Speaker announced that he was standing down, party leaders were invited to meet him in his chambers. The Prime Minister left that meeting with one thought in his mind, and one thought alone, which was to introduce some kind of statutory code of conduct overseen by an external body. When I say &quot;conduct&quot; I am talking about not only financial matters but everything in this regard. That was his thought for the day, he held a press conference accordingly and that was that. I suspect that that is why clause 6, which seemed to be a declaratory clause, was included; I think it was in the Bill to appease the Prime Minister. Thankfully, it has now gone, but some parts of the Bill are still objectionable.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.0/3">My next point relates to the Register of Members' Interests, the proposals on which result from a political imperative on the part of Labour Members who believe that there is some political advantage in introducing those proposals because, by and large, Opposition Members have more interests than they do. They believe that if they work things carefully and put out the idea that people with outside interests are not doing the job of an MP properly, they can gain electoral advantage too. Let us not beat about the bush, because we know why these things are being introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.0/4">We always say that we legislate in haste and repent at leisure, and the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 has been mentioned&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.98.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman, who is smiling, says that it is still on the statute book. I could also cite the Theft Act 1968, which omitted to repeal a provision in Wales whereby a person could be hanged for stealing a sheep. That is still law, but it is not good law.

	<p pid="b.99.1/1">It is not my best point. I say to the right hon. Gentleman that I know many police officers who would not dream of referring to the 1991 Act because it is impossible to do anything with it. We know that Ministers are saying, &quot;We must do something, because the public are furious&quot;. The public are rightly furious, but they will be even more furious if we make a mess of this legislation, by trampling over the Bill of Rights and so on. The other example that one thinks of is the firearms legislation made following the awful incident that took place in Dunblane. Whereas the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 is unenforceable, that firearms legislation made no difference, aside from the fact that it made life difficult for legitimate gun clubs.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/2">I gave evidence today to the Kelly committee, which was interested in the haste with which this Bill was being introduced. Not only is the rate of progress an affront to the committee, but it might impinge on the work that it is trying to do. I do not propose to deal with my next point at length but, as has been mentioned, the Bill is, when all is said and done, a constitutional one. Such a Bill should never be the subject of emergency legislation&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.99.3/1">As the hon. Gentleman says, neither should it be subject to a guillotine. We should have plenty of opportunity to examine matters on a proper pre-legislative basis and all the people I mentioned in an earlier intervention&mdash;the experts in constitutional law, the Clerk and so on&mdash;should be able to give evidence, because these are very important matters. I think we all agree that the current position is not sustainable and that it is probably right to farm out responsibility for allowances and salaries far out of the way of this House. I have never voted on a salary increase, because I did not think it right that I should do so. I believe I was offered the opportunity to vote on this issue once, in the 1992 Parliament, but I declined to take it because I did not think it was right to do so. I am happy for all that to be farmed out, but to confuse that with responsibility for conduct at large is dangerous and we should heed what the Clerk has had to say about that and, in particular, about clause 10.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/2">The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority will be the body to oversee conduct on allowances and so on. As a member of the Standards and Privileges Committee, I have known many instances when there has been not only a finding against a Member, but an apportioning of blame against the Department of Resources. In such circumstances, the new body would be judge and jury in its own court, so would it feel free to criticise its own department? I rather doubt that it would, so a conflict will obviously arise out of that arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/3">The statutory basis for the code of conduct&mdash;the declaratory clause that I mentioned&mdash;has now gone, but many concerns remain, such as the point about privileges, article 9 of the Bill of Rights and clause 10. The clause is very worrying and it has been extensively commented upon in today's press and again this evening. The protection of privilege is a vital tool for everyone in Parliament, because it ensures that free speech is available to us all. We politicians refer ad nauseam to the fact that free speech is the beacon of democracy, but that is because it is and must remain so.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/4">On a more mundane level, we all encounter cases where a company tramples on an individual's rights and acts badly towards that individual, but they have no money to take action against the company. Bringing such matters to this Chamber under privilege, albeit on a limited number of occasions, is useful and may well redress the balance, and that is very important. We know that there is an issue to address in respect of witnesses giving evidence. If they are not covered by privilege, I do not know whether they will be completely candid; the proposal in the Bill could mean that the Committee system in this place would fall into disrepute. We begin to erode the principle of privilege at our peril. We do not lightly refer to the Bill of Rights and we do not make reference to it in every debate in this place, but it is of vital constitutional importance that privilege is retained.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/5">It is unusual for the Clerk to express his views on things of this kind in the manner that he has today. I believe that he did so because of the vital importance of this matter and that he was right to do so, because we need his expertise in this regard. He makes the point by saying the following:</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/6" class="indent">&quot;I should stress that I make no comment whatever on the merits of the Bill's policy proposals; it would be improper for me to do so. My concern is only with the constitutional implications for Parliamentary privilege (including the right of free speech) and the extent to which the courts are likely to come into conflict with Parliament thereby.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/7">He goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/8" class="indent">&quot;It would mean that the words of Members generally, the evidence given by witnesses (including non-Members) before committees and advice given by House officials on questions, amendments and other House business could be admitted as evidence in criminal proceedings. This could have a chilling effect on the freedom of speech of Members and of witnesses before committees&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/9">Free speech in Parliament is essential if abuses are to be examined, including the abuses of Parliament itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.3/10">This debate has been a good one and very serious points have been made. I have not seen such unanimity across political parties as on this issue. I took part in the pseudo-pre-legislative scrutiny part of the Bill and, with great respect to the Justice Secretary, I must tell him that he shifted position many times on many amendments. He accepted many amendments and was reasonable throughout that particular part of the Committee stage, but that just makes that point that this has been a bad Bill from the very beginning. The fact that although it has been amended on several occasions by several Members around that table, it is still in its current condition now makes the point. I have no criticism to make of the right hon. Gentleman, or of his colleague, the Leader of the House, because they were doing their job, but this Bill was rotten from the beginning and it remains rotten now&mdash;it is a dangerous Bill too.</p>

	<p pid="b.100.0/1">I very much agree with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> had to say, in particular his concluding point about the remarkable series of cross-party alliances that we have discovered during this brief debate. If parliamentary debate is to mean anything, this must cause the Government to pause and to take this Bill away and think again. If they must legislate quickly, they should confine any legislation to the issue of allowances and possibly the issue of pay, leaving the complex constitutional matters for further and mature deliberation.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/2">This is indisputably a constitutional Bill, and the Justice Secretary described it as such early in his remarks, but he also described it as an emergency Bill. That should be a contradiction in terms. The British constitution is highly complex. It is partly written and partly unwritten, and it contains complex links between its various parts&mdash;the judiciary, the Government and the House. I recall going around a historic house that had a wonderful silver set laid out in one of the rooms. In order to examine more carefully&mdash;or possibly &quot;borrow&quot;&mdash;one of the silver forks, a member of the public pulled it towards him. What he did not realise was that an invisible thread linked all the items and they all started to move towards him. He desisted very quickly, and the Government should do likewise. Tampering with the bits of the British constitution will lead to unexpected consequences. The question of freedom of speech and the rights of the House as against the judiciary&mdash;and, in days gone by, the rights of the monarch&mdash;have at times been fiercely contested, and the civil war was partly about such matters. So the issue should be approached with humility and great care.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/3">Remarkably, the Leader of the House who is not in her place&mdash;although she appeared briefly&mdash;has denied that the Bill contains any elements of parliamentary privilege. When we raised that with the Justice Secretary, he said, &quot;Well, it didn't last week.&quot; All the clauses that deal with parliamentary privilege must therefore have been added since then. As the Clerk of the House says in his striking memorandum, many parts of the Bill have to do with parliamentary rights and privilege, so I do not believe that all those have suddenly appeared in the last week. If that is the case, it makes me even more alarmed.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.0/1">When those outside hear us talking about privilege, they may think that we are talking about ourselves and our privileges, but what we are talking about is the voice that we have on behalf of our constituents, and the need for that not to be constrained. It is important that people outside understand that we are not discussing our own personal benefit, but their rights to have their voice heard in this Chamber.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman. Parliamentary rights&mdash;and through those the rights of the people whom we represent&mdash;would be a better way to describe them.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/2">We are dealing today with potential statute law, and it will be the job of the courts to interpret it. The Bill is about how Parliament conducts itself, about its rights and, indeed, the powers of Committees. One feature of the Bill that has not been mentioned is that the proposed new authority will be able to interfere with our Committees. Clause 8(6) would require IPSA to produce a protocol regulating the behaviour of various bodies, including the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis and the Standards and Privileges Committee. Such a protocol must presumably be binding in some way. I am not a member of that Committee, but I am a member of several others, and we abide by the Standing Orders of this House. We would resent it very much if an outside agency were to tell us how we should relate to other outside agencies, but that is what is in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/3">IPSA must consult each of those bodies, including the Standards and Privileges Committee, but that is all. After that, its protocol would be binding. If it failed to bind, the courts would decide the matter, not this House. The Bill would export the powers of an important Committee of this House to an unelected, unaccountable quango. It is perhaps the final achievement of the quango state that we are setting up a quango to tell Parliament and its Committees what to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/4">Earlier in the debate, I was worried that all this had emerged from the usual channels. Certainly the Justice Secretary implied that large chunks of the Bill had been agreed. It has been accurately asserted in the past that the usual channels are among the most polluted waterways in the world. We can all agree that private discussions between parties are no substitute for open debate. It is also dangerous when political parties agree. We all remember the Child Support Agency, which was almost unopposed in this House but created immense problems. The implications and consequences of that legislation had not been properly discussed or understood. We also had the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. Even if this were not a constitutional Bill, it would be very dangerous to try to push it through all its stages in less than a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/5">Of course everybody agrees that we must reform our expenses system, but that is happening&mdash;it is the whole point of the Kelly inquiry. Wisely, Sir Christopher Kelly is taking his time. When this issue was raised with the Justice Secretary, he said that the Kelly inquiry was much narrower. He said that it was simply concerned with setting up a system of expenses, and that the wider considerations about who should make the rules and administer and police the system were for this Bill. That was not the understanding when the Prime Minister, in desperation, set up the inquiry and wrote to Sir Christopher on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March</phrase>. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/6" class="indent">&quot;It will of course be for you as an independent Committee to consider how you wish to proceed. I am keen you should not feel bound in your discussions but free to consider a wide set of issues&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/7">He then lists certain items that he wishes Sir Christopher to consider. The terms of reference of the inquiry are, therefore, extremely wide.</p>

	<p pid="b.102.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an acute point. We are prejudging the Kelly inquiry, and I hope that Sir Christopher will not feel bound by that. I was pleased that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1795" name="Alan Duncan">the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan)</phrase>, who opened for the Opposition, said that in government we may revisit this Bill if it becomes law. We should take careful note of anything that Sir Christopher and his committee say about it. It is important that committees are allowed to run their course, take evidence, deliberate and produce a timely report.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/2">I have written to Sir Christopher and his committee, as we all had the option of doing, and I included many suggestions from my constituents about the allowances system. Meanwhile, the interim rules on allowances are working satisfactorily. Like all hon. Members, I have had many angry letters and e-mails about perceived past abuses, but I have received no criticism of the interim system. We are working under an austerity package that I support. It was agreed by the previous Speaker and the leaders of the main parties. It is fine as an interim solution and there is no urgency to replace it with institutional change in emergency legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/3">This is also the worst possible time to be making such changes, when Parliament is suffering from a collapse in its self-confidence. The institutional structures that the Bill would set up would long outlive the immediate problem of parliamentary expenses abuses. To submit to an external regulator in the way that is proposed would be a mistake.</p>

	<p pid="b.103.0/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman not think that if we are seen to be resisting legal sanctions in cases where MPs have effectively acted corruptly, as defined in subsections (1), (2) and (3) of clause 9, the public will be right to think that we still just do not get it?</p>

	<p pid="b.103.1/1">We are not resisting criminal law. The point has already been made in this debate that the new offences are unnecessary. We are already subject to rules against fraud, false accounting and theft. The new criminal sanctions in the Bill are redundant. We are not resisting criminal law; I certainly will not. I agree that the full force of the law should apply, but that is not at issue. This point certainly does not have general assent, but I think that the ability to make rules about salaries and expenses should remain with the House. We should take advice, we should listen, and there should be outside bodies to make suggestions, but I believe that it is up to Parliament to explain and justify to the people who sent us here what those rules should be.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.1/2">We could borrow from American experience. Under a constitutional amendment, Congress does not set its own remuneration, but must set rules that come into effect after an election. That was the most recent amendment to the American constitution. It means that Congress does not set its own rules; it sets rules for the subsequent Congress. In the next day or two, I shall propose an amendment to say that we should vote on new rules, but that they should apply only after the purging effect of a general election, so that we do not set our salaries and allowances but those for the next Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.1/3">The only other part of the Bill to which I wish to refer is clause 10, which reproduces much of the wording of article 9 of the Bill of Rights and seeks to override it. That is extremely dangerous. The Bill of Rights is not an entrenched Act; it can be repealed, and that is effectively what we are doing, with highly unpredictable consequences. Clause 10 protects freedom of speech, both in Parliament and on behalf of our constituents, and is wholly unnecessary. No one denies the importance of parliamentary reform, and that is the point I want to end on. Let nobody accuse this House, and certainly not me, of wanting to resist reform of our expenses. However, we must not carry out that reform by weakening Parliament, by exporting our powers to other organisations and bodies, and by overturning centuries of constitutional development, all of which is being done in a fruitless attempt to save a Government from extinction.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.0/1">Today, the aim is to introduce a Bill that will restore the reputation of Parliament, or go some way towards doing so, specifically when it comes to expenses. I wanted to make a contribution, despite having to reorganise my entire diary to do so, to voice wider concerns about the Bill, and concerns that arise because the Bill does not quite do what I anticipated that it would when it was first announced last week. I feel compelled to speak because the people sent us to this place. They have elected us to make our judgments and put forward views without fear or favour. I feel that it is a duty to make observations that we sometimes feel uncomfortable about making. I also did not want to be complicit by being silent; I certainly will not do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/2">In the few minutes available to me, I want first to make a point about the fact that this is the people's Parliament. This is a representative democracy, and we are here on the people's behalf. Secondly, I want to set the framework and the context in which the Bill was brought forward. Thirdly, I want to highlight some of the pressures on individual Members of Parliament, party leaders and Parliament itself. I then want to talk about the role of an MP, which has not been discussed to any great degree in this place, and has never really been codified or identified. I then want to appeal for some simplicity in how we tackle the issues through the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/3">First, let us be clear: we are elected representatives of the people. We are here because our constituents chose us to represent their interests and to represent the nation on their behalf. We are here to air our constituents' grievances, but also to work in the interests of everyone, without fear or favour. It is important to make it clear that this is a representative democracy; Members come here, into an assembly, to make points on behalf of the people and the nation that sent them. I make that point because, with regard to the Bill, there could be a case for considering a way in which people could feed in directly on our pay, remuneration and expenses system. Like other hon. Members, I think that the issue of pay and expenses is a special case. It is the one case in which we vote on things that directly affect our own well-being.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/4">Another point to emphasise is that when we talk about parliamentary privilege we are talking not about the privilege of Members of Parliament, but about the people's privilege&mdash;the people's ability to express in the Chamber, through their Members of Parliament, points that otherwise may not be heard. We are talking about the ability of the public and Members of Parliament to speak to committees freely and openly. We are talking about the ability of Members of Parliament to speak freely and openly here in the Chamber, to voice sometimes controversial opinions, and to uncover things&mdash;sometimes unpopular things&mdash;that some would not wish to be uncovered. It would be incredibly difficult if parliamentary privilege were in any way undermined, and incredibly harmful to the people who sent us here.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/5">As for the context of the debate, it is quite clear that we are living in a major downturn&mdash;a recession&mdash;and people are feeling the pain of that. It is clear that we are discussing the issue now, in some ways under coercion due to media attention, because of&mdash;I will not hold back my language&mdash;a useless expenses system that in some ways seems designed to bring this place into disrepute. That is why we are bringing forward the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.105.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" speakername="Adam Afriyie" colnum="105"  time="020:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0017.htm#09062940000175">
	<p pid="b.105.1/1">Absolutely; that is why I partially take the blame. I have been here for four years, and along with many Members who have been here for longer, I have had the opportunity to deal with the matter on several occasions. I am glad that we are beginning to deal with it, but I am not sure that the Bill is exactly the way in which to do so. On the subject of earnings, there is some pressure because of the downturn, and the matter of outside interests has now been raised, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.1/2">There is a history of failure to address the problem. It is interesting, by way of context, to look at the number of committees that already exist, and the number of mechanisms that we already have, to deal with expenses. There is everything from a Members Estimate Committee, advisory bodies to it, a Members Estimate Audit Committee, a Committee on Members' Allowances, an advisory body on Members' allowances, the Senior Salaries Review Body, the Select Committee on Standards and Privileges, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, the short-term Kelly review by the Committee on Standards in Public Life, plus several others. There is lots of machinery already there to deal with some of the issues. One of my concerns about the Bill is that we should be careful about introducing yet another body if its relationship to the committees in the system is not clearly defined and carefully debated.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.1/3">What are the pressures on us? First, clearly, there is the media. In some ways they performed a great function by uncovering many of the complications and discrepancies in the system. To a certain degree, they are to be congratulated on that. However, the media's aim is to sell newspapers, so a good headline is no headline at all. What they are looking for are negative headlines. The current system delivers such headlines and bad news day in, day out.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.1/4">Secondly, any parliamentary candidate fighting an incumbent MP will wish to highlight every small detail they can, in order to demonstrate that they may be a better representative. The current expenses system leaves all Members open to such criticism. I shall return to that. Thirdly, political parties are a source of pressure. There is political capital to be made from highlighting how one side or the other has been misusing a system that is incredibly complicated.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.1/5">To someone who, like me, came from the world of business, it is interesting that all the pressures from outside and many from within this place seem to undermine the integrity of MPs, and the information that comes through is used to undermine what we do here. I am conscious that the media will pick out one or two select sentences from the debate today to demonstrate how MPs are trying to hold back the process of reform, and so on. The pressures are enormous, but there is no countervailing pressure from this place to correct that imbalance.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.1/6">There is no clear definition of the role of an MP. The role has grown and evolved. Bagehot identified a few responsibilities, including choosing a Prime Minister, expressing the opinions of the people whom an MP represents, and teaching the nation</p>
	<p pid="b.105.1/7" class="indent">&quot;what it does not know&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.1/8">One or two others have commented on the role, but we know, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">the hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> made clear, that the role is much bigger than that.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.1/9">We have responsibilities to Parliament, to committees, to constituents, to our parties, to ourselves and our own integrity, and to our family&mdash;if we neglect our family, we will come in for criticism. We have responsibilities to support charities locally, to respond to letters, to create laws, to participate in debates, to attend votes, and to respond to the media. Members who are Ministers or who have a Front-Bench job have another job on top of that. That is a quick smattering of the kind of responsibilities we have. In any debate on the Bill, or on expenses, salaries and remuneration, we must first consider what is expected of a Member of Parliament before setting out the remuneration and allowances. The role has changed over the years.</p>

	<p pid="b.106.1/1">I would not necessarily go that far, but we need to set a debate such as this in context. As the hon. Lady pointed out, our constituents do not understand quite what we do. I do not blame them. For the first few years that we are here, we do not understand exactly all the responsibilities either. To inform decision making on remuneration or considerations, one must take into account what is expected of a Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/2">When it comes to second jobs or declaring outside income and the amount of time spent on outside interests, that can be misconstrued if being a Member of Parliament is seen as a full-time, nine-to-five job, which is not the situation. In many ways we are self-employed small business owners. We run our own offices and employ our own staff. In some ways we are paid employees for the functions that we perform in the House. In some cases we are unpaid employees, when we work, many of us, more than 60 or 70 hours a week. It is a vocation. We are trainees&mdash;novices&mdash;when we first arrive. We are part-time employees because we have long recesses, apparently. We have duties within working hours and outside working hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/3">This is not a clearly defined job that implies that there should be a salary. There were allowances from the 1300s to the 1700s, and they were reintroduced in 1911 by Lloyd George. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/4" class="indent">&quot;When we offer &pound;400 a year as payment of Members of Parliament it is not a recognition of the magnitude of the service, it is not remuneration, it is not a recompense, it is not even a salary. It is just an allowance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/5">That was to reflect the fact that people come from different walks of life and have different financial means. The allowance was intended to enable those with lesser means to perform functions in Parliament, but it was not a salary. I am a little concerned that we have slipped into using &quot;salary&quot; for parliamentary moneys that are transferred to Members when, in fact, they are not necessarily a salary.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/6">To make the debate a bit more exciting, I should say that &pound;400, if translated into current-day average earnings, amounts to somewhere between&mdash;we can argue the figure&mdash;&pound;140,000 and &pound;250,000. That is the context in which the issue ought to be considered. I am not arguing for that amount, so please let nobody assume that I am. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I notice that some people are nodding, saying &quot;No, do argue for it&quot;, but I am not going to do so. I merely observe that those moneys are not necessarily a salary, and that there may be a simpler way to tackle the issue. I hope that the Kelly review will consider that.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/7">I am very much in favour of simplicity, but I am concerned that the Bill adds another layer of complexity. We are in danger of repeating mistakes, by just adding more bodies, by not tackling the underlying issue and by creating a system that is as ugly as that which we are attempting to replace. The Bill is too hasty and knee-jerk; we need a better debate about the role of an MP and what they should be paid for. Some direct input by people into the review would be very helpful. The Bill is either too narrow or too broad&mdash;but it has certainly come too soon and without proper consideration.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.107.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" speakername="Andrew Tyrie" colnum="107"  time="020:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0018.htm#09062940000178">
	<p pid="b.107.0/1">Legislation is certainly needed to restore public trust in Parliament, but this is a grossly inadequate Bill. Almost every hon. Member who has spoken has agreed with both points&mdash;except, I am afraid to say, the Front-Bench spokesmen. They, and the Government Front-Bench team, in particular, are infected with a toxic combination of pre-election fever, panic fuelled by the leaks on expenses and the public's reaction to them, and a mistaken belief that just by doing something we can somehow insulate ourselves from the political damage that has been done.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/2">That is why we have what the Secretary of State has called emergency legislation. The Bill contains serious legal, constitutional and practical flaws and, even more importantly, fails to ensure the delivery of the two reforms that are essential for the restoration of public trust. For those reasons, I shall not support the Bill if there is a Division.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/3">The two essential reforms are, first, that the setting of MPs' pay and pensions should be removed from MPs' direct control, because we should no longer be expected or allowed to set them directly by a resolution of the House; and, secondly, that the use to which allowances are put should be subject to full transparency&mdash;as much as is practicable under the law.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/4">I have been a vigorous advocate of both changes for many years, and I proposed them to the democracy task force, on which I sat. It was chaired by my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, and its members included the former Cabinet Secretary Lord Butler and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>. It was plain to us that, whatever the Senior Salaries Review Body might recommend, as long as we MPs vote on each change to our remuneration, the public will believe that we are just feathering our nests. Until full transparency is in place, the public will also continue to believe that we misuse allowances once we get them.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/5">The Bill does at least take the setting of allowances out of our hands, but it leaves salaries to be set by resolutions of the House. That is what has led to problems almost every time the Government have sought to table such motions. If we are to legislate, we should at least be allowed to do it properly so that it covers pay and pensions. I have tabled an amendment to achieve that&mdash;at least, on pay.</p>

	<p pid="b.108.1/1">I am pleased to have a nod of support from my party's Front-Bench team, and to have had one when I intervened on my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1795" name="Alan Duncan">the Member for Rutland and Melton (Alan Duncan)</phrase> in the hope that I could generate support for that amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/2">The Bill hands allowances to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which can then vary them without resolutions of the House. However, that alone will not restore public trust unless it is accompanied by a requirement on IPSA to ensure that allowances are subject to the maximum practicable scrutiny. That could be achieved through an amendment to clause 3, but there has not been one yet and I have not had the time to table one. If we have learned anything from the past few weeks, it is that transparency can and should do most of the heavy lifting by limiting unjustifiable claims and bolstering public confidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.1/3">A good number of the legal and constitutional flaws have already been flagged up. Clause 6 was a casualty, dead on arrival, and clause 10 looks pretty vulnerable given some of the things I have heard. Several other clauses, particularly those that create double jeopardy, might well follow.</p>

	<p pid="b.108.2/1">My hon. Friend is right to identify clause 10 as extremely controversial. A lot has been said tonight about its undesirability, and one of the ironies is that if it were to go, the entire architecture of the Bill's regulatory structure&mdash;the punitive aspects&mdash;would go with it. My hon. Friend may agree that that encapsulates the lack of proper thought given to that aspect of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.108.3/1">I agree with every word of that. It is consonant with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> said on the same point. He listed a number of other serious flaws in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.3/2">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> said, we have had so little time to consider the Bill or hear the views of outside experts; it is difficult to know just how bad the Bill is on the basis of the first few days in which we have had the chance to consider it. The sensible course now must be to await Sir Christopher Kelly's report and then&mdash;only then&mdash;to create a new framework for allowances that accommodates his recommendations. That, of course, might mean coping with several more months of awkward publicity, but that is certainly preferable to coping for years with what could turn out to be seriously defective legislation at the heart of our democratic process.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.3/3">It might also mean amendment of Sir Christopher's recommendations. It must be mistaken to say in advance, as all the major parties appear to have, that we will implement all Sir Christopher's recommendations before they are even published. The Liberal Democrats have adopted a particularly absurd variation by saying that they will accept his recommendations</p>
	<p pid="b.108.3/4" class="indent">&quot; 'blind'&mdash;before we see them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.3/5">They then suggest that we should pass a resolution of the House within the next few days to ensure that that is achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.3/6">Of course we should lean heavily in favour of Sir Christopher's recommendations, but his proposals could contain flaws or the odd shortcoming, and our job is to make sure that he has things right before we legislate. I am sure that he would expect us to do that, too, just as I am sure that he is annoyed by the pre-emption of his report embodied in the Bill. His proposals should be subject to proper scrutiny by examination in Parliament, including by a Select Committee, before they become effective.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.3/7">The Government's almost panic-stricken determination to rush the Bill through the House in three days illustrates so much of what is wrong with how we now make our laws. It exposes the shallowness of the Government's professed commitment to improve how the House scrutinises legislation and the Executive. And, if we allow the Executive to get away with this, that will confirm the public's suspicions that Parliament counts for little these days in the face of an increasingly presidential Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.3/8">The Lord Chancellor described the Bill as &quot;emergency legislation&quot;. We certainly have a crisis, but I do not think that we have an emergency. I hope that the House of Lords will now scrutinise the Bill carefully and at a more measured pace. I particularly hope that it will attach a sunset clause; anything called &quot;emergency legislation&quot; probably warrants one. That would force us to consider in a more measured way what was needed for the longer term once we had the Kelly report. It would also give us the opportunity to implement Sir Christopher's recommendations, some of which may well have a bearing on the shape of the Bill, and to consult others, including the public. Only with the support of the public will it be worth legislating in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="b.109.2/1">I very much enjoyed the speech by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase>, who conducted himself in a typically measured and cautious way. I may be about to be less cautious in my response to the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.2/2">The real test for the Bill is to ask whether it will make Parliament work better, whether it will make better MPs, and whether it will really address the anger that British people feel about MPs. I would submit that it will not, as currently drafted. Our expenses claims are not the sole source of the despair about politics and politicians in our country: the disillusionment of voters has far more profound causes. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> spoke about the role of MPs. Why does Parliament exist? It exists, and it has always existed, to protect the public interest and the freedom of the citizen. It does so in three ways: by holding the Executive to account to prevent the abuse of power; by ensuring that legislation is well drafted and fit for purpose; and by scrutinising public spending to ensure value for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.2/3">That is what we should be doing in this House for our constituents, but are we collectively doing a good job? In recent decades MPs have become increasingly ineffective, and much of the public anger now directed at MPs over expenses must be attributed to that wider failure. I have come to support the principle of independent regulation of MPs' expenses, as I set out in a supplementary letter to the chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, who raised the question with a group of MPs who were giving him informal evidence. However, it is perfectly possible for the Bill to achieve the objective of independent regulation without compromising fundamental constitutional principles that have underpinned our democracy for more than 300 years.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.0/1">I know that it is commonplace to say that MPs have become less effective than they were, but all the evidence, including evidence given before the Committee that I chaired three years ago, shows the reverse. On every single measure, MPs are more effective, more assertive and more independent. Aside from the important issue of time spent in this House, where I accept that there is a problem, they have become more effective.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.1/1">I invite the Justice Secretary to listen to my arguments.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/2">The Bill further undermines MPs' independent capacity to represent the interests of their constituents in the national interest. As the Justice Secretary said, the House of Commons already sits shorter and shorter hours. Recesses seem to get longer and more numerous. An increasing number of decisions are taken other than in Parliament&mdash;in Whitehall, in Brussels, or in the courts, and increasingly not even in our own courts. Legislation increasingly passes through the House of Commons without being scrutinised, this Bill being a case in point, as my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester remarked. Ministers have more and more order-making powers, and there is more and more delegated legislation. Ministers have become legislators in their own right, not least when they sit in the EU Council of Ministers. More and more public money is voted through without any semblance of debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/3">At the state opening of Parliament, we slam the door of our House in the face of the sovereign's messenger to signal the hard-fought independence of the House of Commons from the Crown, but these days such a ceremony is becoming an ironic charade, as today's Prime Ministers have more unfettered power and control over Parliament than any monarch for at least 300 years. The powers of the Crown are vested in the Prime Minister, and he virtually controls Parliament. Only the Government determine the timetable for the House's business, only the Government have the power to determine changes to Standing Orders, and only the Government can table a motion to suspend the time limit on sittings.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/4">Before the second world war, the Government payroll was perhaps a little more than 50 MPs, and a sitting MP who accepted ministerial office was subject to what today's radicals would call &quot;recall&quot;&mdash;that is, they had to resign and fight their seat in a by-election. Today, the payroll has nearly trebled to more than 140 MPs, and ministerial office is just one of the bribes and threats that a modern Prime Minister can hold over MPs without consequence. The proposal for the regulation of MPs without the regulation of Ministers, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> pointed out, graphically underlines the disparity in power that now exists between Parliament and the Executive whom we are meant to be holding to account.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/5">With Parliament so powerless, the voters share that sense of powerlessness. It fuels the anger and outrage about our expenses, the failure of the whole political class, the loss of control over issues such as immigration, the reams of meaningless and unaccountable laws, the endless taxation and waste and the untouchable tyranny of officialdom. That is why the British National party now wins seats in European elections.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/6">It is ironic, at a time when everyone seems to agree that the House of Commons has become too weak and the Government too strong, that the Government should bring forward this Bill to regulate Parliament with a new quango, new criminal offences specific to MPs and, according to the Clerk of the House, new limitations on parliamentary privilege that will have what he calls a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on free speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/7">The Bill of Rights of 1689 came about as a reaction to a long period of monarchical rule during which Parliament was either ignored or did not sit at all. It limited the royal prerogative and established key rights for Parliament, not least the right of free speech. This Bill threatens to turn the clock back, not forward, and to put MPs more in fear of the apparatus of the modern state, not make them stronger or more independent.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/8">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> pointed out, the unworkable requirements for the declaration of outside interests are not neutral but designed to cow MPs by creating a sense that outside earnings are invidious. The role of MP need not be a full-time job&mdash;as has been asked, how else do so many MPs also have time to serve as Ministers? MPs are becoming more like party drones than independent tribunes of the people. They should be representatives, not party delegates. They should represent their constituency at Westminster, not their Westminster party in their constituency. MPs today are expected to behave more and more as employees of some kind of corporation, not to exercise their individual judgment according to conscience. That is why we should not have a job description. Mine is written every time I stand in front of my constituents for re-election.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/9">Some day, this House must demand back from Government what successive Governments have taken away. A competent Government need a strong Parliament to hold them accountable, and there is certainly no evidence that weaker Parliaments have made Governments any better. The Justice Secretary perhaps started a process of reversal with his concession about clause 6, but he will need to make many, many more concessions before the Bill wins my confidence. I shall certainly vote against the time limit on consideration of the Bill, which exemplifies everything that has gone wrong with the governance of our nation.</p>

	<p pid="b.112.0/1">It is a pleasure, if something of a challenge, to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1579" name="Bernard Jenkin">the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)</phrase>. I agree with a couple of his points, one of which is his appeal to ensure that the matter of second jobs is not used to turn this into a House of Stepford Members, where people behave in a standard, robotic, stylised way because they all come from one think-tankish gene pool. He also made the useful point that people's confidence in Parliament is not just about expenses. We need to remember that people are asking basic questions about the worth of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/2">Here in the Chamber last Wednesday, some of the things that were said in the debate on Iraq, when points about Parliament's role in determining the details of an inquiry were ducked and evaded, gave people room to question the worth of Parliament. On the same day, there was a debate in Westminster Hall on Equitable Life. People from all parts of the country have written to us about that predicament. It seems to be the will of the majority of MPs that that be addressed, but when people see the Government question that will, and question the word and work of the parliamentary ombudsman, they will again question the worth of Parliament. So those issues need to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/3">Like some others who have spoken in the debate, I took part in the discussions downstairs that the Secretary of State for Justice chaired, during which, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> said, the right hon. Gentleman was very reasonable. Unlike some Opposition Members, I believe that the Government are approaching the matter not in a blind panic, but with a clear purpose. Some Members have asked why the measure is needed, suggesting that worst of the expenses scandal is over. We do not know that. The publication of last year's claims is still to come and we do not know what new confections and conflations may appear.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/4">If we recess in July, without doing anything other than change the Speaker, people will be scandalised and say that we simply do not get it. If we say that we will leave matters till the autumn, what will happen over the summer, as more newspapers drill into all sorts of aspects of expenses and so on? What will happen if the main parties' conferences, which are held in the autumn, instead of being used to set out stalls for the forthcoming election, are again seized by concerns and disputes about parliamentary expenses, with parties perhaps contending with each other about who is to blame for not dealing with the problem? People will then regret not passing decisive legislation now to tackle some of the problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/5">It has also been suggested that we can do nothing until Christopher Kelly reports. I do not accept that. If we all agree, as we say we do, about the principle of an independent parliamentary standards authority, and independent oversight, administration and management of payments and allowances, let us be mature enough to put it in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.112.0/6">We have to await Kelly's findings before we take action on some issues. Clearly, we need to introduce legislation that is Kelly-compatible or Kelly-ready. I accept that some parts of the Bill go too far and are too pre-emptive or prescriptive and will perhaps require Kelly to make particular recommendations. We should not fetter Kelly's discretion. Clearly, the Government have already reflected that view in taking action on clause 6. During the discussions downstairs, I suggested that the Bill should be entitled, &quot;Parliamentary Standards (Finances) Bill&quot; or &quot;Parliamentary Standards (Allowances) Bill&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.0/1">The Government are right that the matter needs to be addressed urgently. Public disquiet is clearly great, and there has also been great anger. If the Bill were confined to the process of setting up, in anticipation of Kelly, a system whereby our allowances and eventually our salaries were tackled outside the House, by an independent authority, it would go through quickly and command widespread acceptance. However, the Bill contains punitive regulatory provisions, which have constitutional implications. From what has been said so far, the House clearly takes the view that there has been insufficient time to consider them.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.1/1">I accept the hon. and learned Gentleman's point, but if the Government are to make adequate provision, the Bill must cover more than the Opposition suggest. If Sir Christopher Kelly reports in the autumn, we will say that we need time to digest the contents and to prepare legislation. Meanwhile, many Members will scream that a general election is needed urgently. On the one hand, some hon. Members claim that we must take time to do things properly, while on the other, they scream that they want a general election urgently. They also say that they want the matter resolved before the end of the Parliament, so that it is not a problem in the general election campaign or for the new Parliament, which would have to legislate on expenses.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/2">People cannot have it every which way, but that is what they seem to be trying to achieve in this debate. The Government are right that we need clear legislation to be ready to plug in properly to the various Kelly recommendations. That legislation needs to be fully in place and fully activated, hopefully well before a general election. All the preparatory work&mdash;not just the preparatory legislative work, but the work to set up the authority and to scope out its requirements&mdash;needs to follow the passage of the legislation, which is why that legislation needs to be in place before the recess.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.2/1">Given where the hon. Gentleman sits for and what he has said about outside interests, what is his view on those Members, whose work here many would say should be a full-time job, who also sit in another Parliament or Assembly, doing work that many in those legislatures would also say should be a full-time job?</p>

	<p pid="b.113.3/1">I have clearly said that in Northern Ireland, for instance, we need to set a clear point in the electoral cycle when dual mandates end, whether that be at the next Westminster election, so that people do not continue to hold both positions, or at another time. I have already made it clear in my constituency and elsewhere that if I stand at the next Westminster election, I will not continue as a Member of the Legislative Assembly. Those standards will be reflected in our submissions to the Kelly review. Unfortunately, the Kelly review is taking evidence in Belfast on Wednesday, when the House will be scrutinising the Bill in Committee. Indeed, there will also be other legislation to consider, but we cannot be in both places, so we are left with a dilemma. Do we attend Kelly to show our interest in that process or do we attend here to show our due diligence in relation to parliamentary standards? Indeed, that is a problem that does not even take in the question of membership of the Assembly or anything else.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.3/2">It is important that we should take care in respect of this legislation. There are things that will need to be tweaked. There are also things where we perhaps do not need to press the &quot;delete&quot; button, but where we need to press the &quot;save in draft&quot; button, so that we can return to them post Kelly. There are also some things missing from the Bill that need to be there. For instance, there is no reference at all to taxation. It is quite clear that part of the public scandal and concern about MPs' expenses relates to capital gains tax on properties that were funded&mdash;or partly funded&mdash;through allowances from the House. There is also the question of work-related expenses that might be claimed. We know that some exotic and expensive items were refused by the Fees Office, but perhaps they were claimed&mdash;or could be claimed&mdash;as work-related expenses. IPSA needs to provide guidance to Members on what is appropriate in that respect and to engage directly with Revenue and Customs, reference to which is also missing from the Bill. There are references to the Treasury and so on, but not to Revenue and Customs.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.3/3">There should perhaps also be references in the Bill to the Cabinet Office, because there were clearly issues in relation to the expenses of Ministers, particularly where grace and favour homes were in play. The Cabinet Office has a role, because if Ministers receive expenses and allowances in that way, the Executive have to take some responsibility for administering them and for navigating that particular twilight zone, rather than just leaving that to IPSA. Therefore, the role of the Cabinet Office in all this needs to be reflected too.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.3/4">If we took the time that some hon. Members seem to be suggesting, the public would think not that we were taking care, but that we do not care. They would think that we did not understand their shock and disgust. The question is not whether the Government are listening to the House, which is the test that some hon. Members have applied this evening. The question is whether the House is listening to the country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.114.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" speakername="Paul Goodman" colnum="114"  time="021:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0019.htm#09062940000193">
	<p pid="b.114.0/1">The Prime Minister has, in effect, handed us this Bill rather like a man handing a motorway map to a group of dejected, demoralised and, I am afraid in a few cases, discredited travellers. Like a map, the Bill contains features&mdash;a new authority here, a new penalty there. Some of them are unproblematic; others, as we have heard, are rather more of a problem. None the less, as we have heard this evening, we are being told to get a move on&mdash;that the only fitting response to the public anger is to rush the Bill through the House as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.0/2">What you may have observed from this debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker, is a distinct reluctance on the part of the House to be rushed in that way, because the more Members in all parts of the House have looked at the Bill, the less they have liked it. The reason for that is simple. It is because, having looked collectively at the Bill today, we have identified a key weakness&mdash;namely, that the map before us has no agreed destination. It sets out a new body and new penalties, but it fails to set out a clear vision of what the new body will regulate and to what activities the penalties will apply. In short, nowhere in the Bill does it describe what a Member of Parliament is, or what our functions and purposes in this place are. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">The hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> made that point earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.0/3">It is evident that there are two conflicting ideas of what an MP is. The first is that we are elected representatives&mdash;citizen legislators who are free to earn outside this place. The second is that we are professional politicians funded exclusively by the taxpayer and therefore members of a political class, distinct and thus separate from those whom we represent. Elected representatives must, almost by definition, represent a multiplicity of interests&mdash;the interests of capital, the interests of labour, and so on. Under our present constitutional arrangements and cultural conditions, however, most professional politicians will, I am afraid, ultimately represent only one interest&mdash;namely, that of the Executive whom they wish to serve as members, or that of the Executive-to-be. So, the movement in recent years from the MP as elected representative to the MP as professional politician&mdash;first under John Major and Nolan, then under Tony Blair and Nolan's successors&mdash;suits the Executive very nicely. It is no wonder that, by means of the Bill, the ceiling that has for years been descending on private interests will be ratcheted down still further.</p>

	<p pid="b.115.0/1">I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument, but, as I said earlier, it is worth looking at the evidence. As a former distinguished Clerk to the House said recently, the evidence shows that in the golden age of the 1950s and 1960s, the House was wholly quiescent. There was not a single rebellion against the Government in the early 1950s, compared with repeated rebellions under Margaret Thatcher and under this Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.115.1/1">But my prediction is that there will be still fewer rebellions if the Bill goes through in its present form. Ministers know full well that very few Members who work part-time for charities or for businesses, or as doctors or at the Bar, will be able to fend off the exhibitionists and fanatics who grovel before the voters in every constituency pledging that, unlike the sitting Member, they will sit in their parliamentary office writing e-mails 24 hours a day. Those are promises that some&mdash;perhaps many&mdash;of them will not keep, leading to further disillusionment with politics and politicians.</p>
	<p pid="b.115.1/2">Ministers&mdash;including the Justice Secretary, I am sure&mdash;will of course ask why MPs should not, in the interest of openness and transparency, declare how many hours they work outside Parliament. To that, there is only one answer. To use a phrase that the Justice Secretary used earlier: what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Let those on the Treasury Bench who are moonlighting declare how many hours they work outside the House rather than working here on behalf of their constituents, just as any other Member of the House will have to do under the terms of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.0/1">I should like to share an irony with my hon. Friend. Whereas Back-Bench Members of Parliament with outside interests are certainly not working against the interests of the House of Commons, Ministers with such interests are certainly doing so a lot of the time, because they are denying us information and legislating to try to keep us in our box.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.1/1">My hon. Friend makes his point very well. That is why Ministers favour neither the old-fashioned idea of the elected representative nor the fully modern idea of the full-time legislator who is not a member of the Executive, citing the separation of powers as it exists in the United States. It is no wonder that the Prime Minister has handed us this map without a destination, or that the Justice Secretary is urging us to rush the Bill through the House as quickly as possible. It is not that they do not know where the journey is heading; they know perfectly well. I do not believe that the Bill is motivated by the expenses scandal at all. In my view, it is motivated by the Government's desire to entrench further a political class that will be dependent on the patronage of those on the Treasury Bench.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.1/2">The Bill piles further absurdity on the original absurdities set out in the Nolan rules, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> alluded earlier&mdash;namely, that there are only two kinds of interests. One is private interest, personal to Members; the other is the public interest as a whole. However, that is not so much wrong as completely unintelligible. Many other interests must be represented in the Commons for it to be a House of Commons at all. To give but one example, each of us represents a constituency interest; it is possible, indeed likely, that that constituency interest will sometimes clash with other constituency interests, and therefore with the public interest as a whole. The refusal to recognise those truths drives the contortions and contradictions in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.1/3">So many examples have been given that I hesitate to add to them, but the House might briefly want to consider an example cited in <i> The Times</i>. If a constituency business buys a Member a cup of tea, and the Member then raises a matter on that business's behalf, will such a Member be in breach of the paid advocacy rules and be hauled before the courts accordingly?</p>

	<p pid="b.116.3/1">My hon. and learned Friend says, unhesitatingly, yes, and he will know, as we all do, that the Bill threatens to create a vicious circle whereby Members are punished by the courts for representing interests, and punished by our constituents for not representing them&mdash;completing the process whereby, increasingly, I am afraid, Members are transformed into box-ticking clones.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.3/2">We are all asked repeatedly, as was mentioned this afternoon, whether we get it&mdash;&quot;getting it&quot; is the phrase of the moment. I sometimes wonder whether our constituents get it&mdash;whether they get what is coming to them under the Bill, namely, the triumph of the political class, driven by the combination of a rampant media, the professionalisation of politics, a rapacious Executive, and a culture with a 15-second attention span.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.3/3">Why, in the last resort, blame anyone but ourselves if the Bill is allowed to go through with all its imperfections? It is the culmination of a collective loss, over many years, of self-confidence, self-respect and self-belief. If Members of the House do not respect themselves as elected representatives, free to debate the clash of interests that must arise in a free society, no one else will respect them either.</p>

	<p pid="b.117.0/1">It is a privilege to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase>. One of the most depressing things that has happened to me in recent weeks was learning that he is standing down from Parliament. It was depressing not just because I am losing a friend&mdash;we entered this place on the same day some eight years ago&mdash;but because when he outlined his reasons for leaving, I found I agreed with about 90 per cent. of them. He has said exactly what I hope many of the more thoughtful Members would agree with.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/2">I also associate myself with every word of the contribution of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase>, who, as ever, was able to articulate the arguments much more concisely than perhaps I am able to. However, I want to say briefly that I share the almost universal reservations about the speed with which the legislation is being rushed through. As a number of Members have said, it is being rushed through partly out of panic, and partly out of a desire to be seen to be doing something. Rushing legislation, particularly&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;to go through all stages in three days, is a great mistake. We need to move towards greater separation of powers, especially between the Executive and the legislature, and the Bill regrettably takes us in diametrically the opposite direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/3">We risk politicising the judiciary, who will now stand in judgment on issues of parliamentary process and procedure, especially if clause 10 in its entirety comes into play. We risk vexatious litigation, perhaps driven by partisan political considerations. No doubt some publicity-hungry judges will also look to flex their muscles, to the edge of the legislation and probably beyond. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> rightly said, we are sent to this place by our constituents, not as bureaucratic placemen and women but as people who should be able to debate the important issues of the day.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/4">Without wishing to harp on too much about how we got into this situation, it is very important to put one or two things on the record. The Executive were repeatedly warned that the second home allowance was a disaster waiting to happen. I know that, because I have repeatedly warned over many years&mdash;it may be easy for me to be dispassionate as a central London Member whose salary has been kept down&mdash;about the grandstanding that went on by both Government and Opposition leadership on this matter. It goes back, I accept, to the 1980s, but three times during the eight years I have been a Member&mdash;it also happened in January 2008 over the London allowance&mdash;headline salaries have been kept down in spite of the independent Senior Salaries Review Body's recommendations, and then a blind eye was turned to the constant increase in the second home allowance, which was never reduced, reversed or even capped.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/5">In July 2001, there was a huge uplift outside any recommendation from any independent body so there was no longer, in my view, any real pretence that the second home allowance was reimbursement; rather, it was being used as a salary substitute because the Executive failed to have the courage to stand up and make the case for a higher salary going forward. Therein, a culture of absolute cynicism built up.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/6">The general public, in my view, understand the need for MPs living beyond commuting distance to have a home in London. Their view of a second home, however, is a rented, furnished flat, meaning that there is no need for household goods, plasma TV screens, gardening and cleaning bills, and no mortgages, no flipping, and no remortgaging or maximising of financial benefit. The capital gains scam and the appalling ongoing scam of section 292 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, which makes all this tax-free, is little short of disgrace. I suppose that, as in any banana republic, it is the MPs who end up making the law. This issue was not new; it was warned about, and I am not the only Member to have warned about it in these terms and for some years before the balloon went up.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/7">Let me touch briefly on clause 5 and second job scrutiny. I fear that it is the worst sort of cynicism and rank hypocrisy for the Prime Minister to attempt to embarrass Conservative MPs by conflating the second jobs issue with the allowance scandal, which has ended in the disaster that my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe pointed out. There has never been any suggestion that outside employment was undesirable or that it interfered with MPs' duties, nor any sense in which it has been part of the scandal that has engulfed Parliament in recent weeks. Indeed, in my view the real risk is now that MPs will become ever more of a separate political caste&mdash;professionals moving to politics perhaps from their 20s onwards. It may suit the Executive and any future Executive for Parliament to become a cadre of super-councillors retreating from independent-minded views into a constituency-based comfort zone. That, I think, would be absolutely catastrophic for public life, but it is what this Bill will help to reinforce.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1579" name="Bernard Jenkin">the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)</phrase> rightly alerted us to the ludicrous anomaly whereby Ministers, already remunerated out of public funds, are exempted from filling in the same timesheets that each and every one of us who has an outside interest will have to fill in. Yet their extra-curricular activities equally impinge on their ordinary duties as Members of Parliament and as legislators. Indeed, it is compensation for that time forgone that is the very reason why Ministers are paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/9">We need to move, as I think we are&mdash;slowly&mdash;towards the idea of a separation between the Executive and the legislature. I know that that means a big change in how the Executive will operate, but it seems to me that the role of the MP should be as a law- maker, as someone holding the Executive to account, which is particularly important&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;for those MPs from the governing party as well as those from Opposition parties. For reasons that a number of my hon. Friends have pointed out, that tends to have been forgotten.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/10">I believe that this Bill is deeply flawed, not only in its underlying principles but in its practical application. The new external expenses regulatory body that is being created sounds superficially soothing, but experience should have taught the Government that it may well act in many ways to undermine the internal promotion of proper standards among parliamentarians. Instead, a &quot;them and us&quot; culture will be created; there will be systematic attempts to avoid the letter of the rule; and there will be hostility to the ethic of box ticking rather than an appreciation of the principles that should lie behind any code.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/11">We should be trying to inculcate a sense of right and wrong in parliamentarians in all their claims for allowances and expenses or, indeed, in any other way. The Bill, however, risks creating a &quot;what we can get away with&quot; culture that we have seen in the past. We have already seen what has been justified as being within the rules&mdash;ludicrously, there have been claims for &pound;400 a month for food and &pound;250 a month for petty cash with no questions asked&mdash;and that is the system from which we are moving away, but I fear that a body such as IPSA will simply reinforce it with a new set of rules. We need the ethics to come from individuals rather than resulting from a hostility which, inevitably, will be mounted against any new regulatory body.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/12">I am sorry that I have not had a chance to say more; indeed, we would all have liked to say a good deal more. However, I am glad to have had the chance to make a small contribution to the debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.119.0/1">When I came here, I came here as a Member of a Parliament. I look back across 30 years and I think, &quot;What am I now?&quot; I am on the outer reaches of a court. The King sits over there, the heir to the kingdom sits here, and I am a minor courtier if I hope to receive some favour&mdash;or not. That is what has happened. The slamming of the door is on the wrong person now. The Crown moved, as we have long known, from the end of the Mall into Downing street, and has now positioned itself here. The very person whom we did not want to take over the running of our country absolutely in terms of the making of laws and the divine right of Kings has now incorporated himself right in our centre; and fluttering around the King are all these Ministers&mdash;the shadows on our side, the substance on the other side.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/2">The Government have become so large that I believe there are almost more of them than there were members of the main Opposition party at one stage. That is where we have got to. Today, we face one of the Bills of which the Lord High Panjandrum, who is now busily looking at his papers, well knows. We have had a long relationship: he was Leader of the House, no less, was Foreign Secretary, and is now Justice Secretary. He has cast around and then come here himself in place of the current Leader of the House, who unfortunately had to attend a memorial event.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/3">I knew nothing about this 10 days ago. I do not suppose that anyone other than&mdash;apparently&mdash;those on my party's Front Bench, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1589" name="Mark Durkan">the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> and the other party leaders knew anything about it. It does not even follow the old patterns. A Bill used to be deposited, and have a First and a Second Reading. Two weeks used to be provided before the Bill was dealt with on the Floor of the House, so that people could digest it. This Government prattle on about pre-legislative scrutiny, saying that it is embedded in what they are trying to do, but does not this Bill, more than any other legislation, require such scrutiny?</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/4">There used to be a convention, no less, that all stages of a constitutional Bill were taken on the Floor of the House. It seems that the Lord High Panjandrum is going along with that&mdash;the Bill will be dealt with on the Floor of the House&mdash;but something else will be involved: a guillotine. That is the way we do business. Why trouble with us? We are merely minor players in the great drama&mdash;and what a drama! We saw an auction of places in this Government just three weeks ago. We saw them squabbling like anything. And we are supposed to take them seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/5">What I am saying is that this is a very dangerous time for our nation and our Parliament. As the Government seek desperately to hold on to power, they are prepared to throw anything in. The Government say that they want to give more powers to Parliament, but what do they do? They write the reformation of Parliament themselves, in a quiet little arrangement involving Front Benchers consorting with the hon. Member for Foyle and others. That is no way for us to assert ourselves as Members of Parliament, and no way for us to hold anyone to account.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/6">This is an awful Bill. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">The hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, rightly criticised it in making fundamental propositions about our liberty and due processes. He had to do that on the basis of a draft report, because the Joint Committee will not meet until tomorrow, when it would have sanctioned all the comments that he made today. Similarly, the Justice Committee will not meet until tomorrow, although it is taking evidence from the Clerk. This is how we are treated in this House. This is a terrible Bill because it tries to set out who we are.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">The hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> made some very good points. Ultimately, it is the electorate who define what a Member of Parliament is, and we justify ourselves to the electorate by the way we hold the Government to account and challenge the nostrums, propositions and grand performances by Front Benchers. We are the representatives of the people. When we talk about privileges, we mean the privileges of freedom of speech. I come here and I can attack a Prime Minister&mdash;and not only someone as unimportant as the Prime Minister, but even the Lord High Panjandrum himself.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.0/8">The Leader of the House is not going to follow through by concluding this debate. She could be here; we saw her make a fleeting appearance. I know why she did not take on that speech: it is because she cannot. As I look across at the shadows who flaunt themselves in front of us now, it is clear to me that this country desperately needs an election to clear out the clutter. We must now repudiate this Bill, and put it all in a proper and measured process. We have it in place to do so&mdash;but, no, someone has to show off and show that he is the king of Downing street with all the powers of the prerogative behind him and an obedient Government followed by their Whips, in order to ensure that this Bill passes. We should reject it, and we should most certainly reject the guillotine on it.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.1/1">Yes, on the guillotine and against it. All I am doing is asking the House to face up to these things.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/2">A week ago, 10 people stood in front of this House. It was the only time, however, that I bet that any of them had been able to address a Prime Minister in this Chamber uninterrupted with him sitting there for the entire five or six minutes. That is a privilege that is never extended to anyone else in this House. That reveals the contempt that is shown by the Government time and again to the Members of this House, who have to justify their pay and their allowances&mdash;or whatever&mdash;to their own electorate. The Government have forgotten about the electorate in this. It is about what the Prime Minister thinks he can carve up with other Front Benchers. That is no way to be a proper representative body, and we are now going to hear a winding-up speech justifying all this nonsense. The Government have withdrawn something, but we should vote this Bill down if we ever got the opportunity&mdash;although the whole Whips' apparatus must ensure that we are nothing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.121.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" speakername="Dominic Grieve" colnum="121"  time="021:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0020.htm#09062951000367">
	<p pid="b.121.2/1">When I came to this debate today, I was not sure whether the anxieties I felt about this legislation would be reflected across the House. There is no doubt that Parliament has fallen to such a low in recent weeks that it is sometimes very difficult for us to believe that we can make objective judgments about ourselves. It is also very difficult for us to reason through what we need in order to do our jobs. Indeed, the point has been well made in the course of the debate that if we had had more courage in the past to have public debates about what we reasonably needed by way of remuneration and allowances, and if we had debated those things openly rather than brush them under the carpet, we would not have got into the dreadful pass we are in today.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.2/2">I found it particularly compelling that, as each hon. Member stood up and explained themselves, there came a series of comments expressing misgivings about the legislation that the Government have brought forward. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> pointed out the incompatibilities of the legislation with the report on privilege in 1999, and his concerns about article 6 and fair trials and the way in which due process would be observed. There was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> who, along with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase>, went on about an issue that we seem to have just brushed under the carpet&mdash;that this place is about a clash of interests. It is not just a matter of the public and the private. Parliament is supposed to put competing interests together and to meld them, through debate, to produce outcomes, yet the rules under which we appear to be running pay absolutely no regard to that fact. That highlights some of the problems that we will have if we try to impose a public service model of conduct on ourselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.3/1">Will my hon. and learned Friend confirm whether, if I were to compliment an hon. Member on the way in which he represented an interest in this House and if someone used that as evidence of an example of a misdeclared, wrongly declared or undeclared interest, that Member could be prosecuted under the Bill even though I intended it as a compliment?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.122.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" speakername="Dominic Grieve" colnum="122"  time="021:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0020.htm#09062951000369">
	<p pid="b.122.0/1">The fact that the rules are linked to regulations on declarations of interest and what constitutes paid advocacy that are not in the Bill, and the fact that those rules are developing and changing, must give rise to the real possibility that Members of this House could be prosecuted for doing their jobs. That was one of the things that caused me anxiety when I came to look in detail at the Bill. The Government will argue&mdash;perfectly fairly, I am sure&mdash;that that is not their intention. However, the conflation of the draft, the offences section, the requirements on paid advocacy and the regulations that we will have as of <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-01">1 July</phrase>&mdash;I have had to look at them for my own sake, as I am sure has every hon. Member&mdash;seems to make that a real possibility. So, yes, on that point my hon. Friend is right.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/2">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> outlined the extent to which the proposals as brought before the House do not reflect any of the discussions that have taken place and fly in the face of accepted practices as regards Members' conduct. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">The hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> highlighted from his long experience as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights that if we are moving to a statutory system of regulation it must be ECHR compliant, yet what is proposed is plainly nothing of the kind. If that is maintained, we will land ourselves with considerable difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">The hon. Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> made a powerful and passionate speech, outlining what she thought being a Member of Parliament was all about, which I think is accepted across the House. She is right to be concerned about the proposals, because I fear that, even unintentionally, they will undermine her ability to do her job. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> also made a powerful speech about an MP's role.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> highlighted the extent to which the Bill of Rights of 1689, which is often only cited in this place as some decorative extra, is in fact the rock and foundation on which freedom of speech in this country and in this House has been built, and the extent to which those rules will be changed by this Bill, which will be passed in three days by this House. The same points were made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/5">The thing that shone through as the debate progressed was that, save for a half concession by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1589" name="Mark Durkan">the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase>, no one who participated in the debate was happy with the entirety of the Government's proposals, or with anything close to their entirety. My hon. Friends the Members for Windsor (Adam Afriyie) and for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie) highlighted the fact that the legislation appears to have been embarked on in great haste and contains a series of objectives, some of which can be readily supported but others of which appear to be entirely unclear.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1579" name="Bernard Jenkin">the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)</phrase> made an eloquent speech about Parliament and what it is to be here. I can speak only for myself when I say that I came into this House with romantic notions about what it was to be a Member. Those notions survive, but over the past few weeks I have come close to despair and, at times, to following the example of my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe&mdash;I wish I could talk him out of this&mdash;and just walking away from this place in despondency and sadness, because we are close to the point of no longer being able to do our work at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/7">To change direction, may I say to the Secretary of State how I think this issue ought to be approached? He is right when he says that there is an urgent issue to be considered. We have been exposed to unparalleled levels of public anger, hostility and disgust about this place. Those of us who have held public meetings&mdash;I have done so in my constituency&mdash;have had no difficulty in picking up on the extent of public dissatisfaction with the way in which we conduct our business, but I suggest to him that, as has been rightly highlighted in the debate, the issue goes further than salaries and expenses; it goes to our very relevance. The growing perception of our irrelevance is the foundation on which the current crisis has occurred, and we have failed to address that irrelevance for a long period. Whatever he may say, the public perceptions are that this place is powerless against the Executive and that it is supine. All people ever see of this place and all that is ever reported about it is the bear garden in this House&mdash;it is not the work that hon. Members do elsewhere, often in an atmosphere of far greater consensus and moderation&mdash;which tends towards exposing us to ridicule.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/8">The public then examine what we have been up to in respect of salaries and expenses. It was an urgent need that those things be dealt with outside this place, and I am delighted that the first part of the Bill provides for&mdash;or sets the scene for so doing&mdash;exactly that. There is a problem in that, without Sir Christopher Kelly having reported, many of the issues that should be of urgent importance to us are not yet covered. We must face up to the fact that the Byzantine system of allowances and what it allowed people to claim for has created some of the problems, and until it is sorted out we will not have reached our goal. This House can be comfortable with and happy about the fact that we will no longer be responsible for issues relating to our own remuneration, because that is not what we were sent here for&mdash;it is the additional extra to our work. We can be wholly content with that outcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/9">The other thing to have emerged from this crisis is that the transparency that we are now to have is probably the greatest moderator of all in ensuring that things do not go wrong in future. How much better it would have been if the claims that were exposed for criticism in the past two months had been posted the day on which they had been made and an MP could then have realised the public hostility to what he had been asking for, rather than our all facing the problem of having to justify, six years after the event, what many people were told at the time was justified. Transparency will take us a long way too.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/10">For those reasons, the Government's intentions and the first part of the Bill seem to us to be entirely necessary. We will support the Bill&mdash;or we will certainly not impede its passage&mdash;because we take the view that something must be done on those matters, but I must say to the Secretary of State that when one examines the second part of the Bill, one finds that the whole issue starts to become opaque. The Government have created&mdash;or they have certainly set about initially creating&mdash;a structure of regulation and punishment of MPs for transgressions that, if it had been given its full rein when first introduced, would in essence have turned us into the creatures of a quango. The Government drew back from that, but one is left with the impression that having put together a Bill that was constructed around the ex cathedra statements of the Prime Minister, without having previously having consulted anybody, they now feel obliged to pursue at least more than a fig leaf to show that he meant business. The reality, however, is that the Bill is fundamentally flawed in its approach to our regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/11">The Bill would create criminal offences. I have nothing against criminalising Parliament. Indeed, the point was made to me at a public meeting that I attended that one reason for our unpopularity is that the public feel so dumped on and criminalised by a succession of over-zealous Governments over the years. They feel that we are being treated differently to them. However, that may be a good reason for Parliament's starting to decriminalise many of the things that we have imposed on the public, rather than starting to criminalise ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/12">If we are to be criminalised, it should be for some good reason that meets an objective. The first offence that we would create for ourselves would be one for which the general law already provides with far more draconian sanctions. How can we seriously tell our electors that we have a special fraud offence for MPs, punishable by only 12 months' imprisonment, but that they will get 10 years if they commit fraud? What is the purpose of that?</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/13">Secondly, we will criminalise paid advocacy. I happen to think that paid advocacy is bribery. I thought that we were already criminalising bribery in a way that succeeded in taking into account the Bill of Rights and ensured that it would not be an obstacle to the conviction for bribery of a Member of Parliament. If so, what is the purpose of criminalising paid advocacy? It is a serious disciplinary offence against this House, and&mdash;as we have highlighted&mdash;the way in which the rules on outside interests and gifts are now drafted means that Members will be subject to severe anxiety about what constitutes paid advocacy and what does not. If any hon. Member wishes to understand that point, I suggest that they read the latest rules on what has to be declared after <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-01">1 July</phrase>. The doubt about the difference between a gift and a benefit in kind shines through those regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/14">The entirety of the enforcement powers that the Bill would bestow raises serious issues of justiciability. If the House wishes to engage in the merry-go-round of litigation, we can embark on that cheerfully, but it is unclear whether the rules could be enforced by the courts. My opinion is that they would be capable of being enforced by the courts. Indeed, hon. Members may derive some comfort from the fact that they would be able to challenge the rulings by the new Commissioner of IPSA in the courts if they disagreed with them.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/15">Some of those results may be inevitable, but I do not think that all of them are. I am convinced&mdash;I hope that the Secretary of State will be open-minded in Committee&mdash;that we can achieve the objectives that we all share without creating some of the difficulties that have been highlighted by the memorandum by the Clerk of the House and by virtually every hon. Member who has spoken.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/16">This debate is not about arcane issues&mdash;I do not really like talking about parliamentary privilege. It is about whether we can do our job. It is about whether we have the self-confidence to maintain our standards and to act corporately in challenging the Executive and holding them to account, which is one of our primary purposes. If that is undermined, we will be back in our constituencies in 12 months being criticised for something else and with the knowledge that our role is becoming more and more irrelevant. I ask the Secretary of State to have the courage to stand up for high standards, for the protection of the freedoms that we were sent here to protect, and to ensure that not only we but those who follow us have a framework within which to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/17">If the Secretary of State and the Government listen, we can all break up for the recess at the end of July knowing that we have put on the statute book the first building block, and have taken a step in the right direction. However, if we are simply obliged to sign up to the Bill because if we do not we will all be condemned to the outer darkness for failing to appreciate public anger and respond to it, we will do ourselves and everybody else a grave disservice.</p>

	<p pid="b.125.0/1">This has been a lively debate. I believe that we must act now to build on the interim measures that the former Speaker announced in his statement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-19">19 May</phrase>. Given the public's concerns about the conduct of some Members of this House, it is incumbent on us to act decisively, and we need to keep coming back to that key point.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.0/2">From what we have heard in the debate tonight, I believe that the fundamental points are as follows. The current system of allowances clearly must be replaced. There should be independent scrutiny of our allowances and robust enforcement of the rules on financial interests to create a system in which our constituents and Members of this House can trust. We need, and will have, further discussion on the guidance issued to Members, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> referred, and on the declaration of outside interests, which so many hon. Members have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.0/3">Many hon. Members referred to privilege. It is true that privilege plays an important role in facilitating open and honest discussion in the House. However, in relation to the three new offences created by the Bill, there is no reason why privilege should be used to prevent proceedings against a Member of Parliament simply because that evidence relates to proceedings in Parliament. The public's reaction to the events that have unfolded in recent months has made it clear that they expect certain basic standards of behaviour from us, and many comments were made by hon. Members about the scale and extent of public concern outside this House.</p>

	<p pid="b.126.1/1">The shadow Leader of the House had a great deal more time than has been allocated to me. I want to give detailed answers to the points raised. If I cannot, they will need to follow in the next couple of days, or be put in writing to the hon. Members who asked the questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1713" name="Stuart Bell">the Member for Middlesbrough (Sir Stuart Bell)</phrase> talked about this being a time of crisis and of opportunity. He also talked about the too-close relationships between Members and those who were administering the system. As he rightly said in supporting the Bill, we have two days in Committee to discuss, to press and to probe, but he is also right to say that this is no time for parliamentary drag. We have ceded authority on the matter, and we should accept that.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">The right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> talked about representative government and whether the House mirrored the people it is elected to serve. I must correct his view that no Members of this House played a role in the information technology revolution, to choose one example from the long list that he gave. I thought that that was an astonishing thing to say. For a number of years before I entered this place, I worked in a variety of roles for one of the largest IT companies in the world, latterly as a field systems engineering manager. In fact, of the 2005 intake of Labour MPs, not only were a majority women, but a majority were people like me, who had worked in other roles before we came to this House&mdash;who had worked in IT, who had run their own companies, and who had been teachers. One had been a miner, and many others had other roles in our society. We need not have everything, when it comes to outside interests. People can have a career before they come to this place.</p>

	<p pid="b.126.2/1">I have a simple question. The Minister construes the argument on privilege in terms of why privilege could be released to prosecute Members, but does she not accept that the reverse is also true? If that freedom is permitted, could it not end up constraining people who are witnesses in Committee, and could not what is said in this House be pertinent to court cases, causing enormous problems?</p>

	<p pid="b.126.3/1">No. We do not accept that. We will return to the topic time and again over the next couple of days.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> spoke about voting against the Bill on matters of timetabling, and referred to the guidance and the distinction between gifts and donations. My right hon. and learned Friend the Leader of the House has said that there is a clear distinction between payments for which the Member is contracted to provide a service, and gifts and donations. If the guidance is not clear to Members, we can revisit that, but that is no reason not to move forward on the Bill. We can always redraft guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/3">The right hon. Gentleman asked a large number of questions, which we will cover when we debate clause 11. Any future change to the role of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards would be made only with the agreement of the Speaker and after an affirmative vote by the House, following consultation with both the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and the Committee that the right hon. Gentleman chairs. We will return to the issues that he raised about privilege on clause 10.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> raised issues to which we shall return over the next two days, on enforcement and the need for safeguards. The new Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority's powers are set out in clause 8(1), such as paying back wrong payments and correcting the register.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">The hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> urged us to spend more time on the Bill, as did a great many other hon. Members in their contributions this evening. I refer to the statements of the party leaders. The Leader of the Opposition said:</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/6" class="indent">&quot;We will back the establishment of a Parliamentary Standards Authority to supervise all matters relating to Members of Parliament's pay and expenses&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/7">and the leader of the Liberal party said:</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/8" class="indent">&quot;I also strongly welcome the move towards a Parliamentary Standards Authority and an MPs' code of conduct. These changes should be implemented immediately&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-06-10.799"><i> Official Report</i>, 10 June 2009; Vol. 493, c. 799-803</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/9">That is the basis on which we started to move forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/10">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> said that there was no mad hurry for the legislation, and argued for getting rid of redactions when we publish claims and receipts, and for exposing addresses. She also mentioned the complexity and the number of Committees with different functions. The issue of reducing redactions is being examined by the Members Estimate Committee, and I hope we will be able to publish the 2008-09 claims with much greater transparency. The complexity of structures can be reviewed in the weeks and months ahead, but it is important that we move to independent regulation and administration of our allowances.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>, who chairs the Justice Committee, spoke about clause 7 and expressed concern about due process and the human rights dimension. Despite his concerns, he said that he could see a case for setting up IPSA during the parliamentary recess. We must press ahead urgently. The right hon. Gentleman raised the subject of a privileges Act, which we could consider.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> argued for more time, as did many other hon. Members. There will be time to discuss the matter that he raised&mdash;the separation of the investigation function from the rest of the PSA. We can return to that. There is a strong determination that the investigation function should be separate from the PSA's other functions.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.3/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">The right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> referred to the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, and argued that cross-party discussions to forge the Bill were not the right way forward. He gave the example of Congress not setting its own remuneration, as we do not and will not do. There is no reason why the new developments should not interact, so the reviews by the SSRB on pay and pensions can interact with the new structures that we are setting up.</p>

	<p pid="b.127.0/1">The point about the Congress is that it does set its remuneration, but that comes into effect after an election. Congress is self-governing. It does not give away those powers. It makes its own decisions, but under constitutional amendment that takes effect after an election. I advocate the same system here.</p>

	<p pid="b.128.0/1">Indeed, but Congress has more regular elections than we do, so it is easier for Congress to decide the matter when an election is due fairly soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">The hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> re-organised his diary to be present, and he made a wide ranging contribution on the role of an MP. Many other Members spoke about the role of an MP. I disagree with the point that being an MP is not a full-time job, and that an MP's pay is not a salary. The hon. Gentleman and I&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.128.6/1">We will probably return to some of the points that were made in the debate, but, as I was saying, I regard my job as an MP as a full-time job, and I have done since I entered the House. It is dangerous to start saying that we can adequately do the job alongside other tasks. Since I have been a Member, I have been a member of a Select Committee and taken a specialist interest in various subjects, such as health and social care. Clearly, there is more than the constituency to represent, and now I have a ministerial role, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.6/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1579" name="Bernard Jenkin">The hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)</phrase> said that he supports the principle of independent regulation, and he raised a number of issues that the Parliamentary Reform Committee, under the chairmanship of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1478" name="Tony Wright">the Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase>, will look into. In fact, the latter part of the debate went into many issues that the new Parliamentary Reform Committee can look into. The hon. Member for North Essex, again, said that he did not think that being an MP was a full-time job; I disagree.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.6/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1589" name="Mark Durkan">the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> made a very important point that we would all do well to remember as we near the end of the debate: we should consider the worth of Parliament, show the public that we are not just taking care but that we do care, and set up structures in a way that he called being &quot;Kelly-ready&quot;. That might be another phrase that we can take forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.6/4">The hon. Members for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman) and for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field) talked about the professionalisation of Parliament, to which other Members had referred, and the separation of powers, and they were even concerned about judges flexing their muscles. I think that we will return to those aspects of the debate over the next couple of days.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.6/5">Cynicism has crept in, with the suspicion that there is a culture of them and us and of box-ticking. We definitely do want to move away from the &quot;What we can get away with&quot; culture, and I hope that, as the debate unfolds, we can agree on the principles that there should be a more transparent system of regulation and independent oversight. We have the platform on which we can move forward to discuss the detail of the Bill in a Committee of the whole House&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.129.2/1">The Bill should sweep away the old system of MPs' self-regulation in which people no longer have any confidence, and it will pave the way for a new system of independent and transparent regulation. As my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary said earlier, the Bill is a result of some early constructive discussion, and I hope that, over the next couple of days, we can return to the very constructive discussions that we had with Opposition Members. Until today, there was constructive discussion, and there was agreement and consensus.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.2/2">There has been further consideration of amendments, and we can look at all such issues. Today, we have indicated that we will accept the amendment to clause 6, so we can and should move forward on that basis. We can return to the issue of the Parliamentary Reform Committee, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.137.2/1">I am grateful to have secured this debate, because it is on an important and complex issue, and I believe that there is a common-sense way to deal with it. I am also pleased to see the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" name="Jonathan R Shaw">the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw)</phrase> in his place, because he has some knowledge about asbestos in relation to social housing, which is what the debate is about.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.2/2">The debate centres on a report that was recently compiled for the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians by two ladies, Linda Waldman and Heather Williams, who have brought to the attention of UCATT a number of important issues. I want to talk about three of them tonight. First, I want to draw to the Minister's attention the size of the problem. Secondly, I want to refer to the research in the paper, because it relates to a great deal of the current research and gives us an opportunity to consider the recommendations that have been made. Thirdly, I want to suggest to the Minister that he might think about taking some of the recommendations on board, as they would bring about the changes required without a prohibitive capital outlay.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.2/3">The Minister will be aware that asbestos causes a range of diseases: asbestosis, pleural plaques, pleural thickening, lung cancer and mesothelioma. The latter two diseases are unrelated to dosage, and it is thought that just a small exposure can lead to mesothelioma. I want to bring his attention to a study done by the British Lung Foundation in January last year, which set out to explore how wide people's knowledge of the dangers of asbestos was. It commissioned a survey of 399 tradespeople in January 2008, and the respondents were made up of plumbers, builders, carpenters, electricians, joiners and gas fitters of varying ages. The results showed that a third of tradespeople admitted to not being well informed about asbestos, and three in 10 incorrectly believed that asbestos had now been removed from all UK buildings. There is great ignorance about asbestos. Last year, there were more than 2,000 mesothelioma deaths in the UK, which has led some to suggest that the UK has a mesothelioma epidemic.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.2/4">The TUC argues that there are at least twice as many deaths from lung cancer caused by exposure to asbestos as there are mesothelioma deaths. Therefore, perhaps 6,000 to 8,000 deaths per year are caused by exposure to asbestos.</p>

	<p pid="b.137.3/1">The work done by my hon. Friend on this issue is incredible, but does he agree that we need to step up the campaign, as some people think that because asbestos has been banned, and some buildings have been stripped out, the problem is declining? However, there is a time lag with mesothelioma, so the number of cases will increase in the next 10 years, which people do not yet appreciate.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.137.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" speakername="Michael Clapham" colnum="137"  time="022:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0022.htm#0906306000788">
	<p pid="b.137.4/1">I agree entirely with my right hon. Friend. We will see the number of cases increase until about 2015, then plateau and fall way by 2050. Tradespeople working on maintenance jobs who are exposed to asbestos are likely to develop mesothelioma, so it is important to consider what action might be taken on asbestos in houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/2">As the Minister will know, asbestos was a common house building material from the 1930s until the 1980s. It was famed for its insulation and fire-proofing qualities. During that period, all forms of asbestos will have been used in house building: blue, brown and white. Blue and brown were banned in this country in 1985, and white was banned in November 1999. However, it is estimated that asbestos is in 90 per cent. of public sector housing, and the Health and Safety Executive estimates that 1.5 million workplaces contain asbestos.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/3">There is ample evidence&mdash;this point is taken up by Waldman and Williams&mdash;that white asbestos is clearly associated with mesothelioma cancer. In that respect, I refer to a quote, which the two researchers used, from McCulloch and Tweedale's book, &quot;Defending the Indefensible: The Global Asbestos Industry and its Fight for Survival&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/4" class="indent">&quot;In reviewing the science, it is important to remember that asbestos is such a toxic material that even relatively trivial exposure can result in serious or fatal injury. For that reason, one might have expected physicians and allied scientists to have led the campaigns against the mineral and against the companies that produced it.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/5" class="indent">Yet...not only was the medical profession's reaction to the asbestos hazard often feeble, but scientists have been among the industry's most strident defenders. There are two reasons why that was so: corporate suppression and intimidation meant that criticism of the industry came at a price.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/6" class="indent">Another factor was the convergence of the economic, political, and social interests of the scientific establishment and commerce. Careers could be made from industry-sponsored research. No-one commissioned research on behalf of asbestos workers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/7">I think that that sums up clearly what we face when we talk about asbestos in the housing industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/8">Many of the people who will be exposed to asbestos are repairs and maintenance workers. As the Minister will be aware, local authorities, arm's length management organisations and housing associations provide secure tenancies, covered by the Housing Act 1985, which set out landlords' duties and tenants' responsibilities. Repairs are undertaken when a property is vacated and designated as void, but because local authorities need to turn these vacant houses over very quickly, very little has been done to monitor those houses and either to remove asbestos or to ensure that its location is recorded. There are some exceptions, one notable example of which is the London borough of Havering. Its ALMO set out to work with residents and rather than trying to sweep the issue of asbestos under the carpet, it has engaged with residents in dealing with the management of asbestos in its property portfolio.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/9">In addition to the tensions caused by wanting to get the properties back into use so that rent can be earned, another issue at the core of the debate is the contradiction that results from the respective demands arsing from the landlords' responsibility for repairs and the tenants' rights to shape their houses into homes. The landlord is responsible for finding where the asbestos is, certainly within the communal areas, if not in the internal house, but the contradiction arises when the person living in the house wants to shape it to become a home because decorating and modifying the house might bring him into contact with asbestos, particularly if there is no register to show that the presence of asbestos has been identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/10">Although social landlords have a particular responsibility, it has never really been shared with the residents, enabling them to work together. As the Minister knows, landlords now have a legal responsibility to keep an asbestos register, but that has not always been the case. Even now we find circumstances in which councils do not take the residents into consideration: they will look at the asbestos register and some will keep it up to date; others will not. The register therefore fails to act as it should to help residents living in those houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/11">As I say, it is quite different in Havering borough, which has engaged with its residents and worked out an approach together to manage the asbestos in the housing stock. The result is that people who know where the asbestos is can carry out modifications to their houses without exposure to asbestos fibre.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/12">The Health and Safety Executive approach, which, as the Minister knows, is more accepted by social landlords, is to manage asbestos in situ and contain it. It believes that that practice is much safer than trying to remove it. That approach is based on risk assessment and individual responsibility. The authors of the report, entitled &quot;As Safe as Houses?&quot;, argue that that stance &quot;fails to recognise&quot; the context in which asbestos is found in domestic dwellings or the desire of people actually to turn their houses into homes. That is where a contradiction arises. I believe that the asbestos register can could be used to make residents aware of where the asbestos is, and that it can be dealt with in a way that will not cause injury to health.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/13">It was, to a degree, in recognition of that fact that following the implementation of the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006, the Health and Safety Executive ran a major asbestos awareness campaign under the slogan &quot;Asbestos&mdash;The hidden killer&quot;. An evaluation of the campaign suggests that it worked, and that tradesmen became aware of the dangers. The downside was that it did not include the residents of homes containing asbestos.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/14">The asbestos register is an important tool because it gives information to contractors doing work on premises and to members of the emergency services, but residents, including home owners, are left to decorate or modify their homes facing the likelihood of being exposed to asbestos. We need a two-pronged approach. We need to establish where the asbestos is, using the register, and, having done that, to establish the stage of its erosion. We then need to ensure that advice is provided so that residents can choose either to leave the asbestos in situ or to remove it.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/15">The authors of the report made eight recommendations. I do not know whether the Minister has had time to look at them. One of the most important is that the current legislation needs to be extended</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/16" class="indent">&quot;to ensure that the duty to manage is extended to the internal part&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/17">of the domestic dwelling. It must be borne in mind that such dwellings become workplaces for maintenance workers as well as posing a danger to residents. The report also suggests that power tools should display a symbol advising users to check that they are not working on asbestos, and that there should be training to increase the asbestos awareness of all social housing staff and resident association representatives and training for maintenance workers, tradesmen and caretakers involved in social housing projects. I referred the Minister to the British Lung Foundation survey, which showed that few tradesmen were aware of the dangers. The final recommendation is that</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/18" class="indent">&quot;Regular public information campaigns should alert DIY enthusiasts of the dangers of asbestos&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.4/19">Implementation of the eight recommendations in the report, which the Minister can read, would create a rational way of dealing with asbestos without an enormous capital outlay.</p>

	<p pid="b.140.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> on his success in securing this important debate. I echo the tribute paid by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" name="John Battle">the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle)</phrase> to the work that he has done in bringing the matter to the House's attention and ensuring, along with others, that workers are given better protection from asbestosis and mesothelioma. I represent the area of a former shipyard in Chatham which is one of the hot spots in the south-east of England, and my constituents owe my hon. Friend a debt of thanks.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.0/2">I thank the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, for which I have enormous respect and with which I have worked in the past, for commissioning the report to which my hon. Friend referred. I also thank Dr. Linda Waldman and Heather Williams for their work, which will contribute to improving the current controls that are in place to protect their members and the wider work force from exposure to asbestos.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.0/3">In terms of fatal disease, asbestos is the most serious occupational ill-health problem that the country faces. The Government are concerned about the human suffering and misery behind the annual death toll, estimated at over 4,000 a year. Sadly, while there is nothing that we can do about those previously exposed, we can certainly do much to prevent further exposures. First, I will outline the legislation covering some of the issues raised in the report, and then I will comment on each of the report's main recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.0/4">Legislation in the mid-1980s banned the importation of the most dangerous types of asbestos. As the carcinogenic effects of asbestos became known, legislation was introduced in the 1990s leading to the total ban on the importation of all types of asbestos and prohibiting the use and sale of products containing asbestos. Research by Professor Julian Peto and Health and Safety Executive epidemiologists in 1995 showed that the largest group of workers at risk from asbestos-related disease were those in the maintenance and building-related trades such as carpenters, plumbers and electricians who disturbed building fabric.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.0/5">Consequently, we introduced for the first time in the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 a duty to manage asbestos in non-domestic premises. That duty places a legal obligation on individuals who have responsibility for the repair and maintenance of non-domestic buildings to manage the risks from exposure to asbestos that may be in their buildings. Duty holders are required to identify the location and condition of any materials containing asbestos in their buildings. They must then assess the level of risk and put in place a management plan to manage those risks. Asbestos that is in good condition should be left undisturbed. Damaged asbestos must be encapsulated or removed by licensed contractors if necessary. The duty holder must ensure that the management plan and other pertinent information are readily available when maintenance or renovation work is planned or undertaken. They should ensure that the information on the location and condition of the materials is given to anyone likely to disturb it.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.0/6">In considering the recommendation to extend the duty to manage to domestic buildings, we have to look at the scale of the risks that may arise. For those whose activities are liable to disturb asbestos frequently, the risk is cumulative through repeated exposures. In the context of this debate, we need to understand what the risk is from asbestos in all homes. A recent study, commissioned by the HSE, found no evidence of an increased risk of mesothelioma from carrying out DIY activities or living in certain types of buildings more likely to contain asbestos, such as high-rise flats, prefab houses, and council or ex-council houses.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.0/7">While the analyses of non-occupational exposures in this study were based on relatively small numbers of cases and controls, and therefore have limited ability to detect small increases in risk, it is clear that such exposures do not represent major sources of mesothelioma risk. The only association between increased mesothelioma risk and exposure in a domestic setting was for people living with workers in jobs classified as medium or high risk before the age of 30. While anecdotal evidence provides examples of distress in specific situations, our policies have to take into account the whole context.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2009-06-29b.141.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" speakername="Jonathan R Shaw" colnum="141"  time="022:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090629/debtext/90629-0023.htm#0906306000791">
	<p pid="b.141.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, and I shall come on to home information packs later in my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/2">The duty to manage asbestos was introduced so that the risks from the thousands of tonnes of asbestos still present in non-domestic premises would be consistently managed. Those working on those buildings, such as plumbers, electricians and other maintenance workers, often do not know they are at risk from disturbing the material or if their work is putting others in the building at risk. The principles underlying the approach are evidence-based and proportionate towards compliance.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/3">I shall now cover the specific recommendations of the UCATT report, starting with those that would require a legislative change. The report has made several recommendations with regard to private housing. The first is that the duty to manage should be extended to private households and the second is that it should be made mandatory for asbestos surveys to be undertaken at the point of sale.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/4">My right hon. and hon. Friends will be aware that most residential properties now require a home information pack. That pack may include a home condition report, although that is not mandatory. Voluntary take-up of the report has been low. Although there is clearly a demand for information on the condition of the property, the report in its present format is not seen as the right means of achieving that by the home buyers, sellers or the industry more widely.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/5">I understand from colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government, who have responsibility for the issue, that a working group has been established to explore alternative options for ensuring that consumers have appropriate information about a property's condition. The working group is not specifically looking at environmental matters that might affect homes, such as asbestos. The issue of whether and how the presence of asbestos in a home could be reflected in any new reporting arrangements is a matter for the industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/6">The UCATT-commissioned report recommends that the duty to manage regulation is also extended to social housing and that asbestos surveys are also made mandatory for such housing. The Health and Safety Executive is currently evaluating the impact of the duty to manage regulation and that will inform any decision on amending, replacing or extending the scope of the regulations. The UCATT report will form part of the evidence for the HSE's evaluation. We hope that it will be able to conclude that evaluation in the autumn.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/7">The last recommendation of the report that would require legislative change is that warning symbols should be displayed on power tools to alert users to the dangers of working with asbestos, as my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone mentioned. The HSE will reflect on that helpful suggestion, which I believe is aimed at influencing behaviour. It might be that legislation is not the best way to influence the behaviours of workers and do-it-yourself enthusiasts. HSE research has concluded that media campaigns such as the recent hidden killer campaign, to which my hon. Friend referred, are the most effective method to influence behaviour. He mentioned the British Lung Foundation survey and its concern that workers were not aware of the dangers. I would hope that if that survey were carried out now, it would find that the hidden killer campaign has raised awareness and done what we all want to do by changing behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/8">Follow-up research showed that the campaign was successful in raising awareness of the risks and appropriate precautions. In addition, 71 per cent. of workers also said that they either had taken, or were planning to take, a more precautionary approach to avoid exposure to asbestos at work. I think that we would all welcome that. The HSE is working in partnership with key stakeholders from the supply chain to increase the availability of all essential protective equipment recommended by the HSE to allow workers to work safely with asbestos.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/9">I shall now focus on the report's recommendations on the provision of training and campaign activity. I welcome the recommendation to prioritise asbestos hazards in training provision for maintenance workers. The Government fully agree with the need for improved knowledge about asbestos, where it may be encountered and the appropriate precautions to take. The asbestos at work regulations already require training to be given to those at work who might disturb materials containing asbestos, even inadvertently. There are now many providers of such training. Most are members of the UK Asbestos Training Association, which the HSE helped to establish.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/10">For other workers who might be exposed to asbestos, employers already have a general legal duty to provide training and instruction to allow their general duty of care to be met. Employers who undertake work in demolition or maintenance, or any other work that is liable to expose employees to asbestos, have a separate duty to assess whether asbestos is present or is liable to be present, or to assume that it is present and then to take all the necessary precautions to prevent exposure to asbestos fibres.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/11">On the specific issue raised by UCATT, the training provided for local authority and other staff in the housing sector should already include knowledge of asbestos where that is appropriate to their role. The Government, through the HSE, will continue to promote relevant occupational health and safety training in the context of the risks that employees face. The HSE recognises the importance of maintaining that work and, in partnership with many, including UCATT, will continue to raise awareness.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/12">The UCATT report also calls for a review of the content of all current training provision for maintenance workers. The Government agree that maintenance workers, particularly apprentices and young trainees, need to be aware of the risks of asbestos. The HSE has already recognised that, is working with a major training provider linked to the union UNITE and plans to extend this to other key training and syllabus-setting bodies. The HSE intends to influence national vocational qualification and other course content in this sector, as it has in other sectors. That approach, together with the legal requirements in the asbestos regulations for those already in the workplace, should lead to a much better informed younger work force.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/13">Similarly, as I outlined earlier on the labelling of power tools, any campaign must be based on evidence of what works best and needs to be underpinned by research and impact assessment. It is worth noting that independent research confirmed that the HSE's campaigns targeting the building maintenance work force were effective in reaching and influencing their target audience&mdash;maintenance workers. The general public also noticed the campaign messages, and the HSE is planning a smaller campaign to maintain the impetus this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.1/14">In conclusion, I confirm to my hon. Friend that the Government have done much since 1997, as a result of his badgering and hard work, to strengthen the legislation and control mechanisms concerning asbestos. That includes the total ban on the importation and use of asbestos&mdash;</p>
