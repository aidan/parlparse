	<p pid="a.428.2/1">The Government's goal is to halve the number of people without access to a bank accounts. We have established a &pound;120 million financial inclusion fund and an independent financial inclusion taskforce, which has recently reported to me that we are making good progress towards that goal. I can tell the House today that we have appointed two new members of the taskforce: Bridget McIntyre, the UK chief executive of Royal and Sun Alliance, and Danielle Walker Palmour, director of the Friends Provident Foundation.</p>

	<p pid="a.430.0/1">I thank the Minister for that answer, and he is right that the terms of the Commission's communication to the Council of the European Union are disappointing. Is he telling the House that that communication effectively kills the application for the derogation, as it is, of course, a communication to the Council? What can we do to ensure that the necessary pumps and facilities will be put in place in every marina and pier that will require them before <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase>? I have pursued the Minister on that point for a number of years. The issue could have been dealt with much more quickly and much sooner, if he had had the backbone to deal with it.</p>

	<p pid="a.431.7/1">As chair of the all-party BBC group, I accept that my hon. Friend is more interested in the size of the licence fee than its statistical classification. However, he follows these things closely, so he knows that the licence fee has risen by 15 per cent. above inflation since 1997. He knows, too, that the BBC's income has risen above that because of the growth in the number of households and improved clamping-down on evasion of the licence fee. We can settle the new licence fee for the next period at a level that is fair to the BBC and to the licence fee payer, and that allows the BBC to lead and fund the digital switchover, while sure that it is available to everyone in the country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-07a.441.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="441"  time="011:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061207/debtext/61207-0003.htm#06120759001154">
	<p pid="a.441.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the business up to the recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.3/2">Yesterday, in the United States, the Iraq study group published its report. It is a chilling commentary on the management of the Iraq war and its aftermath. The Prime Minister is in the United States today for talks with President Bush following the report's publication. Undoubtedly those talks will cover not only the report but the response of both Governments to its findings, and proposals for the future of our involvement in Iraq. May we have a statement from the Prime Minister before the recess on the Iraq study group report and future UK involvement in Iraq?</p>
	<p pid="a.441.3/3">The Department of Trade and Industry is expected to issue a report on the future of the Post Office next week. It should cover support for rural post offices and the replacement for the Post Office card account. Can the Leader of the House confirm that there will be an oral statement from the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry so that Members can question him on the report? Given that the subject is of great concern to Members in all parts of the House, as Government decisions have led to the closure of many post offices&mdash;not just in rural areas, but in urban areas such as Ross road and Woodlands Park in my constituency&mdash;may we have a debate on the future of the Post Office in the new year, in Government time?</p>
	<p pid="a.441.3/4">The Leader of the House will be aware that new procedures have been introduced for the Committee stages of Bills. The House voted on them only a few weeks ago. Among other things, the new procedures allow Public Bill Committees to take evidence during consideration of Bills. I think that when the Leader of the House said that they would come into force after <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase>, many Members thought that that meant that any Committees sitting after that date would be able to take public evidence. However, I understand that the new procedures will not apply to any Bill introduced&mdash;not just any that has had its Second Reading&mdash;before <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase>. That means, for example, that the Committee on the Greater London Authority Bill will not be able to take evidence from either the Mayor of London or from London borough council leaders. Is that another sleight of hand by the Government, or will the Leader of the House reconsider, to ensure that the will of the House is put into practice?</p>
	<p pid="a.441.3/5">Yesterday the Chancellor gave us the pre-Budget report. There is a pattern to such things&mdash;Labour Members cheer them on the day in the House, and a few days later the Chancellor's promises start to unravel. This one, however, started unravelling as soon as he sat down. Not only did he give us reheated spin on education and fail to mention the crisis in the NHS once&mdash;which, I presume, means that he supports the cuts in the NHS&mdash;but his claim to be addressing green issues struck a false note. Under this Government, carbon emissions have gone up and the burden of green taxes has fallen. The verdict on the Chancellor from Ed Matthews of Friends of the Earth was:</p>
	<p pid="a.441.3/6" class="indent">&quot;I would give him probably one out of 10...I think it's pretty feeble really. He's got a terrible record. For 10 years he's failed to provide a green budget.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.441.3/7">Hon. Members may recall that earlier this year, in the Budget, the Chancellor promised</p>
	<p pid="a.441.3/8" class="indent">&quot;to radically reform vehicle excise duty...introducing...a zero rate for a small number of cars with the very lowest carbon emissions&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 295.]</p>
	<p pid="a.441.3/9">As it turned out, no cars eligible for that zero-rated road tax are currently available to buy in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.3/10">Yesterday we heard about zero-carbon homes. The Chancellor announced</p>
	<p pid="a.441.3/11" class="indent">&quot;plans to ensure that within 10 years every new home will be a zero-carbon home&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-06">6 December 2006</phrase>; Vol. 454, c. 309.]</p>
	<p pid="a.441.3/12">Last night on &quot;Newsnight&quot;, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury said that there were already some zero-carbon homes in the UK. How many are there? He was not quite sure. Where are they? In a development somewhere, he said. What part of the country are they in? He did not know. So&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-07a.442.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" speakername="Jack Straw" colnum="442"  time="011:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061207/debtext/61207-0004.htm#06120759001157">
	<p pid="a.442.2/1">The right hon. Lady asked me first about the Iraq study group's important and timely report. The Prime Minister will give his initial reactions to that at a press conference later today in Washington&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Oh!&quot;] Well, that is where he is. Even with his great skills, there is no way that he can suddenly whisk back here to make a statement. On the issue of a statement, it is not usual to make statements on bilateral visits of that kind. There will, of course, be Prime Minister's questions next Wednesday&mdash;<i> [Interruption.] </i>It will be good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.2/2">On the Post Office, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry intends to make an oral statement. As the right hon. Lady is trying to help position her party as an alternative Government&mdash;I am glad to notice the smirking laughter from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase> with regard to that statement&mdash;let me say that the idea that &quot;the Government are to blame for the closure of post offices&quot; is simply incorrect. Post office closures have been caused by technological changes that have led to a catastrophic drop in customers, which would have happened under any Government. What would not have happened under the previous Government, however, is the &pound;2 billion of additional subsidy to help rural post offices in particular, many of which have fewer than 15 to 20 customers a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.2/3">On Committee stages of Bills, I do not have the exact text of what I said, but I made it clear when introducing the measures that we were putting before the House a plan that the default setting of evidence sessions should apply in respect of Bills that had their Second Reading after <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase>. I am pretty certain that I said to the House that, for that reason, we anticipated that only five Bills or so would have the procedure during the current Session.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.2/4">However, on the Greater London Authority Bill and the Offender Management Bill, I undertake, without commitment, to talk to my right hon. Friends who are handling those Bills to see whether they are willing to introduce such sessions. There is no sleight of hand; we proposed the measure to ensure that this change, which is of profound importance to the way in which the House scrutinises Bills, gets properly bedded in.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.2/5">Lastly, at some length, the right hon. Lady went on about yesterday's brilliant statement by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The problem that the Conservative party has is that we have had an unparalleled rate of economic success over the last 10 years, which puts into dismal perspective the record of the previous Government. She asks for a statement; we had a statement yesterday.</p>

	<p pid="a.444.2/1">On the first item that the hon. Gentleman raises about the Iraq survey group, we accept that that is an important review and, as I have told the House, the Prime Minister will answer questions here for half an hour next Wednesday. The hon. Gentleman asks for a debate as well. I cannot promise that there will be a debate on Iraq, or foreign policy more generally, before Christmas, but I shall certainly note that he has made a request for one after Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.2/2">The hon. Gentleman also asks whether we can have better opportunities to debate estimates. The Modernisation Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into the use of non-legislative time in this House&mdash;which I think is eccentrically distributed at present&mdash;and I hope that he will put forward his own evidence on that, as I think he has raised an important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.2/3">I note what the hon. Gentleman says about the BBC licence fee, and on his final point, on which I think it is fair to say that he was blowing his own trumpet&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.446.2/1">Last week, the Leader of the House turned down a request for a debate on home helps no longer being provided for many frail and vulnerable people. At the same as that he turned down that request, a 90-year-old war veteran in a wheelchair was in my constituency office because he had been assessed as being ineligible for a home help. How can a warm-hearted, generous Leader of the House such as my right hon. Friend grant a debate on fisheries next week, but refuse one on the frail and vulnerable being denied home helps?</p>

	<p pid="a.450.3/1">Given the Prime Minister's shameful refusal to come to the House to respond to the Iraq Study Group report, we will have plenty of time to discuss future passport policy. Will the Leader of the House keep in mind early-day motion 336?</p>
	<p pid="a.450.3/2" class="italic"> [That this House notes that it is the intention of the Government that from the Spring of 2007 all first-time applicants for a passport shall present themselves for a personal interview and that from 2009 all applicants for a passport, including renewals, shall present themselves for an interview; further notes that the numbers involved are very great, being over 650,000 in 2007 and rising to an annual figure of around 6,500,000 in 2009 and beyond; believes that the provision of 69 interview offices to meet the demand will be quite inadequate for the purpose; and calls on Ministers to reconsider these proposals, in any event to greatly increase the number of interview offices that will be available, and to abandon the general requirement that applicants for renewal of passports shall submit themselves for a personal interview.]</p>
	<p pid="a.450.3/3">The proposal for personal interviews for all passport applicants, including renewals, is a catastrophe waiting to happen and the House needs to discuss it so that we can call on the Government to change their policy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-07a.455.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1836" speakername="James Purnell" colnum="455"  time="012:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061207/debtext/61207-0006.htm#06120759001203">
	<p pid="a.455.0/1">I welcome the fact that the hon. Gentleman will not be voting against the measures. I was looking at the exchanges from last year, when he was teasing my predecessor about welfare reform. It is interesting to look back. The hon. Gentleman said that the Government were dithering about incapacity benefit reform. We are now legislating on it. He said that the Government would do nothing about the Turner report. We have now brought forward a Bill on it. He said that the Government would do nothing about the Child Support Agency. We have a White Paper due shortly. It is quite clear that, over the last year, there has been real progress on welfare reform. We are legislating to implement the things that he said last year we would do nothing about. I am glad that he recognises that and that the Opposition support us on quite a lot of this.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/2">In answer to the hon. Gentleman's detailed questions, I think that the rate of inflation that he referred to is the pensioner poverty index, which is a technical measure. It is related only to the proportion of pensioners who get most of their income from the state&mdash;75 per cent., I think. Of course, the vast majority of them are on pension credit and their pension credit will go up in line with earnings. We are the first Government to do that. They used to have to live on &pound;68.80; it is now going up to nearly &pound;120. We have committed to continue to do that in relation to earnings. In fact, we are going to legislate for that. I am sure that the Conservatives will join us in voting for that to continue to be uprated in line with earnings, because that is the certainty that the poorest pensioners in our country deserve. Of course, there is always more that we can do on pensioner poverty. However, it is worth remembering that when we came to power there were more than 3 million pensioners in poverty. Now there are fewer than 1 million. That has been achieved only because of the policies that we put in place&mdash;policies that the Opposition have opposed at every single stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/3">The hon. Gentleman asked what more we could do to increase take-up. We are doing exactly that. I am happy to provide him with a briefing on the pensions transformation programme, which is one of the leading programmes on that in the world. It is making a significant difference. The National Audit Office, which reported on the Pension Service recently, made it clear that good progress had been made. It made some suggestions&mdash;in particular, about how we can reach the poorest pensioners in our society and how we can make sure that pensioners claim all the benefits that they are entitled to&mdash;which we will look at. I urge any Member of the House who is worried about this matter to go on a visit to look at how the local service is helping people to claim their benefits, and to see the real progress that is being made and the way that that is transforming the incomes of some of the poorest pensioners in our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/4">As part of that programme, we are responding to the point that the hon. Gentleman made about council tax benefit. We want more pensioners to be able to claim that and there is a radical new way for them to do so. There is now a three-page form where there used to be a 26-page-form. Claims can be made over the phone in a matter of minutes. We are looking forward to that starting to make a big difference. As I said in my statement, we are already paying out &pound;30 million extra in backdated claims because of the data matching exercise that we did.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/5">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of incapacity benefit reform. As he knows, there is a major Bill going through the House on that. I thought that he was slightly churlish in not acknowledging the fact that there are now 900,000 more disabled people in work than there were before and not acknowledging the great success of pathways to work, which is recognised by independent experts as one of the most successful programmes anywhere in the world for people who are on inactive benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.0/6">The hon. Gentleman finished by talking about fraud and simplification, which is an important subject. Our simplification unit is constantly looking at ways of simplifying benefits. For example, we have just announced a radical simplification of the state second pension system, which will mean that people will know that they will get &pound;1.40 a week extra in retirement for every year that they care or contribute. We are always looking for opportunities to simplify the system, not least because that can help to reduce error and to deal with fraud. It is worth remembering that, before we came to power, the Tories never even measured what fraud was going on in the system. We have reduced fraud in income support and jobseeker's allowance by two thirds. That is another area where we have made significant progress and one that I hope that the House will welcome.</p>

	<p pid="a.463.3/1">On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December</phrase>, the Under-Secretary of State for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">the Home Department, the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)</phrase>, responded to my question about potential cuts in the integrated drug treatment programme by saying that he did not accept that the Government had cut the programme. I have since had the opportunity to check the position. Paul Hayes, the chief executive of the National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse confirmed that the &pound;28 million pledged to the scheme for 2006-07 would be &quot;scaled back&quot; to just &pound;12 million. I checked in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; that the definition of &quot;cut&quot; is &quot;reduce&quot; or &quot;cease&quot;, so do you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, share my concern that the Minister may have inadvertently misled the House and that the position needs to be corrected?</p>

	<p pid="a.478.0/1">I take on board your earlier comments about trying to be brief, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.0/2">I represent a rural constituency. As most hon. Members appreciate, concerns about affordability are not restricted to urban areas. In our sparsely populated rural area we experience many problems similar to those in urban areas. The main difference is lack of delivery in rural areas. House building has focused in and around urban areas, and funding from the Government to support affordable housing has followed. That was brought home to those of us who serve on the Public Accounts Committee&mdash;it is good to see other members of it here&mdash;earlier this week when we considered the National Audit Office report, &quot;A Foot on the Ladder: Low Cost Home Ownership Assistance&quot;, which forcefully made the point that house prices are rising fast and incomes are relatively static, especially in rural areas, and the problem is getting worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.0/3">The NAO identified &pound;112 million of efficiency savings that could be made from the implementation of the Government's policies on supporting affordable housing. Redeployment in the way that the NAO suggests would help more than 4,000 people into affordable housing. I hope that the Department will take note of that and try to implement some of the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.0/4">I have recently been lobbied by the Midlands United group of housing associations, which has made a submission to the Chancellor for the comprehensive spending review, pointing out some of the impact of the lack of priority afforded to the midlands, especially rural areas, in recent years. The east and west midlands have almost one fifth of the country's housing stock but receive less than 15 per cent. of public funding for housing. Last year, just under 30,000 new homes were built in the midlands, but only just over 3,200 were affordable homes. That is not good enough. The needs of the area are acute.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.0/5">One reason for the lack of priority is that no funding has been provided through the Government funding mechanisms for key workers who live outside London, the east and the south-east. That means that, of the &pound;470 million that the Government spent last year on their affordable housing schemes, &pound;221 million was spent on key workers, but not a single pound was spent outside those areas. None of that was spent in the midlands or in the north. One reason for that is that we are labouring under an excessively centralised housing allocation. The new regional spatial strategies grant unelected regional assemblies the ability to allocate houses according to their priorities. Not surprisingly, that tends to focus house building and growth on the larger population centres. For example, in the west midlands, of housing is being allocated to the urban areas, leaving the rural areas to pick up the scraps.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.0/6">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" name="Andrew Stunell">the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase> that we should consider local determination based on local priorities, and provide much more flexibility for local authorities to decide how many houses they should build and where they should build them.</p>

	<p pid="a.481.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>, the Chair of the Select Committee, on its report, and on the fact that the Committee is also undertaking an inquiry into the social housing element. I shall be concentrating on social housing in my speech today. Like other hon. Members, I want to emphasise that a key issue is supply. We have seen a 30 per cent. fall in lettings in the social housing sector since 1999-2000, and a decline in the overall stock in the social rented sector of 238,000 units, mostly as a consequence of the right to buy.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.0/2">We have seen a welcome upturn in new housing provision recently, particularly in London but also in other parts of the country, but this has to been considered in the context of a continuing fall in supply that outstrips provision. Last year in London, for example, 6,037 additional affordable homes were constructed, but 11,549 were sold through the right to buy. It is important that we consider both sides of the equation and concentrate on the broader picture if we are to address what is nothing less than a crisis in the provision of social housing to meet the needs of our population.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.0/3">I want to make a couple of remarks about the impact of the fall in provision of social housing on community cohesion, a subject that is dear to my heart. There is no doubt that many cities&mdash;London in particular&mdash;are experiencing an exacerbation of community tensions as a consequence of the competition for the scarce resource of housing. We must also recognise that the impact of homelessness and overcrowding falls disproportionately on black and minority ethnic communities. The figures show that 12 per cent. of white households live in overcrowded accommodation, while 35 per cent. of black and minority ethnic households do so. The figure for Bangladeshi families is 62 per cent. The impact is disproportionate. Not only do our minority communities&mdash;particularly our Muslim communities&mdash;bear the brunt of housing need, but the settled migrant communities and white households in parts of London that are experiencing changes in their communities as a result of population movement are themselves deeply anxious about those changes and resentful of the fact that their sons and daughters are unable to obtain properties either to buy or to rent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-07a.485.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1610" speakername="Greg Hands" colnum="485"  time="014:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061207/debtext/61207-0010.htm#06120759001282">
	<p pid="a.485.0/1">I am a member of the Select Committee that produced the report, although I was not a member of the Committee for the duration of the inquiry. I, for one, do not agree with all the report's findings, but I hope that it has been a helpful contribution to what is becoming a more extensive and pressing debate. I am also vice-chairman of the all-party arm's length management organisations group, and I represent a constituency in which about a third of housing stock is social housing, which is well above the national average but round about the London average.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.0/2">My position is to support in general more house building. It seems that some of that building will inevitably have to be on greenfield land, which I support somewhat reluctantly, although it is not the same as supporting construction on green belt land, about which I have severe reservations, as I do about the Government's approach announced earlier this week.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.0/3">My constituency suffers badly from the phenomenon of lack of affordability of private housing. The <i> Evening Standard</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December</phrase> included an article entitled, &quot;Has it ever been harder to buy a house in London?&quot; The picture that accompanied the article is of Wingate road in Hammersmith W6. According to the caption, a four-bedroomed house with garden, with an asking price of &pound;750,000, was sold for &pound;866,000 within a week. Affordability is a very large issue in my constituency. In central London, the average home price, as distinct from house price, is about to break through the &pound;500,000 barrier.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.0/4">I also want to reflect on another phenomenon that is getting coverage and interest at the moment: flight from London. That is a growing problem, and a report in the <i> Evening Standard</i> today says that about 250,00 people per annum are leaving London. My constituency has one of the highest population turnover rates in Britain of 20 to 25 per cent. each year. It is also now the second largest constituency in Britain in terms of population, after the Isle of Wight. Therefore, a lot of people are moving out, but even more are moving in.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.0/5">My constituency is also the second youngest in Britain after Battersea, and is among the top 10 for the location of young professionals. I want to address many of my comments to the problems that face young professionals and young families in getting on the housing ladder, including the private rented sector, in London and the south-east.</p>

	<p pid="a.493.0/1">Like other hon. Members, I warmly welcome the Select Committee's report and congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> on her introduction. I add my voice to those that have emphasised the importance of the point that the report makes about the need to increase radically the amount of social rented housing units to be built in the future. Shelter has urged that for some considerable time and I am pleased that the Committee endorsed it. I know how passionately my hon. Friend the Minister feels about it and she has rightly said that it will be considered during the comprehensive spending review. I have no doubt that she will make her points during that review and it is important that the message is also sent&mdash;from, I hope, both sides of the Chamber&mdash;that we wish to see a step change in the good work that is already being done by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/2">If we are to increase effectively the supply of affordable housing, it will involve a partnership between the Government, housing associations, social landlords, developers and, obviously, local government. I wish to say one or two words about the situation in Birmingham. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">There is no doubt, as the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> said, that overall housing investment in the west midlands needs to go up, and go up radically. But I have some concerns about the policies being pursued by the current administration on Birmingham city council. That is not to say that the previous administration, which was Labour, got everything right. It did not and other hon. Members and I had criticisms of it. Some of those points were brought out in a seminal report by Anne Power, who chaired an independent commission on council housing in Birmingham. Had the Labour administration remained in power, some important progress would have arisen from that report, but sadly the present administration has decided not to take up its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/3">The Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition that now runs Birmingham does not get everything wrong, however. It does some things right, but I have major concerns in two areas and I would appreciate my hon. Friend the Minister's comments on them when she replies to the debate. The first is the approach to meeting the decent homes strategy for the city. The way in which the council is approaching that might not be sustainable and could have a detrimental impact on the supply of affordable homes in the city. The second is the council's whole approach to tackling homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/4">The council has based its decent homes strategy on what it calls positive retention, which appears to be financed by a rush of land sales. I hope that I am proved wrong, but it is not clear to me that the figures add up in a way that would make the programme sustainable in the medium term. That is why it was wise of my hon. Friend the Minister to advise the council, in her letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-20">20 October</phrase>, that she is asking officials closely to monitor the programme to ensure that it is on target and continues to be financially viable. There are some concerns that it might not be so.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/5">The problems extend beyond whether the figures add up. There is also a real concern that the Conservative-Liberal Democrat administration's desire to raise as much money as possible from land sales could be pushing up land prices in a way that is not necessarily helpful in promoting house building in the social rented sector and the social housing sector generally that the Committee's report recommends and Birmingham certainly needs. Another unwelcome consequence of the administration's approach is that it is centrally driven and could end up inhibiting the development of the effective community engagement and locally based housing initiatives that are so important to building mixed, sustainable and safe communities. The independent housing commission that I mentioned emphasised that approach as very important.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/6">We have been pioneering that approach in my constituency of Northfield on a cross-party basis and I hope that the city council does not try to stifle what is being done or subsume it into models imposed from above. I have some concerns about that because I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1413" name="Stephen McCabe">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe)</phrase>&mdash;who, as a Whip, cannot speak for himself&mdash;has real worries about the way in which the city council has terminated a management agreement for the largest tenant-managed co-operative in the country in his constituency. I do not dispute that there are serious allegations against that management co-operative, but my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green maintains that the city has gone about trying to tackle the problem in an unacceptably heavy-handed way. Moreover, its procedural approach appeared questionable and in some cases to be contrary to the rules of natural justice&mdash;to the extent that my hon. Friend has had to refer the matter to the ombudsman and the district auditor. Once again, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will look at the matter in the coming period.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/7">Last year, I was fortunate enough to secure an Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall on Birmingham's management of its homelessness service. Local authorities such as Birmingham have Government targets to reduce the number of families presenting as homeless, but the problem that I identified in that debate was that Birmingham seemed more concerned about meeting the letter of the target than its purpose. In other words, a big part of the city's strategy appeared to be based more on reducing the number of families recorded as presenting as homeless or threatened with homelessness than on identifying the number who are in fact homeless or threatened with homelessness and helping to overcome that as well as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/8">That approach led the council to adopt a series of what I can describe only as &quot;gatekeeping&quot; measures that made it more difficult for families threatened with homelessness to be so recorded in its figures. In the Westminster Hall debate, I drew attention to the most ludicrous aspect of the matter: even when landlords were acting lawfully in giving tenants notice to quit and the tenants involved felt that that was reasonable, the council was forcing them into unnecessary disputes and costly court actions. I pointed out that, in adopting that strategy, the council was not tackling the problem of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/9">I accept that some improvements have been made since then, and that useful work has been done on an advice and referral service called Home Options that is being adopted by the council and some of its partners. The council recently nominated itself for a Chartered Institute of Housing award. It did not win&mdash;despite what its press release said&mdash;but it did reach the final shortlist.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/10">However, problems remain: as far as I can tell, for instance, Birmingham city council is still forcing landlords and tenants into the unnecessary and costly court procedures that I described earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/11">There are other, more fundamental, problems. Birmingham city council still seems to think that reducing the number of families whom it allows to register as homeless or threatened with homelessness is the same as reducing the numbers who are in fact homeless or threatened with homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/12">Another difficulty has to do with schemes such as Home Options. Such schemes have some good points, as I said earlier, but problems arise with the highly misleading statistics that the council gives for the number of cases in which it considers a scheme has prevented a family from becoming homeless. All too often, they deal with cases that are referred by housing department staff to some other agency, either internal or external. Any such case that is not sent back to the housing department is recorded as one in which homelessness has been prevented.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/13">A statistic derived in that way might mean that a case of homelessness has been prevented, but it might not&mdash;the result might simply be that an applicant has joined the ranks of the hidden homeless. Housing organisations such as Shelter are aware that the hidden homeless exist, and all hon. Members know the same from their casework, but all too often those people do not show up in the statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/14"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">My right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> have also spoken of the hidden homeless. I stress that I am not talking about cardboard city: I am talking about young people sleeping on friends' floors, and about families who are forced into already overcrowded accommodation with relatives, with all the stresses, strains and family breakdowns that that involves. Such cases might not show up in the statistics, but that does not alter the fact that they are real.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/15">Birmingham city council has just published a scrutiny report on its homelessness service, and I commend it for that. The report makes some useful points, although I hope that the council will publish the evidence on which it is based. It says that the council wants to review the situation in the coming year. I hope that the review will ask some searching questions about exactly what the statistics the council uses are based on. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to keep a close eye on Birmingham and this issue to see whether, in reality, the claims that the council makes for itself reflect the whole picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/16">I also ask my hon. Friend at least to consider changing the target that applies to councils to one that obliges them to focus their efforts on preventing homelessness and tackling it where it is unpreventable&mdash;rather than one that relies on recorded homelessness presentations, which can lead to overly restrictive definitions of what that means by particular councils and to overly restrictive definitions of what constitutes temporary accommodation. I know that organisations such as Shelter are worried about that. It is not a problem that applies only to Birmingham, but it is an issue that we need to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/17">I say those things because I think that they are necessary, but, of course, they are entirely without prejudice to my plea for more socially rented homes. However the homelessness service is managed, without the necessary supply of affordable homes, particularly in the social rented sector, we will not have the necessary properties. I hope that my hon. Friend will look closely at Birmingham. It is making some improvements, but I still have significant concerns&mdash;as do others&mdash;about the way in which the housing policy is being managed.</p>

	<p pid="a.499.2/1">I accept your strictures, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and in view of the number of interventions that I have already taken, I shall certainly not take any more.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.2/2">Let me conclude as quickly as possible. Chesterfield council was told that it had too much money in council house rents, so in the last financial year &pound;3.2 million&mdash;14 per cent. of all the rents paid by Chesterfield's tenants&mdash;has been taken away to spend somewhere else in the country where it is desperately needed. Yet if the council privatised tomorrow, the privatised landlord could keep the money. How can it be that today the money must be redistributed elsewhere in the country, but tomorrow, under a private landlord, we could keep the lot? Chesterfield council was told that 70 per cent. of its right-to-buy receipts must be taken from it by the Government to spend somewhere else, yet if it privatised the system tomorrow it could keep all the money. How can it be that today a total of &pound;9.2 million must be taken from Chesterfield to be spent elsewhere, including&mdash;insultingly&mdash;on the Olympic infrastructure in London two years ago under the former ODPM, yet tomorrow it could stay in Chesterfield, with a private landlord? The situation is ridiculous.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.2/3">Why is the policy so incomprehensible and vindictive? First, there is the new Labour dogma that the public sector is bad and cannot deliver anything, as we see with Labour's increasing attempts to privatise both education and the national health service. Secondly, the root cause is the Chancellor and the public sector borrowing requirement, which was confirmed by senior officials at a meeting of the Defend Council Housing group on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-21">21 November</phrase>, attended by several Labour MPs. Only yesterday, the Chancellor was boasting about how low our PSBR is. I do not understand that claim. If public borrowing builds hospitals, schools or council housing it is debt, and therefore bad, but if it is private borrowing it is economic growth, and therefore good. The money is the same, although it costs more to borrow privately than publicly&mdash;but private is good and public is bad. That is voodoo economics of the highest order.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.2/4">Recently, localism has been a popular buzzword with both the Government and the Conservatives. If the word means anything, however, it must mean a shift in the balance&mdash;from London to the regions and local councils. The UK, and England in particular, is the most centralised democracy in the western world: 90 per cent. of the money raised by the Chancellor, in London, is handed out with strings attached. In Scandinavia, France, Germany or any state in the USA, people would react with blank incomprehension if we described our system. They run their local services, borrowing locally, prudentially, to raise money for them. They would not understand the idea that Oslo, Paris, Berlin or Washington should tell local communities how to run their health, police, fire, housing or education services.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.2/5">In the last financial year, &pound;9.2 million was taken from Chesterfield's council tenants. The council could be building new houses with that money and refurbishing its stock. The council could be prudentially borrowing and using rents to meet the tremendous housing needs of Chesterfield. Under a local system, Birmingham, Southport, and all the other places we have heard about that are in the same position, could meet local needs. Will the Minister explain why a Labour Government continue vindictively to penalise and punish people in Chesterfield, which is primarily a poor working-class community?</p>

	<p pid="a.503.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. One of our key problems is the national criteria, which do not take account of specific local factors. There is a lack of family homes, and an over-supply of flats in comparison with family homes, not just in London but further afield. On previous occasions in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1758" name="David Maclean">the House my right hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean)</phrase>, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="A J Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase>, have pointed out that there is, effectively, a moratorium on development in their areas, because housing targets for their regions have been met, and the targets are treated as ceilings, not floors. One of the unfortunate consequences of the regional spatial strategies over which the Minister presided is that many communities that wish to expand and to build new housing, both market and affordable, in order to keep the community sustainable, are prevented from doing so. Essentially, national and regional policy has restricted growth in areas where it is genuinely popular.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.2/2">I recognise that there is some resistance to house building in certain parts of the country, but I submit that the right thing to do is to operate by consensus rather than confrontation; that is always the right way to proceed. I notice that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> is smiling. May I remind him of what he wrote in a recent article entitled &quot;Decent Homes in a Sustainable Environment: Priorities for Labour Policy&quot;&mdash;a title that clearly suggests that, under this Government, we have had neither decent homes nor a sustainable environment? He points out that</p>
	<p pid="a.503.2/3" class="indent">&quot;indiscriminate and indifferently designed greenfield developments of low-density executive houses gave the English language the memorable phrase 'concreting over the countryside', and fuelled an anti-housing backlash.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.2/4" class="indent">In a context where performance was judged by numbers, quality was the obvious casualty while sustainability and energy efficiency rarely if ever got a look in.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.503.2/5">The right hon. Gentleman's critique of his Government's policy was prefigured by the comments of the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-07a.523.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" speakername="George Young" colnum="523"  time="016:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061207/debtext/61207-0016.htm#06120759001400">
	<p pid="a.523.1/1">The Select Committee began to query some of the estimates that the Government have given about costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/2">The second reason I wished to speak was to comment on the constitutional aspect of the situation. At a time at which neither MPs nor Parliament are held in high regard, this matter is a litmus test for the democratic process. We are all sent here to hold the Government to account. This is not the Opposition against the Government, but Parliament against the Executive. On the one hand, we have the unanimous conclusion of a Select Committee of the House that supports the findings of our parliamentary ombudsman, and on the other we have the Department for Work and Pensions, which is accountable, through its Secretary of State, to the House. The House, through its Select Committee, heard the Secretary of State's defence and unanimously rejected it. My constituents know that if Members of Parliament have the will, they can compel the Government to think again. If we do not, their worst fears&mdash;and those of others who have faith in Parliament&mdash;will be fulfilled.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/3">I have a third and final reason for speaking in the debate. As Secretary of State for Transport in the previous Administration, my Department was involved in a similar stand-off with the ombudsman and the Select Committee. I say this in defence of the Secretary of State: he is pulled two ways because although the ombudsman and the Select Committee may be pulling him one way, he might well have his accounting officer and his permanent secretary, and perhaps the Treasury and the National Audit Office, pulling him the other way, reminding him that he is accountable for public funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/4">A letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">5 December</phrase> was perhaps sent out in anticipation of the debate. It enclosed some Q and A&mdash;questions and answers&mdash;but there was no A to the most frequently asked Q: why have the Government rejected the Select Committee's report? I found the letter rather dismissive of the Select Committee. Its unanimous recommendation is dismissed with the comment:</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/5" class="indent">&quot;While recognising some members disagree with that view&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/6">The case in which I was involved, which is referred to in the report, involved compensation for blight caused by the Channel tunnel rail link. I believe that it offers a way out of the current impasse. In that case, a satisfactory resolution was achieved&mdash;it is referred to on page 36 of the report. Initially, the Department rejected the recommendations of the ombudsman and the Select Committee on compensation for blight. At this stage in the proceedings, however, the Government thought again.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/7">The letter that I wrote to the Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="1995-11-01">1 November 1995</phrase> identifies the route that should be used on this occasion. I wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Despite the doubts recorded earlier, the Government is prepared to consider afresh whether a scheme might be formulated to implement the Committee's recommendation that redress should be granted&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/9">I went on to write:</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The Government would of course consult the Committee as proposals are being developed. I should add that in agreeing to look again at a compensation scheme, the Government does so out of respect for the PCA Select Committee and the office of the Parliamentary Commissioner, and without admission of fault or liability.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/11">I then added two somewhat pompous sentences:</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/12" class="indent">&quot;While being prepared to look at the possibility of a scheme, I hope you will also understand my making it clear at this early stage that we will need to consider seriously the possible costs of a scheme, which cannot yet be established. As Chairman of the Select Committee whose remit is good administration, you will understand that I would not be discharging my responsibility to the taxpayer by offering an open-ended commitment on an uncosted basis.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/13">The Select Committee that made the recommendations that we are debating today is looking for a similar response from the Government. All that the Minister need do at the end of the debate is say my exact words&mdash;there is no copyright on them. If he does, he will begin to build a bridge between the Government and Parliament, instead of further widening the chasm, and setting the Government on a collision course with the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/14">Finally, I offer a quote that the Minister might find helpful in his negotiations with the Treasury. Who said that there was</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/15" class="indent">&quot;clear and unmistakable evidence in the ombudsman's report of five significant areas of maladministration by the Department...Many pensioners have...lost their life savings, and retired workers their redundancy payments...I must ask why we have had to rely on the ombudsman to confirm the mismanagement...and incompetence that was widely known about more than one year ago...Does the Secretary of State agree that the House will find it strange that he...continues to deny the Government's responsibility for mistakes and does not even apologise for his Department's role?&quot;?&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="1989-12-19">19 December 1989</phrase>; Vol. 164, c. 204.]</p>
	<p pid="a.523.1/16">Those are the words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, spoken in 1989. When the Minister writes to the Treasury, asking whether he can reopen the matter of the Government's decision, he might like to pray in aid that quotation, to secure a response from the Treasury. When he makes his winding-up speech, I ask him to put to one side the line that his Department might have drafted for him, and instead to respond to the mood of the House, which is, as I see it, that the Government should think again.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-07a.525.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1748" speakername="Alan Simpson" colnum="525"  time="016:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061207/debtext/61207-0016.htm#06120759001401">
	<p pid="a.525.0/1">In truth, it ought not to be me speaking in this debate, but my constituent Brian Wilson, who is one of the pensioners who had their pensions stolen. He has turned out to be an incredibly valuable source of knowledge to me. I suspect that virtually all hon. Members have someone like Brian Wilson in their patch. If they do not, they should count themselves lucky to have missed out on the problem, but they are also missing out on an education as to where we went wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.525.0/2">It is puzzling to understand why we should still need to hold such debates, because if we had followed a principle of &quot;three strikes and you're out&quot;, the Government would already be out. The comprehensive and damning report from the parliamentary ombudsman sets out why the Government are responsible&mdash;not for the collapse of schemes, but for failing to set a rules framework for the schemes that made secure what the Government promised was secure. A report from the Public Administration Committee pretty much endorsed that conclusion, and it endorsed the call for the Government to intervene to set the matter fully, not partly, right.</p>
	<p pid="a.525.0/3">On the deliberations held in the High Court, only this week, in the case brought by the pensioners, the Government received an almighty rollicking from the High Court judge for failing to produce an outline of their defence until what was almost literally the last minute. They finally did so on Monday night. The words of rebuke uttered by the High Court judge on Tuesday morning, and the grovelling presentation made by Government legal representatives, demonstrated how poor a position the Government are in. When successive independent verdicts ultimately trace the line of responsibility back to the Government, the Government cannot say, &quot;We just don't care about those independent judgments; we won't accept responsibility for redressing the balance, whatever form that balance takes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.525.0/4">It is with sadness that I approach our debate, because ultimately the courts will require the Government to accept the responsibilities set out by the ombudsman. As a result, those pensioners will be failed not just by the Government but by Parliament, which will be failing in its duty of scrutiny if it does not tell the Government of the day that they must accept responsibility, and if it does not introduce measures to provide full redress.</p>
	<p pid="a.525.0/5">I am pleased that it has been established that the matter does not rest solely on the Government's shoulders. In fact, it stems from the provisions put in place after the Pensions Act 1995, and the guarantees made by the Conservative Government that were endorsed when Labour came to power in 1997. It cannot be argued, however, that the Government fail to understand the nature of weaknesses and deficiencies that were built into the scheme that they put in place. After Maxwell, the actuaries advising the Government expressed doubts on several occasions about the weaknesses of the pension guarantee. The executive summary of the review of the minimum funding requirement published in May 2000 stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.525.0/6" class="indent">&quot;there is a large and worrying gap between the level of security which the MFR test actually delivers and the public's perception of what it will deliver&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.525.0/7">The report went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.525.0/8" class="indent">&quot;We recommend that, in addition to the MFR test, there should be a security measure which is clearly disclosed to members...Members would be informed that the MFR test differs from a true security test and does not give 100 per cent. security, as they currently believe.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.525.0/9">Much of the confusion that has emerged in debates is rooted in that belief.</p>
	<p pid="a.525.0/10">People who argue that the Government are responsible have never claimed that they were responsible for the failures of the schemes. However, the Government failed to put in place an adequate rules base for the functioning of the schemes; they failed to disclose to members the rules that would give preference to existing pensioners, rather than non-pensioner contributors; and they failed to disclose that the guarantee was not 100 per cent., or that members would probably reclaim only 50 per cent. of their funds.</p>
	<p pid="a.525.0/11">There is no point quibbling about people's distrust of the Government, and people's wish to check information elsewhere, because in the post-Maxwell climate, Government assurances had enormous importance. We failed the Ronseal test&mdash;the notion that the product does what it says on the tin&mdash;because we told people that their pension was secure when we knew, because the actuaries told us so, that that was not the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.526.2/1">Will my hon. Friend clarify a couple of points? First, back in the mid-'90s, when legislation was introduced post-Maxwell, it was indicated that pensions would be safe from somebody doing something underhand to steal them, not that pensions would be safe if the underlying investments or the company supporting the pension scheme did not do very well.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-07a.530.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" speakername="David Laws" colnum="530"  time="016:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061207/debtext/61207-0017.htm#06120759001415">
	<p pid="a.530.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising those points. His constituents share the view of many people outside the House who have seen what the hon. Member for Nottingham, South called a &quot;three-strikes-and-you're-out&quot; process in relation to the Government's position on this issue. We find the Government still determined to resist the conclusions of a three-stage process. First, the ombudsman prepared her report in a way that fed back to the Department her developing conclusions, but that did not persuade the Government. Then we had the highly critical report from the ombudsman, and now we have a unanimous and extremely critical report from a cross-party Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/2">We could continue to rehearse some of the detailed debates that the ombudsman and the Select Committee reflect on in their reports, but that would be difficult to do in the detail that some of the issues deserve in the 50 or so minutes that we have left. It is worth reflecting, however, on the strength of the conclusions that the ombudsman and the Select Committee have reached. The Chairman of the Select Committee reminded us of the terms in which the ombudsman put her conclusions. She concluded that the Government had provided information to the people who had lost their pensions which was &quot;inaccurate&quot;, &quot;incomplete&quot;, &quot;unclear&quot; and &quot;inconsistent&quot;. It is hard to imagine a more decisive, unambiguous and critical description of the information provided by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/3">The ombudsman's report went on to state:</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/4" class="indent">&quot;I have found that maladministration was a significant contributory factor in the creation of financial loss...Nothing in DWP's submissions persuades me otherwise.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/5">That was a conclusion from the first part of her process. She went on to reinforce the point about her own position when she said that</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Parliament has decided that it is my role&mdash;and not that of any party to a complaint&mdash;to determine what constitutes maladministration.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/7">That is a fair point. Many of us would feel that the Government had a responsibility, after a process in which they had been given every opportunity to comment on and refute the allegations and concerns that the parliamentary ombudsman was looking into, to take far more seriously the conclusions that the ombudsman has reached, and which have been reinforced by the Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/8">Despite being a cross-party body, the Select Committee has produced a report that echoes the criticisms of the ombudsman and, I believe, sides entirely with the ombudsman on every major point of dispute. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/9" class="indent">&quot;We agree with the Ombudsman that maladministration occurred. Government information about pensions was deficient and reasonable people would have been misled... the Government should have considered the Ombudsman's recommendations properly, rather than immediately assuming that they would place large burdens on the public purse.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/10">In language whose critical tone is similar to that used by the ombudsman, the Select Committee points out that it has conducted its own investigations and taken its own evidence. It also states:</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/11" class="indent">&quot;We believe that the Government is being, at best, na&iuml;ve and, at worst, misleading.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/12">That is a very strong conclusion for a cross-party Select Committee to reach, particularly given that&mdash;as many of us who have served on Select Committees know&mdash;in circumstances of this kind Committee members representing the governing party are often under pressure to water down conclusions that are especially critical of the Government. The terms of the report and its conclusions show that there must have been a very strong conviction among the Committee's members about the Government's handling of the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/13">The Committee also reflected on the way in which the Government had decided to deal with the ombudsman's conclusions. In the ninth of its conclusions and recommendations, it says:</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/14" class="indent">&quot;We share the Ombudsman's concern that the Government has been far too ready to dismiss her findings of maladministration. Our investigations have shown that these findings were sound. It would be extremely damaging if Government became accustomed simply to reject findings of maladministration&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/15">As the hon. Member for Nottingham, South said, the Government have undergone a three-strikes process involving the initial consultations with the ombudsman, the ombudsman's report and a cross-party Select Committee report. In the light of that, I would expect the House and the Select Committee to be immensely disappointed by the Government's response to the Committee. On the issue of the ombudsman's position, they respond thus to the criticisms made of them:</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The ombudsman has, and will continue to have, the total and unqualified respect of the Government.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/17">It is one thing for the Government to respect the ombudsman; it is another thing for them to cast aside and ignore major recommendations affecting thousands of people when an ombudsman's report has trailed through all the evidence, and has been reinforced by a Select Committee of the House. If the Government are going to take future reports by the ombudsman seriously, they cannot afford to give the impression that advice in such reports will be accepted in small cases in which small issues and small amounts of money are at stake, while conclusions with a much greater impact on Government finances can simply be cast aside.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/18">In their response, the Government repeated the highly questionable&mdash;if I may describe it in that way&mdash;allegation, or assertion, that the financial assistance scheme is a good enough replacement, and the changes to it debated in the other place yesterday an adequate back-up, for the individuals who have lost their pensions. The response says:</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/19" class="indent">&quot;The Government agrees there should be a significant package of support and believes that FAS, as extended, constitutes such a package.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/20">The hon. Member for Cannock Chase gave a detailed explanation of all the ways in which the financial assistance scheme is deficient in relation to the pension protection fund, and all the ways in which the headline statistics in the scheme relating to the proportion of pensions that people can expect to be returned to them are let down by the proportion of the total pension package that is returned. In the Committee's report, the hon. Gentleman has also described all the ways in which the FAS is deficient. We debated the issue yesterday with regard to new regulations to improve the FAS. The improvements are welcomed by Members on both sides of the House, but they are still a long way short of adequate compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/21">The Minister acknowledged that the Prime Minister was questioned on that specific issue yesterday. In response to a question from one of his hon. Friends, it seemed that the Prime Minister left open the possibility of further changes and improvements to the scheme. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/22" class="indent">&quot;I agree that it is important to keep the terms of the scheme under review&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-06">6 December 2006</phrase>; Vol. 454, c. 301.]</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/23">I hope that that was not simply the sort of comment that Prime Ministers make under pressure, as a way of fobbing of their own Back Benchers who are concerned about injustices of this type. When the Minister responded to my question about the Prime Minister's commitment, he did so in rather lukewarm and ambiguous terms. He said that the Government keep all their policies under review and will continue to do so. That was not particularly cheery and it rather made me think that the Prime Minister had been giving a brush-off rather than a hope of real improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/24">Perhaps we should not be so gloomy, however. The Minister looked unimpressed when the hon. Member for Nottingham, South described some of the ways in which the financial assistance scheme could be improved, and some of the ways in which a fairer compensation package should be delivered. I remind him that his predecessors were similarly unimpressed when the arguments for such a scheme were first made. At that stage, the Government did not want to give way on the issue. Eventually, they found the money to introduce a scheme, and then maintained that it was good enough. Yesterday, we debated the new scheme and the improvements to be made. Ministers always say that improvements to such schemes are unaffordable, and go on saying that until they are forced to make changes and improvements. The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire made a helpful suggestion to the Minister, and demonstrated how Governments can make rather elegant U-turns if they want to do so. I seem to recall that the Government of which he was a member had a habit of making quite a few U-turns, not all of which were elegant, but he showed how Governments, if they wish to do so, can change their opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.1/25">Given the Government's formal response, I do not have high hopes that today's ministerial summing-up will take on board the criticisms made by the Select Committee and the ombudsman. I hope, however, that the strength of opinion expressed in the House during the debate, and the strength of opinion in a cross-party report, will cause the Government to keep the issue under review. I hope that the Prime Minister's comments yesterday will allow further improvements to be made to provide a fair package of compensation to people who have lost their pensions under such circumstances.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-12-07a.535.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" speakername="Michael Penning" colnum="535"  time="017:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061207/debtext/61207-0018.htm#06120759001418">
	<p pid="a.535.0/1">I think and hope that the Government have listened to the compelling arguments made by all the speakers this afternoon in this very important debate, which has sadly been cut short, not least by an obviously orchestrated campaign by the Government Whips Office to intervene in order, it would seem, to put the ombudsman on trial. However, I shall not waste time discussing that; the members of the public who have been listening to this debate, and the 700 members of the former Dexion scheme, will have heard that for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/2">I pay tribute to the Chairman of the Select Committee and to the ombudsman for a brave report and for sticking to their guns. There is an old-fashioned phrase that is not heard much these days: natural justice. Their report is an attempt to secure natural justice for many of our constituents and their families and loved ones, who have had their pensions stolen from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/3">I became a Member of this House only some 18 months ago, but approximately five years ago the campaign team for the former Dexion workers approached me and showed me the documentation that they had been given over the many years that they had worked for Dexion. They left that documentation with me and it did not take me long to realise that they had a very strong case, in the light not just of the recommendations and actions of this Government, but of those of my own Government in the period since 1995. The leaflets were flawed; that was my view before the election, and the reason why I have worked tirelessly to help them.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/4">The 120,000-plus people whose pensions were affected are not just numbers. We have heard about the fantastic work that Ros Altmann has done on behalf of the campaign group, and I pay tribute to Ros today. These are ordinary people who were going about their business; in my company's case, they had worked for the company for a very long time. They had done the right thing. They had paid into a Government-recommended, perfectly safe pension scheme, so that they would rely not on state benefit, charity or a handout from a scheme, but on a pension scheme that they had purchased on behalf of their families and loved ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/5">Marlene Cheshire&mdash;a delightful lady&mdash;had to tell her husband David on the day he died that the compensation had come through and that everything was okay, so that he would pass away thinking that everything was okay for her, and that she had been left with the money. The Minister met the widows group that I brought to him. The stories that they tell are massively distressing. Marlene is one of 400-odd members of such schemes who receive some money from the financial assistance scheme. The Minister knows how much she gets&mdash;&pound;20 a week. If the decimal point were shifted, that would be somewhere near what she should have got.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/6">I am not saying that the taxpayer should pay everything, and nor are the former Dexion workers campaign group, the ombudsman or the Select Committee. What we are saying is that we need to come up with a plan. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1748" name="Alan Simpson">The hon. Member for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson)</phrase> has come close with the ideas that he put forward today, some of which I was going to offer myself. I shall raise other issues. For instance, the schemes are still being forced to purchase annuities. Why? How much is left in the schemes? Perhaps the Minister can tell us when he winds up the debate, because the figure is missing and there is a lot of money still being administered by the trustees.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.0/7">Many of the unclaimed assets that the Chancellor thinks that he can use are from pension schemes in insurance companies. What better use could there be for that money than to compensate those wonderful people?</p>

	<p pid="a.544.0/1">My hon. Friend might recall that during Question Time on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">16 October</phrase> I suggested that this matter might well end up in the courts. Although it would be quite wrong to talk about the substance of the court case, the pensioners themselves feel that the Government are threatening them with costs if the case is pursued to judicial review. My hon. Friend said that the Government were waiting to hear from the pensioners' representatives, but it has now been established that it is the other way round. When will the representatives of the pensioners be hearing from the Government?</p>

	<p pid="a.551.2/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate on internet gambling, because I think that the subject is very important. I am not a great expert on the internet, but I know of people who are involved in internet gambling and worry about the situation. I speak without having consulted such people, but I hope that they understand that I share a concern which others have expressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/2">There is an adequacy of accumulated evidence and expert opinion to suggest that the issue should be a matter of concern for a large number of people, extending to more than those who practise internet gambling. It may seem a little anachronistic to term internet gambling &quot;a vice&quot;, but if that is what it is, then that is what it is&mdash;although gambling is not the oldest vice, it is certainly well up there.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/3">I do not want to be negative; I want to be positive&mdash;and we are, as they say, where we are. As I am sure that the Minister will say, internet gambling is here to stay, and, to be frank, we had better get used to it. However, I want to sound a note of caution about some things that concern me, because we are, in a sense, stepping into the unknown. I also want to put forward some thoughts about things that I think are within the Government's power to effect and regulate.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/4">The Government set out their position early on with regard to internet gambling and, to their credit, they have remained consistent. The House of Commons Library has said this about gambling and internet gambling:</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/5" class="indent">&quot;Gambling is not something that can be regulated out of existence whatever its dangers: traditionally, gambling regulation was based on the physical premises in which gambling took place...the internet has made such regulation impractical; in the face of such hard facts the best course of action for Britain is to permit online gambling from British-based websites in the knowledge that such gambling can be subject to British regulation and will offer security to British punters that will discourage them from trusting their luck (and money) to overseas operators.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/6">Few would take issue with that point of view. Indeed, the Government have been supported in their approach by the Salvation Army, the Methodist Church and GamCare, among others.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/7">The Government have also said, however, that they want the UK to become a centre for the online gambling industry. That aspiration has, of course, been thrown into sharp relief by the passing of anti-gaming laws in the US, which prohibit banks from accepting requests for payment from gambling websites. The industry's potential is massive. Last year, $12 billion was bet on sites around the world, which offer games such as poker, blackjack and roulette and slot machines, and &pound;1 billion of that was staked in this country. Many operators will be looking to Britain to fill the void left by the US, and it is understandable that UK plc should seek to profit economically, but many people will be uneasy with such an aspiration.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/8">A study commissioned by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport found that on a conservative estimate the number of online gamblers is about 1 million people in the UK staking on average &pound;1,000 each. A recent &quot;Panorama&quot; programme, however, contained claims from a further study suggesting that that figure is a massive underestimate. That study stated that 5.8 million people&mdash;one in 10 people in the UK&mdash;log on to sites every month.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/9">For some, the situation has proved to be very profitable. Some people&mdash;I suspect that they are a minority&mdash;have turned professional and earned huge sums of money, but for others the results have been devastating. Citizens advice bureaux have reported some extremely disturbing cases, albeit in relatively few instances. One man gambled on the internet and lost &pound;200, having seen a TV programme on online gambling. He became so obsessed about the need to recover that &pound;200 that he now owes more than &pound;50,000. Another bureau saw somebody who ran up &pound;30,000-worth of online gambling debts in 12 months, using one credit card to pay off another. That person is applying for bankruptcy. Many people may find it hard to imagine that worthy organisations such as GamCare and the Responsibility in Gambling Trust, no matter how well funded, would have the tentacles to prevent punters from slipping into such a vortex of addiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/10">The point is that gambling on the internet is an inherently isolated pursuit, unlike gambling in the social context of a casino. Typically, those gambling on the internet will do so alone. The dangers of acting on impulse are thus increased. Dr. E. Moran from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, who has many years of experience in this field, including involvement with the establishment of Gamblers Anonymous, lists several well established psychological effects of gambling, ranging from habit forming caused by small but regular prizes to an unrealistic assessment of the player's chances of winning. Users may be unaware that they are racking up large losses, because they are given occasional wins as an incentive to keep them locked in. The availability of credit on many sites means that users lose sight of their debt, which contributes to the temptation to chase it. Extensive studies have shown that the psychological and physiological effects on those who participate in gambling encourage the chasing of losses.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/11">It may be said that it is a small minority who are afflicted by these conditions of self-delusion and that it is the responsibility of the gambling industry and the Government to target those people and give them help. That is true, but my fear, and that of others, is that a few years down the line we may find that what is currently a minority has grown significantly. In 2002, an inquiry in Australia found that one third of the industry's total revenue was derived from &quot;problem&quot; gamblers.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/12">Given that people are faced with a barrage of bright lights and flashing images offering the possibility of big winnings, it may be unhelpful to talk in terms of &quot;problem&quot; or &quot;vulnerable&quot; gamblers, because that implies that anyone else is somehow invulnerable. Reading through Government papers on the subject, one gets the impression that if only the punter had enough information they could be transported to a state of calm objectivity when deciding whether to risk each stake&mdash;but gambling can be glamorous, exciting and sometimes very fast. There is likely to be regular success, which tends to blinker the user to his or her long-term losses and encourage participation. The fact is that internet gambling is conducive to addictive behaviour. We can say at the very least that not all who take part make an informed choice all the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/13">Education and transparency are important, but are they enough? We surely need more and better restrictions on under-age children gaining access. The recent licence regulations issued by the Gambling Commission are welcome in their requirements for age verification, but there may be gaps. What can be done, for example, to stop children gambling via internet services on mobile phones? For obvious reasons, we need to take steps to ensure that phone credit cannot be used to stake money. Across the board, we need more warnings that players have spent too much money, and we need to look at restricting the amount that can be staked in any one period of time. The provision for punters to &quot;self-exclude&quot;&mdash;to inform the website that they wish to be prevented from taking part&mdash;is dependent on individuals recognising that they have a problem and furthermore taking steps to tackle it. &quot;Pathological&quot; gambling, as it is termed, is not so easy to tackle.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/14">What assurance can my right hon. Friend give me that the banks and credit card companies will be fully involved in identifying problem gamblers and that credit will not be granted so easily by the websites themselves, and in the form of credit cards? We need to support, financially and through close involvement with the regulators, all the organisations, such as GamCare, that work with those who need help. I am pleased that that appears to be forthcoming, because it is needed. The establishment of the Responsibility in Gambling Trust is also welcome, and it is good that a target of &pound;3 million a year to fund its activities has been set. However, am I alone in thinking that having members of the industry, even in a minority, on the board, is at least questionable? Expertise is one thing, but perception of vested interest is another. It should be remembered that the organisation was originally set up by the industry and known as the Gambling Industry Charitable Trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/15">I see no reason why the partnership formed with the Economic and Social Research Council to conduct research, for example, could not have been with the Gambling Commission. By all means let us have a body charged with research and educating the public, but should not that be funded by a levy on the industry, but be separate from the industry? Surely that is the only way to ensure rigorous independence&mdash;perceived and actual&mdash;and to give the public full confidence in its activities and strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/16">Even if we accept the Government's strategy of damage limitation by means of a tightly regulated UK market, it is less easy to understand why restrictions on advertising internet gambling are to be relaxed from next year. No matter how closely the regulations are drawn up to protect children and those at risk, advertising and, to a lesser extent, sponsorship is designed to entice those who would not otherwise opt to participate, and to encourage those already involved to play more.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/17">I have discussed this matter with Ofcom, because I consider the distinction between sponsorship, which is currently allowed, and advertising, which is not, to be doubtful. It seems to me that, irrespective of whether a form of advertising acts as a direct incitement to purchase a product, advertising and sponsorship want the same outcome&mdash;increased sales.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/18">A proliferation of companies has sponsored, for example, InterCasino with &quot;Football Tonight&quot; on Sky. Others have sponsored football teams. There is a particular worry about football. For example, I understand that one company has sponsored Aston Villa. Companies are out to maximise profits, and a big part of that is attracting new customers&mdash;from competitors, but also from those who have never gambled. A leading academic on marketing strategies confirmed that, and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/19" class="indent">&quot;By definition in this relatively new market, there will be potential customers who are not yet familiar with online gaming. Marketing off-line will seek to draw such people into this new and entertaining world and thus deliver new value to the company. Typical strategies might focus on making entry easy into online gaming&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/20">It is one thing to push for a set of regulations designed to lure players away from potentially unscrupulous operators, but we should not encourage greater participation. Surely banning advertising in itself would not have repercussions such as driving people underground. It remains within the powers of the UK Government to ban advertising, and they should do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/21">Certainly the Government should take immediate action against companies that have breached existing rules. Despite assurances in November last year that online gambling companies would face prosecution for flouting the law, no one has so far been prosecuted. The law continues to be widely ignored. For example, 888.com recently offered the chance of a seat at the Aussie Millions poker tournament in Melbourne for anyone who downloaded the poker software and completed stages of a free tournament.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/22">Earlier in the year, the same company offered free flights to anyone who opened an account. I am told that <i> The Independent</i> newspaper hosts a gaming section on its website offering inducements of up to &pound;500 to make deposits when signing up. Those are only a few examples, and even if those concerned could make a case that they were operating within the letter of the law, they are surely not operating within its spirit.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/23">Will my right hon. Friend give me an undertaking that the law will be rigorously enforced now, and that those who infringe it will be punished severely? Furthermore, if he will not consider a ban on advertising, does he think it appropriate&mdash;even with the enhanced protection of the new regulations&mdash;that when the Act comes into force next year, such inducements will be legal?</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/24">We need to be cautious about the next few years. As I said, I am fully aware that in terms of direct regulation, we will be in a much better position in September next year than we are now. It is right and proper that the Government have taken the lead in efforts to establish international standards for the regulation of online gambling, and I congratulate them on doing it. I do not think that the road that the United States has followed is the right one.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/25">I call on the Government to commit to doing four things in the run-up to September. They should ensure that the industry gives more warning to players and restricts access to under-age people. They should also ensure that regular authoritative research is carried out to monitor the situation, as well as assessing the burden placed on health services, charities such as Citizens Advice, and others. They should consider whether the Gambling Trust is, and is seen to be, as independent as it should be, and they should take immediate steps against unlawful advertising, and seriously consider a ban.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.2/26">We in Britain are entering new territory&mdash;a territory in which demand for gambling is being actively stimulated. Gambling online is but one form of this, but because of the internet's ease of access and increasing pervasiveness, it has the potential to be the most pernicious. I am not suggesting that there is any harm in the occasional flutter. Nor am I seeking to be a killjoy. Prohibition would be illiberal and, more to the point, impossible to enforce. But the spirit of the Gaming Act 1968 is worthy of preservation. Gambling, unlike many other regulated activities, is deserving of special consideration because of its inherent addictive properties. We should not be in the business of allowing it to be promoted unhindered.</p>

	<p pid="a.555.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1930" name="Ben Chapman">my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Ben Chapman)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. The matters that he raises are important, and I know that they are close to his heart and to the interests that he pursues.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/2">Let me start by saying that I am very pleased with what we, collectively&mdash;the Government, the Gambling Commission, the industry and others, such as the faith groups&mdash;have achieved so far, and will, I hope, continue to achieve. We are creating a modern, flexible licensing regime for a modern, innovative industry. Ours will be a new system of regulation, which will be watched widely around the world as it develops. It will be able to adapt more quickly to new developments in the industry and will involve local people and their elected representatives more closely in the regulation of gambling in their communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/3">We have given the Gambling Commission the statutory powers that it needs to tackle illegal gambling and operators who breach the rules. We have ensured that continuing to keep crime out of the British gambling industry remains central to our system of regulation, and is backed by the toughest vetting and by sanctions at the end of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/4">I agree entirely with what my hon. Friend said about the Gaming Act 1968, which was put on to the statute book to drive crime out of gambling. It was probably one of the most draconian pieces of legislation on the statute book, and it has worked very effectively. Indeed, it has given the industry the integrity for which it is known around the world and the basic principles that we have tried to bring into the Gambling Act 2005 and the new regime. Most importantly, we have placed the protection of children and vulnerable people at the heart of gambling regulation for the first time. Provisions such as those were not in the 1968 Act. New commercial freedoms for industry are balanced by new obligations to ensure that children and other vulnerable people are protected. This balancing of new rights and new social responsibility obligations is absolutely central to the success of the new Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/5">It is worth reminding ourselves precisely why we need the new Gambling Act. Controls on commercial gambling are being undermined by new technology. This means that we are finding it difficult to protect children and vulnerable people from risky new products and from new methods of delivering those products, such as the internet. The Gambling Act restores control by means of a strong, flexible, adaptable licensing regime, which has social responsibility as the key underlying principle. Other countries, such as the USA, have taken a different approach from ours, especially on remote gambling. But our view&mdash;with which Professor Budd, Parliament, problem gambling experts and most academics agree&mdash;is that strong regulation, not prohibition, is the best means we have of protecting children and vulnerable people from the harmful effects of gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/6">We will be able to employ a range of measures designed to permit the socially responsible to promote and offer their gambling activities in a socially responsible way. In fact, social responsibility will be an explicit licence condition, with breaches triggering serious penalties including unlimited fines or even loss of licences. As I have said, protecting the public&mdash;especially children and the vulnerable&mdash;remains our top priority. I am confident that the measures in the Act will protect children and vulnerable adults, but the Gambling Commission will be able to impose additional measures on operators to provide further protection if it is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/7">We do not know whether more people will choose to gamble, but I believe that if they do, they will be far better protected than they would have been under the old Act. The industry has established the Responsibility in Gambling trust, which my hon. Friend mentioned, to fund prevention and treatment of problem gamblers. We have set a target of some &pound;3 million a year to apply once the Act is fully implemented, from September next year. The trust is working very hard to achieve that target, but if more is needed and is not delivered by the industry, the Act allows the imposition of a statutory levy. We will use those powers if necessary. We want to see the industry make its due contribution to this critical arm of the arrangements. We can apply the powers to the Gambling Commission as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/8">We are allowing the expansion of gambling opportunities only because we are also introducing effective measures to deal with the risk. We will keep a close eye on levels of problem gambling. If evidence tells us that we need to get tougher to protect the public, we will do so. The Government recognise that remote gambling poses new potential risks, which my hon. Friend described. The problem that we have faced and choose to address is that existing legislation does not deal adequately with the internet and remote gambling. We believe that strong regulation is the best means of protection for consumers. Operators in Britain will have to comply with a specific remote gambling licence. Licences will contain tough conditions to protect vulnerable users, and will prevent children from gaining access to sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/9">As I said earlier, the British gambling industry enjoys a well-respected international reputation for integrity and high social-responsibility standards. Strong regulation in the new growth areas will further enhance our reputation, and allow British operators to lead the global online market. Regardless of whether remote operators choose to base their businesses here, we retain a keen interest in how those businesses' gambling activities are promoted and advertised to British citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/10">Legitimate gambling businesses based in jurisdictions with robust consumer protection regimes should be allowed to advertise in great Britain. It will be an offence to advertise illegal gambling, but the Advertising Standards Authority has been working with the Gambling Commission to draw up a new code for non-broadcast gambling advertising in the light of the Gambling Act 2005, and has been consulting widely. The Secretary of State also has reserve powers under the Act to make regulations on the form, content, timing and location of gambling advertising. We will not hesitate to use those powers if it becomes clear that self-regulation is not sufficient to protect children and vulnerable people from exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/11">My hon. Friend referred to an event that took place a few weeks ago. While it is not strictly accurate to say that we have no control over remote gambling operators based overseas, we recognise that regulating remote gambling is a global challenge. That is why we held the first-ever international Government summit on remote gambling in the United Kingdom on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-31">31 October</phrase> this year. We brought together more than 30 jurisdictions from around the world with an interest in regulating for remote gambling with a view to exploring the scope for developing minimum international standards for such regulation, particularly in relation to social responsibility and age verification. I believe that we made excellent progress, and that we now have a road map that will lead to better regulation of remote gambling throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/12">Those present at the summit agreed to co-operate further in a number of key areas to ensure that gambling remains fair and crime-free and that vulnerable people are protected. We discussed the text of the draft communiqu&eacute; in detail. Delegates have taken it back to their respective Governments, and written confirmation will be sought in the coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/13">We also agreed at the summit to follow up with proposals for an expert working group representative of those countries present. We will want to involve wider international institutions, including UNESCO and the global financial sector, in advising on the development of worldwide standards for regulation. I hope that that group will report back in the middle of next year. The co-operation that we received from credit card companies was also pleasing, as that is essential if we are to regulate internet gambling effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/14">My hon. Friend referred to the Responsibility in Gambling Trust and asked whether members of the industry should be a party to that. I think it is right that they should. Sir Alan Budd recommended that they should be on it. We need to expose the industry to the arguments of those who are from a different constituency but equally concerned about gambling and vice versa. Members of the Methodist Church are also on the Gambling Commission. That is right. It does not tarnish the Methodist Church or the Salvation Army to be involved in regulation or to be on the commission or the trust. It is a two-way street, and we must bring together responsible people from all sectors, including the industry, those affected by it and those who have justifiable criticisms. If we can bring those parties together, the trust will operate better, and the Gambling Commission will regulate better.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/15">On advertising, my hon. Friend's position was clear. He outlined the role of Ofcom and the Advertising Standards Authority, as well as that of the Gambling Commission, and I assure him that the regulations will be applied very firmly. He referred to gambling operators' sponsorship of sport, particularly football. He is right to do so, as there are concerns about advertising on football shirts and sponsorship of football clubs by gambling companies. The Gambling Commission will consult on the issue early in the new year, with my full support. As the Minister for Sport as well as the Minister with responsibility for gambling, I think that we need to take a responsible attitude to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/16">We are developing a white list of those territories outside the European economic area and Gibraltar, which can advertise in the United Kingdom unless a specific exemption has been made. Countries will have to demonstrate that they have a strict regime before they can register on that white list and thereby have the opportunity to advertise in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/17">Five years ago, we asked Sir Alan Budd to look at internet and remote gambling because Parliament and the Government did not have the powers to intervene to protect the vulnerable. It was right that we did that and we have had, effectively, a five-year debate to bring an Act to the statute book. The Act takes the basic principles of the 1968 Act and puts them into a modern setting. It mentions many of the issues that are of concern to the British public, including the protection of the vulnerable and of children, which is in legislation for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/18">I give my clear assurance that the Government will carry out the Act's proposals to the letter if we need to intervene to protect the vulnerable in our society. The way in which the industry developed and operated under the 1968 Act gave it international credibility and integrity and we want that to continue. It is an important part of our leisure industry. This country has probably the best regulatory regimes in finance, the law and in business, and companies that come to be registered and licensed in this country will do so under a very credible regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/19">If we can marry those elements together we can have an industry that is socially responsible and which can play a legitimate part in our leisure industry, while accepting that we have to protect the vulnerable in society&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/20" class="italic"> The motion having been made after Six o'clock, and the debate having continued for half an hour, Madam Deputy Speaker<i> </i> adjourned the House without Question put, pursuant to the Standing Order.</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/21" class="italic"> Adjourned at twenty-five minutes to Seven o'clock.</p>
