<p>Within the boundaries of a monetarism which is characterised by soaring Government borrowing and a money supply figure which is out of relationship with what the Government want, does the Chancellor accept the need to restore output and demand in the economy?

<p>The hon.

<p>Why did the Chancellor on 24 November seek to give the misleading impression that he was increasing Government tax revenues from North Sea oil and gas by &#x00A3;1 billion on top of the levels previously forecast, saying that there was

Why did not the right hon. and learned Gentleman tell the House that his own private forecast was that those revenues would be &#x00A3;1 billion short next year unless he took action? Is not the Chancellor giving the distinct impression that, on top of the employers' national insurance contributions chaos, either his budgetary policies are in chaos or he does not know what is going on?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman gives me an opportunity to correct at once the entirely false report on the front page of today's issue of <i>The Times</i> to the effect that the position about the yield from North Sea oil was not fully presented to the House on 24 November. He will recall that I said in my statement that the changes proposed in the oil tax regime would
<q>together yield around &#x00A3;1 billion in 1981&#x2013;82, mostly from the new tax."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 24 November 1980; Vol. 994, c. 317.]</q>
The hon. Gentleman will also recollect that the forecast published on the same day, and republished in the <i>Economic Progress Report Supplement</i> for December, made perfectly clear that
<q>After taking account of the proposed tax changes announced on 24 November, revenues from North Sea oil and gas in 1981&#x2013;82 are expected to be in the range of &#x00A3;4&#x00BD;-5 billion, a little higher than forecast at the time of the Budget.</q>

<p>In view of the money supply figures for the past two months, will my right hon. and learned Friend explain the technical, as opposed to the political, arguments for reducing minimum lending rate by 2 per cent. without there being compensating and contemporaneous cuts in public expenditure and increases in taxation?</p>

<p>I explained to the House as well as to my hon. Friend that the well-justified reasons for the welcome reduction in minimum lending rate were, first, the prospect of declining monetary growth, particularly when the public sector moves into surplus in the new year, and, secondly, the fact that the inflation rate has been coming down and is continuing to come down very sharply, so that the real rate of interest has been rising at the same time. In those circumstances, for monetary and other reasons, I have no doubt about the justification for the reduction in MLR.</p>

<p>Following the Chancellor's initial reply that he thought that the benefit of his measures was embodied in the reduction of MLR by 2 per cent., does he

really think that that is a satisfactory move, taking account of the plight of British manufacturing industry and the fact that in his own forecasts introduced at the same time as his mini-budget he expected a further fall in manufacturing output next year of another 5 per cent.? Does not that suggest to the Chancellor something far more dramatic&#x2014;that the basic problem is indeed a lack of effective demand in the economy? Will he not be concerned with the kind of points made by his hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, South-West (Mr. Budgen) about whether he is achieving or under-achieving his so-called money supply targets? In our view, these are matters which are totally irrelevant to the successful management of the economy.</p>

<p>May I take the opportunity of welcoming the right hon. Gentleman to his new Shadow portfolio and wish him a long tenure of that role?<br/>
It is plain from what the right hon. Gentleman said that he intends to signal a change of management, since he has taken the first opportunity to discard the respect for monetary policy which was at least the one hallmark of his predecessor. That is a signal of economic and financial irresponsibility.<br/>
The answer to the point specifically raised by the right hon. Gentleman cannot be repeated too often. We are not likely to succeed in restoring the health of our economy if we continue to deceive ourselves that we can do so by expanding demand within the United Kingdom. The crucial cause of declining prosperity in this country has been the continuing loss of competitiveness by British industry, attributing itself far more to high and rising wage costs than to any other cause. The right hon. Gentleman must cease deceiving himself in looking for an increase in demand as the right economic prescription.</p>

<p>The Chancellor is absolutely right in what he attributes to me as my attitude towards monetary policy.

<p>Precise information is not readily obtainable. In broad terms, however, Customs and Excise identified, on average, about &#x00A3;1,000 additional VAT per control visit to the larger businesses in 1979, compared with an overall average of about &#x00A3;200.</p>

<p>Does not that figure show the incompetence of the Government's housekeeping?

<p>No doubt the hon. Gentleman is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Society of Civil and

<p>If the hon. Gentleman believes that, he will believe anything. My right hon. Friend is devoted, as are the Government, to the reduction of the undue burden of public sector borrowing and the achievement of monetary control.

<p>Very close attention was given to that. It is for that reason that the measures that I have announced to restore balance to the nation's accounts next year are directed first, at the revenue from the North Sea


and, secondly, at raising additional revenue from the employees' side of the national insurance account. The changes for employers are the consequence of inflation and inflation alone. However, they represent a reduction in the real burden. The increase on that side is about 8&#x00B7;3 per cent. while the increase on the employees' side is about 27 per cent. I am sure that my hon. Friend will remember that these changes have enabled me to announce substantial reductions in the burden of the stock relief arrangements.</p>

<p>I understand that the Chancellor is raising the national insurance surcharge by &#x00A3;1,000 million. That is roughly the global sum. What is his prime objective in raising this additional and unwelcome sum? Does he think that it will help to diminish or to increase unemployment next year?</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman would do well to remember that the national insurance surcharge was the invention of the Government of whom he was a member. He would do well to remember also that the additional income being raised by the changes that I made on 24 November is coming, as I have emphasised, not only from the surcharge but from national insurance contributions on which the surcharge is imposed. The burden beyond inflation there imposed will be on employees. The reason for making the changes is to ensure that the borrowing requirement is moving towards balance so that there is some prospect of interest rates coming down rather than going up. That is a matter of prime concern to industry.</p>

<p>One has to have regard to monetary growth over a long period. The prospects are for a slower rate of monetary growth for the remainder of the financial year. Bank lending is showing signs of deceleration.

Lady has put it in those terms, does she agree with the statement made in the Irish Parliament this morning that it was the most important visit to the Republic since the foundation of the State? Does she agree with that statement made by the Taoiseach in the Dail, and, if so, why?</p>

<p>It is the first time that four members of the Cabinet, in pursuit of the bilateral talks that we now have between fellow members of the EEC, have attended such talks in Dublin. It is the first time that they have been held in Dublin. Last time they were held at No. 10 Downing Street between similar Ministers. That does not seem to me to be unusual.<br/>
On the question of steel, I agree that it is extremely important to the future of this country, and to many parts

of this country&#x2014;not only to those who work in steel but to those who work in industries that depend upon it. For that reason, I think that the report requires thorough consideration before we rush in to make comments upon it.</p>

<p>On the right hon. Gentleman's latter point, four Ministers is the usual number that we take to bilateral talks. It is far more natural than the right hon. Gentleman is willing to concede for this Government to have regular talks with the Government of the Republic of Ireland in the same way as we have regular talks with France, Germany and Italy. We have been trying to establish that regularity and trying to achieve better co-operation and understanding. We have received excellent security co-operation along the border.<br/>
On the question of steel, of course the right hon. Gentleman is free to use his Supply days precisely as he wishes. I can say only that the Government will wish to study the report very carefully indeed. Doubtless my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will wish to have talks with Mr. MacGregor. We shall wish to discuss the matter in the Cabinet before we rush into a statement about it.

<p>May I remind the right hon. Gentleman that there is a series of extremely important interlocking economic and industrial questions on which we have asked him to ensure that we have statements before the house rises for the Christmas Recess? Will he now tell us about them?<br/>
Will the right hon. Gentleman make sure that the Secretary of State for the Environment makes a statement to the House on the rate support grant, which will affect local authorities in a very special way this year and may affect the employment levels throughout the country in a very special way this year? May we therefore have a statement from the Secretary of State for the Environment on Tuesday?<br/>
Will the right hon. Gentleman also tell me when we shall get the statement&#x2014;for which I have asked for two weeks now, or at any rate for one week &#x2014; on the financial crisis in the railways, which is a matter of major importance for the country's economy as a whole?<br/>
With regard to the steel industry, which we were discussing a few minutes ago, we do not believe that the Government's response to what I have said and to what has been said generally in any way meets the position. We believe that it is essential for the House to have a debate on the matter first. <i>[Interruption.]</i> In that case, we shall

on Tuesday table for discussion the question of the Government's direct responsibility for the difficulties of the steel industry, which carries it very much further. When the Home Secretary intervenes from his reclining position to tell me how to&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> It sounded to me as though he was saying "Supply day, Supply day". He has been saying it for quite a long time. May I tell him that we believe that we had every right to urge&#x2014;the Government have so far refused to agree&#x2014;that there should be a general debate next Tuesday on unemployment.<br/>
We are confronted, therefore, with a mounting industrial and economic crisis of huge dimensions throughout the country, and we shall have to take that into account in all the business next week, including the motion for the Adjournment for the Christmas Recess, if that is, tabled. We may have to table an amendment to that motion to get the Government to report to the House properly on all these questions.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has in part answered his own question. Of course, these important matters should be debated by the House, but we have made available a Supply day on Tuesday and it is open to the Opposition to choose what subjects they wish. On Thursday next week there is a second Supply day, which is at present devoted to European matters.<br/>
With regard to the statements for which the right hon. Gentleman has asked, I cannot promise an early statement on transport, one of the reasons being that the demand for statements next week is becoming so heavy that we are in danger of their cutting into the Opposition Supply day or into private Members' time. I have consulted my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment and he is more than willing to make an oral statement on the rate support grant in the House next week.

We are seeking to do our best to assist the Government in relation to the steel debate, although it will mean that we shall not be able, as a result, to have the more general debate on unemployment which I am sure is desired by many hon. Members, certainly on the Opposition Benches.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has now answered the question about the financial crisis on the railways. I hope that there will be a statement about that, too.

Following the endorsement by the House of the Government's proposal to undertake an experiment, in which Standing Committees on Public Bills will be permitted to have up to three sittings in Select Committee form, Standing Committees will be able to take evidence in public. The first two Bills selected for the new procedure are the education special needs Bill&#x2014;which will be introduced in this House shortly after Christmas&#x2014;and the Deep Sea Mining (Temporary Provisions) Bill, if and when that Bill comes from the other place. I shall make a further announcement about the third Bill as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Given that we are not going to get a statement on the recent visit to Dublin, can we not at least have a debate on it?

<p>Hon. Members did not have only one and a half hours after midnight in which to debate Northern Ireland. They had a full day's debate on the Northern Ireland (Appropriation) Order.

<p>May I draw the attention of the Leader of the House to early-day motion 19 on unemployment in South Yorkshire?<br/>
<i>[That this House deplores the rapidly increasing level of unemployment in South Yorkshire, where nearly 60,0.00 people were out of work in November, which amounts to 10 per cent. of the county's workforce and represents an increase of 3,300 jobless in just one month;</i>

<i>notes that unemployment in Mexborough is 16&#x00B7;2 per cent., the eighth highest in England, in Rotherham, a development area, it is 10&#x00B7;8 per cent., in Barnsley 10&#x00B7;6 per cent., in Doncaster 11&#x00B7;7per cent., and in Maltby 12&#x00B7;6 percent., all intermediate areas, whilst in Sheffield, which is due to lose its assisted area status in 1982, and where there is virtually no demand at all in the manufacturing sector and unfilled vacancies are the lowest on record, there are now 24,500 people out of work, an increase of 50 per cent. since May; further notes that gloomy though these figures are, they further conceal the even more serious unemployment problems of smaller areas and of particular groups of people in such towns as Penistone, Wombwell, Thorne, Goldthorpe and Dinnington; calls attention to the Monopolies Commission Report on the British Gas Corporation and its threat to jobs in South Yorkshire, where it has been estimated that at least 500 jobs are at risk; and calls upon the Government to recognise that the magnitude of the unemployment problems justifies a far higher level of aid to South Yorkshire, and urges it to match the vigorous employment promotion and development programmes of the county council and the district councils.]</i><br/>
How far can Ian MacGregor's proposals on South Yorkshire go? The right hon. Gentleman must know, even if the Prime Minister does not, that major surgery is contemplated. How far can those proposals be carried out without totally destroying the morale and commitment of men and management in private as well as public steel in its British heartland &#x2014; Sheffield?

As hon. Members will be aware from the answer given by my hon.

Is he aware of the very real anger of my constituents&#x2014;a large number of them hitherto solid supporters of his party rather than of mine&#x2014;about the closure of four stations in my constituency and many more over the rest of South London, and the virtual prevention of those people from getting home at night by public transport?

<p>I am aware of the situation in South London and of the latest developments today, and I express my concern about the situation.

<p>No, I cannot. No such guarantee has been given. No Government could promise any other Government unlimited time for a measure in this House. What my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made clear is that if a request for amendment of the Canadian constitution is received we shall act in accordance with precedent and respond to it. But it must be clear that the progress and implementation of any such request must depend upon the general state of business in the House. That is why I have made it clear that the earlier that request is received the more likely it is that it can be dealt with in this Session.</p>

<p>I do not know whether one can draw the conclusions that the hon.

<p>That is a perfectly reasonable request. I inquired only this morning about the state of the Bill. It is not policy difficulties that are holding up the Bill. It is the drafting of what is a complicated measure. I should like to see it published before the recess.

There must be a reasonable interval of time, to give hon. Members an opportunity to consider it.</p>

<p>In view of fact that major Government policies are being made and dealt with in written answers, may we next week have a Government statement about their policy on statements to the House? With regard to the Dublin talks, is it right that when there are hon.

I reiterate that of course it is the custom of the House that major statements of policy are made to the House, when it is sitting.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. This is a short point of order, but one which I am sure that you will appreciate. Today, my name appeared third on the list of hon. Members who sought to ask oral questions of the Prime Minister. Consequently, I sat quietly and patiently while questions were asked before mine, hoping and thinking that I would have my opportunity in due course. In fact, a dozen or perhaps 15 of my colleagues had the opportunity of asking questions of the Prime Minister, none of whom had tabled questions.<br/>
As we have a ballot for positions in respect of questions to the Prime Minister, would it not be possible to group questions that are the same? The first eight on today's


Order Paper were more or less identical, and it seems unfair that those of us who have taken the trouble to table questions to the Prime Minister&#x2014;certainly if we are within the first two or three &#x2014; should not have the opportunity to ask those questions in preference to the hon.

<p>The hon. Gentleman has a good point. There is a sense of grievance on each side of the House if an hon. Member has tabled question No. Q3 or Q4 and is not called. The House will be aware of what happened this afternoon. Ten minutes were devoted to question No. 1 and five minutes were left for question No. Q2. I was unable to call many hon. Members. It may be worth while for the Procedure Committee to consider what the hon. Gentleman said about questions that are identical. Again I place on record the fact that I believe that Prime Minister's Question Time is being spoilt by the form of questioning that takes place.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Weatherill. The Committee is in some difficulty on this occasion. With regard to almost all social security measures during the previos Parliament and in this Parliament so far, the Department has issued notes which have made life a little easier for hon. Members who wish to table amendments. I am sure that you will appreciate that there is considerable difficulty in tabling amendments to this Bill. You will notice that no amendments have been tabled in the name of the Government or of any Conservative Back Bencher. Labour Back Benchers have had considerable difficulty in tabling amendments as well as in trying to ensure debates on various important topics.<br/>
I draw your attention, Mr. Weatherill, to amendment No. 1, standing in my name, which was an attempt to ensure that the Committee would have a proper debate on why it was necessary for the procedures to be rushed in order that all the stages on the Bill be taken today. New clause 2, to which my name is attached, was an attempt to ensure that we could have a debate on the whole question of the upper limit. Because of the difficulty in tabling amendments, neither proposal has been selected.<br/>
Is it possible within the selection of amendments to debate the central question why this measure should be stamped through the House within a week, and also the second question of the upper limit, which would enable us to make more sense of many of our earlier amendments with regard to alternative ways of raising revenue? I ask for your guidance on these matters.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Gentleman that this is an extremely complicated Bill. Fortunately, it is not for me to give guidance on it. That is a matter for the Government. The hon.

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Weatherill. I am extremely grateful for the ruling that you have just given with regard to new clause 2. That may not be unconnected with the point about notes on clauses, which are almost traditional in respect of social security measures. Is there a printing error in the list of amendments? As you said, the Bill is complex, and it raises &#x00A3;1 billion of finance via a form of taxation. Can you say whether some amendments are missing because they did not reach the printer in time, or whether there is a separate sheet? I am not the only hon. Member to notice that not one amendment has been tabled by a Conservative Member. I just wonder whether they tabled them too late or whether, like my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett), they were waiting for the notes on clauses. This is an astonishing situation &#x2014; <i>[Interruption.]</i> &#x2014; and it is no good the Secretary of State pooh-poohing the matter. It is not without significance that not one amendment by a Conservative Member appears on the Amendment Paper.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can reply to the question about why my hon. Friends have not tabled amendments. I am


a little puzzled about the notes on clauses. I have been advised that we gave infractions for 30 copies of the notes on clauses to be placed in the Vote Office, and I have been informed that they were sent yesterday. I must tell the House that for some reason they do not appear to be available in the Vote Office. They were sent by my department to the Vote Office, and urgent inquiries are being made to ascertain why they are not available for hon. Members. They are intended as a help, as I am sure, Mr. Weatherill, you will understand. In a sense they are help offered by the Department, but they are not an essential part of the Bill.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Weatherill. This is the first social security measure either in the previous Parliament or in this one whose Committee stage has been taken on the the Floor of the House.

If the Secretary of State has slipped in 30 copies to the Vote Office without telling anyone&#x2014;[Hon. Members: "He has not."] They are not there, but the right hon. Gentleman has admitted that he intended to slip them in. My hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) and myself, as Opposition Front Bench spokesmen, have not received them, nor has any of my hon. Friends. Until copies are available for hon.

<p>I recognise your difficulties, Mr. Weatherill, and I realise that the problem is not ore of your creation, but one created by the Government. Over the last week or two the Government have slipped through a series of measures rapidly and often by sleight of hand which have been discovered by public and other pressure. They introduced his Bill on Monday, with the Committee stage to be taken on Thursday, and they have failed to provide the necessary information for Members on both sides of the House in the customary way.<br/>
I understand your difficulties in relation to suspending the sitting, Mr. Weatherill, but it is within the bounds of the Government's discretion, in view of this situation, in view of their failure to give their Back Benchers an opportunity to table amendments, and in view of apparent inability to reconsider the Bill and to get it right at Committee stage, for them either to withdraw the Bill or 10 proceed only to the Committee stage and leave the remaining stages for another day. We are being asked not only to rush through the Bill within three days of its being introduced, but to consider the remaining stages in one day. That is unprecedented; and to compound that, the Government have failed to give us the correct information in order for us to be able to continue the debate. I ask the Secretary of State to say either that he will withdraw the Bill or that we shall not sit beyond 10 o'clock tonight.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Weatherill. It is a fairly recent practice on the part of

Governments of both colours to make available notes on clauses. As I understand it, that is purely at the discretion of the Government of the day. In my view, this Bill is exceptional in that it is accompanied by the Government Actuary's report, which gives full information as to the financial implications of the Bill, not quite clause by clause but virtually clause by clause. In view of that, and in view of the full explanation that was given to the whole House on Second Reading earlier this week, the Opposition are on weak ground in trying to pursue this point.<br/>
With regard to the specific points raised by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) about the absence of amendments from this side of the House, it could be that, having studied the Bill and having heard the speech of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in introducing the Bill, Conservative Members were satisfied and did not wish to table any amendments.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Weatherill. I entirely agree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, East (Mr. Buchan) that this in no way your responsibility. However, I disagree with the hon. Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean). Will the Secretary of State tell us whether he can recall any precedents on this matter? I think he will agree that when I was Secretary of State for Social Services notes on clauses were circulated on every matter concerning health or social security. Simply to have the Actuary's report is an entirely different matter. We are dealing here with a situation in which a Bill is being rushed through the House, and putting Back Benchers at a great disadvantage. Is that not in line with the action that was taken earlier this week, when a statement was made in reply to a Select Committee report, when the Chairman of that Committee was not informed that a statement would be made? Is it not a reasonable request that if the Secretary of State has prepared the notes on clauses the House should stand adjourned until it has had an opportunity to see them? He intended hon. Members to see them, and he wishes us to see them, so let us see them before we proceed with the debate</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Weatherill. You have said that this is a highly technical Bill. The House depends on precedent to a great degree. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Ennals), who was Secretary of State for Social Services in the Labour Government, pointed out that for several years notes on clauses have been provided. It is no good the present Secretary of State saying that they are not essential to the Bill, and that the Bill can proceed without them. The fact remains that it is a well-established precedent&#x2014;a precedent to which the Secretary of State subscribes.<br/>
I do not think that it is unreasonable, in order to ensure that the precedent is followed, to suggest that this sitting should be suspended so that the information can be provided, read and comprehended. If the public at large heard this discussion, they would say that we were daft to carry on in this way. Apparently, the Secretary of State wants to help the House, but he cannot do so because of a procedural difficulty. I ask you, Mr. Weatherill, to consider suspending the sitting for as long as it will take to get the notes here and give us time to absorb them. I


suggest that an hour would probably be sufficient. If the notes were here, we could probably peruse them sufficiently within half an hour.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can help the House. When I convey to hon. Members the information that I have they may feel that they could have done more to help themselves. The notes on clauses have been in the Library since yesterday. There is a notice to that effect in the Library. The Vote Office, which is an office of the House, and not my Department, said that it was unable to accept the notes, and they were therefore placed in the Library.<br/>
Hon. Members will know that it has been the practice of the Library for many years to prepare notes for the guidance of Members. It does not seem to be unreasonable to suggest that in these circumstances hon. Members might have informed themselves of the notes that were in the Library. I respectfully suggest, Mr. Weatherill that we should make progress with the Bill. The amendments that have been tabled by Labour Members are abundantly clear, and it is clear that those hon. Members who have tabled amendments have understood the Bill admirably. They are seeking to make changes, and there is no reason to doubt the capacity of Labour Members to debate their amendments successfully. We shall try to give replies that, I hope, will satisfy the House.</p>

<p>Order. Before I take any further points of order, I think that I should make my position clear. My responsibility is to ensure that those official documents that are necessary for the debate are in the Vote Office. I am not responsible for guidance notes or anything of that sort, so points of order to me on that subject are irrelevant. I cannot deal with them. I think that we should proceed with the Bill, because we have a very heavy day ahead of us.</p>

<p>We understand your difficulties, Mr. Weatherill, and we accept your ruling. However, as you have expressed it very well in the past, it is partly your responsibility to ensure fairness to both sides of the House, and to ensure a free, well-informed and open debate. We are concerned about that and about the opportunity, under the guidance notes, to put forward the right amendments.<br/>
The Secretary of State is more than half disingenuous. I have served in several Departments, but this is the first time that I have been involved with the social security Department. It is also the first time that a Minister has failed to draw to the attention of Front Bench speakers the availability of notes. That responsibility is his, and it has not been fulfilled.<br/>
Some of us have been working hard in the Library for the past three days trying to understand some of the complexities of the Bill. At no time were the notes brought to our attention. However it was done, there was certainly a slip-up in the delivery of information to the Opposition Front Bench.<br/>
The easy way out of the difficulty is for the Secretary of State to join us in asking for a suspension so that we can study the notes and, if necessary, prepare manuscript amendments which, I hope, you will consider carefully, Mr. Weatherill.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Weatherill. Occasionally papers are delayed in Committee upstairs and the practice is to adjourn for a short while so that hon. Members may study the papers, because that expedites the proceedings.<br/>
An eight-page document is now available, though the Secretary of State did not know when he arrived here that copies were available in the Library. If he had known, he would have informed the Committee. He became aware of it only as a result of information that reached him later.<br/>
The purpose of the change in our procedures and the provision of notes on clauses is to enable hon. Members to understand clauses better, and it is, therefore, a method of expediting discussion. A suspension of the sitting for half an hour would allow some of us to obtain the document, and we could return for a better-informed discussion.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Weatherill. A number of us are staggered that the Opposition want time to consider the notes. The whole Bill appears to us to be childishly simple. Two documents have been made available in the Vote Office, and I assure the hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), whom we welcome to the Opposition Front Bench, that the only reason why my hon. Friends and I have not tabled amendments is that we understand the Bill with great clarity and are more than satisfied with it. It is unnecessary for us to consider wasting the time of the Committee to allow Labour Members the chance to absorb what they should know anyway if they were on top of their jobs.</p>

<p>Further to the point of order, Mr. Weatherill. We all understood and agreed with your ruling on your responsibility as regards papers in the Vote Office, but beyond that the Chair has a responsibility in relation to established precedents of the House. The Secretary of State has told us candidly that a precedent has been broken. His first explanation was that there had been a breakdown in communications between the Elephant and Castle and Westminster. The second explanation was that, for some reason or other, the Vote Office refused to accept the papers.<br/>
That sort of thing has happened before. We understand that the notes are available. I urge a suspension of the sitting, because you know, Mr. Weatherill, as well as I that a short suspension can often save an enormous amount of time later. We do not want to go on like this all night, as we did on a previous occasion which you may remember.<br/>
If, Mr. Weatherill, you will not accept a suspension proposal, will you accept a motion to report progress? I agree that we have not made much progress yet, but such a motion is one of the established ways of coping with the sort of difficulty that the Secretary of State has put us in. I can remember many precedents&#x2014;for example, on the Abortion Bill in the 1960s &#x2014; when the device of reporting progress, however much or little progress had actually been made, has been used so that Members can study a Bill and get on smoothly. Clearly, we shall not get on smoothly as if we go on as we are.</p>

<p>I must rule on that major point of order. I cannot accept a motion to report progress. As the hon. Gentleman said, we have not made any progress. I


am aware that guidance notes have sometimes been put out by Departments, but sometimes they have not. It is not an established precedent that every Bill should have guidance notes.<br/>
The most helpful suggestion that I can make is that we should proceed with the first group of amendments&#x2014;the discussion will probably last for at least an hour&#x2014;and that hon. Members who have not seen the document, which has been available, I understand, in the Library for day, should take the opportunity to look at it. If they wish to submit manuscript amendments, I shall certainly consider them. Shall we proceed with the first group of amendments?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is correct. Of course, the box in the Library does not contain all the documents shown in the index. It is well known that documents placed in Library boxes go adrift. The Library staff are always complaining about it. I know that the Low Pay Unit brief was missing from the box a few hours ago, because my copy was required for making a number of copies.<br/>
Amendment No. 2 seeks to substitute &#x00A3;28 for &#x00A3;27 as the weekly earnings that trigger off payments of national

insurance contributions. Several hon. Members referred on Second Reading to the fact that the increase was a hidden form of tax on the lowest paid. Most people do not appreciate that the national insurance system does not work like the income tax system. Once one passes the threshold at which contributions become payable, they are payable on earnings below the threshold, which is not the case in the income tax system.<br/>
It is estimated that for that reason about 50,000 of the lowest-paid workers in the country will have a massive increase in their marginal rate of tax from next April, because they will pass into the earnings level at which they are required to pay national insurance. I shall give the Committee some examples so that we can see the scale of what the Government are proposing. The problem was referred to extensively in the LPU brief, and I do not want to reiterate what was said on Second Reading.<br/>
I am pleased to see a Treasury Minister on the Government Front Bench. I hope that he will remain throughout the proceedings. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said on Second Reading:
<q>The hon. Member for Isle of Ely (Mr. Freud) said that there is a poverty trap difficulty in what is being proposed. I cannot deny that. It is a subject more suitable to the close, detailed examination that only a Committee stage can provide".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 1072.]</q>
We could examine the Bill in more detail if we were provided with more information.<br/>
Let us examine part-time workers. In 1979, part-time workers worked an average of 20&#x00B7;4 hours per week. The average pay was between &#x00A3;26 and &#x00A3;28. That is the point at which they are to be put into the national insurance system.<br/>
I shall give some examples of people who will, because they earn an extra &#x00A3;1 or 50p, be subject to a national insurance impost in excess of &#x00A3;2. That will put them in an invidious position. I refer to wages council industries for which figures are available. A 19-year-old "service worker", working as a cloakroom/toilet attendant or night porter in a hotel, will earn &#x00A3;54 for a 40-hour week in London. It is not uncommon for such workers to split jobs. For 20 hours' work, that person will earn &#x00A3;27 a week and, therefore, be required to pay national insurance contributions of more than &#x00A3;2 a week.<br/>
An 18-year-old "regular worker" working in a bar, pub restaurant or club outside London earns &#x00A3;57 a week, or &#x00A3;28&#x00B7;50 for a 20-hour week. Such a person would still be caught if our amendment were accepted, because the amendment increases the figure only to &#x00A3;28. There is a limit to how far we can go in amending the original Act to give the Government scope to move away from the original intention, which was to make the lower earnings limit equivalent to the old-age pension. Since 24 November, the pension has been &#x00A3;27&#x00B7;15 a week. Therefore, the Government's provision is within the law.<br/>
As I made clear on Monday, the Government have changed the law. The old-age pension no longer goes up in line with average earnings. It goes up in line with prices. In this case, the price rise is less than the earnings rise The pension should have gone up to &#x00A3;28&#x00B7;30 if the Government had not changed the rule.<br/>
We are trying to match the original bipartisan, consensus approach to the way in which pension details are organised. That approach has been changed by the


Government. We chose the &#x00A3;28 figure because that is the nearest to what the pension would have been had the Government not changed the rule.<br/>
We have not had a chance to cost our amendments, so I hope that Government Ministers will not tell us that we have not provided for the increased costs in our amendments. We have made some attempts to gain increased revenue, although you in your wisdom, Mr. Weatherill, have not selected all our amendments. We cannot cost this amendment because there has not been time to table the necessary questions. We have been pushed at a speed which is not commensurate with making good law. I should be interested to know the cost of our amendment, because that would help my hon. Friends when drafting manuscript amendments.<br/>
4.45 pm<br/>
The Government's view is contrary to the spirit of their election manifesto. It is contrary to the reality of the social security and income tax system in Britain. The Government are pushing more people into the poverty trap. The Chief Secretary has admitted that. I am surprised that some of the so-called experts who have campaigned for many years on the interaction of tax on the social security system are missing from the Government Benches. They know that the first debate is on a crucial subject. They know that more people will pay more combined tax and social security at a lower rate of earnings than is good for the nation.<br/>
I shall quote from "The Wealth of Nations" on the consequence of taxing the low-paid. I suspect that Government Members are under strict instructions to keep their mouths shut and keep out of the Chamber because the Government wish to bounce the Bill through the House.<br/>
Adam Smith said:
<q>If direct taxes upon the wages of labour"&#x2014;</q>
taxes mean social security contributions in this case&#x2014;
<q>have not always occasioned a proportionable rise in those wages, it is because they have generally occasioned a considerable fall in the demand for labour.</q>
What is the Government's estimate of the increase in unemployment following the enactment of the Bill?<br/>
Adam Smith continued:
<q>The declension of industry, the decrease of employment for the poor, the diminution of the annual produce of the land and labour of the country, have generally been the effects of such taxes".</q>
He meant taxes on the low-paid. By not raising the lower earnings limit to a level which is high enough to meet the requirements of the law, and certainly by not raising it to meet the requirements of the 50,000 low-paid who will be pushed into paying an impost of &#x00A3;2 a week for crossing over the threshold, the Government are doing a great disservice to the nation.<br/>
I do not intend to stray into areas which do not relate to the amendment. I understand that we are to be allowed a debate on the upper earnings limit on clause stand part. I doubt that there will be much left to discuss then, but that is subject to what my hon. Friends find in the notes on the clauses.<br/>
I ask the Government to come clean and to itemise the cost. The Government will say that they are bound by the law. However, they could have tabled a paving amendment. We are asking only for a 99p variation between the old-age pension and the lower earnings band. That is not an open-ended commitment that can be abused.

The amendment is responsible. I hope that the Government show some good will during the passage of the Bill. The Bill is being bounced through the House. It is a massive tax measure which involves a &#x00A3;1 billion impost and will raise about &#x00A3;2.4 billion in 1981&#x2013;82.<br/>
There are one or two other points that I and some of my right hon. and hon. Friends should like to raise on this group of amendments, but we are in Committee and can raise them later. Therefore, I shall wait until some of my hon. Friends have spoken and the Secretary of State has given the Government's view on the amendments.</p>

<p>I have some sympathy with what the hon. Member for Birminghan, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) said. He reinforced the matters that have been raised with us by the Child Poverty Action Group and, in particular, by the Low Pay Unit about the possible regressive effect on the lower earnings limit. The hon. Gentleman's amendment proposes a very marginal change in this respect to increase the lower earnings limit from &#x00A3;27 to &#x00A3;28. I shall listen with interest to the Minister's reply to the amendment.<br/>
The Committee should address itself also to a wider question which in my opinion, is directly relevant to the amendment&#x2014; namely, what the loss of revenue would be if the amendment were accepted. I am sure that whichever Minister replies to this group of amendments will be able to tell us the financial implications. In the Government Actuary's report which is associated with the Bill, the estimate for the surplus on the national insurance fund, taking into account the revenue which will accrue as a result of the Bill and the outgo which is already agreed, will be &#x00A3;39 million in 1981&#x2013;82. In my opinion, that is a very small surplus in view of the large outlay that is involved.<br/>
If we accept this amendment and the similar amendments to which we shall come later, will we endanger the firm commitment that we have to maintain the real value of benefits? The pension and other long-term benefits&#x2014;the retirement pension and widow's benefit are by far the biggest proportion of outlay&#x2014;were increased by 16&#x00BD; per cent. for the year beginning 24 November this year. That is a commitment that goes through this year and, no doubt, will be continued into a further increase in benefits in the year beginning November 1981. We are obliged to ensure in the Bill that there is sufficient revenue to the national insurance fund to meet these firm commitments, some of which are already in operation.<br/>
I hope, therefore, that my right hon. Friend will be able to respond to what the hon. Gentleman said. I fully appreciate that the hon. Gentleman has not had time to do the full research. So I hope that my right hon. Friend will inform the Committee what loss of revenue will be involved and what the implications are for the firm commitment on expenditure that the Government have already embarked upon for pensions and other benefits.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman referred to the Government Actuary's report. An interesting question arises from appendix 3 to that report. The Government Actuary's estimates arrive at a surplus of &#x00A3;39 million on the basis of an 11 per cent. uprating of benefits in November 1981. That makes nonsense of all the figures. Will the Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer abate those benefits under the Social Security (No. 2) Act 1980 so that the benefits will not go up by 11


per cent.? That would throw the Government Actuary's forecast of any surplus and deficit completely haywire. We want this information now. Unless the facts about next year's uprating are made available, some of the costings the amendments or the Government Actuary's forecast are nonsense.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Gentleman knows very well from his previous experience that it would be highly unusual for Governments to speculate on the likely level of uprating nearly 12 months from now.<br/>
We know that there is a firm commitment for the uprating of the long-term benefits by 16&#x00BD; per cent. and of the short-term benefits by a lesser amount. That is already in operation and has to be paid for. The Government Actuary has given his calculations in that respect. If we are to accept the hon. Gentleman's amendments regarding the lower earnings limit and also the upper earnings limit, together with a number of later amendments, what would be the likely effect on the national insurance fund? Would that fund then be able to meet its commitments? if the fund is unlikely to be able to meet its commitments&#x2014;the Government Actuary's calculations suggest that the margin is very narrow&#x2014;we are saying, in effect, in adopting the amendment that we are withdrawing from the pledge made regarding the increase in pensions and other benefits which began on 24 November.<br/>
There is another matter which I think is relevant to the amendment and to later amendments. It concerns the balance which was struck, on the contributions side as well as the benefits side, in what is now called the Barbara Castle pensions Act. A balance was struck at the time and accepted by the then Opposition. So we now have, and I rejoice in it, a broadly bipartisan approach to the Castle Tensions Act. I am profoundly relieved that we are not now discussing a possible Jenkin pensions Act. If we are to take that bipartisan approach seriously, an approach which was agreed after much labour, we must be careful that we do not upset the balance between lower earnings limits and upper earnings limits, that being part of the bargain which was struck at the time. I hope, therefore, that my right hon. Friend will be able to give us information on those two matters.<br/>
I listened sympathetically to some of the hon. Gentleman's arguments, but if my right hon. Friend is able to convince the House of the need for this additional revenue and the need to preserve the balance and to maintain the compromise in the Barbara Castle pensions Act I, for one, shall hold the view that those arguments outweigh the other arguments that have been adduced by the hon. Member for Perry Barr.</p>

<p>I was interested in some of the points raised by the hon. Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean). The bipartisan approach, which I am certain was warmly welcomed, came when Mrs. Castle and the late Mr. O'Malley were Ministers, which was in a very different age, when there were genuine attempts over many months to find such an approach for the new pension scheme. I understand that the hon. Gentleman does not want to see anything which would damage that, but we must accept that the bipartisan approach to pensions, the national insurance fund and benefits has been totally destroyed by the Government's actions over the past 18 months. Whatever they may have said before the election,

they have introduced a whole series of Bills, until this one, concerned only to reduce benefit entitlements for the elderly and those on short-term benefits, including the unemployed.<br/>
The Bill before us has a different role. After two Acts which removed the entitlements of national insurance beneficiaries, the question whether it has been introduced to ensure that there is enough money in the fund to fulfil the commitments to national insurance recipients is irrelevant. The Secretary of State himself in the Second Reading debate on Monday referred to what is proposed as a surcharge. That reference is to be found in column 947 of <i>Hansard</i> of 8 December. It is a surcharge. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury recognised that the Bill introduced a piece of taxation, that it had nothing to do with benefits but was a quick&#x2014;and, we thought, very unfair&#x2014;way simply to raise additional revenue to rescue the Government from the crisis that they have got into<br/>
Therefore, to analyse whether the motive was to enable the fund to fulfil its commitments shows a naivety on the part of the hon. Gentleman that I would not have expected from him, with all his experience of the subject in office and in the House and in Standing Committees. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) said, we can see this only as a piece of straight taxation. I was going to say "straight but crooked". It is certainly straight but unfair.<br/>
The amendments, modest as they are, aim to make the changes less unfair. My hon. Friend rightly pointed out that on Second Reading it was agreed that we should look again at the poverty trap. I wish to draw upon the notes made available to us all by the Low Pay Unit, because they are valid. The unit says:
<q>The problem is compounded for the families of at least 90,000 low paid workers who are caught in the poverty trap by virtue of the fact that they receive Family Income Supplement and other means-tested benefits. In addition to the 37&#x00BE;p in the pound deductions for income tax and National Insurance, each additional pound that such families earn also reduces the amount of benefit they are entitled to. The effective marginal tax rate faced by those caught in the poverty trap thus turns out to be either slightly below or slightly above 100 per cent. Indeed the latest DHSS figures indicate that a married man with two young children will have a total disposable income of around &#x00A3;63 a week whether his weekly wage is actually &#x00A3;39 or &#x00A3;79. The Government's decision to raise National Insurance contributions can only help to deepen the trap that these families find themselves in.</q>
That is illogical, because during the whole period when the Secretary of State was in Opposition he was concerned, as I was, with the poverty trap. We were devising methods, such as child benefit, to try to narrow it. The Bill can only widen the poverty trap and bring more people within it.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for reminding the House of the debates that we had in earlier manifestations. Perhaps I may in turn remind him of the argument that he and his hon. Friends used to advance from the Government Dispatch Box when these points were made that two of the main means-tested benefits which give rise to the phenomenon to which the Low Pay Unit draws attention, family income supplement and the housing benefit, run on&#x2014;FIS for a year and housing benefit for six months.<br/>
Certainly, for the FIS benefit, the uprating of the entitlement figures each year means that there is not the snapshot effect that the Low Pay Unit has drawn attention


to in its report, but a more dynamic effect, which greatly mitigates the phenomenon to which the right hon. Gentleman is drawing attention.<br/>
The Low Pay Unit does not take account, in any of its figures, of that six-month or 12-month run-on. I remember the right hon. Gentleman advancing those same arguments from this Box.</p>

<p>I accept the value and significance of the run-on. My point is that the proposals before the Committee will deepen the poverty trap. The right hon. Gentleman cannot question that. He cannot question, either, that people on very low incomes &#x2014; including many part-time workers earning between &#x00A3;27 and &#x00A3;29 a week&#x2014;who would not have been touched by tax will be brought into payment.<br/>
That is one of the reasons why my hon. Friends on the Front Bench have tabled an amendment to try, at least modestly, to raise the floor. I wish that it had been possible to raise the floor much higher and that the law had entitled us to raise the ceiling much higher, too, as the right hon. Gentleman accepts that this is a form of taxation. It is a form of taxation that is grossly regressive and gives easy opportunities for those at the higher end of the earnings rate to escape from its real significance, because of the ceiling.<br/>
Therefore, I support the amendments, although I think that they are far too modest. They are as far as it is possible for us to go in this debate.<br/>
I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will tell us some of the financial implications of what is being done. I did not share the belief of the hon. Member for Somerset, North that the estimated surplus, in the Government Actuary's view, was running dangerously low. That is why I said that I did not think that this measure was introduced to deal with the problem of a very low balance in the fund. It is introduced to deal with the deplorable economic situation that the Government have got themselves into.</p>

<p>The argument of the hon. Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean) was persuasive&#x2014;or was it? He said that the argument for the changes that the Government have made &#x2014; that is, changing the lower limit at a lesser rate than that at which they are changing the higher limit&#x2014;was to maintain the real value of benefits. Some hon. Members pointed out that the real value of some benefits was not being maintained. Those are the short-term benefits in the national insurance scheme, which are being cut for the first time since the 1930s&#x2014;in fact, the first time since 1928&#x2014;by five percentage points.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman quickly recovered to say that the main benefits that we were considering were those for the long-term beneficiaries, particularly pensioners and widows. Is it true to say that the Government will maintain the value of those benefits? If not, presumably the arguments supporting the differential changes between the floor and the ceiling of contributions in the national insurance scheme will begin to fall apart.</p>

<p>In fact, their value is being somewhat improved this year as a result of the 16&#x00BD; per cent. increase. No one can deny that. The facts are well established. I note that the former Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Ennals) is nodding.<br/>
The totality of benefits was increased on 24 November. The increases will ricochet into forward years and they will have to be paid for. My judgment on the Government Actuary's figures is that the increases in the Bill will be needed to pay for those increased benefits. If I am wrong, I am sure that my right hon. Friend will correct me when he replies to the debate.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention. One of the problems is that the contribution years as laid down in the Bill do not coincide with the benefit years. If the Bill is enacted, it will take effect from April 1981. The pension increases announced on 24 November will run for a full calendar year. Therefore, there will be an overlap of six months.<br/>
I ask the hon. Gentleman to take his argument forward. The rate of the retirement pension will be partly determined by this measure, but it will be determined in the early part of next year for November 1981. Is the real value of that benefit being increased? We know from statements made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the real value in one sense will not be maintained because of what is called the overpayment of 1 per cent. this year.<br/>
I asked the Library to make researches to ascertain whether there was another example of a Government, at the beginning of a review period, making a statement to the effect that pensions, which the hon. Member for Somerset, North has said are one of the main benefits that take up much, if not most, of this expenditure, were to be increased by less than the anticipated rate of inflation&#x2014;in other words, a cut.<br/>
The Library found that the only other Government who announced that the coming pension increase would amount to a cut in money terms were the one in office in 1920. The Government then said that they were confident that there would be a real increase in pensions, irrespective of the review period in 1920. as the boom had collapsed and there would be a fall in prices.<br/>
It seems that the Government have another first. We have had an announcement that the major national insurance benefit&#x2014;that paid to old-age pensioners&#x2014; will be cut in real terms next year. The Government have made an announcement to that effect. We must consider that pledge, promise or threat in the context of the floor and ceiling of the national insurance fund.<br/>
As usual, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) explained clearly the reasons why the opposition would ask for the support of the Committee&#x2014;</p>

<p>It may be that my hon. Friend has overlooked a rather important issue in responding to the reasonably put argument of the hon. Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean). The balance to which the hon. Gentleman referred was struck in 1975. There was written into the 1975 Act for the uprating of pensions the earnings link. That has been killed by the Government, with the consequence that this year alone a


&#x00A3;2 loss will be experienced by pensioners when account is taken of the sum by which they would have benefited had the Government not introduced the first Social Security Bill earlier this year. That is an important factor to bear in mind.<br/>
The loss of &#x00A3;2 followed an earlier effective cut, in that there was a failure to make food certain excess of earnings figures over price figures early in the year. That produced a loss of 50p to 60p a week. This year, pensioners suffered an effective loss of about &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50 per week before the Bill was introduced.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1789599" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1097.0" hansard_membership_id="93" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2692" speakername="Mr. Field" colnum="1097" time="17:15:00">
<p>My right hon. Friend has put clearly the difference between the two major parties on how pensioners are being treated. That will be taken into account during our discussions in Committee. The Government rightly say that they made up the shortfall by the pens tort uprating that took place in their first year of office. However, they did not make good the shortfall for the short-term national insurance benefits. There was a cut in the first year, followed by a 5 per cent. cut in the second year. It is as plain as a pike staff that there will be a cut in the third year.<br/>
Before my right hon. Friend intervened, I was about to turn to the arguments advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr. The change of one percentage point may not seem to be particularly important to sonic, but it is especially significant for those at the bottom of the earnings pile. My hon. Fiend was right to draw the Committee's attention to the importance of the change to part-time workers. His homework was better than mine, in that it included references to the new earnings survey to establish the groups of workers and the numbers of part-time workers who would be affected by the change.<br/>
My hon. Friend advanced the valid argument that we must all make a distinction between national insurance and income tax increases. In the public's mind there is often confusion between the two We have a threshold, in the income tax system. That threshold is determined by personal allowances. As we move over the threshold we begin to pay tax at about the threshold point. However, the national insurance scheme is similar to what the old exemption system used to be in our income tax system, until Austen Chamberlain changed it in his famous Budget of 1920 or 1921.<br/>
Until that Budget, tax allowances were valuable only if a person's income was below a certain level. Once the threshold was crossed, the whole of a person's income came into tax. Austen Chamberlain created the beginning A the personal allowances system by allowing everyone co claim value of the allowances and not to pay tax on the equivalent of the allowances &#x2014; the allowances Hatched against one's personal income.<br/>
There is a difference between crossing the tax threshold for the low-paid, who begin to pay tax only on the next &#x00A3;1 of earnings, and crossing the national insurance threshold, whereby the low-paid begin to pay tax on all their earnings up to that point as they would have done ender the old exemption system of taxation. That must be borne in mind and linked to my second point, which concerns the changes over the past few years in the threshold for national insurance contributions and the changes in the tax threshold, which are important in this debate.<br/>
If we cast our minds back, we will recollect that we used to live in a world where the threshold for national

insurance benefits was well below that for taxation. The two are now almost in alignment. My hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr made the point that as the low-paid crossed the national insurance threshold they will pay tax at 7&#x00B7;75 per cent. on all their earnings up to that point, unless we are lucky with our amendment. They will also begin to pay tax on their marginal rates of tax. A cruel pincer movement will operate against them.<br/>
Such arguments would not carry that much weight if the national insurance contributions bore only the burden that they were meant to bear in the original national insurance scheme. I was lucky enough to catch your eye, Mr. Weatherill, on Second Reading, and I drew to the attention of the House the fundamental change in the size of the contribution that comes from the Exchequer. That is relevant to our amendments, particularly No. 2.<br/>
Beveridge considered it important that we should all earn our right to benefit. There were powerful arguments for that then, and there may be today'. He won the case for that argument on the basis that if there were a poll tax everyone would feel that he had earned his right to benefit and because that poll tax would bear heavily on low-paid workers we could expect to claim only a certain amount of revenue from the poll tax for the whole national insurance fund. Beveridge envisaged that as rights to benefit grew in the post-war years the employee and employer contributions should fall as a percentage of the total fund and an increasing percentage should be picked up by the Exchequer.<br/>
Unfortunately, I do not have the exact figures with me, but they are in the 1944 White Paper on the Beveridge report. If I remember correctly the Exchequer contribution rose sharply throughout the post-war period until it was about 70 per cent. in 1965. In other words, the Exchequer was picking almost three-quarters of the cost of the national insurance fund, the cost being borne by general taxation, which was clearly much more progressive than the proportional system of taxation, which is what the income tax system is for most taxpayers in 1980&#x2013;81.<br/>
Governments of both parties allowed that major change to occur in the post-war period, but particularly the Conservatives. In 1961, with the introduction of earnings-related contributions, the Government decided that there would be no Exchequer supplement to those contributions. We shall return in later amendments to the considerable fall, under the Bill, in the Exchequer contribution from 18 to 14 per cent. To some people the change from 7&#x00B7;75 to 6&#x00B7;75 per cent. may seem trivial, but it is important for the reasons that I have tried to outline. As my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr said, as soon as a person crosses the national insurance threshold he pays tax on every pound of earnings.<br/>
It is important also in a second respect. The threshold for national insurance contributions is now closely aligned to the tax threshold. At that stage, a person is also beginning to pick up a tax bill. Thirdly, over the post-war period we have seen that much more of the national insurance fund financed from contributions from employers and employees and a very significant decrease in the Exchequer contribution.</p>

<p>I shall happily give way to the right hon. Gentleman if he wishes to take up that point.<br/>
An increasing burden is being put on employers and employees, and changes in the rate are therefore that much more important than they would have been had the Exchequer, for example, been footing 70 per cent. of the bill.<br/>
If we are concerned about the low-paid and the burden of taxation that they bear, there are powerful arguments for amendment No. 2. My right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Ennals) also stated that we cannot view those arguments as separate from the arguments about the poverty trap.<br/>
In Opposition, one tends to think of the poverty trap as having a snapshot effect. In Government, one always stresses what wonderful administrative changes have been brought about so that people are not caught in the trap. The real test is how our constituents are affected by the changes. We do not have as much contact with our constituents as we should like, as we have many other tasks to perform. However, I know of people in my constituency who have been affected by the snapshot effect of the poverty trap, as the Secretary of State called it. They have not been released by the different time lags of changes in benefits and tax rates. The poverty trap argument must be taken on board. We know of families affected by it, in spite of the fact that the intellectual and academic arguments say that it is as a figment of our imagination.<br/>
I am puzzled by amendment No. 3. I am an abolitionist for the ceiling on national insurance contributions. I am puzzled why my hon. Friends, whom I trust on these issues, ask us to support an amendment that appears to be a contradiction of our normal stance.<br/>
I had the benefit yesterday of speaking to someone who helped to devise the 1975 Pensions Act. I was truly puzzled by the explanation that the Financial Secretary gave on Second Reading. I thought that perhaps I had missed something in the background to the 1975 Act, as though the ceiling was of crucial importance to the agreement that we had made with the occupational pension funds. If so, that argument should be spelt out. If that agreement is torn up, the Government have only themselves to blame. The Treasury has destroyed the consensus between the parties on pensions and must take the responsibility if the failure, break-up or tearing up of consensus is followed through.<br/>
The real reason why the formula in the 1975 Act of six and a half or seven times the minimum was thought of was that it was then considered important to limit the contribution on those bands of income before taxpayers reached the old surtax rates. In other words, we did not want extra contributions or a proportional contribution from those taxpayers who would have then crossed the surtax band&#x2014;now called the higher rates of tax.<br/>
One change, particularly from the 1979 Budget, is that the thresholds for the higher rates of tax were changed dramatically. There is, therefore, a powerful case for saying that, given that fact, there is not now a problem of lifting the ceiling&#x2014;certainly not in the terms that some of my hon. Friends have thought&#x2014;and linking people into the surtax bands as well.<br/>
As an abolitionist, I am puzzled that some of my hon. Friends should have put down amendments to bring the ceiling down from, I believe, &#x00A3;200 to &#x00A3;195. There is a powerful case for abolishing the ceiling. We on the Labour

Benches must, sadly, accept that we shall be unable to influence the way the Government spend the revenue that arises from the Bill.</p>

<p>In case my hon. Friend concludes sooner then I had expected, and in order to muddy the waters a little, may I make one point clear? There were two Acts in 1975&#x2014;one on pensions and one on social security. Much of those Acts was based on the 1973 legislation, which was the responsibility of the Conservatives.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that intervention, because it reminds me of a point that I should have stressed but did not, which is that if there was agreement between the parties on pensions we have to ask at what cost. The answer is that the scheme was satisfactory to the occupational scheme, and that in itself seems a good reason for questioning whether the State&#x2014;that is, the taxpayer&#x2014; obtained a good enough deal. In considering whether the private sector is satisfied with certain underwritings from taxpayers, perhaps we should consider whether the taxpayer's interest was pushed hard enough.<br/>
The argument for lifting the ceiling is separate from that about whether the Government are right to bring in the Bill and to increase taxation by &#x00A3;2 billion-plus. There is a powerful Socialist argument for raising the ceiling on contributions, but now there is a High Tory argument for it as well. Although the Government will find the Bill helpful in meeting the public sector borrowing requirement this year, they are putting in their legislative programme a time bomb that will make it that much more difficult for them to achieve their targets in the coming year. That is why Labour Members keep returning to the real cuts in benefits by the Government.<br/>
If earnings-related supplements are phased out and national insurance benefits are cut in real terms, more and more families and individual claimants will be pushed on to means-tested assistance. The more that happens, the bigger will be the bill to be met either by the taxpayer or from the PSBR to pay the supplementary benefit budget. The more claimants that are kept within the national insurance scheme, the easier it will be in coming years in this Parliament to reduce to the PSBR as a proportion of GDP, which is one of the Government's major objectives.<br/>
While there is that High Tory argument, there is also a powerful Socialist argument. We wish to have a society in which people are not made dependent on means-tested benefits but claim them as of right, as citizens, free of means tests. The Treasury Bench talks about securing consensus, and here is a new consensus growing between both sides on the reforms needed in the national insurance fund to secure the Government's objective of meeting the PSBR and our objective of freeing people from means tests and making sure that those who have been conscripted into the army of the unemployed to fight inflation do not bear an undue proportion of the cost. Those of us who are lucky enough to remain in jobs will then put much more into the national insurance fund so that the unemployed can draw decent benefits as of right and free of means tests. I am puzzled by amendment No. 3, which seeks to lower the ceiling. I should prefer it to be abolished for those powerful arguments.<br/>
We must bear in mind, in considering amendments Nos. 2 and 3, that we are dealing with a Government who have not only cut the real value of short-term national


insurance benefits but have given notice&#x2014;the first time that it has happened since old-age pensions were introduced in 1908&#x2014;that in the coming review pensions will be cut in real terms by 1 per cent. below the inflation rate. It is another doubtful first for the Government.<br/>
Some hon. Members may feel that a 1 per cent. change in contributions to the national insurance scheme is neither here nor there. I have tried to point out why it is important for low-paid workers. Their contribution is based on every pound they earn once they cross the threshold. That threshold is near the tax threshold, so that at about that point they start to pay tax as well. Many of them also begin at that point to lose other forms of means-tested help. My right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North pointed out the whole bands of income in which considerable numbers of families will be unable to improve their position.</p>

<p>I do not want to venture now into debating the removal of the upper limit, because we have had a clear undertaking that if we keep away from that subject while we debate the amendments we shall have an opportunity to explore it when we reach the clause stand part debate.<br/>
With my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Miss Richardson), I tabled amendment No. 3 in an attempt to discover how the Government arrived at their figure of &#x00A3;200. If I obtain a satisfatory answer, I shall not press the matter to a Division. If not&#x2014;and so far we have not had satisfactory answers on this point&#x2014;I hope that we shall be allowed a separate vote, because the matter is one of a separate principle.<br/>
We tabled the amendment because the Government provided a lot of information about how they were increasing the amount they wanted to raise through national insurance, but surprisingly they did not make clear what would happen to employers. They did not explain, either, why they had decided to break away from precedent and, in setting the upper limit, go for the top of the range rather than stay at the mid-point.<br/>
The regulations suggest that the upper earnings limit should be between six and a half and seven times the basic rate. That works out at between &#x00A3;176 and &#x00A3;203. Over the years, the Government have always gone for a mid-point of more cm less seven times the pension rate. The current mid-point of the range is &#x00A3;163, but the current operative figure is &#x00A3;165. In this new case, the Government have deliberately chosen to go virtually &#x00A3;10 above the midpoint. Why? In spite of their being pressed on Second Reading on Monday, they gave no explanation for not following custom and practice in this matter.<br/>
The only explanation I can imagine is that, they must have asked themselves by how much pensions would have risen under the old regulations. The rise would have been based on whether earnings or prices had risen more. If pensions were increased in line with earnings, which the Government did not do, they would have reached &#x00A3;29 or slightly less. If that figure is multiplied by seven, the result is just over &#x00A3;200. It seems that the Government were assuming, in fixing the upper limit, that pensions would go up by the amount by which they should have risen but for the earlier legislation to take away the linkage. That is a perfectly reasonable explanation. Perhaps the Government could offer an alternative one.<br/>
However, it appeared from the figures that the Government thought that pensions should have risen to

&#x00A3;29 then multiplied that by seven, which comes to about &#x00A3;200. That is how they produced some logic for the figure of &#x00A3;200. If that logic worked for the upper limit, they should have applied the same logic to the lower limit. I am pressing the Government for an explanation of why they chose &#x00A3;200 instead of &#x00A3;190. We have tabled a modest amendment suggesting that the lower limit should be changed from &#x00A3;27 to &#x00A3;28. On reflection, perhaps we should have gone for &#x00A3;29.<br/>
There is a major problem for the part-time workers who are trapped when there is a small improvement in their income&#x2014;it may be only a few pence&#x2014;and they have to pay national insurance contributions not based on those few pence but on the whole of their earnings. There is not sufficient recognition of the number of people who, for one reason or another, have been forced into living entirely on part-time earnings.<br/>
I shall give three examples of constituents who fall into that category. One man worked until July and was then made redundant. He had to make decisions about his future. He concluded that he was in the wrong career and that he wanted to start again and undertake a different university course. He did not find any difficulty in getting into a university. His major difficulty was obtaining a grant. However, based on his redundancy money and the possibility of finding a part-time job he thought that he could struggle through as a student by financing himself. He had major difficulties meeting his fees. He was dependent upon his own money to finance him. When he looked for a part-time evening job, he found that he was entering a whole new world. Employers were talking not about a rate for so many hours but about a rate that took into account whether he could stay below the national insurance level. He discovered that, to some employers, that was important because it simplified their bookkeeping. The employers could then say that the employee preferred to keep below the limit because it saved him having any deductions.<br/>
The man found not only that if he earned a little more he would lose money, but that it distorted the whole area of wage negotiation because it was more crucial to keep below the Government limit than to negotiate the rate for the job. The man discovered that h s interests were in conflict with the full-time workers whom he worked alongside. They would be happy to see the hourly rate raised by a few pence, because at least that would be an improvement. Yet, for him, a movement upwards meant telling his employer that he would have to work a few hours less, otherwise he would find himself above the national insurance limit.<br/>
Another constituent qualified as a teacher but could not obtain a full-time job. He was entitled to draw benefit. Instead of doing that, he visited many colleges and found a little work here and there. Eventually he built up his work to a level where he was teaching almost more hours during a week than a full-time teacher. That was two years ago. As a result of the cuts that have taken place, he found that because he was a part-time teacher he was especially vulnerable. Every time a college had to make a cut, his hours were reduced rather than those of the full-time teachers. His hours have been cut back to the point where he has to consider whether it is better not to work and to apply for benefit or to remain in work. He is another person who has been caught by the national insurance trap.


He would like to build up his work, because the more work that he obtains and the more places where he is seen, the more likely it is that he will obtain a full-time job.<br/>
My final example is of a woman who worked in the textile industry for about 20 years. She has been made redundant. She is entitled to benefit but she prefers to work. She lives on her own. She says that unless she goes out to work she does not see anyone. She does not know her neighbours, because for so many years she has gone out to work and seen little of them. She feels socially isolated. With a struggle and much persuasion, she found herself a part-time cleaning job, which brings in a fraction more than she could obtain in benefits. It is very marginal. She now finds that she has a substantial amount of stoppages because she is just over the national insurance limit. She feels that there is little or no justice in that area.<br/>
5.45 pm<br/>
The Government should be offering a clear explanation of how they managed to pick &#x00A3;200 rather than &#x00A3;190 out of the air. They should say whether it was based on seven times what the pension should be. They should apply that same logic to the bottom end of the scale and allow that limit to rise to at least &#x00A3;28, if not to &#x00A3;29. I do not claim that by doing that they would remove all the problems of the poverty trap, but at least they would show, with a practical action, that they were moving in the right direction. Over the years we have heard about the Government's concern, but we have seen no practical action. We do not have the figures, but no doubt the Government Front Bench will tell us what that would cost. I believe that it would be a small cost and something that they should do.</p>

<p>In replying to the many points raised by Opposition Members, I shall go through them as logically as possible. We should start with amendment No. 2, moved by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker), which links with amendment No. 4. Of course, we understand that there will always be concern when the Government draw a line below which one does not come into a certain category but above which one comes into it. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State mentioned in an intervention, the effect of the poverty trap as explained in the brief by the Low Pay Unit&#x2014;to which I shall return&#x2014;omitted to note the duration of the family income supplement and the duration of housing benefit.<br/>
We need to put on the record not only the effect of the amendments but also why we believe that they should not be accepted. If we increased the lower earnings limit from the &#x00A3;27 proposed in the Bill to the &#x00A3;28 proposed in the amendment, we should fail to do what we are required to do by section 1(2) of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. That Act requires the lower earnings limit to be an amount equal to, or not more than 49p less than, the basic pension rate at the beginning of the tax year in question. It is customary to set the multiple at 50p, and the tolerance of 49p in the statute was designed to permit that degree of rounding down.<br/>
As the Bill stands without the amendment, the amount of the lower earnings limit conforms to that rule. The &#x00A3;27 a week is the required rounded-down figure derived from the pension rate now payable for a single person of &#x00A3;27&#x00B7;15.</p>

<p>I have not yet finished the point. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will give me a few moments so that he may hear what I have to say. I understand that any impact on the contributions of low earners will be difficult for them. Nobody is denying that. But there is just as sudden a jump between &#x00A3;27&#x00B7;99 and &#x00A3;28 as there is between &#x00A3;26&#x00B7;99 and &#x00A3;27. I understand that the amendment was tabled for illustrative purposes in order to discuss the issue and not the exact amounts. It may also be argued that by changing the pension formula to relate it to prices movements rather than the better of earnings or prices, the Government had already effectively held down the lower earnings limit and brought more people into the contributions net.<br/>
The burden is a percentage contribution. That is why it is light where earnings are low. Although the contribution for an employee&#x2014;&#x00A3;2.17 at &#x00A3;28 a week&#x2014;may be a significant burden for people with such earnings, there are three things that we have to remember.<br/>
We have had several discussions about part-time and full-time earners, and I want to go into that question for a few moments. There are very few people with full-time earnings at the level concerned. They are generally part-time earners, often with other sources of family income. We know from the Department of Employment statistics that only about 0.2 per cent. of all full-time male employees earn less than &#x00A3;40 a week and that about 2.3 per cent. of all full-time female employees earn less than &#x00A3;40 a week. Therefore, there are very few working full-time for &#x00A3;28 a week.<br/>
It is important to remember that if we were to increase the lower earnings limit from &#x00A3;27, as in the Bill, to &#x00A3;28, as in amendment No. 2, we would reduce the accruing rights of the additional components and the guaranteed minimum pensions. Here we enter a very complicated area. I am sure that all hon. Members are well aware that very valuable benefit rights accrue from the contributions. Contributions paid on earnings at the lower earnings limits are sufficient to give full rights to all the basic benefits and pensions in the scheme. If there are any gaps in the year's record, there are credits and voluntary contributions which can rectify the deficiencies.</p>

<p>If I have followed the Minister's argument correctly, she appears to be saying that the more the Government cut the old-age pension, the more the lower earnings limit will be lowered. More people will come into national insurance and, therefore, gain the benefit, at the expense of the cuts in the old-age pension, because of the break with the link with earnings. Is the Minister saying that the cut with the link with earnings is the advantage, so that old-age pensioners have a lower pension and, therefore, the other people make this gain? Is that the Minister's argument?</p>

<p>No, that is not my argument. I am sorry if what I said in some way gave rise to that thought. I was seeking to explain to the Committee that it was important that, even at low levels of earnings, these people had the opportunity, with those low levels of earnings, to be contributing. I am certain that the whole Committee would want to keep to that. It stems from the Social Security Pensions Act 1975, which sought to bring more people into earning pensions on their own account.</p>

<p>Will the Minister accept that she is advancing an extraordinary argument? She is advancing the argument that the more we drop the floor, the better off will people be. Why, therefore, are we increasing it? Es it suggested that we should have it at &#x00A3;20, &#x00A3;15 or &#x00A3;10, in order to get all the benefits that will flow? it really will not wash.</p>

<p>What I was saying was not that we would drop the limits but that there are benefits that accrue for the people who come into the area of paying contributions. It has been widely accepted throughout the House of Commons and throughout the pensions industry that contributing towards a pension for one's old age is a good thing to do. If we wanted to raise the lower limit at which we began the process, the size of the contribution paid by those above that limit would be even harsher, and the effect of the poverty trap at that higher rate would be very much more abrupt.<br/>
With regard to the whole question of part-time earnings, on which a number of hon. Members commented, we estimate that there are about 200,000 persons with part-time earnings between the lower earnings limit of &#x00A3;27 proposed in the Bill and the &#x00A3;28 proposed in the amendment. The census of employment for June 1977 shows that about 40 per cent. of part-time workers are earning less than &#x00A3;28.<br/>
The important aspect, to which I referred earlier, is that those who are on low pay and who work for 30 hours a week&#x2014;or, if they are single parents, for 24 hours a week&#x2014;are entitled, if they have children, to family income supplement. That continues for 52 weeks and the housing benefits continue for &#x00A3;26 weeks, irrespective of any change in circumstances, whether it be brought about by a change in the lower earnings limit or by some other change in circumstances concerning taxation.</p>

<p>Certainly, it is not&#x2014;as the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said from a sedentary position&#x2014;in order to confuse. When the family income supplement was brought in in 1971, it was to try to help the families who were on low lay to increase their income and to help them over a continuing period of time. The housing benefits, as hon. Members will know, are not administered by my Department and are largely administered by local authorities. But, quite separate from anything that is before us tonight, there is the review of housing benefits. I shall note my hon. Friend's comment when we come to that review. In order that my hon. Friend should not be further confused, I felt that I should clarify the point as quickly as possible I do not intend to elaborate it any further.<br/>
Some of the other comments made during the debate have concerned not simply the full-time and part-time earnings but the problems that obviously accrue for far lilies who are on low incomes. While it would be very easy to accept the arguments put forward by the hon. Member for Birkenhead, I do not believe that we shall resolve any of the problems that face us in this matter if we do away with the upper limit, to which I shall return when dealing with amendment No. 3, tabled by the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett).<br/>
The problem that the Opposition face when they suggest that there should be any change in the lower earnings limit is that they are seeking to move away from a formula that we have always hoped would stand the test of time. It is a formula that was painfully arrived at during the passage of the Social Security Pensions Bill in 1975. The formula included a lower earnings limit, which would be effective for the payment of contributions. The &#x00A3;28, as the hon. Member for Stockport, North said, might be justified if we were to look at the earnings movement, but there are now other considerations that quite genuinely outweigh this point. We have particularly the need to preserve the basic benefits for the lower-paid.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean) asked about the financial effect of the amendment. The effect would be to reduce income by &#x00A3;9 million in respect of those employees earning between &#x00A3;27 and &#x00A3;28 but to increase income by &#x00A3;31 million by reducing the range over which the contracted-out contributions&#x2014;of both employers and employees &#x2014; benefit from contribution abatement. In other words, the amendment would result in a net increase.<br/>
6 pm<br/>
Both this Government and the Labour Government have kept to the formula because they wished to ensure that the lower earnings limit was linked to the level of pensions. As a result, those in employment whose earnings exceed the lower earnings limit contribute towards these basic benefits.</p>

<p>It might be better for me to finish my remarks first. It is important that contributions should be sufficient to support the benefit for which they provide cover. That is why the direct link between the contributions earnings limits and the pension rates remains an important criterion. The most important thing is to protect benefit rights for the future.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Perry Barr said, amendment No. 4 is a paving amendment for amendment No. 2. Its effect would be to bring the &#x00A3;28 within the limits required by the Act. The Government believe that the link between the basic pension limit and the lower earnings limit should be maintained, but we do not want to lose the start of class 1 insurance cover. Some people would lose that if the Act were amended.<br/>
I turn to the questions raised by the hon. Member for Birkenhead. Why cannot we do away with the upper earnings limit? That question is also relevant to the amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Stockport, North. We all accept that pensions&#x2014;</p>

<p>If the hon. Member for Perry Barr so wishes, I shall leave those remarks until later. The House has never agreed that pensions should be unlimited for those who have earned high wages throughout their working lives. Therefore, there must be an upper earnings limit for pension purposes. Contributions above that limit will give no entitlement to benefit. They will be a straight subvention from the national insurance fund. Given the remarks made by the hon. Member for Perry Barr and the wish to discuss the matter in the debate on clause stand part, I shall not go into further detail.<br/>
Those of us who have sat on Committees that have discussed social security Bills are used to hearing ingenious explanations for raising certain issues from the hon. Member for Stockport, North. Over the years we have got used to that. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that his explanation today had nothing to do with the decision about the upper earnings limit.<br/>
The amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Stockport, North seeks to change the upper earnings limit proposed for class 1 contributions from &#x00A3;200 a week to &#x00A3;190 a week. Section 1(3) of the Social Security Pensions Act requires that the upper earnings limit should be between six and a half and seven and a half times the basic pension rate, or between &#x00A3;176&#x00B7;48 and &#x00A3;203&#x00B7;63. In practice, the upper earnings limit has long been a multiple of &#x00A3;5, for ease of calculation.<br/>
In 1980&#x2013;81 the upper earnings limit was 7&#x00B7;08 times the pension rate. The proposal put forward by the hon. Member for Stockport, North would reduce that multiple to just under 7, at a time when income to the fund needs to be bolstered in order to match outgo. Cmnd. 8091, the report of the Government Actuary on the financial provisions of the Bill, shows that the total outgo for 1981&#x2013;82 of &#x00A3;17,842 million is much higher than that of previous years. The amount goes up every year at a fast rate.<br/>
On Second Reading, it was accepted that income should be kept in line with outgo. Even with the upper earnings limit of &#x00A3;200, the surplus expected in 1981&#x2013;82 is under &#x00A3;40 million. Indeed, it is about &#x00A3;39 million. If there were an upper earnings limit of &#x00A3;190, there would be a deficit of &#x00A3;64 million on the estimated outgo according to the Government Actuary's report. The &#x00A3;200 mentioned in the Bill is 7&#x00B7;37 times the pension rate. In other words, it is well within the range of six and a half to seven and a half times the pension rate in the Social Security Pensions Act. If we were to accept the hon. Member's amendment, the House would have to make up the deficit that would accrue for 1981&#x2013;82 in some other way.</p>

<p>I have already told the hon. Gentleman that if the upper earnings limit were set at &#x00A3;190 the deficit on the fund would be &#x00A3;64 million, according to the calculations that the Government Actuary has used.<br/>
The &#x00A3;200 limit avoids the need for a further rate increase. It makes the impact of the contribution burden a little more progressive. It is important that the national insurance fund should be kept in balance, as far as that is possible. If we were to create a deficit purposely and knowingly, we should be wrong.<br/>
Many comments have been made on this group of amendments. A rise in rates for national insurance contributions will never be welcomed. We have sought to

keep within the terms of the Act that was agreed, after a great deal of discussion, by the late Brian O'Malley and other colleagues of mine in 1975. Not only was agreement reached between parties in the House and in the other place but also, for the first time in many years, agreement was reached between those in the occupational fields who have about 11 million contributors and those who run the national insurance pension fund. To break such an agreement would be a truly retrograde step.<br/>
For those reasons, I believe that we must keep to the formula of the lower earnings limit for the single person's basic pension, that we ensure that the national insurance fund is kept in balance and that we do not go down a path that would lead it directly into deficit.</p>

<p>I hope to say more later, but it might be useful, as I am at the Opposition Dispatch Box for the first time, as it were, to make some comments.<br/>
I was surprised at some of the points made by the Minister in justification of these proposals relating to the lower-paid. I find extraordinary the suggestion that whereas, hitherto, we were told that we were keeping out the low-paid in order to save them money, we are now told that if we push up the figure to &#x00A3;28 we shall cause them to suffer. That seems to be a contradiction of the concept that we should leave the figure at &#x00A3;27 in order to assist and not to bring hardship. All who have discussed this proposal have said that the &#x00A3;27 level will increase the hardship on those who are already in the poverty trap. The excuse for choosing this figure is that the 3 million people on the &#x00A3;27 to &#x00A3;29 level are on part-time earnings and are in receipt of family assistance of one kind or another.<br/>
I also find extraordinary the argument that the figure could not be moved up to &#x00A3;28 because the parent Act would not have permitted it. But the Opposition, despite all the difficulties that have been imposed upon them in dealing with amendments, have put forward a way of doing that successfully by introducing amendment No. 4 as a paving amendment.<br/>
Much of the argument that we have heard has had little to do with the concept of the consensus on national insurance that the Minister has been defending, including using the name of Brian O'Malley. The consensus has been rapidly smashed by the Government. One aspect of the smashing is the heavy reduction in the taxation element&#x2014;the shift from 18 per cent. down to 14&#x00BD; per cent. that is envisaged. That is beginning to shift away from the consensus. We do not accept that there is justification for this proposal on the basis of previous Acts introduced largely by the Labour Party, usually with support from the Conservative Party, based mainly on the work of Brian O'Malley.<br/>
This is not so much a national insurance measure as a tax measure. <i>The Sunday Times</i> reports:
<q>As forecasts of the government's borrowing requirement mount higher, ministers are discussing possible increases in taxation. It would be against the government's principles to raise income tax, and its obsession with inflation figures makes it reluctant to increase indirect taxes. So it is now looking at the employees' national insurance contributions as a way of raising more revenue.</q><br/>
The proposals set out in this clause, but more so in the following clauses, relate to tax and not to national insurance. That is one reason why we feel angry about this measure.<br/>
Will the &#x00A3;27 cause hardship? Of course it will. Much has been made of the material brought forward by the Low


Pay Unit. I have not heard anyone so far reject the arguments of the Low Pay Unit. It argues that the problem will be compounded for the 90,000 low-paid workers already caught in the poverty trap. It says that the effective marginal tax rate is about 100 per cent. It points out that
<q>a married man with two young children will have a total disposable income of around &#x00A3;63 per week whether his weekly wage is actually &#x00A3;39 or &#x00A3;79.</q>
The whole argument is based on those who are caught in the poverty trap, and that should be crucial for the Government because they claim that they were elected to provide incentives. I cannot think of anything that will provide a greater disincentive than the &#x00A3;27, because the amount to be charged on that figure is based not on the last pound but on the total amount. Therefore, the Government are contradicting their own claim to try to achieve the non-workshy society.<br/>
6.15 pm<br/>
The balance has now been shifted, but it has not been shifted justly. One of the arguments for the &#x00A3;27 is that whereas on the upper limit&#x2014;the ceiling&#x2014;there has been a shift of about 22 per cent., the bottom level has been raised by only 17 per cent.</p>

<p>Will my hon. Friend also comment on the Government's proposal to index the higher-rate tax bands? That is part of the equation, is it not? The difference between the lower-paid and the higher-paid is not only the level of national insurance contributions that they have to pay but the tax benefits that trey are are given.</p>

<p>We are accusing the Government not of having no pattern in their thinking but of having a pattern of that kind in their thinking.<br/>
I turn now to the &#x00A3;190 figure, I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) treats this as a probing amendment rather than an amendment on which we would necessarily wish to vote. I do not think that he has received a satisfactory answer. We had hoped that there would be closer financial involvement in his multiplication by seven, because that would have aided us with the other amendments. We have not yet been given a clear explanation. It is clear that there was no mathematical thinking in the Government's mind.<br/>
Approximately 3 million part-time workers will be c aught in the trap between &#x00A3;27 and &#x00A3;29. We have proposed these amendments because we see injustice developing further between higher-paid and lower-paid workers. Each shift by the Treasury towards contributions will result in a direct and highly regressive tax.<br/>
I hope that we receive support and even a shift of mind by the Government, particularly on the lower level of &#x00A3;27.</p>

<p>I rise with some trepidation to speak on social security, because I do not share the expertise of most Opposition Members. I do not subscribe to Orwell's view that "Ignorance is Strength". I hope that the simplicity of my understanding on one aspect of clause 1 will make more impact on the Secretary of State than the more learned and expert arguments that hate been adduced by my colleagues.<br/>
Everyone&#x2014;even the Secretary of State&#x2014;accepts that this is a regressive measure. The amendment, which refers to raising the lower limit from &#x00A3;27 to &#x00A3;28, is at the heart of the most regressive aspect of this regressive Bill.<br/>
I draw the attention of the Secretary of State to the manifesto on which he and his colleagues fought the general election. On page 13&#x2014;which was unlucky for some&#x2014;it states:
<q>We shall cut income tax at all levels to reward hard work, responsibility and success; tackle the poverty trap"&#x2014;</q>
we are discussing the poverty trap&#x2014;
<q>encourage saving and the wider ownership of property; simplify taxes&#x2026;and reduce tax bureaucracy.</q>
It goes on:
<q>It is especially important to cut the absurdly high marginal rates of tax both at the bottom and top of the income scale.</q>
We are here dealing with an even more absurdly high marginal rate of tax at the bottom of the income scale. The election manifesto goes on to say:
<q>It must pay a man or a woman significantly more to be in, rather than out of, work. Raising tax thresholds will let the low-paid out of the tax net altogether.</q>
This is a lowering of the threshold. It is also a form of tax, so it is contrary to that undertaking. The manifesto goes on:
<q>unemployment and short-term sickness benefit must be brought into the computation of actual income.</q>
That was on taxation. I turn to what the manifesto says about social security. This aspect may explain why the Chancellor got himself and the House so confused when he introduced his mini-Budget. The manifesto says:
<q>Our social security system is now so complicated that even some ministry officials do not understand it.</q>
It appears that several Members, at least, of the Treasury Bench did not understand it, and probably do not understand it any more now. The manifesto also says:
<q>Income tax starts at such a low level that many poor people are being taxed to pay for their own benefits.</q>
This is exactly that kind of tax, and because it is more regressive than income tax it taxes those at the lower end of the scale more heavily even than if this bit of revenue had been raised from income tax.<br/>
I therefore strongly support the amendment to increase the minimum level from &#x00A3;27 to &#x00A3;28 because of that crucial, regressive aspect of this part of the existing legislation. I think that we all recognise that it has that impact, whatever the levels may be. There is, nevertheless, merit in raising the level, because this is not like income tax. When one moves from one income tax bracket to another, one pays the enhanced rate only on the income covered by the higher bracket. One does not have to pay the higher rate on all the income that one receives. In this case, as I understand it in my simple way, when people who previously made no contributions go over this benchmark, they must immediately start paying 7&#x00B7;7 per cent. not just on the income above the benchmark but on the whole of their income.<br/>
This must be the most regressive aspect of anything in our taxation and social security system. The amendment is an admirable effort to alleviate to some extent the consequences of this general provision. I therefore strongly support it. As I have said, I hope that my simplicity and relative ignorance in this matter may have helped to convince the Secretary of State in a way that the expertise of my colleagues has not.</p>

<p>I am very puzzled by the Minister's reply, the whole thrust of which seemed to be that she was doing people a good turn by keeping the limit that bit lower, because she was ensuring that people paid for benefits. If that is her argument, she must be certain


that for all part-time workers there are definite benefits to accrue from payments. Some people are unlikely to receive any benefit. It is a very difficult area.<br/>
There are people who, if they do not pay contributions for only short periods in the course of a lifetime, lose very little, if anything of their pension. It is, therefore, dangerous to tell people now struggling to work their way through college or university by working part-time that it is in their own interests to pay contributions. For most of them, that small amount of money is far more crucial now than it is ever likely to be for their pension, as they will almost certainly be entitled to a full pension on the rest of their earnings record over the years.<br/>
The only possible area in which those people might lose benefit is in regard to sickness benefit, but if the Minister really believes her own argument she should be saying that all people who are working and are below the &#x00A3;27 threshold should have the opportunity to make a contribution, taking into account their ability to pay, so that they may get benefits. She should be putting forward a graduated system of payments in order to give everyone that form of benefit, rather than have this cut-off point.</p>

<p>I think that my hon. Friend said that the only benefit that people might actually lose was either retirement pension or sickness benefit. Is he aware that many part-time workers, some of whom earn just over &#x00A3;27, are ineligible to register as unemployed part-time workers and, therefore, receive no national insurance unemployment benefit? Many employment exchanges will only register people, particularly women, for full-time work. That invalidates the argument that only sickness benefit and pensions are affected by this miserable proposal.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1789628" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1111.1" hansard_membership_id="1152" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2420" speakername="Mr. Bennett" colnum="1111" time="17:30:00">
<p>I accept that. I am suggesting that if the Minister is really concerned about the group that is losing as a result of the higher rate she should bring forward proposals so that some of those people can qualify for benefit and make a small payment, but not the penal tax contained in this proposal.<br/>
With regard to the upper limit, we still have not had a proper explanation of the figure. All that it really amounts to is that the Government were looking for any extra money that they could find, and that is why they raised the limit. There was no logic in it at all.<br/>
The Minister went on to say that it all came back to the supposed deal in relation to the Social Security Pensions Act. There is great concern among the Opposition as to what that deal actually was and what record there is of it. As I understand it, the Social Security Pensions Act provided that pensions would be linked with prices and earnings, and that they would be raised in line with whichever went up the most. If that was the deal, it was broken last year, when the Government took away the link with earnings, because that is the important aspect. If the Government wish to rest their case upon that, they must start moving these things in line with earnings and not merely in line with prices.<br/>
The Minister must give the Committee a clear explanation. Was the deal based only on the link with pensions, irrespective of how they went up, or was the link with pensions based on the fact that they would go up with the best of both worlds&#x2014;prices or earnings? That is my understanding of the deal. It is unfair of the Minister to

claim that a deal reached in the past, based upon those principles, still holds when one of the fundamental principles has been withdrawn.</p>

<p>I may be wrong. I heard the Secretary of State muttering while my hon. Friend was making his point. I invite my hon. Friend to put the question directly, because I do not know what Ministers actually mean when they talk about the deal. Do they mean the consensus, the bipartisan agreement&#x2014;the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 or the Social Security Act 1975, one or other, or both? That is the nub of the matter. The earnings link is in the Social Security Act, but the earnings limits are in the Social Security Pensions Act. We must know to which Act Ministers are referring, so that we know which pledge they are breaking.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I see no point in my repeating the question. I hope that the Minister will answer it and tell us on what basis the deal existed. If she is claiming that it existed merely on the basis of prices, most Labour Members would not accept that.<br/>
If the argument is to rest on the link with earnings, the Government at least ought to accept the increase from &#x00A3;27 to &#x00A3;28. On that basis, I would have thought that the &#x00A3;200, rather than being the top point, could be the mid-point in a range between, say, &#x00A3;185 and &#x00A3;210. I believe that the Committee could accept such figures.<br/>
We must be told the basis on which the deal was made. Was it based on one of those Acts, or on a combination of them? In my view, it would be acceptable only if it were done on the basis of earnings as well as prices.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1789632" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1112.2" hansard_membership_id="2273" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13240" speakername="Mrs. Chalker" colnum="1112" time="18:30:00">
<p>I come back to what I have said already. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) did not grasp the point that I made about the upper earnings limit being changed in line with his amendment. I was pointing out that this would cause a deficit on the national insurance fund of about &#x00A3;64 million. In changing contributions limits, the previous Government, long before this Government, always sought to keep the fund in balance. The amendment would not permit that to happen. That is the advice of the Government Actuary's Department, and that is the reason why we are unable to accept the amendment. We have a duty to keep the fund in balance.<br/>
Both the hon. Member for Stockport, North and the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) made an interesting case. I shall want to go into it in some detail afterwards, but I do not think that it was tied directly to what was said earlier in the debate. I shall consider what the hon. Members said and see whether there is any information that I can give them directly by letter.<br/>
I should like to reply to the point raised by the hon. Members for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) and for Stockport, North. When I referred to the earnings limit, I spoke of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. As the hon. Member for Perry Barr said, it is in that Act that the upper and lower earnings limits are defined, as well as their relationship to pensions. For those who were not in the House at the time of that legislation, I should point out that the deal was to enable contracting out by companies that wished to have a company pension scheme that


worked alongside the State pension scheme. That was brought into being from April 1978 by the Social Security pensions Act 1975. There has been no change in that deal. The upper and lower earnings limits are set out there for very good reasons, as I have sought to point out. I believe that we are right to maintain the formula that was agreed in that Act, thus ensuring that the contributions of those who earn eventually provide benefit.<br/>
One Labour Member spoke of the regressive nature of national insurance contractions. I accept that the argument can be played that way, but I believe that most people in the country realise that it is net income on which most families judge their standard of living. On that basis, one must accept that national insurance contributions are mildly progressive up to the upper earnings limit, and that that contains the vast majority of families.<br/>
We could engage in long discussions on this issue. However, the principle that was established by both parties in 1975, in the measure that went through the House speedily and with no difficulty whatever, has now been used as a vehicle. We understand the tactic, but we cannot accept the case that has been put forward by the Opposition.</p>

<p>I should like to make one point so that it is clear and on the record. We do not accept the Minister's, arguments. We sincerely believe that the agreements entered into in tie past have been broken by the Government's decision earlier this year to break the link between the old-age pension and earnings or prices, whichever is the higher. Our argument has hung on that point. We stick by it. We do not accept the Government's arguments, and we shall vote for the amendment.</p>

<p>The doors are not closed, Mr. Godman Irvine. This is a debating Chamber, and I should have hoped that both doors could be closed before we commenced the debate. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the Secretary of State wish to say something?<br/>
It is not without accident that only one Conservative Member, the hon. Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean), took part in the debate on amendment No. 2. I hope hat a few more Tory Members will seek to participate in this debate, if only because of the large sum of money involved accept that only a small sum was involved in the previous group of amendments&#x2014;&#x00A3;9 million or &#x00A3;22 million net to the national insurance fund&#x2014;but amendment No. 5 is in some ways the meat of the Bill. The Government are seeking to raise &#x00A3;1 billion by an impost of 1 per cent. on the national insurance contributions paid by employees.<br/>
The Treasury notice issued last month, which was Landed out to selected journalists, broke down the figure. We are talking about &#x00A3;947 million raised from employees, but in the notes at the bottom of the notice it is indicated that a further &#x00A3;50 million has to be added. That will come basically from the self-employed and those who pay voluntary contributions. There is a later amendment on the self-employed. I had not realised on Second Reading that there was an impost on the self-employed. We are talking about a total of &#x00A3;997 million.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1789647" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1117.4" hansard_membership_id="6929" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32384" speakername="Mr. Patrick Jenkin" colnum="1117" time="18:45:00">
<p>So that there should be no misunderstanding, I should point out that the &#x00A3;997 million, includes the &#x00A3;50 million, as the note says, added far c lasses 2, 3 and 4 contributions. It is the &#x00A3;50 million added to the &#x00A3;947 million that appears in the first column of the Treasury note.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1789648" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1117.5" hansard_membership_id="179" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3234" speakername="Mr. Rooker" colnum="1117" time="18:45:00">
<p>I thought that that was what I had said. I said &#x00A3;947 million at first, and I realised afterwards that there was an extra &#x00A3;50 million, in the note to the note. The grand total is &#x00A3;997 million, which includes the &#x00A3;50 million it impost on the self-employed. It is &#x00A3;1 billion, and that is a lot of money in anyone's language. I understand from a written reply that it is the equivalent of 1&#x00BC;p on income tax.<br/>
An increase in income tax would be a fairer way of raising the money, because the well-off who earn more than &#x00A3;200 a week would pay extra, but they will not pay proportionally more through national insurance contributions. The Bill does not come into effect until the next financial year, and we shall have a Budget before then, which will change tax rates, or at least tax allowances, for the next financial year. There would be no great problem about holding hack a 1&#x00BC;p tax increase until tile Budget. The Government would get the same amount of extra revenue for 1981&#x2013;82.<br/>
Why the rush? The money did not have to be raised by the use of the Bill. Most of the contents of the Bill would have been included in an order that would have been

debated for one and a half hours late at night, but the Government have chosen to use primary legislation to raise the money.<br/>
Why did the Government not raise the money by an increase in income tax? The answer, of course, is that they are committed not to raise income tax. If ever a Government were hoist on their own election promises and hasty measures on taking office, this is that Government. After reducing the standard rate to 30p, they would have considerable difficulties with their Back Benchers if they started to increase it. They have therefore used the backdoor method of the national insurance fund to raise the money.<br/>
In the debate on the Queen's Speech the Chancellor of the Exchequer had the gall to try to give the impression that it was the fault of the Government Actuary that the Bill had to be introduced. The right hon. and learned Gentleman was asked why he had not increased the upper earnings limit within the ceiling. His answer suffices for the general tenor of the Government's argument:
<q>Because the figure arrived at by way of conclusion follows from the Government Actuary's analysis of what it is prudent to impose."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1980; Vol. 994, c. 900.]</q>
I assume that that is an equally sufficient answer to those who ask why the impost is 1 per cent.<br/>
The Secretary of State was fond of saying in Opposition that the Government Actuary's analysis was based on his assumptions. But those are assumptions that he is directed to use by the Government. The Government cannot try to dissociate themselves from the decision as the Chancellor of the Exchequer sought to do.<br/>
The Government Actuary has been instructed to use average unemployment of 2&#x00B7;3 million for 1981&#x2013;82, average earnings of 10&#x00BD; per cent. more than in 1980&#x2013;81 and the fact that there could be a benefit uprating in November in line with the expected movement in prices.<br/>
Two qualifications to those instructions must be made. First, the Government are committed to knocking 1 per cent. off the old-age pension increase next year. Secondly, invalidity, unemployment, sickness, industrial injury and maternity benefits may be raised, under the powers that the Government have taken this year, by 5 per cent. less than the rise in prices. I suspect that when the Government Actuary issues his report on the current financial year of the national insurance fund we shall see a different estimate of surplus or deficit. I repeat our complaint that we are dealing with figures that will change substantially in the financial year for which we are legislating.<br/>
The Government are telling the nation that they need &#x00A3;1 billion. Some of my hon. Friends will attempt, by amendments Nos. 7 and 9, to split the 1 per cent. impost half and half between employee and employer, as has been done in the past. That proposal has a certain equity about it. The Secretary of State must give us a little more detail and explain why the employee will have to pay the whole impost.<br/>
It seems that of the 1 per cent. that vie are debating &#x00BC; per cent. is required for the National Health Service. The questions that I asked about that in winding up Monday's debate were not satisfactorily answered, and I hope that the Secretary of State will answer them today.<br/>
I questioned the split-up of the policy decision changes referred to in the White Paper that was issued this year. I am chasing up the &#x00A3;121 million that the Government expected to get for the NHS by imposing charges on road


accident cases, removing the exemption from dental charges for young people, tightening up the use of the NHS by foreign visitors and charging for sight tests. The sight test was the only one for which we were given a figure for the extra input to the NHS. It was about &#x00A3;10 million or &#x00A3;11 million. That leaves &#x00A3;110 million split between the other three policy decisions with which the Government now say that they cannot go ahead. I hope that we shall have a breakdown of that. I hope also that the Minister has been provided with the figures.<br/>
7 pm<br/>
That accounts for only &#x00BC; per cent. By no stretch of the imagination is that new money for the National Health Service, in view of the implication in the White Paper. Another &#x00BC; per cent. is required in the normal course of the national insurance fund operations. There is not too much complaint in principle about that. It would have been required according to the Government's forecast of average unemployment in the same way as a &#x00BC; per cent. increase took place in April this year. We claim that &#x00BC; per cent. of the 1 per cent. is legitimate. It is a tragedy that the Government forecast an average unemployment level of 2&#x00B7;3 million. The implication is that the figure will be much higher than that.<br/>
We take extreme exception to the remaining &#x00BD; per cent., which we shall debate at great length on clause 2. It involves the removal of the supplement from the national insurance funds to the Treasury. There is no good reason why that &#x00BD; per cent. should not be split between the employer and the employee. It is a shift of resources from the taxpayer to the backs of employees. The Government's only argument is that they do not wish to burden industry. The Secretary of State nods in agreements, but the Government are burdening industry substantially by the measure that we are debating.<br/>
We have learnt from debates and press comment that the effect of the increase on employers is considerable, simply because of the spill-over effect of the national insurance surcharge, the change in the rates and the expected change in inflation. I accept that employers would have had to pay extra anyway. The Government say that they want to relieve employers of their burdens. But they have not done that, because they are imposing a burden. They are putting the impost on employees. Employers pay corporation tax and others pay capital transfer tax, capital gains tax and even income tax. The burden could have been shared. I suspect that the Government might change the income tax rate in the next Budget, but it is best to get this money under the belt for next year.</p>

<p>I am a little worried that my hon. Friend might be falling into the trap of talking too much about the employers' and employees' contributions, as though they can be kept separate. Many employers manage to shift the burden on to their employees. One must examine a firm's overall wages policy and costs to know whether the burden falls on the firm or on the employees. There is much danger in talking in simplistic terms, which we are forced to do on the amendments. The matter is more complicated than the Government admit.</p>

<p>When the number of the Conservatives participating in the debate equals the number of my hon. Friends who are participating, the Government will have a charge to make against the Opposition.<br/>
One has to make points in simplistic terms because of the way in which the Bill is drafted and because of the restrictions on drafting amendments resulting from the timetable and the Ways and Means resolution.<br/>
All of the 1 per cent. impost falls on employees. If any of it were put on to employers, many of them would simply lump the national insurance contribution with the wages bill and put the entire 20 per cent. on to the consumer. Employers do not attempt to take a share of the burden. I am drawing a distinction between the 0&#x00B7;5 per cent. due to removal of the Treasury supplement and the other 0&#x00B7;5 per cent. that is not due to its removal because it is related to general taxation, of which employers pay an unequal share.<br/>
If not the most central issue, this is the most expensive one in terms of raising money from the 22 million people who are lucky enough to have jobs. Whatever the Government might do about tax allowances and the standard rate of income tax, they will not be able to claim that they are fulfilling their manifesto commitment to reduce taxation. They have increased the rate of taxation on the insured population twice this year. In just over 12 months, the burden has increased by 1&#x00BE;p in the pound for the majority of people. It has changed by almost 8p in the pound for many low-paid workers at the margin.<br/>
People are not worried about net income alone. They are worried also about the stoppages and the effect on the extra &#x00A3;1 that they might earn by way of bonus or overtime. The majority of low-paid workers are women who work part-time. Their tax burden is increasing apace under this Government and under the Bill. There is no doubt that &#x00A3;1 billion is a lot to impose upon employees. It is grossly unfair.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) will not make the plea that he made on Monday for Government Members to seek to overturn the Government's case. We accept that they will not do that. We accept that we shall not win the vote. However, the majority of working people will understand what the Government are doing by pushing the Bill through. In short, it is to increase their tax burden.</p>

<p>I speak particularly to amendment No. 6, in the name of Liberal Members, which was tabled in response to an invitation from the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, given when he wound up for the Government in the Second Reading debate. He said:
<q>The hon. Member for Isle of Ely (Mr. Freud)"&#x2014;</q>
the Liberal spokesman on these matters&#x2014;


<q>said that there is a poverty trap difficulty in what is being proposed I cannot deny that. It is a subject more suitable to those, detailed examination that only a Committee stage can provide, but I took note of what the hon. Gentleman said."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 1072.]</q>
Our amendment is a direct response, because it proposes that the additional 1 per cent. impost shall not apply to wages of less than &#x00A3;85 a week.<br/>
There is no doubt that the Bill adds substantially to what was already the worst poverty trap that we have had in this country. On 8 December, reviewing the Bill, <i>The Times</i> said:
<q>Those effects are the opposite of the Government's declared aims of removing disincentives.</q>
<q>The changes mean that 50,000 of the lowest paid will have their marginal tax rate increased by 6&#x00B7;25 per cent. next April compared with their position before the Budget.</q>
<q>Those earning &#x00A3;40 a week will be able to keep only 62&#x00B7;25p of e very extra pound they cam. On earnings of &#x00A3;500 a week high earners will be able to keep 40p of every extra pound, compared with 17p before last year's Budget.</q>
<q>In addition 90,000 families receiving family income supplement and other means-tested benefits will have an effective marginal tax rate close to 100 per cent.</q>
That is not what the Government told the people when they were seeking election in 1979. The House has so many times heard a recital of the broken promises that I do not want to weary the Committee with it at length tonight. It is sufficient to remind hon. Members of chapter 3 in the 1979 Conservative manifesto, with the bold heading
<q>A more prosperous country</q>
Under the sub-heading
<q>Cutting Income Tax",</q>
we read:
<q>We shall cut income tax at all levels to reward hard work, responsibility and success; tackle the poverty trap</q>
and so on. It is just as well that the very subtle draftsman used the word "tackle". Indeed, the Conservatives have tackled the poverty trap to some tune, by elevating it to a degree of horror that we had not previously seen.<br/>
The social policy research unit at York university recently declared that the poverty trap had never been worse. It is so far-reaching now that, in the opinion of the York university researchers,
<q>it would be much more accurate to describe it as a poverty plateau",</q>
because instead of applying to a fairly narrow, although very hard-done-by, section of the population, it now any lies to a wide hand of people over a wide range of wage scales. Our amendment is an attempt to remove part of the addition to the poverty trap that the Bill undeniably creates.<br/>
It will no doubt be said&#x2014;because the House is often misled in this matter&#x2014;that by removing the 1 per cent. addition from a number of wage earners we should create a deficit in the national insurance fund for one year. It cam tot be said too often that there is nothing wrong with that For example, in 1977, on the recommendation of the Government of the day, the House deliberately voted national insurance changes in the expectation of a deficit. As is well known, and as the Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out before now, there is no statutory obligation that every year the fund's income shall at least balance its outgoings. The state of balance is very much to be over a period of time.<br/>
There is no reason at all why this impost should be inflicted in this one year. That was another respect in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 24 November, in his mini-Budget, failed to spell out the real position as fully as the House was entitled to expect. That is the

reasoning behind our amendment &#x2014; that the poverty plateau was bad enough and extensive enough already, and that it was wrong and unjust that the Bill should further narrow the difference between being on unemployment benefit and being in work.<br/>
7.15 pm<br/>
I conclude by reminding the Committee&#x2014;although I am sure that hon. Members will not require much reminding&#x2014;of the appalling disincentives to taking a low-paid job. My constituency is by no means scattered&#x2014;it is in two metropolitan boroughs&#x2014;but I have many distressing examples of people who lose through going out to work, by the time they have paid their appalling bus fares and have had meals out, which working in a distant place involves, and have lost the former reduced rate of income tax, which this Government abolished. It cannot have been the intention of Conservative Members, when they took their seats on the Government Benches that people should lose in that way I beg them to repent of this further error before they add it to their catalogue of crimes.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State and I should be in agreement in strongly objecting to the use of national insurance contributions and payments into the national insurance fund as a simple but grossly unfair means of taxation. As I pointed out in an earlier intervention, when the right hon. Gentleman was in Opposition he voted against the concept of a surcharge, even though that surcharge affected both employers and employees.<br/>
It is hard that the right hon. Gentleman has suffered this form of punishment&#x2014;for that is what it is&#x2014;from the Treasury, which has decided that it wants to minimise the extent to which it increases the rate of income tax, if that is what it will do, or increase taxes at all. The Treasury is in fact simply using the fund as a means of collecting money for itself.<br/>
That means that the national insurance contributions bear no relationship whatsoever to the level of benefits and the entitlement of people who make the contributions. Beveridge and those Labour Ministers who created the national insurance fund and the National Insurance Act, which was the basis of it, would turn in their graves if they thought that Beveridge's concept would be used by Governments simply as a means of raising extra revenue&#x2014;revenue that they did not have the guts to raise through ordinary taxation, particularly when carried our in such a retrograde way, imposing a tougher impost on the lower-paid than on the higher-paid.</p>

<p>There are moments. The right hon. Gentleman has shown one or two examples of kindness to


me. I shall not mention them now. I merely say that there are moments when I have this feeling for him. I am feeling neither sorry for him nor angry with him. One of the accusations that I have frequently made against him is that he is a Treasury Minister. I do not know whether the Bill proves that he is or whether the Bill has been forced upon him by his Treasury colleagues.<br/>
There is logic in the Liberal amendment, which has been referred to by the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Wainwright). If the Government are to use this method of raising &#x00A3;1 billion, it would seem fair to use the principle that has been used over many years&#x2014;namely, increasing the contributions of employers and employees at the same time. That has not been done. The burden has been placed almost entirely on employees. It is the equivalent of about 1p in the pound on the standard rate of tax.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) might like to explain how they can reconcile what they are now saying&#x2014;namely, that the burden should be shared between employers and employees&#x2014;with the most almighty row that they both made a couple of weeks ago because it was suggested that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was somehow concealing the fact that there were to be increases for employers. It seems that the right hon. Gentleman is trying to have it both ways, and I hope that he will explain the inconsistency.</p>

<p>There was fury in the House as well as among employers, in the CBI, in the press and elsewhere, because it was felt that the House and the country were being misled by the Chancellor's statement. At that stage we did not enter into the argument whether the raising of the money should be shared between employers and employees on an equal basis. We argued that the gist of the statement was that the burden would be placed on one side. The right hon. and learned Gentleman gave no indication that another &#x00A3;1 billion would have to be paid by employers. That was the nature of the row, and the right hon. Gentleman knows it.<br/>
What effect does the right hon. Gentleman think that these provisions will have on wage claims when the people realise what has happened? Will they not recognise these provisions as an impost upon their earnings at a time when inflation is higher than the Government's stated 6 per cent. norm? Even those who are forced to accept 6 per cent. settlements will be expected to pay the higher rate of contribution to national insurance. Surely the Government expect that there will be a reaction on the part of employees when the Bill comes into effect.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) stressed, there will be no more money for the National Health Service as a result of the division of the extra money that is being raised. There will not be an extra penny for the NHS. It will not be enabled suddenly to say "We shall contribute &#x00A3;25 million in response to the Select Committee on perinatal and neonatal mortality, or &#x00A3;X million for renal dialysis, or any other specialty. "The money will go to the Treasury. That was said honestly by the Chief Secretary, who replied to the

debate on 8 December. We shall be dealing later with the reduction from 18 per cent. to 14&#x00BD; per cent. of the Treasury supplement. The right hon. Gentleman said:
<q>it plays a major part in reducing the public sector borrowing requirement."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 1072.]</q>
That is the only way in which the Treasury is considering this operation. It considers that it is a simple way of getting itself out of a desperate financial situation of its own making. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will support the amendment when the Committee divides on it.</p>

<p>These are important amendments because they relate to the form of taxation and insurance contributions that we should pay as employees and employers. They raise a number of general issues as well as the specific ones that are reflected in the amendments.<br/>
I share the view of my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Ennals) that the amendments should be supported on the ground that there is a degree of equity in the proposal that any increase that is thought to be required in national insurance contributions should come from both employers and employees on an equal basis. That has nearly always been the practice in the past when Governments have asked for increases in contributions. They have normally increased both sets of taxation. On this occasion, the Government propose to increase taxation by imposing an extra 1 per cent. on employees by a variety of methods and to make no specific increase in employers' contributions directly, although there will be indirect increases in employers' contributions.<br/>
I am sorry that the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Wallasey (Mrs. Chalker), has left the Chamber. I wanted to refer to a remark that she made earlier about taxation.</p>

<p>I was saying that I am sorry that the hon. Lady has left the Chamber. In the previous debate she referred to the form in which national insurance contributions are paid and spoke about their progressive or regressive nature. I think that she said that national insurance contributions were mildly progressive. When she said that, I pricked up my ears. It is the most extraordinary statement that I have heard in a long time in this place. It must have been made on the assumption that those who earn &#x00A3;200 a week, for example, pay a higher cash amount in national insurance contributions than those who earn, for example, &#x00A3;50 a week. That must be so because we pay the same percentage in national insurance contributions, although the cash outcome is different at different income levels. The more one earns, the more one pays.<br/>
That cannot be described as mildly progressive. It merely means that the richer one is, the more one pays in cash terms. The percentage of income that is paid by someone earning &#x00A3;200 a week is the same, notionally, as the person who is earning &#x00A3;50 a week. Therefore, the argument that national insurance contributions are mildly progressive should not be tolerated by the Committee.


That relates to the amendments, which seek to reduce the impact of the regressive form of taxation. They seek to reduce the regressive form of the taxation in a way that is more acceptable to employees.<br/>
Much mention has been made of the effect on the low-paid of the increase in contributions. Low-paid workers, male and female, are hound to pay the same percentage of their total income above the threshold of &#x00A3;27 per week n contributions as the person earning &#x00A3;200 a week. The Minister cannot therefore argue that it is a mildly progressive form of taxation. It is regressive.<br/>
7.30 pm<br/>
It has other unacceptable features. It is an employment lax. It is as bad as selective employment tax, which was attacked at great length by the Conservative Opposition during the Government of my right hon. Friend the Member for Huyton (Sir H. Wilson) between 1964 and 1970. It is, therefore, absurd for this Government now to argue that it is a form of taxation as acceptable as income tax.</p>

<p>That is a valid point. However, we must remember the context in which the increases are being made. Substantial concessions are available to companies in the form of deferments on corporation tax. They pay only a small proportion of their before-tax profits in corporation tax and other forms of taxation. For example, tarts of the oil and banking sector have paid little, if any, corporation tax over the past few years. British Petroleum c id not pay any corporation tax in the last financial year far which it reported its pre-tax and after-tax profits. Companies are faced with serious problems over manpower and selling their goods in the market glace, but they pay less tax in real terms than the individual employee.</p>

<p>Reverting to the question whether these national insurance contributions are regressive, is it not true that even if they could be considered progressive they are much more unfair to the low-paid than a system that would take a similar amount from general taxation? However, my hon. Friend and I agree that they are regressive.</p>

<p>I agree. However, they are less so than a year ago. The Government have abolished the 25 per cent. tax band&#x2014;the slice of earnings on which people paid only 25 per cent. tax instead of 30 per cent. That change was made in the Budget of 12 June 1979. However, national insurance contributions are still significantly more regressive than income tax on the present basis, even in the context of the Government's extraordinary measures to abolish the 25 per cent. tax band and to index the higher rate bands They have protected higher income earners and attacked the ability of the low-paid to defend themselves against tax increases at that level. The imposition of the 1 per cent. increase, the freezing of the lower point of starting national insurance contributions at &#x00A3;27 per week and the abolition of the 25 per cent. rate band penalise the lowest-paid for the economic policies of this Government.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 7 and 9 raise a number of other points. Should the Government be introducing what is essentially an employment tax at this time? The hon.

Member for Anglesey (Mr. Best) mentioned the problems created for employers by the increased national insurance contributions. The Government, through this Bill and other measures introduced a few weeks ago, are putting a tax on employment. They will encourage employers to shed as much labour as possible in order to reduce their national insurance contributions and cut costs. Unemployment is rising by 100,000 a month. It is irresponsible of the Government to bring forward proposals that will have a direct ill effect on employment.<br/>
We must also consider the effect of the increases in national insurance contributions on the ability of low-paid workers to defend their living standards. We should not gloss over that. We must debate the extent to which they can defend their living standards against the Government. A worker taking home &#x00A3;45 or &#x00A3;50 a week needs to protect his real take-home pay against price and tax increases. The only way to do that is by boosting his wage packet, as the Government refuse to introduce price controls. The only way in which a worker can protect his real take-home pay is to increase the wage claim to his private or public sector employer.<br/>
The increase in taxation through the increased national insurance contribution will therefore properly be reflected in trade union wage claims. Trade unions have to bear in mind not only the retail price index but the level of income tax and national insurance contributions.<br/>
The Government pretend that we are talking about funding social benefits and not about taxation. That is a piece of hypocrisy, the like of which I have not heard for a long time. Nye Bevan used to say, when addressing Labour Party meetings throughout the country, "Comrades, I'll let you into a State secret. There ain't no fund." He argued that it was merely a bookkeeping exercise. It is myth and hypocrisy to regard the proposals to increase employees' contributions by 1 per cent. as necessary to balance the books. The Bill simply increases taxation, and our amendments say that if the burden is to be applied it should be shared equally between employers and employees.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. He says that these matters will be taken into account in future wage negotiations. He neglects the other aspect of my argument, which is that employers do not have that facility. If the burden is placed upon them, they will have to shed labour, which will lead to greater unemployment. Surely the hon. Gentleman understands that.</p>

<p>That is a remarkable intervention, because the one facility that employers have which emloyees do not have is a captive audience. Not only are they able to reduce their static costs&#x2014;labour, rates and so on&#x2014;and reduce their marginal costs, but they can pass on through price increases any increased costs. That is precisely what they will do as a result of these changes. They will recoup higher national insurance payments through price increases or by reducing the amount of labour they employ.<br/>
We are proposing that the 1 per cent. increase in contributions, with which we do not agree&#x2014;because it is an attack on the low-paid, it reduces demand in the economy and is unnecessary&#x2014;should be shared equally between employers and employees. Employees will be seriously affected if they alone bear the burden. The social cost to the community will be just as great as the hon.


Member for Anglesey implied it might be if employers had to bear their part of the increase. The hon. Gentleman argues that if the burden is shared some labour might be shed. But if employees carry the whole burden family budgets will be seriously hit in terms of their ability to pay rent, rates and grocery bills.</p>

<p>I was following my hon. Friend's earlier argument about the effect of the Bill on wage negotiations in the coming year. He was arguing, I believe, that workers and their trade unions would take both price increases and tax increases into account. Can he provide technical information on that point? Whenever we debate national insurance contributions, there is always a discussion about whether they are a tax. As they clearly are a tax and should be thought of as such, will the increase show up in the tax and prices index which the Government produced early in their period of office as a way of showing that prices were rising less fast than the retail price index? Shall we see in the coming year, therefore, many more trade unions using the TPI as a more accurate way of judging changes in the living standards of workers?</p>

<p>That is a most interesting contribution. Trade unions have ignored the TPI because it does not include a large part of the extra tax burden that the Government have imposed. I have no doubt that trade unions will continue to rely, as they traditionally have, on the RPI as the main source of their prices information. They will add on to that, as is proper, any increases in income tax or national insurance contributions flowing from Government decisions.<br/>
I am certain that that will have a major effect on wage claims over the next few months and for the next pay round. This 1 per cent. increase in contributions must be related to the Government's proposals this winter for a 6 per cent. pay policy. The Government are saying that earnings must rise by that amount only, certainly in the public sector. Cash limits in that sector are set at 6 per cent. But the Bill means that, before any price increases or tax rises likely to be included in next April's Budget are taken into account, 1 per cent. of that increase will already have been swallowed up. That action alone invalidates the 6 per cent. pay policy.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is wrong, because it is 6 per cent. on earnings and that means 3&#x00BD; per cent. on rates of pay. I have worked out that the hospital domestic can expect on that basis to get about &#x00A3;98 a year with a 3&#x00BD; per cent. increase on the basic rate before stoppages.<br/>
That is another reason why the Government are wrong to insist on employees bearing all the burden. If they want their 6 per cent. wages policy to be effective, they must persuade workers and trade unionists that the only way to obtain a real increase in wages is by agreeing with their 6 per cent. policy, and that will not happen if they introduce measures that undermine it from the outset.</p>

<p>Do I understand the point correctly? Is my hon. Friend arguing that the Government's wages policy of 6 per cent. on earnings would, if successful, mean 3&#x00BD; per cent. on overall rates, and that of that 3&#x00BD; per cent. 1 per cent. would be clawed back by the Bill?</p>

<p>That is right. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the Secretary of State want to intervene on this? Perhaps he or the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who has just joined him, have information to which I am not privy.<br/>
The cash limit specifically demands a 6 per cent. growth in earnings over the next 12 months, but the final figure will depend on earnings opportunities in particular industries. In the National Health Service, a 24-hour operation, earnings opportunities are substantially greater than in other industries. But that means that, in some parts of the public sector, the only increase will be 3&#x00BD; to 4 per cent. on rates of pay, not the 6 per cent. specified.</p>

<p>I am more puzzled now by what my hon. Friend is saying. The Government's wages policy of 6 per cent. means 6 per cent. on rates of pay, the lower denominator. That will mean 3&#x00BD; per cent. on earnings. The national insurance contribution is based on earnings and will therefore apply at the low level. Am I still wrong?</p>

<p>The Government's proposal is 6 per cent. gross on earnings, and that means that the increase in wage rates would have to be 3&#x00BD;&#x2013;4 per cent. Therefore, some part of the 6 per cent. would be available for overtime, increased shift work premiums and so on. That has been built into the cash limits. The position under the Bill is that the national insurance 1 per cent. increase would be paid on earnings of 6 per cent. rather than on the rate of 3&#x00BD; per cent.<br/>
Some individuals will be seriously affected. They will not receive the full 6 per cent. increase. It is an illusion to believe that every worker will receive a 6 per cent. pay rise. Many workers will not receive the full 6 per cent. increase because they will not have the earnings opportunities to do so. That applies especially to those who Will be badly affected by clause 1&#x2014;for example, the part-time workers who earn about &#x00A3;27 a week and who do not have earnings opportunities. They are specifically excluded from receiving overtime payments by their contract of employment. They have to work up to either 40 hours or 33 hours before they can claim any further overtime payments. A substantial number of people will be badly affected by the 1 per cent. increase in contributions. That is a good reason why it should be reduced to &#x00BD; per cent.<br/>
There is a good argument for reducing the proportion paid by employees and loading some of the burden on to employers, especially in relation to the low-paid. Their jobs are being taken away and their earnings opportunities are being restricted. It is another serious blow to them. It is humbug for the Government to talk about national insurance contributions being mildly progressive. We should throw it back in their faces.</p>

<p>I apologise for not being in my place to hear the opening comments in this part of the debate. If I understand correctly the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mr. Race), the gist of the case is that because the national insurance contributions and increases are regressive, rather than progressive, the burden should be shared between employees and employers.<br/>
I wish to develop the idea that there is a case for the increase being put on to the shoulders of those in work and not on to those of the employers. The contribution of the hon. Member for Anglesey (Mr. Best) is important on this point. If we follow that line of argument, it is crucial that


we consider the base on which we are asking workers to make a contribution to the insurance fund. Briefly, I am saying that there is a case for the increase to be shouldered by employees. I go further and say that there is a case for a further increase for employees if we receive concessions on rights to benefit. That argument can be entertained only if we consider the basis on which we take contributions from workers, especially the low-paid. I agree with the arguments put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green on that matter.<br/>
At this point I wish to speak to amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7. Amendment No. 5 is a clear statement removing the increase, unless one shares or changes the whole basis on which we ask for national insurance contributions amendment No. 6, coming from the Liberal Benches, would divide the contribution between those earning up to &#x00A3;85, allowing them to pay at the old rate, and those earning above that level, who would pay the new increased rate. Amendment No. 7 would make the increase only &#x00BD; per cent. No doubt that ties in with the argument that there is a clear case for sharing the burden with employers.<br/>
Unfortunately, I was not in the Chamber to speak again on the first set of amendments. However, the point that I wished to make then is relevant now. I was genuinely amazed by the Minister's comments. The hon. Lady put forward the argument that we should not be too concerned about the increased burden that the low-paid would endure under the Bill because they receive a range of other help&#x2014;for example, family income supplement. The Secretary of State and the Minister were at pains to say that Opposition Members were mistaken about the way in which the poverty trap works. They said that we gave a snapshot of the real world and that the real world did not operate in that way. They said that the trap should be viewed rather like an old-fashioned time machine camera.<br/>
Let us consider the effect of this measure and the contribution of the low-paid. If the clause is passed unamended, there will be an increase of about &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;17 a week for the low-paid. At a stroke, the Government will be taking &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;17 off the family income supplement as soon as the Bill comes into operation. If the Secretary of State replies t3 the debate., I hope that he will give us information about how many family income supplement recipients receive less that &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;17 per week. By this measure alone, how many people will lose the whole of their family income supplement?<br/>
While we might have an academic argument as the evening progresses about how the poverty trap works, and whether this side or the other side of the Chamber has a more accurate vision of how the low-paid are affected, there cart be no question but that considerable numbers of those helped by the family income supplement payments will lose all their benefits because of this measure.<br/>
I wish to return to some of the remarks that my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green quite rightly made about the effects of the measure on the low-paid. Like him, I am sorry that the Minister is not in the Chamber. Obviously she will return, she will be told of our comments and she will respond to them. I see that my hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) is in her place. She can help me with my figures. We have only 19 lady Members of the House. Perhaps I should say women Members. I had not intended to use a sexist term, but I have done so.<br/>
Overwhelmingly, the issue of low pay affects women workers, yet one of the 19 women Members of Parliament

is a Minister at the DHSS, which has a record of introducing measures that hit viciously at women workers. The Government have proposed a scheme for maternity pay that redistributes the benefits available. The proposals for a sickness scheme redistribute money from families to the childless, again hitting at women and the children that they look after. The measure that we are discussing tonight is a third prong in the attack on low-paid workers. It massively increases the contribution which low-paid workers, mainly women, make to the national insurance fund. Let us remember that most low-paid workers are women. If we are at all concerned about the least privileged, those who gain least from the community's resources &#x2014; which is another way of discussing the inequalities between the sexes in our society&#x2014;there is a powerful case for saying&#x2014;</p>

Is he aware that a school meals worker who is made unemployed by a county council education authority can say to the unemployment benefit office that she wants to register as a part-time worker and have a contribution record, yet she cannot register as unemployed and receive unemployment benefit? At the same time, however, because of the actions of the Government, she is expected to pay substantially more in insurance contributions for the advantage of having no benefits whatever.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be fair. I think that he mentioned the maternity grant. It was my understanding that The proposals for redistribution would make it non-contributory, so that many more women would be eligible than are presently eligible under the rules. Will the hon. Gentleman clarify that?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is correct in one way. That is just one part of it. We now have proposals to reform radically the whole form of support for women in the first weeks of the child's life. The objection is not that one cannot make more sense of the proposals and make sure that, within them, poorer women get more, but that men, who are as a group more privileged than women in our society, will not be asked to contribute one extra penny to those reforms.<br/>
Women are a weak group in the community, and we have now come up with a wonderful way in which to reform the forms of support that we give to maternity, if I may use that term as a general heading. We are to redistribute from slightly richer women to slightly poorer women. There is a case for leaving the richer women with the benefits that they have and redistributing from richer men to women generally.<br/>
That is the point that we ought to bear in mind with the sick pay proposals that we are discussing tonight. It applies particularly to amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7, to which many of us will address ourselves. It is an attack on low-


paid workers, who are overwhelmingly women workers, and, therefore, the proposal cannot be divorced from other measures which the Government are taking and which are putting women workers at a greater disadvantage.<br/>
That is why I said that I regretted that the Under-Secretary of State was not in the Chamber, as she is in a privileged position, being one of the 19 women Members in the House of Commons. One would have thought that on these issues, which vitally affect the half of the population who are women, we would have had a better fight from within the Department to protect the interests of low-paid workers, who are overwhelmingly women.<br/>
My next point, which has already been raised in the debate, is about which group should pay the increased contributions. Here I depart somewhat from the argument put forward by my Front Bench. If we make a case for the whole of this contribution increase, or any future contribution increases, to be borne only by those in work, that can be a just move only if we look at the basis on which we ask for contributions from those in work. In other words, I agree with the emphasis that my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green put on drawing a distinction between the tax system and the national insurance system and showing how, on balance, the tax system was more progressive than the national insurance system.<br/>
Given that the difference is such a small one, I am reminded somewhat of the medieval theologians who, for hundreds of years, happily debated how many angels and archangels could stand on the head of a pin. Now that the Government have abolished the lower rate of tax, the tax system is, for the vast majority of workers&#x2014;apart from the 4 per cent. who pay surtax&#x2014;a proportional system of taxation. That emphasises the point that it is still a fairer way to raise increasing contributions in this country than the national insurance scheme itself.<br/>
I believe, as the hon. Member for Anglesey said, that to increase further the national insurance contributions of employers will put some employers out of a job. Obviously it will not affect most employees, but we are concerned with the people who are at the margin. It might be our children or our mum or dad who are at the margin and are made unemployed. It might be some of our own constituents who are at the margin and who are affected in that way. If we support that argument, given all that we have said here about how regressive the national insurance system is as a form of raising revenue, it is axiomatic that those of us who say that the cost should not fall on employers should say that we will try to persuade the Government to reform the whole basis of national insurance contributions for employees, so that we can build it into a progressive form of taxation or national insurance contribution.<br/>
That is why, on Second Reading, several of us made the point about the need to raise the ceiling. I shall not dwell on that because we shall return to it in the debate on the clause. What is necessary is to lift out of the bottom of the scale a number of those who are paying tax. The important point is that once people cross the national insurance threshold they pay contributions on every pound, and the national insurance threshold now is almost the same as the tax threshold. This means that people not only start to pay tax; they start to lose their rights to means-tested benefits. If people are at the bottom of the FIS entitlement, they will lose that entitlement.</p>

<p>Is it not clear that the impact, in employment terms, of increased contributions on the employer&#x2014;not the employee&#x2014;is very much conditional on the context in which those increases are made? In other words, if we have full employment, relatively stable prices and a firm demand in the economy, with few industries threatened by imports on any substantial basis, an increase in national insurance contributions of the kind proposed by the Government for employers, and of the kind proposed in the amendments, is marginal indeed to employment prospects. It is only where a large number of economic variables are impinging on employers and causing them to reduce employment levels that it becomes slightly more significant.</p>

<p>That is right. I believe that many people are getting very near to the unemployment queues, apart from the millions who are already in the queues.<br/>
My hon. Friend referred earlier to how similar this part of our taxation system was to the selective employment tax. We know that the National Institute of Economic and Social Research made a detailed study of the impact of that tax. We know that, wherever possible, that form of taxation was passed on in increased prices. That would be the effect here of increasing the employer's contribution. Where it could not be passed on, there would be an effect on job prospects. We should not do it without making a firm commitment to reform the basis of insurance contributions by employees as well.</p>

<p>As always, there is great persuasion in what the hon. Gentleman is saying. As I understand it, he is putting forward an argument for graduated payments by employees of national insurance contributions. Has he really thought that through? I accept that a form of regulation is fair&#x2014;we have it in any event in income tax&#x2014;but it is already graduated in a way, inasmuch as it is a percentage on earnings. Obviously, as the earnings increase, so the contributions increase. Has the hon. Gentleman thought of the administrative burdens that would be placed on employers as a result of what he is suggesting? He has been kind enough to accept my point that a further burden on employers in contributions is likely to lead to greater unemployment, but surely the greater administrative cost and administrative inconvenience would also lead to greater unemployment.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman should not underestimate the intelligence of employers in the public and private sectors. If the Revenue sends out tables showing how to work out deductions from pay, employers will be able to work them out, just as they have done in the past. No increased burden will result from devising a fairer way of getting contributions from employees.<br/>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. We are agreed that any increases that are made should be put on employees, as long as the system is more progressive. To hint that the system is progressive because it takes a certain amount from income as income rises is to miss the fundamental point. As soon as a person crosses the threshold, he pays his insurance contributions on every pound earned.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman must have been busy on parliamentary duties elsewhere when we debated the first group of amendments. At that time we dwelt on this matter for some time and showed how similar it was to the old exemption system, which was abolished by Austen


Chamberlain, I believe in the 1920 Budget. At that time our tax system was based on the same principle,&#x2014;namely, that allowances were of value to a person only if his income was below a certain level. Once that point had been crossed, the whole of a person's income was subject to tax. That is still true of the national insurance system, and that is why we fought&#x2014;and lost&#x2014;the debate to raise the starting point for national insurance contributions.<br/>
I have been trying to show that a case can be made in part for debating these amendments. We are discussing amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7 because we want to draw attention to the effects on lower-paid workers. If we are to hold a sensible debate, we must put a human face on those lower-paid workers. That face is the face of women. This measure cannot be considered separately from the other social security changes that the Government are making. They represent attacks on women workers and on women generally. I am sorry if I am beginning to bore the House by my pleas.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support.<br/>
We must consider how we can spread the money, earned over a period of 20 to 40 years, over a lifetime of 30 or more years. As a group, men are more privileged than women. How can we achieve a redistribution of money from men to women? The Government have introduced a series of measures that have increased the status of men at the expense of women. This and other social security measures cannot be divorced from the tax changes that the Government have made.<br/>
The Government are trying to balance their books, and they have got into difficulties. I have never accused the Government of dishonesty. Nevertheless, they have ruthlessly redistributed money in favour of the rich. The Government said that they were going to do that, and they have done it. No dishonesty is involved. However, it is wrong to elevate the issue of greed to an issue of principle. It is clear that the Government have a mandate for that. Men were the main beneficiaries of tax cuts. We are&#x2014;</p>

I sought to plead in favour of amendments Nos. 5, 6 and 7. The Government are making an attack on low-paid workers, and those workers are mainly women. That cannot be divorced from other Government measures. There may be a case for not increasing the contribution on employers, but one must ask how regressive taxation and national insurance contributions are on employees. If we wish to increase the load, we must make the base progressive.<br/>
The Government have had to introduce the Bill. It should have included a major change in the basis on which employees make contributions to the national insurance fund. There might be a case for further increases, provided

that there is a quid pro quo by way of an increase in benefits. One could then sell that to one's constituents more easily than one can sell the present base.</p>

<p>I shall concentrate my remarks on amendment No. 5, which would delete subsection (2). As has been pointed out, that subsection would place a burden of about &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;17 a week on the low-paid. Therefore, it is deflationary. It will result in a diminution in demand and will create a higher level of unemployment. The Chief Secretary argued at Question Time today that it was a means of paying social benefits. He argued that the sum of about &#x00A3;1 billion, which is derived from the increase in primary class 1 contributions, is sufficient or will go towards the revenue necessary to maintain some of the social services. No doubt the Secretary of State would also argue along those lines.<br/>
In reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Derby, North (Mr. Whitehead), the Chief Secretary said that if one wills the end&#x2014;the maintenance of social services&#x2014;one must will the means. The Chief Secretary is wrong. The Government will take money largely from the poor and give it back to the poor in a convoluted transfer that will subject them to further means tests. That is not good enough.<br/>
I turn to a subject that was mentioned on Second Reading, because it is relevant. We are not supposed to talk about it, because it was featured on a television programme. I refer to the &#x00A3;1 billion that was obtained by the Rossminster group through tax avoidance, The Government could consider tightening up tax evasion and tax avoidance instead of adding another burden in the form of clause 1(2). The Government might argue that it would take a certain amount of time to smoke out those smart alec lawyers and to stop tax avoidance. There is no reason why the Government should not increase the public sector borrowing requirement as a temporary measure. The additional contribution of 1 per cent. found in subsection (2) will be contrasted against that televison programme in which well-heeled gents in well-laid-out offices ran schemes for well-heeled people to avoid paying tax. People will say that the measure is extremely unjust. They will want to change the society in which that&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall spell it out for you, Mr. Godman Irvine. Subsection (2) proposes that there should be an increase in primary class I contributions from 6&#x00B7;75 per cent. to 7&#x00B7;75 per cent. That is a 1 per cent. increase. My argument is that the increase in this subsection, which is a burden upon the low-wage earner, will be seen as unjust.

I make the point that a short time ago a television programme demonstrated how the payment of about &#x00A3;1 billion had been avoided by a tax avoidance scheme. I am making the point by way of illustration&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am illustrating this in passing, by way of example. This is the usual way of&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] Does the hon. Member for Lancaster (Mrs. Kellett-Bowman)


wish to intervene? I do not like sedentary interjections being made by the hon. Lady in that stentorian voice of hers. I do not wish to go down the path that she is suggesting because you, Mr. Godman Irvine, would naturally and correctly call me to order. I was using that illustration by way of example, in passing. I think that it is an important point to make.<br/>
I was saying that the subsection should be deleted because it is possible to consider alternative sources of income. I suggest the diminution of tax avoidance, but that might take some time. The Government's argument is that they must have this money in a fairly short time. That is why they are using this quick and easy administrative method of raising money.<br/>
However, the Government have already indicated that they are not sticking rigidly to the public sector borrowing requirement target or, for that matter, to the figures for the growth of the money supply. I do not want to go into that, because it is not relevant to the point that I want to make.<br/>
My claim that the Government have altered their PSBR target so that they could legitimately accept the amendment to delete subsection (2) is evidenced in <i>The Guardian</i> today. This point was mentioned during Question Time. The heading is:
<q>Biffen's hint of U-turn startles the Right.</q>
That refers to the Chief Secretary&#x2014;the right hon. Member for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen). This article by Ian Aitken, the political editor, was challenged at Question Time today. The Chief Secretary said that he had the advantage of being at the meeting where this claim was made. On the other hand, so did the person who spoke to Ian Aitken. [AN HON.

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Godman Irvine. I accept a great deal of what you say.

<p>That is the point. My argument is that subsection (2) should be deleted. I am putting forward

reasons why subsection (2) should be deleted. I believe that it is unfair. At the same time, if the subsection is deleted, the Bill, which seeks to raise revenue, will be short by &#x00A3;1 billion. The Government will not get &#x00A3;1 billion if subsection (2) is deleted. Therefore, I submit that it is not out of order if, for example, there are alternatives.<br/>
Parliament has debates to convince Members to vote in particular ways. That is the pretence through which we go. It is in order to do that. However, we know that, whatever we say, all Conservative Members will support the clause because they are hacks. As soon as the Whip goes out, they follow it.

Therefore, I should not have thought that it was irrelevant to consider that comment and to suggest alternatives for subsection (2), which we wish to delete.<br/>
The Government's claim that subsection (2) must be retained at all costs because their PSBR target has to be met is not true, in view of a speech made by no less a person than the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to a Back-Bench committee of the Conservative Party.</p>

<p>I do not propose to reveal any secrets to the Conservative Party yet. Mr. Aitken wrote:
<q>He argued that there was a considerable degree of imprecision in calculating such figures as the money supply and public borrowing, and that there were no grounds for despair when things went wrong. But his audience was startled to hear him say that the time had come to abandon such targets in favour of a flexible policy designed to meet the unexpectedly grave economic recession.</q>


8.30 pm<br/>
That unexpectedly grave economic recession will be made even graver by the clause and by the raising of &#x00A3;1 billion under subsection (2). That is one of the reasons why we oppose it. By virtue of that quotation, which was hedged around by the Chief Secretary, we are arguing that public borrowing can be increased in order to get over the problem of the &#x00A3;1 billion that the Government are facing.<br/>
I should like to go a little further and deal with a number of other alternatives. One short-term alternative is public borrowing. You, Mr. Godman Irvine, have said that this is not a Budget, but we think that it is at least part of the budgetary process. Let us suppose that there is a gap of three or four months between now and the next Budget. That could be covered by borrowing. In the next Budget, an alternative would be to shift this swingeing increase, which will bear heavily on those least able to pay, on to those who are most able to pay. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) said, we should introduce a more progressive basis. Income tax is a more progressive basis.<br/>
I was reminded of that when I saw question No. 9 on today's Order Paper, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), who asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer:
<q>'what evidence he has that the opportunities and incentives provided to business and to individuals in his 12 June 1979 budget are working as intended.</q>
Those incentives, which were tax concessions to the well-off, were designed to create jobs by stimulating entrepreneurial activity. It is beyond peradventure that that has not worked, and we knew that it would not. Therefore, the claim that this removal of tax from the well-off would produce an improvement in the economy is patently untrue. Therefore, there is a good case for restoring those tax cuts. That would produce more than the &#x00A3;1 billion which would be raised under subsection (2).<br/>
The other alternative that I want to consider&#x2014;assuming that subsection (2) is deleted, which I hope it is &#x2014;relates to a rapid examination of expenditure on defence. If the Chief Secretary is right&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. The hon. Gentleman must realise that we are dealing with the case for or against raising the class 1 contributions. It follows from that that it would not be in order to follow the line of argument that the hon. Gentleman is now following about other aspects of taxation.</p>

<p>If amendment No. 5 is carried, I take it that the Government will be short of revenue. I do not think that that is a matter of controversy. I think that the Secretary of State would agree. If I am to persuade my hon. Friends to vote with me, I must convince them&#x2014;because several doubters exist&#x2014;that there are alternatives to which the Government could turn their attention. I know that you, Mr. Godman Irvine, would want me to be able to convince my hon. Friends on this matter.<br/>
Therefore, as an illustration, I believe that there are areas of expenditure that are non-productive&#x2014;indeed, they are inflationary because they produce nothing at all &#x2014;which in the current financial year have risen by 2&#x00BD; per cent. In my opinion, the Government should look at defence expenditure. They should do so in order to transfer

that money to the social expenditure which the Chief Secretary says is a desirable end, although we must look at the means.</p>

<p>Surely, Mr. Godman Irvine, we must consider alternatives, otherwise the Government will be &#x00A3;1 billion short. One of the arguments which the Secretary of State will use is that we should not vote for amendment No. 5, unless he&#x2014;I am willing to give way&#x2014;accepts it. If he opposes it, it will be on the ground that it is no alternative, because he must have this revenue. Therefore, if I am to persuade my hon. Friends, I must be able to point out to them that there are alternatives. I shall not deal with the question of Stingray, although my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) is right in saying that it is costing about &#x00A3;1 billion.<br/>
I turn now to a suggestion that was made by the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr. McCrindle) on Second Reading. I realise that I must not make a broad Second Reading speech, but we are dealing with that section on which the hon. Gentleman concentrated. He said that this was an unfair tax and that the clause was unfair and bore most heavily on those with moderate incomes. I think that the hon. Gentleman suggested a tax on banks' profits.</p>

<p>I had no intention of intervening in the hon. Gentleman's speech, but I am sure that he would not like to misrepresent me. I said that, although there was a regressive element in the proposals, on that basis alone we should not turn back from the path along which we were treading. Instead, any regressive elements could be taken care of by increased family income supplement to those who are at work as soon as there can be any increase in social expenditure. The hon.

<p>I do not wish to misrepresent the hon. Gentleman in any way, and, indeed, he can make his own speech. I was recalling from memory, and I think that he suggested that the regressive element in this legislation could be remedied to some extent by a tax on the windfall profits of the banks. He is at liberty to modify that and to make his peace with his Front Bench. Undoubtedly he is a man of ability, but he should not put himself too much out on a limb, because there will be a Government reshuffle shortly and I have my eye on him for consideration. Of course, I am very influential with the Leader of the Conservative Party&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I think that I have given the hon. Gentleman the kiss of death.<br/>

<p>I am grateful for your protection, Mr. Godman Irvine, from the diversions put before me, and I shall not engage the hon. Member for Brentwood and Ongar in a discussion about his speech. I do not want to misrepresent him in any way. He said on 8 December:
<q>to raise income tax instead of charges would be preferable or, perhaps better, that they should impose a once-for-all excess levy on banking profits."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 1050.]</q>
I merely wanted to demonstrate that if we agree to amendment No. 5 and delete subsection (2), this is the way to fill the gap created by the deletion of that subsection.<br/>
The banks are making massive profits because of the Government's policy of raising interest rates to extortionate levels, and a tax on windfall profits would be one way of obtaining revenue for the social purposes to which the Chief Secretary referred and which, I have no doubt, the Secretary of State will maintain are necessary.<br/>
The Opposition believe that this is an unfair tax&#x2014;and it is a tax. It will be oppressive on those who are least able to pay. We want to shift the burden on to the backs of those who are most able to bear it, and I have no doubt that both sides of the House agree that the banks are well able to pay in order to maintain social services.<br/>
The other amendments are an attempt to produce some element of fairness in a basically unfair and regressive tax position. I do not much like the Liberal amendment. It would make a slight improvement, but I should rather see subsection (2) deleted. If that happy situation were to occur, the Government would have to tell us by what means they intended to raise the money. I should welcome that, because I should like a fairer and better treatment of the ordinary working class than the Government are proposing.<br/>
I hope that I have managed to convince any of my hon. Friends who had even an iota of doubt that there are alternatives to subsection (2) and that we ought to support amendment No. 5 and delete the subsection.</p>

<p>I appreciate the attempts of my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) to point to other areas where money can be raised if that must be done. I was staggered to hear that we may not discuss other projects where savings could be made. Stingray has already been mentioned, and there are other weapons and projects that could easily be cancelled. As Mr. Godman Irvine has now left the Chair, we may be able to suggest alternative savings.<br/>
This morning I went on one of my periodic visits to the River plant of the Ford Motor Company, which makes the upholstery for Ford cars. Nearly all the workers are women, and several asked me what we would be doing in the House today. I said "We shall be putting up your national insurance contributions." Such is the power of the British press that few of the women had heard much about the contribution increases. One or two had heard but could not believe that on top of all the other increases that they have had to suffer as workers, taxpayers and ordinary members of society there was to be yet another blow inflicted by a Government who are mean enough to rush it all through just before Christmas.<br/>
I asked many of the women what sort of Christmas they would have, how many children they had, whether they would be having family parties and so on. While not pleading poverty, several said that it would be a pretty hard Christmas, because they would not be able to buy as much for their kids and their homes as they had in previous years. They just do not have the money. They were appalled to find that as a result of the Bill, which is being rushed through the House with unseemly and indecent haste, they will be penalised further.<br/>
8.45 pm<br/>
The people already understand the result of the Government's actions. In almost every family in the land someone is on the dole, has to claim supplementary benefit or is in receipt of sickness, injury or invalidity benefit. All such families receive child benefit. They know how mean the Government have been in not increasing the benefits to bring them into line with inflation. I am talking about low-paid and average-paid workers. They are finding that times are hard as a result of Government action. My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley was absolutely right to suggest alternative ways of raising revenue.<br/>
Amendment No. 5 seeks to delete a whole subsection. That is our aim. However, if we cannot persuade enough Government Members to that view, perhaps they would care to examine one or two other amendments which they might find more attractive. For example, amendments Nos. 7 and 9 divide in half the 1 per cent. which is to be raised under the clause. The intention is to raise half from the employee and half from the employer. I have not heard all the speeches tonight, but some hon. Members suggest that the levy should not be put on the employer because some employers might bounce it back on to the employee or consumer. However, even that seems to be more equitable. If we cannot get rid of the provision altogether, it is better to divide it down the middle so that employees and employers make equal contributions.<br/>
Much has been said about low-paid workers&#x2014;women and part-time workers in particular. I represent a solidly working-class constituency where, traditionally, women go out to work because money is needed to supplement the family income. In most cases women do not go out to work because they want a career, although some do. Some of the work that they do is poorly paid and boring. Mostly it is not work that they would choose to do, but they have to do it because they need the money.<br/>
These are the kind of women that I have talked to, as I am sure have other Members in their constituencies, on council estates in particular, who are the first to be driven to the wall, losing their jobs or having to give up their jobs as a result of some of the actions of this Government. Hon. Members cannot fail to realise that some of the overall


public expenditure cuts which have been made&#x2014;for example, in charges for home helps and the cuts in the home help service, the closing, or the non-opening, of old peoples' homes and the fact that school meals provision is not as it used to be&#x2014;have placed an extra burden on the woman of the family. In some cases, she has had to give up her job to look after children or elderly or sick relatives and is not able to carry on working, even though there may be a job for her.<br/>
The Government have not given sufficiently careful consideration to the effects of their policies, including the policy that we are debating tonight, on married women and those who are in poorly paid and part-time jobs. I hope, therefore, that we shall consider, as an alternative to the amendment, to delete the subsection, amendments Nos. 7 and 9. I hope that we shall have a vote on amendment No. 9, assuming that the principal amendment, No. 5, is not carried. I hope that the Committee will support me in amendment No. 9 as an alternative to what has been proposed.</p>

<p>The nub of the clause lies in the rather remarkable statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 24 November, in which he said:
<q>it is right that those who remain in employment should be invited to be in a percentage of that cost by the increase that I have described in national insurance contributions.</q>
If amendment No. 5 is not passed, we shall be turning the Chancellor's invitation into a godfather-type invitation which people cannot refuse because it will be the law of the land. That is a curious form of invitation, the sort of invitation which this Government seem to issue to everyone where money is concerned&#x2014;that is, apart from their rich friends.<br/>
In considering what the Secretary of State said about his taxation and benefits policy. I shall refer&#x2014;unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer), I do not rely on what some Government Members regard as hearsay evidence of a reputable journalist when listening to a wet blue moan in the Lobby&#x2014;to a piece of wet blue paper issued by the news service of the Conservative Central Office concerning the speech which the Secretary of State made to the Canton Conservative Club. For the uninitiated I should explain that Canton turns out to be not in China but in Cardiff. He said on that occasion, and I must admit that it is pretty true, even with the media not on our side:
<q>It is easy for the Socialists to accuse us of cutting back on welfare in order to finance tax handouts for the better-off.</q>
He is absolutely right. It is easy for us to do that, because it is true and the most powerful forms of propaganda are always those which are true. For once in a while, the Secretary of State made an accurate statement in his speeches around the country. Having looked at many of the right hon. Gentleman's speeches in the past two hours, I think that that phrase stands out as the one that is probably the most accurate of all those that we could quote.<br/>
I turn to the matters that my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) referred to, particularly in relation to those members of our poorer community who rely on family income supplement. As I explained earlier, I have a very simple view of these matters, because I do not have the expertise of many of my hon. Friends. I understood that my hon. Friend was talking about FIS to the value of &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;17 disappearing from many of those who can presently draw it, disappearing entirely as a result of the Bill. That would be a severe blow.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way so that I can put the argument a little more clearly. We were talking generally about low-paid workers. I was saying that I was sad that I had not received a reply in the debate on the first set of amendments. I was amazed that the Under-Secretary defended the increase in the national insurance contribution of low-paid workers generally by saying that we must not worry too much, because they would pick up FIS. My point was that many of them would have the whole of their FIS given by the DHSS and then taken back by the Inland Revenue. I hoped that the Secretary of State would tell us how many workers would, in effect, have the whole of their FIS payment cancelled out as a result of the clause. Perhaps when the right hon. Gentleman next intervenes he will give us that valuable information.</p>

<p>I think that when the Secretary of State gave the figure 28 he meant 28p and not the number of people who were being taken out of ITS. Apparently his officials, those whom he accused in his election manifesto of not understanding the system, do not understand it well enough to have been able to give him the necessary advice since my hon. Friend raised the point originally.<br/>
According to the latest figures provided by the Department, figures which I believe are as recent as 1975, the take-up of FIS is roughly only 75 per cent. of those eligible. I also understand from the Department that it is believed that the bulk of those who do not draw it would not be entitled to a great deal. It seems to follow from my hon. Friend's point that a substantial number of people not drawing FIS would be taken out of eligibility for it by the methods that we are talking about.<br/>
We all know that one of the reasons for the 1 per cent. increase is the substantial increase in unemployment. I seem to be following my hon. Friend rather closely tonight. He has already spoken of the exaggerated impact of unemployment on women. They have suffered disproportionately because there has been a disproportionate shedding of labour among people who are only in part-time employment. Women tend to be more often in part-time employment than men. Consequently, they have suffered considerably more as a result of the Government's other measures that have led to increased unemployment. Unless the Government accept amendment No. 5, a disproportionate share of the burden of paying for unemployment will fall upon the shoulders of women in part-time employment who are at the nodule point of the impact of these benefits. Once again, women will suffer more&#x2014;I refer to those in employment, especially in part-time employment&#x2014;as a result of the Government's policies.<br/>

It was stated in the Conservative Party's manifesto that a Conservative Government would "tackle" the poverty


trap. There may be numerous interpretations of the word "tackle". There is the tackle by a Third Division North half-back that is intended to knock the knees&#x2014;</p>

<p>Was that interpretation intended by those who wrote the Conservative Party manifesto? I spoke of the half-back tackling a forward. That example applied to whatever Division One wanted to choose, whether it exists these days or whether it does not. The Bill will help pick up the forward in the role of the poverty trap. It will do nothing to harm the poverty trap. It is not tackling it at all but increasing it. That is another good reason for supporting the amendment to delete the proposed increase. That increase, taken with the other measures in the Bill, is bound to accentuate the poverty trap, especially for women who are in part-time employment or who have passed out of that employment as a result of the Government's policies.<br/>
One of the problems is that those who occupy the Treasury Bench have little knowledge of the poverty trap except at a theoretical level. They see their problems as having to deal with the wealth trap. We have had the Treasury Bench graced with a member of the Government whose main reputation was gained outside the House. He is now dependent on his ability to alleviate the wealth trap to the tune of &#x00A3;1,000 million, which is equivalent to the amount to be raised&#x2014;</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. Your predecessor in the Chair raised this point when I was addressing the Committee. If we are to persuade enough hon. Members to vote for the amendment when the Committee divides, we shall have to convince them that there are sound alternatives if the amendment is carried.

However, the proposal that the hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mr. Dobson) wishes to make is a matter of argument. We are not discussing defence or housing. Hon.

<p>I should hate to be diverted into a series of passing references to anything. I shall, therefore, deal with one consequence that will result if the Committee does not pass the amendment. I address my remarks more to Conservative Members than to my hon. Friends. My remarks have nothing to do with alternative means of raising the &#x00A3;1,000 million that the Government seek to raise by the 1 per cent. increase. I shall point out an inevitable consequence for the Government's economic policies and the general state of the economy if the amendment is not passed.<br/>
The Government are in a trap. To date, according to official Government figures, price inflation has been a bit lower or about the same as the level of wage increases. If, however, as a result of the Government's policy, wage increases are kept roughly to the Government's target of 6 per cent. but inflation is not brought down to the same level, the impact on the people will be much greater than merely the official figures. Whatever the official figures, the disparity between pay increases and price increases will grow. The perceived rate of inflation will also increase. The Government would therefore be unwise, even within their own philosophy, to impose an additional &#x00A3;1,000 million tax on people in employment, when they should be seeking to keep to the minimum the perceived rate of inflation. If the Government impose the increase, they will raise the perceived rate of inflation at the very time when they should be doing all in their power to lower it.<br/>
This measure is unfair in that it imposes a burden on those least able to bear it. It imposes a particularly harsh burden on women, because they constitute a disproportionately high proportion of those in part-time employment, the people whom the Bill will hit hardest. It shows a failure of the Government's policies because it will accelerate the perceived rate of inflation. The


Government have available to them a host of other measures to raise the &#x00A3;1,000 million, including, if I may mention them in passing, some substantial cuts in the wasteful defence expenditure upon which they are now embarking.</p>

<p>When the Bill was first published, based as it was on the Chancellor of the Exchequer's statement, a number of commentators, hardly any of whom were sympathisers with my party, said that the increased contributions were the Government's admission of defeat for their policies. The fairest and most just course for the Government would have been to announce that they were increasing taxation. Their election manifesto commitment precluded that, however, and since the manifesto contained no comparable commitment about national insurance contributions they saw it as a convenient way of balancing the books.<br/>
Although it gets them out of difficulty, it does so at the expense of social justice. The lower-paid will suffer most. Generally, part-time women workers will have to pay between &#x00A3;2 and &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;25 national insurance contribution out of wages of &#x00A3;27 or &#x00A3;29 a week.<br/>
That is a curious comment on the Government's first Budget, of June 1979. Its clear objective was to remove the disincentive effect of heavy taxation on earnings at lower and middle levels and to strengthen financial incentives by allowing people to keep more of what they earned. It was to cut the marginal rate of tax on overtime and so on. That, at least, was the official reason given in the Budget snapshot produced by the Treasury on 12 June 1979.<br/>
The proposal to increase the national insurance contributions of those at the low end of the incomes scale runs counter to all that. The hon. Member for Harrogate (Mr. Banks) has said repeatedly that, far from giving those people incentives, the proposal is the grossest disincentive, the grossest attack and the grossest example of social injustice. He said that the only people who were doing well out of the Government were the bankers and the moneylenders. I shall add the brewers also.<br/>
9.15 pm<br/>
Our charge is the sheer social injustice of the measure and the complete negation of incentives to people who desperately need some help, if not incentives.</p>

<p>I was about to mention that document. The Low Pay Unit points out that the marginal rates of tax at selected income levels show the gross disincentive under these and related proposals that have been put forward by the Government since they were elected. The document gives a table showing that by April 1981 workers earning the equivalent of &#x00A3;40 per week at 1979 prices will keep only 62&#x00B7;25p of every additional &#x00A3;1, compared with 68&#x00B7;5p before the June 1979 Budget. The Budget reduced their income by more than somewhat.

Those earning &#x00A3;500 per week&#x2014;not &#x00A3;40 per week&#x2014;will keep 40p out of every additional &#x00A3;1, compared with 17p that they would have kept prior to last year's Budget.<br/>
The document states:
<q>Thus while the majority of workers have seen their marginal tax rate reduced by up to 20 per cent. by this Government, an estimated 50,000 workers have had theirs increased by 6&#x00BC; per cent.</q>
Those are the facts as produced by a reputable outside body.<br/>
The obvious intention of this pan of the Bill is to transfer burdens from the Treasury, and, therefore, from the generality of taxpayers, to the national insurance contributors. Generally speaking, an unfair proportion of those increased national insurance contributions will be paid by the low-paid sections of our community. The most regressive provision in the Bill is the reduction of the Treasury supplement from 18 percent. of contributions to 14&#x00B7;5 per cent.&#x2014;a drastic reduction in the commitment of the taxpayer to the national insurance fund.<br/>
The increase in contribution rates over and above that required by the Government Actuary is to finance the cut in the contribution made by general taxation to the rational insurance fund. The Government Actuary's report on the Bill notes that an extra &#x00A3;529 million will have to be raised in contribution income to make up for the cut in the Treasury supplement. That is not coincidental. It is a deliberate part of Government policy to switch the burdens&#x2014;not only in the national insurance area but in other areas&#x2014;of social benefits, whether they be housing subsidies or anything else, away from the generality of taxpayers to others who are least able to bear them.<br/>
We are moving further away&#x2014;and the amendment and those linked with it are moving further away&#x2014;from the original concept of financing the national insurance fund on a tripartite basis. I refer to the Beveridge report, produced 30 years ago. The forecast then was that by 1965&#x2014;15 years ago&#x2014;the Treasury would be contributing about 46 per cent. of the total charges on the fund and that that proportion would in all probability increase. Instead of that happening, the Government are reducing the proportion to 14&#x00B7;5 per cent.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend mentioned the Beveridge report. There was no clear statement on how much the Exchequer contribution should be over the years. That was


shown in the White Paper produced by the Coalition Government in 1944. There the figures are quite different from those in the note with which we have been provided as a brief.

The Library brief on these matters includes a table deriving from the social security statistics for 1975, showing the Exchequer contribution as a percentage of total contributions excluding contributions to the National Health Service where appropriate. It shows the percentage Treasury supplement as 16&#x00B7;7 percent. in 1975, compared with 38&#x00B7;7 percent. in 1951.<br/>
The point that my hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) was making is worth repeating. The Government are pursuing a deliberate policy, which is hidden a little in the technical detail of the Bill. It is a deliberate shift of burdens. We are moving from a relatively fair and progressive system of taxation to a most regressive and socially unfair system of flat-rate contributions under the national insurance scheme. That is the main charge against the Government. In addition, it accentuates the problems of the poverty trap.<br/>
When the Conservatives were in Opposition, they&#x2014;not least the Secretary of State and his underling, the Under-secretary&#x2014;were eloquent about the evils of the poverty trap. They are now hell-bent on making it worse. That is most reprehensible. During a recent debate in another part of the building, one of our colleagues said that he was sick and tired of hearing Tories saying one thing in Opposition and another when they were on the Treasury Bench. That is what the Government are doing tonight, and that is why we strongly object to the Bill.</p>

<p>Like my colleagues, I find this clause to be one of the most obnoxious in the Bill. The Conservative Party has been trying to trick the country out of a proper debate. The Government have insisted on slipping through a tax measure to raise an extra &#x00A3;1 billion. This measure is designed to discourage debate outside the House and designed to discourage people from finding out what is happening. If the Government had introduced this measure in a Finance Bill, in the normal way, we should have had a period of three or four months for people to appreciate the measure and to make representations.<br/>
The Government intend the Bill to be enacted and to increase people's stoppages next April. They do not want people to know why that is happening. That is objectionable. The Government should have the honesty to tell people that they do not want to increase income tax, because that would be a U-turn. They should say that they are doing the same thing in a more regressive way, by increasing national insurance contributions. It would have been fair if the Government had said that and had then received the country's support. It is particularly objectionable that the Government should try to sneak this measure through in such a way.<br/>
It is a pretence to say that the measure involves national insurance, because no one will derive any benefit. If the Secretary of State can show me one benefit, I shall take back some of my words. There are cuts in every area. Pensions are being cut in real terms. Sickness benefit, unemployment benefit and industrial injury benefit are being cut in real terms. Even the Health Service has, in effect, been cut, because of the imposition of VAT. In all those areas for which people pay their contributions, there are cuts. They are being asked to pay more and to accept less. This is clearly a taxation measure that has nothing to do with national insurance.<br/>
The Minister keeps insisting that the Bill must be rushed through before Christmas so that it can take effect from 6 April. However, the other fiscal measures will be announced in the Budget. We are being given only one measure and we cannot look at a package and a total effect. Why does not the Secretary of State introduce proposals to change personal tax allowances now? New tax tables could then be available from 6 April. That would be logical. However, the right hon. Gentleman seems to think that it is perfectly all right for those measures to be considered in the summer. Perhaps he will not change personal allowances this year.<br/>
The Treasury does not intend to bring forward a measure for personal tax allowances this year. Does it intend to have the money and then, perhaps, to pay it back in the form of a refund later in the year? There is no logic in that. What about family income supplement? We have argued strongly about the low-paid. What are the Minister's proposals for FIS next year? That might give us some idea of the impact on the low-paid. Again, he wants to keep that information back. He is not prepared to give us a total package as regards the financial position next April. Some will find that their stoppages will increase in April as a result of this measure and will possibly go down later in the year because the Government will be trying to claim some credit for changing the personal tax allowances.<br/>
9.30 pm<br/>
The Liberal Party was challenged to propose something that was fairer than a lump sum, but the attempt that is made in amendment No. 6 is somewhat feeble. The hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Wainwright) talked about the poverty plateau rather than the poverty trap. I suggest that the amendment would put into the plateau only one small peak. It would not do much to solve the problem of how to change from a regressive to a reasonably progressive tax.<br/>
I hope that a separate vote will be allowed on amendments Nos. 7 and 9 because they deal with a different principle. We are reluctant to concede that the Government need to raise the extra &#x00A3;1 billion. However, if they are to raise it, we would argue that it should be done in a fairer way by sharing the burden between the employer and the employee.<br/>
I accept that there are some problems. I do not believe that the imposition of this tax can be see in terms of half going one way and half the other. It depends entirely on bargaining power, labour relations and the employment situation how the money is split between the employer and the employee. However, it still seems fairer to split it in that way.<br/>
The Government claimed that they were determined to help the employer and were not putting up his costs. Then it came out that they were putting up his costs considerably.<br/>
I suggest that the Minister could accept the amendment and split the increase between the employer and the employee without doing any harm to the employer if he considered the real problems facing the employer&#x2014;high interest rates and the exchange rate. If he could persuade the Treasury to bring down either of those by a small percentage, most employers would happily pay their extra national insurance contribution. That would be of more help to them than holding off their increase.<br/>
Will the Minister say whether the &#x00BC; per cent. is required 1 or the increased numbers of unemployed or for the extra numbers qualifying for pennon payments? I suggest that it is wrong to raise extra money to pay the unemployed. The emphasis should be on reducing the level of unemployment. The most depressing part of the Government Actuary's report on the extra &#x00BC; percent. is the Government's acceptance that the average level of unemployment next year will be 2,300,000. If the Government could solve that problem, there would be no need for the &#x00BC; per cent.<br/>
I hope that the Committee will support amendment No. 5 to leave out subsection (2) Failing that, I hope that we shall be allowed to express oar preference for amendments Nos. 7 and 9.</p>

<p>It is almost three hours since the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) moved amendment No. 5, which seeks to delete subsection (2), which he rightly described as the heart of the Bill and which would raise &#x00A3;1,000 million extra in national insurance contributions. I make no complaint that hon. Members have addressed themselves at length to the issues posed by subsection (2), and I shall do my best, I hope at not too great length to respond to the points that have been made.<br/>
The hon. Member for Perry Bar, who was echoed by the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett), asked why we had to have the Bill now. The hon. Member for Stockport, North asked why whatever tax changes my light hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer may have in mind for the Budget should not be made known so that the tax tables may be issued or, alternatively, why this decision could not be put in the context of the Budget and dealt with at the same time.<br/>
The answer really lies in the practicalities of the rational insurance contributions. I shall explain in a moment why the Government thought that this was the sensible way to proceed in the position in which we find ourselves.<br/>
The difference between tax and national insurance contributions, purely as a matter of machinery, is that PAYE is cumulative and national insurance contributions are not. With PAYE, one can announce the rates in the Budget and issue the tables later in the year, perhaps about June&#x2014;the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Wainwright), as a member of the accountancy profession, understands these things extremely well&#x2014;and then catch up with the wrong payments that have been made in the first two or three months of the financial year, because PAYE operates cumulatively.<br/>
One cannot do that with national insurance. The tables issued to employers for national insurance purposes must

be issued in time to allow them to make the necessary changes in their pay arrangements, whether on computers or otherwise. We therefore have to issue those by the beginning of February so that the new rates of national insurance contributions can be deductable from 6 April. That is the mechanical reason why we have to do this.<br/>
It was for exactly the same reason that the Labour Government, when they introduced the National Insurance Surcharge Act in 1976, had to proceed on almost exactly the same timetable&#x2014;including, incidentally, taking that Bill through Parliament in the space of a very few weeks. That is why we have to do this, and that is why we must pass the Bill.<br/>
I turn to the reason why we wish to add one percentage point to the national insurance contribution of employees. The House will remember, as this was discussed at some length on Second Reading, that one-quarter of that is to provide money for the National Health Service and thus to enable the Government to maintain the growth in spending on the National Health Service to which we committed ourselves in our election manifesto.<br/>
A further &#x00BC; per cent. is necessary to maintain the flow of funds to the national insurance fund, to meet the expected demand on that fund in the course of the next year. The reasons for that are spelt out in the Government Actuary's report published with the Bill.<br/>
The third element, which aroused the indignation of the hon. Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton), and to which, no doubt, we shall return on clause 2, is a further &#x00BD; per cent. to allow for the reduction in the Treasury supplement, which, as my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary said on Second Reading, makes a direct contribution to the reduction of the public sector borrowing requirement.<br/>
It would not be light for me on this amendment to go into the economic arguments for the essential policy of containing the size of the public sector borrowing requirement. But no one has sought to deny that the case for raising extra money in this way, to allow the public sector borrowing requirement to be reduced, was made absolutely clear from the start&#x2014;from the moment that my right hon. and learned Friend the Chancellor announced this&#x2014;and it is at the heart of the Government's economic policy.<br/>
The hon. Member for Perry Barr and a number of his hon. Friends asked why we must put this wholly on the employee and why it has not been shared, as perhaps in other circumstances it might have been, between employer and employee. It is fair to say that in the early days of the national insurance scheme employers' and employees' contributions were much the same and moved broadly in parallel. In recent years, even leaving aside the national insurance surcharge, the employers' contribution has moved up and is now more than 10 per cent., whereas the employees' contribution was 6&#x00BE; per cent., now rising to 7&#x00BE; per cent. as a result of the Bill.<br/>
The Bill, to a modest extent, narrows the differential. But the real reason why we decided to make this impost on the employee and not on the employer is that the pattern and movement of the factors in the economy, particularly the high interest rates and the high exchange rates that have been referred to in the debate, press very much more hardly on employers than on employees. Standards of living over the last 12 months have on average risen quite significantly across the country. The increase in earnings has been four or five points higher than the increase in


prices. In those circumstances, it seemed to the Government fair and right that the extra contribution should be paid by employees and others in work, such as the self-employed.<br/>
I listened with great interest to the point made by the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field), who courageously took issue with his hon. Friends who argued in favour of splitting the contribution half and half between employers and employees. The hon. Gentleman agreed with my hon. Friend the Member for Anglesey (Mr. Best), who argued for the burden being placed on employees. Before the hon. Member for Birkenhead gets to his feet, let me add that I appreciate that he said this was right provided that the base was altered. The base is settled by the pattern of the 1975 Act, and that base is not being altered in the Bill. However, he accepted the case that those in work should now bear the extra burden of financing the benefits for those not in work, whether they are old, unemployed or whatever.<br/>
I take profound issue with the hon. Member for Wood Green (Mr. Race), who said that this would have as much effect on employment as it would if we put the burden on employers. With great respect, that simply does not make economic sense. If we put extra burdens on the employers in the present circumstances, they would have an immediate effect on the level of employment. The hon. Member for Birkenhead certainly accepted that case. At a time when price margins are being squeezed, and when prices in the high streets show that competition is extremely fierce&#x2014;one can see that in the sales that take place week after week and month after month&#x2014;there is no possibility whatever of placing the burden on employers. The hon. Member for Wood Green is living in cloud-cuckoo-land&#x2014;the hon. Member for Barking (Miss Richardson) made the same point&#x2014;if he believes that if the impost is put on employers they will simply pass it on in higher prices. That would put their profit margins under still tighter pressure and lead inevitably to more people being laid off. For that reason, we felt that it would be wrong to put any part of this additional national insurance increase on to employers.</p>

<p>The Government have claimed that they have reduced taxes. In fact, in the first Budget that they brought before the House they reduced taxes for the wealthy. They have also imposed VAT on working people. Although working people have been told that there have been tax reductions, they will find a reduction in their take-home pay as a result of this increase in national insurance contributions, and that will lead to a feeling of injustice. Does not the right hon. Gentleman agree that when the tax and prices index which is issued by the Government shows the increase to be above 16 per cent., it will encourage workers to claim higher pay increases?</p>

<p>I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman. It may well be that unions will seek to use this as an argument in their negotiations for higher pay. However, in the mood of realism which is now dominating the pay scene in this country&#x2014;where the question of how much extra pay private and public sector employers can afford is the determining factor&#x2014;my guess is that this will have no significant impact on the level of pay increases that will be awarded.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State said that I had been living in cloud-cuckoo-land. Who is living in cloud-cuckoo-land? His Government have screwed employers' profit margins. His Government have undermined their profits. We are arguing for equity and fairness in the national insurance system.

<p>That is a totally different tune from the tune that the hon.

<p>May we return to the point that there could be a case for putting this increased charge on employees, if only the base could be changed? We have again heard from the Government that it could be changed but for the 1975 Act. Clearly, that Act came down Mount Sinai on tablets of stone, to be unchanged in any way. Will the Secretary of State tell the Committee what there is in the 1975 Act that would prevent people earning below &#x00A3;27, &#x00A3;28 or &#x00A3;29 a week from paying 1 or 2 per cent. of their-wages in contributions, and allowing&#x2014;as the Liberal amendment suggests&#x2014;a graduation up the income scale?</p>

<p>I shall deal with the Liberal amendment in a moment. I think the hon. Gentleman recognises the understanding that was reached in 1975 between the pension interests and the private sector. I should not use the phrase "private sector", because more public sector pension schemes are contracted out than private sector schemes. About 10 million employees are in pension schemes that have been contracted out on the basis of the structure that was agreed in the 1975 Act. The basis of that was a whole range of&#x2014;</p>

The hon. Member for Perry Barr asked what had happened to the &#x00A3;121 million charges foreshadowed in Last year's public expenditure White Paper. Those charges have not been made, and &#x00BC; per cent. of the increased contribution is required for making up the loss of revenue. Of the total, &#x00A3;100 million relates to England and, of that, &#x00A3;14 million relates to the income from sight tests. The Committee will remember Mat we dropped that proposal in response to objections from hon. Members.<br/>
The remainder relates to other charging proposals that have been abandoned or modified, such as that for further measures to recover the cost to the NHS of treating road accident victims. We still hope to bring forward shortly proposals for recovering more of the cost of the use of the NHS by foreign visitors. We shall be announcing details in due course. Much the largest item was the road accident proposal, for which no practical scheme has emerged.<br/>

Far from being &#x00A3;613 million, it was &#x00A3;25 million. For the hon.

<p>Despite the Secretary of State's excitable and lurid language, which almost rivals that of the Chief Secretary, who was rebuked by the Chair for swearing at Question Time, he ought to be fair to the Committee and give us details of the accumulated surplus in the national insurance fund this year and in 1977.</p>

<p>The important point about the accumulated surplus is that as a proportion of the outgo&#x2014;which is the key ratio&#x2014;it has been steadily declining year by year. The figures are given in paragraph 16 of the Government Actuary's report. In 1979&#x2013;80 the proportion was 36 per cent., in 1980&#x2013;81 it is 34 per cent. and in 1981&#x2013;82 it will be down to 30 per cent.

<p>Yes, but that is only about four months' outgo. As someone said, "There ain't no fund." It is a working balance, and it is absurd for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that we should cheerfully plan for a massive deficit.<br/>
I will not go into the obvious practical difficulties of adding yet another rate of contribution, which the amendment would involve. It would massively complicate the work not only of my Department but of every employer in the land. They would need three rates for their employees. The task of checking that and ensuring accuracy would be massive. I cannot advise the Committee to accept the amendment.<br/>
We shall come to the question of the Treasury supplement when we discuss the next clause. There is nothing sacrosanct about the size of the Treasury supplement. It has changed over the years. It has been over 34 per cent. and below 12 per cent. It has fluctuated between 15 per cent. and 20 per cent in the last six or seven years. We are spending billions of pounds more on non-contributory benefits, and the general taxpayer is thus making a bigger contribution to social welfare payments. It is, therefore, not unreasonable, when trying to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement, to shift an, additional part of the burden of financing the national insurance fund to the contributors and off the general body of taxpayers, and thus off borrowing.</p>

<p>With respect, I am speaking of the general level of public sector borrowing.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Ennals) will remember that the Select Committee criticised me in the summer because the changes made in the Social Security (No. 2) Act for reducing benefits in the next year or two did not affect the public sector borrowing requirement to the full amount of the cuts. We answered that argument by saying that it would depend on what happened to the contribution rates in November 1981. The right hon. Gentleman cannot complain if, in order that the changes in the national insurance fund feed through directly to the public sector borrowing requirement, a reduction is made in the Treasury supplement.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Norwich, North also argued that the increase for the National Health Service would not give rise to extra spending on the service. That comes rich from the Minister who presided over cuts of one-third in the total capital expenditure on the Health Service rather than move an inch on charges. We have said that we shall preserve entirely intact the growth of the National Health Service. We are right to ask the House and the country to pay a little more for it.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State has criticised me, and I must reply. He knows that when I was Secretary of State the general growth of revenue and capital in the National Health Service was faster than it has been since the present Government came to power There is no point in touching only upon capital and leaving revenue aside.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1789787" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1154.3" hansard_membership_id="6929" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32384" speakername="Mr. Jenkin" colnum="1154" time="21:45:00">
<p>The right hon. Gentleman cannot escape the fact that, rather than impose extra contributions and higher charges, he preferred to cut the programme. We do not do that.<br/>
I have the impression that the Committee is anxious to reach a conclusion. The changes that we are making in the clause&#x2014;which is at the heart of the Bill, as the hon. Member for Perry Barr said&#x2014;are realistic in the financial and economic circumstances. They are fair between different categories of our citizens. They put the burden upon people in work in order to preserve benefits


for people who are not in work and in order to preserve the Health Service. The changes are sufficient and necessary, in part to maintain the solvency of the national insurance fund.<br/>
Amendment No. 5, which would delete the subsection, amendment No. 6, the Liberal Party's elaborate and not very sensible plan, and amendments Nos. 7 and 9, which would shift part of the burden on to employers, are contrary to the best interests of the national insurance fund, the Health Service and the economy. Therefore, I cannot advise the Committee to accept them.</p>

<p>Perhaps the saddest aspect of tonight is the petty meanness of the Government's action. They face the biggest economic crisis for half a century, and what do they do? They take half of 1 per cent. from the workers alone; there is no half of 1 per cent. from the employers. They remove &#x00A3;1 billion from the workers' pockets to pay for the crisis that they themselves have caused.<br/>
The measures that the Government are taking are exacerbating the crisis. They found a short-term crisis&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am sorry about the outcome of the interruption. We were hoping that Conservative Members would join us in recognising that such Bills should not be rushed through the House. We should stop the debate now and return next week to discuss the Bill in a proper businesslike fashion. If I have to keep the Committee up until the early hours of the morning, it is the fault of the Government Front Bench.<br/>
One of the worst and saddest aspects of the Bill is that, in the face of the biggest economic crisis for 50 years&#x2014;I believe that it is more serious even than the crisis of the 1930s&#x2014;the best the Government can do is to extract yet another &#x00A3;1 billion out of the working people to deflate the economy. It is the meanness and pettiness of the action that annoys us as much as anything.<br/>
I was interested in the Secretary of State's reasons for this shambles of a method of dealing with the problem and pushing the Bill through tonight. He said that it was being done for mechanical reasons. He made a distinction between the problems with handling PAYE and those with national insurance contributions. He said that the measure had to go through tonight to get the tables in order. It does not have to go through tonight. If the Government want to take &#x00A3;1 billion out of the economy, they can do it through taxes. They do not do so because they are afraid. They made many promises to the country when they came to power to cut taxes. Even so, those cuts have been rendered nugatory by the indirect taxes that they have raised in an attempt to avoid raising direct taxes. There is no excuse for this shabby package being presented to us in this way.<br/>
The Bill has little to do with the National Health Service. It is an economic, a budgeting response and is not a matter of national insurance. By taking such measures, by trying to counter the crisis they have created for themselves largely by their deflationary methods, the Government have turned what could have been a short-term crisis of an interim cyclical recession into a major long-term decline. Measures such as this, petty as they are, are part of the package that has been destroying Britain's basic industrial economy. The Government must bear that in mind to understand some of our anger.<br/>
The Bill, purporting to be concerned with the national insurance fund but in reality a deflationary economic decision, is self-defeating. The Government have got themselves on a ratchet on which every measure they take creates yet another 100,000 unemployed, and every increase in unemployment leads to an increase in the public sector borrowing requirement. The very measures that they are taking to defeat inflation are therefore expanding the PSBR. If the Secretary of State disagrees with that, let him produce the figures for when his Government came to power and for now. The Government have increased the requirement.<br/>
The same applies to the money supply, with which the Government claim to have dealt. We say that the money supply is out of control, and they ask us why we are complaining because we do not believe in that type of policy. It is true that we do not, but they do. They regard it as the fount and origin of the actions they should carry out.<br/>
The Secretary of State spoke tonight about the new mood of realism among workers which, he said, would lead to lower wage settlements. The point was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mr. Race), who linked the Bill to the problem of wages. There is a new mood of realism, but it is the one referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) when he was quoting the speech by the Chief Secretary last night. We want a new mood of realism, and there it is. The

Chief Secretary is beginning to see the error of his ways, and he is one of the pundits in that area. The Secretary of State should follow suit.<br/>
In what way do we regard this measure as being not only unnecessary but unjust? Let us compare it with the other financial measures taken by the Government during the past 18 months. In the first Budget, they fulfilled their promise by cutting &#x00A3;4&#x00BD; billion of direct taxation, of which 37 per cent.&#x2014;more than one-third&#x2014;went to the richest 7 per cent. of the community. That is a redistribution of wealth with a vengeance. There was little justice in that. There might have been some economic argument for it if that top 7 per cent. had used the money for investment. They did not, and nor will they, because the other aspect of the Government's policy, the high bank rate and the level of the pound, have rendered nugatory even that release of resources to the investing class.<br/>
That increase in finances was at the expense of the workers' pockets. They are being soaked again to deal with the immediate crisis. They had to pay for that increase in the form of value added tax, savage cuts in the social wage and other proposals. We were told that the Government needed to take &#x00A3;1 billion out of the economy to save Britain. It is &#x00A3;1 billion from working people. Yet this week, on the basis of the Rayner proposals, the Secretary of State&#x2014;for a paltry &#x00A3;50 million as against this &#x00A3;1 billion crisis&#x2014;changed the method of allocation of money to working and other mothers in proposals for the child benefit allowance.<br/>
The Government do not understand how people live. Members on the Government side do not live, as do many Labour Members, with the problems of poverty. As an indication of the rise of poverty in Britain, let us consider the voluntary action of women drawing child benefit. They can draw it weekly, fortnightly, three-weekly or four-weekly. In the past year, the numbers drawing child benfit weekly increased by more than one-third. In June 1979, 35 per cent. drew the benefit weekly. In June 1980, the figure was 45 per cent. That increase of one-third is a direct indication of the strain that is being put not only on the poor but on many others. The 45 per cent. goes well beyond the 20 per cent. that the Government talk about in the peculiar view that they have of the poor in Britain as a caste that must be identified by family income supplement or something else. That 45 per cent. includes reasonably well-off working families. Yet they need to take that voluntary action. It is a nuisance to draw the benefit weekly. It is an indication of the poverty in Britain.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) pointed out that workers earning &#x00A3;40 per week at 1979 prices would keep only 62&#x00B7;25p of every additional pound that they earned. They lose at &#x00A3;40 per week. They have dropped from keeping 68p to keeping only 62p. On the other hand, those earning &#x00A3;500 per week, who a year before could keep only 17p in the pound, can now keep 40p. That more than doubles the amount going into the pockets of the rich. There is a direct loss to the pockets of the poor through taxation.<br/>
That is the background against which we must consider the measure before us. Let us consider the arguments in favour of it. One argument was that it would produce incentives. Where is the incentive in the Bill? The Government are increasing contributions on the one hand, and on the other hand they are maintaining the lower limits at which contributions begin. Instead of increasing the incentives for people to work, they are almost deliberately


creating disincentives. They are putting more people into the poverty trap and keeping them there. There will be little incentive for them to do other than campaign even more for higher wages.<br/>
The Bill purports to be about social security, but it is nothing of the kind. It is a Bill about taxation. It is a Bill about the failure of the Government to deal with the economic crisis which they themselves have largely created. It results from the Government's own decision to increase taxes. They were afraid to increase direct taxes. What they have done instead is to call for a further contribution from the workers.<br/>
Incidentally. Mr. Crawshaw, this has nothing whatever to do with the discussion that we shall be having&#x2014;no doubt in the early hours of the morning&#x2014;on the relative proportions of the Treasury allocation and contributions within the national insurance fund. Basically, the Bill is merely raising money.<br/>
It is said that the Bill can partly be excused on the ground that &#x00BC; per cent. is given in the unemployment sector. We might have forgiven that &#x00BC; per cent. if it had been allocated between employees and employers. The Government have created more than 2 million unemployed. Having created 2 million unemployed&#x2014;</p>

<p>The gist of the hon. Gentleman's remarks is that revenue which would be available under the Bill for pensions and other benefits and for the National Health Service will not now be available, according to the argument that he is using. If he accepts that&#x2014;and he must, in view of what he said&#x2014;where is he to raise the money? Is he to increase personal direct taxation? If so, candour requires that he should tell the Committee frankly that that is his proposition.</p>

<p>Order. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was in the Chamber when the Chairman made some comments about debating where money is to be raised. I am sure that it is not a necessary part of the Opposition's case to say where it is to be raised. It is for the Opposition to press the amendment. I say this because the debate has been getting so wide as to cover every aspect of policy. It is no part of this Committee stage to be debating where the money would be raised. It is a matter of saying whether it is appropriate to raise it in this particular way.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Crawshaw. There are one or two Conservative Members who are sniggering about this matter. You have been reiterating a position that you made clear earlier when those hon.

<p>I am always in support of the Chair. I should very much have liked to suggest ideas, such as increasing the ceiling on contributions. I might even have been tempted to mention the word "defence", but, since you say that it is out of order, Mr. Crawshaw, I shall not mention it. I might even have said that we could reverse the taxation concept here in order to tax the rich to help the poor. But, again, since it is out of order, I shall not, of course, deal with it.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that working people are concerned with their take-home pay and that it is kidology for the Government to try to tell people that they are reducing taxation when they are moving the burden from direct to indirect taxation? We recall that in their first Budget the Government gave massive concessions to the wealthy. Now, they are proceeding to increase the national insurance contributions of the less-well-off, the low-paid. The workers know this when they look at their take-home pay.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1789807" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1162.1" hansard_membership_id="1833" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11585" speakername="Mr. Buchan" colnum="1162" time="22:30:00">
<p>My hon. Friend has put it more succinctly than I have been able to do in the past 20 minutes or so. It is not only the working people who see these contributions as tax. Conservative Members also see them as a tax. The Secretary of State said:
<q>Strictly speaking, the sums involved here are not taxation, but I suspect that for most people increasingly their national insurance contributions have more the quality of taxation than they used to do".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 5 December 1978; Vol. 959, c. 1369]</q>
The right hon. Gentleman accepts that. The Secretary of State for Trade raised a point of order. Conservatives seem to do a lot of their work through points of order. Perhaps we should learn from them. In 1976 the right hon. Gentleman claimed that the increases in national insurance were a "pure tax increase". I could not have put it better myself.<br/>
The Minister for Social Security is missing. Where is Reg? I was looking forward to seeing him. Perhaps he is having a day off. Perhaps his old conscience has surfaced. The right hon. Gentleman said:
<q>If we reduce the expenditure from the rational insurance fund and if the contribution is also reduced&#x2014;I am saying 'if because other factors come into it"&#x2014;</q>
our Reg is a careful lad&#x2014;
<q>we are still fulfilling the objective of reducing taxation because national insurance contributions are a form of tax.</q>
That is how the Government see it.<br/>
Therefore, we are right to argue that, if it is a tax, it should have been introduced in that form. That would have been fairer. We object to the way in which the Government are dealing with this crisis. They are not helping the National Health Service. The cuts will still be there. Those who work as hospital cleaners will still come to our surgeries. The Bill will not raise money for the NHS.<br/>
Several objections can be made to the Government's method. They have undermined the people's faith and have attacked their confidence in the social insurance principle. They have increased contributions when the benefits that they are supposedly funding art being savagely cut. Benefits of every variety are being cut, including short-term benefits, such as those for sickness, invalidity, industrial injury and unemployment.<br/>
The Government are not content with merely breaking the connection between pensions and earnings or prices, whichever is the higher. We have been forced to accept the connection with prices. If my light hon. and hon. Friends and the leader-writers are right, the Cabinet meeting was a close-run thing. As I said on Tuesday, it was only the "wets" who saved the Government's face. Instead, the Government want to set pensions 1 per cent. lower than inflation. What for? Do they want to drive all our 75-year-olds out to work? What is the point? The only motive is meanness.</p>

<p>I thought that I was sticking more to the real nature and purpose of the Bill than did the Secretary of State. I am dealing with the reasons for and the purpose and effect of the Bill.<br/>
This measure cannot do anything but damage regard for the social insurance principle if the Government persist in increasing contributions when the benefits are being savagely cut.<br/>
There are other reasons why we object to specific parts of the Bill. My amendment seeks to wipe out the 1 per cent. impost. Therefore, it must be in order. The second objection is that the proposal is unjust. Income tax is paid on both earned and unearned income. National insurance contributions are paid only on earned income. Therefore, the workers and some sections of management will pay, and not those who live on interest, dividends and rents.<br/>
Income tax has a threshold before one starts to pay. That is not so with these contributions. Contributions begin at &#x00A3;27 a week, which is close to the supplementary benefit level for a single person. Income tax is paid at higher rates if one is better off and can afford it. But these contributions are not paid on earnings above a certain ceiling. I was asked about money. Here is one way in which we can look at money. We could remove the ceiling of &#x00A3;200 a week. After all, that is &#x00A3;10,000 a year. Should not that ceiling have been raised or even wiped out in favour of a graduated return in benefits following that?<br/>
There are other ways of dealing with this matter. At the moment, it is unjust&#x2014;even in the Bill it is unjust&#x2014;because those who are paying at the bottom end&#x2014;my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) will keep my figures right on this aspect&#x2014;will have the limit raised by 22 per cent., whereas the ceiling is raised by only 17 per cent. Have I got it right?</p>

<speech hansard_id="1789812" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1163.4" hansard_membership_id="1833" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11585" speakername="Mr. Buchan" colnum="1163" time="22:30:00">
<p>My hon. Friend is quite right; it is the other way round. The floor has been lifted by 22 per cent., so people are being brought in at &#x00A3;27 a week; but the other end of the scale has not been lifted by an equivalent figure. I have never claimed to be numerate, but I understand this. The imbalance between the two figures means that the poor are clobbered and the rich get richer.<br/>
This proposal is unfair also because income tax is graduated&#x2014;higher earners pay more tax&#x2014;but national insurance contributions are partly flat rate. By the way, this also affects the friends and supporters of the self-employed. It is a flat rate for the poorer self-employed and, for that matter, the better-off self-employed whom the Conservative Party wooed so assiduously at the election.<br/>
I do not want to go much further, although I think that some of my hon. Friends will want to comment on what I and the Secretary of State have said. I should like to finish by quoting from an article by David Wyn Williams in <i>New Society:</i>
<q>National insurance contributions have been quietly converted into a second income tax.</q>

He then goes on to analyse why they are more unfair than income tax:
<q>Thus in each of these ways, the present rates of national insurance contributions go a considerable way to negate the complex adjustments whereby the income tax system seeks to work social justice between differing taxpayers on account of differing commitments, needs, and sources of income. If the regressive effects of VAT and the other expenditure taxes were brought into the analysis".</q>
The thing has become even more unfair because of the overburden of these taxes.<br/>
We shall shortly be discussing the relationship between the taxation element of the national insurance fund in relation to the contributions. For the moment, we reject this part of the clause, and I call upon hon. Members on all sides&#x2014;because there must still be some "wets" here even at 10.40 pm&#x2014;to vote with us.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1789813" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1164.0" hansard_membership_id="93" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2692" speakername="Mr. Field" colnum="1164" time="22:30:00">
<p>I rise once again to draw attention to the unsatisfactory nature of the Secretary of State's reply. I want to draw his attention to three points. If I am brief, it may encourage him to respond in a more positive manner than he has done so far.<br/>
I turn to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mr. Race) about the Conservative Party's election manifesto, particularly that part which dealt with the high marginal rates of taxation. The Conservative election manifesto was quite clear on this point. It said that high marginal rates of tax operated at the top and the bottom. What we are partly discussing this evening is how effectively, or otherwise, the Government have delivered on that pledge in respect of those on the bottom.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Fife, Central (Mr. Hamilton) did not make full use of the Low Pay Unit brief, I direct the Secretary of State's attention to the figures that it gives for changes in the marginal rates of tax for those at the top and the bottom. For those on the 83 per cent. marginal tax rate when the Government came into power, the rate has been reduced to 60 per cent. If I am right, that is a reduction of just more than 20 per cent. But for those earning around &#x00A3;40 a week there has been an increase in the marginal rates from 31&#x00B7;5 percent. to 37&#x00B7;5 percent.&#x2014;a 6&#x00B7;25 per cent. increase. If that is taken over the base, it is something like a 20 per cent. increase in their marginal rates of tax.<br/>
We have tabled these amendments to draw attention to that fact that while the Government have delivered in respect of high-rate taxpayers&#x2014;because they believe that it was important&#x2014;the exact opposite has occurred for the low-paid, although both groups were bound together in the same pledge in the Conservative election manifesto. I am sure that the Committee would be grateful to hear a reasoned reply from the Secretary of State about how he squares that election promise with the reality. If it was good enough for those on high pay, why was not that election promise good enough for those on low pay?<br/>
Secondly, I want to develop a little further the main point of the Liberal Party's amendment. It was said that if we adopted that proposal, or a much more modest one that I floated but did not table, given the fact that we accepted how regressive the national insurance contribution was&#x2014;starting from each pound once one had crossed the national insurance threshold&#x2014;there might be a case for graduating the contribution for those on low pay. We were told that that was not on, because it would somehow violate the covenant that was made between the


parties in the House and between the House and pension schemes in the private sector. That does not stand up to reason. What private pension scheme will object because the House has decided that the regressive national insurance poll tax should be lessened for those at the bottom of the pile?<br/>
Earlier this evening we failed to raise the floor of the national insurance contributions, which was a way of helping low-paid workers, particularly women, who constitute the majority of low-paid workers. We were told by the Secretary of State that that would have covered a mere 200,000 workers. If his figures are right, the number would be equal to the electorate of Daventry, Wallasey and Wanstead. That is the size of the group that was affected adversely by the amendments that were rejected earlier.<br/>
10.45 pm<br/>
We ate trying to retrieve part of that position now by making sure that either some groups of workers&#x2014;the lower-paid workers&#x2014;have a lower rate of national insurance contribution or there is no increase in the national insurance contribution. Will the Secretary of State turn his mind to that point" Does he maintain that if the national insurance contribution were made fairer for the low-paid, the pension funds would be in revolt? If there is to be a further increase in the national insurance contribution next year&#x2014;as no doubt there will be&#x2014;and if the right hon. Gentleman expects hon. Members from both sides of the House to support him, as I do, in an increase only for employees, there is a duty on all of us to ensure that the regressiveness of the tax is less for those on low pay.<br/>
Thirdly, I should like to draw the Committee's attention to the increases in national insurance contributions, which are not classified as taxation increases in a technical sense, and to the reason why, in the past, we have not viewed national insurance increases as increases in taxation. No previous Government have increased the contributions and in the same benefit year planned reductions in benefits. It would have been easy for Governments to say that this was an insurance scheme and that they were asking for contributions because there would be increased benefits.<br/>
We are now at the stage when there will be increased contributions and less benefits. We should view that as an increase in taxation and discuss ways of raising it more fairly if the Secretary of State will not meet our points about the regressiveness of the tax and how it affects workers on low pay&#x2014;particularly women workers, who compose the army of the low-paid. The more he stubbornly refuses to meet us on these points, the more difficult it is. I apologise for returning to the same point, but it is crucial. If, in the next few years, there is no growth, people will have to face sensibly the question of financing the Welfare State. We must get them to consider how they can spread their lifetime earnings of 40 years over a lifetime of about 80 years. We shall never be able to get that argument on the road if at the time that we are increasing contributions we are cutting benefits.<br/>
I should like to emphasise before you leave us, Mr. Crawshaw&#x2014;I hope only temporarily&#x2014;that I am asking the Secretary of State to respond sensibly and seriously to our points about the difference in the Government's election promises and their performance in fulfilling them. They have reduced the high marginal tax rates for the rich, but they have increased them for the poor, although they

promised effective action to reduce the marginal tax rates for the poor. Does the Secretary of State seriously maintain that if we did something to mitigate the hardship on the lowest-paid the pension funds would clamour round and lobby and jostle him on his way to his office at the Elephant and Castle tomorrow morning? Does he maintain that this is not an increase in taxation when, at the same time, he is cutting benefits?</p>

<p>We were disappointed with the Secretary of State's reply, because he seemed more concerned to sit down at 10 o'clock than to answer our questions. We wanted to know more about the &#x00BC; per cent. that is being requested because of the problems of unemployment. I asked whether it was all necessary for the unemployed or whether more people were coming on to pensions. The right hon. Gentleman did not enlighten us.<br/>
The Secretary of State reiterated his belief in the so-called deal that he claims was reached on an agreed policy for pensions. He does not accept that he tore up the deal last year when he took away the link with earnings. The whole basis of the deal was that there would be a steady increase in pensions, because pensioners would get the benefit of rises in line with prices or earnings, whichever was the greater&#x2014;the ratchet effect. That was an essential part of the deal. The right hon. Gentleman cannot change the rules and claim that the deal still exists.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman did not say much about amendments Nos. 7 and 9. He did not answer our question whether the burden could have been shifted on to the employer rather than the employee. He did not give us the breakdown of the incidence of the burdens on the two groups. There is some evidence that the low-paid may benefit a little if the onus is placed on employers rather than on employees. The Secretary of State should have explained why the amendments are unacceptable.<br/>
We may be at fault on amendment No. 8, because we have not spent much time discussing it. It draws attention to the fact that if the Government's case were that payments had to go up because extra benefits were being paid, only the &#x00BC; per cent. increase would be needed. As we have pointed out, individual claimants will get less in real terms in future. In that case, the Government's only argument can be that more people will be receiving benefits. I suppose that they will be the increasing numbers of unemployed for whom the Government are planning.<br/>
The other &#x00BE; per cent. involves nothing but the Government's monetary policies&#x2014;a saving on Exchequer NHS contributions and other Treasury money-saving decisions. The &#x00BE; per cent. has nothing to do with the national insurance principle. If the Minister will not accept amendment No. 5 to delete the whole clause, he ought to agree that the only portion for which he has a case is the &#x00BC; per cent. for the unemployed and pensioners. I hope that he will tell us how much is needed for extra pensions and how much for increased unemployment.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State failed to answer a number of questions raised by the Opposition. While you were out of the Chair, Mr. Godman Irvine, several Conservative Members raised, in a rather jeering manner, the issue of alternative sources of income, and I had to point out that I had spent some time setting out what I thought should be the alternatives. It is important to present a credible alternative when one says that a clause should be removed.<br/>
It is true that the Secretary of State did not go down that road, but he did say that the money was necessary for, among other things, the maintenance of the National Health Service, and he had an altercation with my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Ennals) about the relative position under the present Government. But everyone understands perfectly well the situation of the NHS&#x2014;that it is facing grave difficulties and that the position of the Government is not that they want to maintain the NHS but that they are quite happy to see it eroded. They welcome private schemes and private hospitals and a shift of resources from the public to the private sector. I thought that the Secretary of State's claim that the money was needed for the NHS was particularly weak, especially as we know that a very small proportion of this revenue is likely to find its way there in any event.<br/>
The other point that the right hon. Gentleman answered rather inadequately was the question of the 6 per cent. It was pointed out to him that the Government have a policy of a 6 per cent. imposition to limit wages in the public sector and yet wage earners will find that they have a 14 per cent. increase in their rate of national insurance contributions, if these amendments are not carried, at a time when we are facing an annual inflation rate of about 15 or 16 per cent. The increase in contributions is an increase in taxation, as was demonstrated by my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan), who pointed out that many hon. Members, not from the Labour Benches but from the Conservative Benches, have referred again and again to these national insurance charges as being a tax.<br/>
This rate of tax increase is very high indeed and simply does not square with the Conservatives' much-vaunted claim, in their manifesto, that they would reduce taxation for those at the lowest and the highest levels of income. They have simply said "This is not a tax", but the Secretary of State must accept that the rate of increase in the national insurance contribution under subsection (2) is about 14 per cent. That really is a very large increase, and it is contrary to the Conservative manifesto.<br/>
The only way in which the right hon. Gentleman can justify it is by saying that it is not a tax but simply a national insurance surcharge. But the effect of removing money from a wage packet is exactly the same, whether one calls it a surcharge, a contribution or a tax. It is a wholesale breach of the Conservatives' commitment, and it would be far and away better if the Government admitted it and said "We will restore some of the cuts that we made on the marginal rates of the rich"&#x2014;they were massive cuts&#x2014;"in order to give ourselves a proper, fairer and progressive source of taxation" rather than use this blunt instrument to raise the money.</p>

<p>No doubt the Secretary of State will cavil about the wording, but on page 14 the Conservative manifesto said:
<q>We must therefore be prepared to switch to some extent from taxes on earnings to taxes on spending.</q>
That was used to justify the increase in value added tax, but I think that it is clear that tonight we are talking about a tax on earnings.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed. My hon. Friend confirms the precise principle of what I was saying&#x2014;that the Bill represents a clear breach of that commitment; and I hope that the message goes out clearly to all those who were lured into voting Conservative. I must say that they are

very thin on the ground these days. Not many people admit that they voted Conservative, and those who admit it do so with a shamefaced, grudging attitude, recognising the disastrous policies that the Government have been following.<br/>
11 pm<br/>
The Secretary of State is increasing the contributions on behalf of the Treasury. We learn from leaks that he is an enthusiastic supporter of the Treasury view, proffering cuts in his Department without any pressure. At the same time, there is a 5 per cent. cut in benefits. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has said that if one wills the end one must will the means. The end is not quite the system that the Government inherited from the Labour Government; it is a diminishing end. Therefore, it represents a very bad bargain&#x2014;contributions increased by 14 per cent. and a reduction in benefits of 5 per cent. If that were done by an insurance company, the organisers might well find themselves without many supporters and, depending on their prospectus, facing criminal charges. The Conservatives' prospectus claimed the reverse of what is happening.<br/>
The Chief Secretary is one of the few thinkers in the Cabinet. <i>The Guardian,</i> thanks to a mole among Conservative Back Benchers, tells us that he is now veering away from the targets. His is the right view. If the Conservatives are to prevent the present crisis enveloping us&#x2014;the crisis that is the reason for raising &#x00A3;1 billion under the clause&#x2014;they will have to be much more flexible and cease being so oppressive to the person least able to withstand their oppression, the ordinary wage earner.<br/>
The Secretary of State said that it was necessary to have the &#x00A3;1 billion. We have shown that the Government's means are not the only ones open. They are adopting them because they are a narrow-minded, petty Government of the rich, by the rich and for the rich. That is why they do not adopt a progressive taxation system. They prefer to put the burden on the backs of the poor.<br/>
That is why we oppose the clause and support the amendments. I hope that even at this late stage the Secretary of State will say that the Government are considering alternative ways of raising the &#x00A3;1 billion.</p>

<p>It would be remiss of Opposition Members not to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) on his excellent speech. I am sure that all Labour Members hope that he will make a number of such scathing attacks on the Government over the next few months and in due course make some speeches from the Government Dispatch Box.<br/>
We must address ourselves to the Government's arguments for the 1 per cent. increase in the employee's national insurance contribution. As we all know, as we all read the newspapers, the increase was decided upon after a long discussion in the Cabinet about the way in which the Government would raise money for the public service and in particular to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement. It is clear from the Secretary of State's Second Reading speech that the Government's intention was simply to provide money for that purpose.<br/>
No doubt the Cabinet discussed alternative methods of financing the PSBR other than the proposals that are set out in the clause. If there were arguments in the Cabinet about the ways in which such a substantial sum could be raised, it is right for the Committee to discuss the


alternatives and to draw attention to the way in which the Government might deal with the situation in which they find themselves.<br/>
Every time the unemployed increase by 100,000, the net cost to the PSBR is about &#x00A3;440 million. That is the figure produced not by the Labour Party research department but by the Library in an excellent document on the cost of unemployment. I have no doubt that the 1 per cent. increase in employees' contributions that is called for in the Bill is a direct and inevitable consequence of the Government's policy of allowing unemployment to rip ahead. The more that it rips ahead, the more Bills like this we shall get and the more the Secretary of State will be forced by his Cabinet colleagues to activate the sections in the Social Security (No. 2) Act 1980 that allow for the 5 per cent. cut in unemployment and other benefits in the next financial year as well as in this year.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) drew attention to the increases in employees' contributions hat have been called for at a time when benefits are being out. The No. 2 Act is on the statute book, and I have no doubt that in due course the Cabinet will be discussing whether the relevant sections are to be activated and whether benefits will be cut again in the next financial year.<br/>
The political purpose of the clause is clear. It is to fund the Government's central objective, which is to allow unemployment to rise. They will allow the pressure in the labour market to depress wages and to attack the real living standards: of ordinary working people. That is the only way in which they can pursue heir policy of reducing the power of labour in the overall economy.<br/>
The impact of such a change in the economy is bound to be substantially deflationary. National insurance contributions from employees or employers have an effect on the level of economic activity and on the level of employment in certain industries. The clawing back of &#x00A3;1,000 million from taxpayers is bound to increase unemployment substantially. It is a straightforward piece of economic deflation.<br/>
The Committee would be right to delete the clause. However, I refer to amendment No. 6, the Liberal amendment, which raises an important principle that the Committee should discuss fully. At what point, if any, should the national insurance system be based on the level of earnings of a particular employee? We have a floor and a ceiling, and between those two points the national insurance system tends to work on a uniform basis irrespective of the level of earnings of the individual.<br/>
Great play has rightly been made with the argument that the national insurance system is regressive and favours the well-off at the expense of the low-paid. The Liberal amendment seeks to reduce the regressive effects of a national insurance system, if we are to have one at all, by allowing the existing rate of employees' contributions to be levied on those who receive less than &#x00A3;85 a week and the new rate to be levied on those with incomes in excess of that sum.<br/>
Why has the Liberal Party chosen &#x00A3;85 as the cut-off point? If a system of graduated national insurance employees' contributions is operated, there is a great deal of sense in having a number of bands activated at different income cut-off points. For example, there would be a case for having a contribution band clearly linked to those groups in receipt of or eligible for certain State benefits, such as family income supplement. There could be a lower

rate band of employees' contribution for a certain range of incomes. There could then be a series of bands of income contributions at higher earnings levels. If we are to have a progressive system of contributions, there should be a series of cut-off points that could be specified by Parliament and changed in accordance with changing circumstances.<br/>
However, for the life of me I cannot understand why the Liberal Party has chosen &#x00A3;85 as the cut-off point. It does not relate to the average earnings of the male full-time worker, which at the last count in the new earnings survey were about &#x00A3;125. Presumably it is an attempt to deal with the problems of the low-paid, but the level does not relate to the level of State benefits or the number of people in particular income bands.<br/>
If we cannot get the progressive changes that are required in the national insurance system, we should delete the clause and throw the political football right back to the Government to sort out. We should tell them that we do not want that form of extra taxation on the low-paid and workers generally. If they want to solve the problems of the economy, they should solve them in a totally different way and not by imposing further inordinate burdens on ordinary working people.</p>

<p>One point not touched on by my colleagues causes me concern. With increasing unemployment, there is a danger of increasing social division. The Government's presentation of the increase in national insurance contributions may, either inadvertently or deliberately, be seeking to provoke enmity between the unemployed and people in work.<br/>
In his mini-Budget on 24 November, the Chancellor said about the national insurance fund:
<q>Thirdly, the fund at present receives a substantial contribution from the general taxpayer through the Treasury supplement.&#x2026; In these circumstances, it is right that those in work should shoulder directly a larger share of the cost of contributory benefits."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 24 November 1980; Vol. 994, c. 316.]</q>
11.15 pm<br/>
Ministers in the Treasury, and especially Ministers in the Department of Health and Social Security, constantly go on about scroungers and proudly announce that they have appointed more and more people to sort out scrounging among social security claimants. We may be witnessing an attempt by the Government to cause those who are in work and whose incomes are reduced to become antipathetic about the level of unemployment benefit paid to those whom the Government are driving to the dole. In that sense, the Bill sows the seeds of an unpleasant social division.<br/>
Our stand stems not so much from the content of the Bill but from the way in which it is being presented by the Government and the nature and history of those who have devised that form of presentation. That is a further reason why the Committee should support the amendment in its attempt to reject that concept lock, stock and barrel.</p>

<p>I beg to move amendment No. 10, in page 1, line 16, leave out subsection (3).<br/>
I suggest that the size of -be Conservative side of the Committee will reach 100 before we disappear. [HON. MEMBERS: "Rubbish."] It may be that some other Conservative Members have joined our proceedings, because, apart from the hon. Member for Somerset, North (Mr. Dean), no Conservative Member has so far taken part.<br/>
The amendment seeks to leave out subsection (3). It may be that Conservative Members do not know I do not intend to read them a lecture, but I should tell them that it puts am impost on widows and married women.<br/>
I have looked through the Conservative manifesto to see what was said about national insurance benfits, especially in regard to widows and married women. There was nothing. However, I found a quotation at the front by the nurse of the nation which said:
<q>For me, the heart of politics is not political theory, it is people and how they want to live their lives.</q>
It is signed by the Prime Minister. Given that since they came to power the Government have cut widows' benefit&#x2014;slipped in through the Social Security (No. 2) Act earlier this year&#x2014;I accept that we are now talking about a residual number of women who are still locked into the old married women's option scheme under the national insurance system. By and large, they are married women and widows. The Government now propose a 37 per cent. increase in their national insurance contribution. That is a large increase. It is larger in percentage terms than the one to which my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) referred previously. By any stretch of the imagination, a 37 per cent. increase takes a little beating, even under this Government.</p>

<p>It is not my job to give answers from the Dispatch Box. That is the job of Ministers.<br/>
I want to ask the Minister a few questions. If she can answer them, we can reach a speedy conclusion to this debate. This is a quite narrow subject by any definition. The increase is from 2 per cent. to 2&#x00B7;75 per cent. [HON. MEMBERS: "How much is that?"] It depends on the earnings of the married woman. I should have thought that that was obvious. In an earnings-related scheme, the amount paid would depend on the earnings between the upper and lower income limits.<br/>
If the hon. and learned Member for Thanet, West (Mr. Rees-Davies) had been present earlier, he would probably have been able to work out examples for himself. For the purposes of this debate, however, it does not matter. The fact is that the rate is being changed for the first time in five years. It has been 2 per cent. since 1975. <i>[Interruption.]</i> One Conservative Member says that it is 2 per cent. of nothing, and another says that that is no reason for keeping it there for ever.<br/>
We have to look at what the women get for the payment. The number of national insurance benefits that a married woman or widow can obtain for paying the option is limited in the extreme. One is industrial injury benefit, but that is being cut by the Government in the Social Security (No. 2) Act. There is no evidence that more married women and widows paying the small stamp are suffering industrial injuries and creating an impost on the national insurance fund that requires this sort of


increase. If there is evidence, will the Minister give it to the Committee? Given the limited range of benefits, there has to be a rational reason for such a large increase. It could have been &#x00BC; per cent., and we could have accepted that because it is in line with the figure we accept for the Government's forecast of increased unemployment. We want to know why there is such a large increase.<br/>
I do not know how many married women and widows are still in this twilight area. The numbers are declining. There must be fewer each year, because no woman now entering the labour market is allowed to opt for this small payment. How much extra money will the Government raise from this declining band of married women and widows by this increase in the option that they pay?<br/>
How much is involved? How much will be raised, and why is there such a large increase, bearing in mind that one of the major benefits to which these people are entitled is being cut? Subject to the Minister's reply, I shall leave the matter there.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1789841" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1179.0" hansard_membership_id="93" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2692" speakername="Mr. Field" colnum="1179" time="22:30:00">
<p>I am sorry that the Secretary of State is not in his place, because I wanted to address some questions directly to him, partly linked to ideas that he put forward before the election. I wanted to make that link not to taunt him but to show that some of those ideas, had they been followed through, might have stood him in good stead in answering the questions posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker).<br/>
Before the election, the Secretary of State was in favour of the idea of having what are called family impact statements in every Bill. In other words, just as we have a financial statement in the Bill, the Bill would carry a statement saying how families and different members of families would be affected by the changes that are proposed.<br/>
A number of measures that the Government have proposed and carried through during this Parliament have been favourable to single people and harmful to families. One of the interesting points about the national insurance scheme is that some aspects of it are favourable to women and children. Had we persuaded the Secretary of State to follow through his idea &#x2014; his interest was second to none before the election&#x2014;to preface all major Bills and departmental documents with impact statements, he would have been in a better position to answer the questions that my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr has raised. What sort of deal is the group that opted for the married women's option &#x2014; a dying breed in the national insurance scheme&#x2014;gaining from the scheme? Are the benefits that they receive so much greater than those of others in the scheme, particularly other women, that an increase in contribution was due?<br/>
It is sad that we do not have that information. We have been pincered into a debate in which we can consider only the distributional impact of increased contributions. The debate has been one-sided. We have considered only the groups on which contributions are bearing heaviest and most unfairly. If we had information about who benefits most from the national insurance scheme, we could make more sense of the argument about whether the increased contributions are fair.<br/>
12 midnight<br/>
What do the dying breed of women who have taken the so-called married woman's option get from the national

insurance scheme, compared with other groups of women who pay the full contribution? Is it so disproportionately unfair that it is reasonable to ask them to pay a 35 per cent. increase in their contribution? With that information, we could make better progress.<br/>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will tell her right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that if one of his comments before the election had borne fruit afterwards, so that we had family impact statements on major Bills and Government statements, we should be better able to answer the pertinent questions asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1789842" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1180.0" hansard_membership_id="336" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11431" speakername="Miss Richardson" colnum="1180" time="22:30:00">
<p>I was startled at the start of the debate to hear groans from the Government Benches and a Conservative Member saying "Oh, it is so boring." I wish that the married women and widows whom we are discussing and whose national insurance contributions are being increased by 37&#x00BD; per cent. had heard that remark. When we get such comments from the Government Benches, I sometimes wish that our late-night debates were broadcast live. Many would be ear-openers.<br/>
We need to know how many married women still exercise the option and how many widows are involved. The numbers must be small, because married women are now paying the full stamp. Those whom we are discussing must inevitably be older women who are probably on low earnings. The increase from 2 per cent. to 2.75 per cent. will have a disproportionate impact on them because of their low wages.<br/>
The Secretary of State said on Second Reading that married women who opted for the lower-rate contribution were still getting a good bargain. I do not know whether that is the right way to describe it. We are instructing those women that they must pay more tax, and they will not regard that as a good bargain.<br/>
I have always wanted to get married women away from this optional small contribution because I did not feel that it was the right way for them to be treated&#x2014;indeed, not the right way for the whole concept of married women's earnings, contributions and taxation to be treated.<br/>
I hope that the Under-Secretary of State will be able to give us some facts and figures which will enable us to judge a little more accurately than we are now able to do precisely what the problem is. She might also care to give us an averaging of what some of the earnings might be of married women who fall into this category.<br/>
We have been talking about the fact that married women on the whole, with very few exceptions, earn very much less than men, even when doing similar jobs, I am sorry to say. It would be interesting to know whether the hon. Lady has some figures which would enable us to judge the situation properly.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1789843" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1180.1" hansard_membership_id="310" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3487" speakername="Mr. David Winnick" colnum="1180" time="22:30:00">
<p>I support the amendment. It is particularly vindictive that this substantial increase of 37 per cent. should take place, for undoubtedly it will hit most those married women and widows who are among the poorest in the community. On Second Reading, the Secretary of State gave no justification for the increase, apart from the fact that there had been no increase since 1975. That was it&#x2014;there has been no increase since 1975, so this sum of money should be raised.<br/>
When one compares the manner in which the richer sections of the community have been well rewarded by this


Government, it makes one extremely angry that again it is the poor, the elderly and all those who can least defend themselves who are being made the object of such an attack.<br/>
I am justified in pointing out again that in the Government's first Budget 37 per cent. of the tax reduction went to the top 7 per cent. in the community, while this year 14 per cent. went to the top 2 per cent. Those figures are hardly in dispute. If the Government's case is that there is really no alternative but to raise this sum of money, our question is simple. Why not take it from those who have been so well rewarded by the Government? Why take it from the poorest?<br/>
Does the Under-Secretary of State dispute that those who will be hardest hit by the clause are the sort of people we have been referring to? Will she deny that, in the main, they are the poorest amongst the wage earners? They contracted out because of their low incomes, because they wanted to retain more money, for the most obvious of reasons. It is therefore extremely unfair that this section of the community should be penalised.<br/>
Perhaps one of the reasons why the Tories are now in Government instead of the Labour Party, and with such a large majority, was the promise to reduce taxation. It would be wrong for me as a Labour politician to deny that the propaganda by the Tories worked very well. Many of my constituents who did not vote for me were perhaps swayed by the promise that under a Conservative Governments their taxes would be reduced. But when I ask people now "How much better off are you as a result of the tax cuts which have taken place?" they laugh. They are not better off at all.<br/>
At least some of my constituents have gained from the reduction in direct taxation, but it has been offset by the increase in indirect taxation, so there is no net gain. I sometimes try to persuade my hon. Friends that we should use this fact to show that a reduction in direct taxation does not help the average person.<br/>
I hope that the Under-Secretary will give us much more information. How many people are involved? Is it not true that they are mainly the elderly and the poorer sections of society? How much money will be raised as a result of what is proposed in the Bill? I hope that even at this late stage the Government will recognise the justice of the amendment and not oppose it.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State justified the clause in a few lines of his Second Reading speech:
<q>Married women and widows who have opted out of the full payment will pay the increased NHS contribution. They also contribute to the cost of the national insurance scheme, from which they benefit. The increases for them are a little higher, proportionately."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 955.]</q>
How right he was! The increase is 37 per cent. I wonder why.<br/>
The beginning of this debate was greeted by sneers and sniggers from the Conservative Members present, none of whom has justified the swingeing increase in tax. One of those to sneer was the chairman of European Ferries, currently receiving around &#x00A3;12,000 a year plus expenses as a Member. It hardly behoves anyone in that position to talk about married women and widows or to criticise the Opposition, who are resisting taxes that we believe are unfair.<br/>
I want to speak particularly about the imposition on widows. As a proportion of total earnings, in cash terms

the increase is relatively small, but we are talking about people who have low incomes anyway and for whom a 37 per cent. increase in national insurance contributions is a great deal. They have to budget from week to week and are not saving up to go abroad on holiday by means of European Ferries. They do not have a few thousand pounds in the bank. Instead of saying "Inflation is coming down", they say "Prices are still going up week by week." Their national insurance contribution is going up a good deal faster than prices in the shops, but prices are still going up by about 15 per cent. a year.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has spoken of the sort of people who will not be adversely affected. Does he agree that another group who have done well, and from whom the money could come, are those who have not paid their income tax as a result of the activities of Rossminster?

I was pointing out that widows and married women would feel it, even though in absolute terms it might be thought relatively small.

They do not have money to fall back on if they receive a bigger electricity bill or whatever.<br/>
When we were in Government, were there not many bleeding hearts on the Conservative Benches on the subject of widows? They stood shoulder to shoulder. They told us that widows were suffering and asked us what the Government were doing to improve the position of widows. We had it time after time. We still have a few bleeding hearts on the Conservative Benches. However, they do not show the little cross that they wear on their sleeves when they are in the Division Lobby. They slide away or vote for the Government. We know who they are. They were going to give the disabled, the pensioners and the widows so much assistance. Where are they now?</p>

<p>If the Bill had passed through the House of Commons in an ordinary manner instead of being rushed through with all its stages having to be completed in one day and one night, it would have been dealt with in a more rational manner. It is entirely the fault of the Government Front Bench that the present procedures are being adopted. The Government are trying to force it through the House of Commons.<br/>
During the lifetime of the Labour Government, we had our arguments about widows. One of the improvements in benefit that was introduced during that period was due to the efforts of some Labour Back Benchers. My hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) was involved in organising a group of Back Benchers to obtain improved benefits for widows. That group voted for those improvements along with some Conservative and Liberal Members. Anyone who checks the record will find that the Labour Members on the then Government Benches were by no means the quiescent hacks that we see before us these days. That applied even with a narrow majority. The Conservative Members who were in the House of Commons during the administration of the previous Labour Government know that we were prepared on many occasions to vote if we felt that an issue was an important aspect of party policy. We were not prepared to adopt the hypocritical position that the Tories were using merely for political pretence.<br/>
I return to the position of widows. They will feel the imposition very keenly. It has been argued over the past few years that they have the same costs as a married couple. Heating and lighting cost the same. They cannot light or heat half a room. They have the same rates to pay. They feel particularly keenly that they are suffering as a result of existing legislation and could do with a better deal. Many other sections of the population consider that their lot should be improved, and any Government have to examine the priorities in the light of resources available. However, many widows feel particularly keenly that they are at a disadvantage because their partner is dead. They feel isolated, yet at the same time they have to bear costs which in the case of a married couple are shared.<br/>
The imposition on married women is unfair, but widows will consider that it is even more unfair on them because of their isolation and the fact that they have to bear the extra cost on only one income.<br/>
It is a particularly cruel imposition. I recall the representations, agitation and speeches made about widows when we were in Government. It is, therefore, clear that the Government are making an about-turn in introducing the 37 per cent. increase in widows' contributions, particularly when their main benefit as a result of the contribution is cut. On the one hand, the contribution is increased. On the other, if they are unfortunate enough to be in receipt of industrial injury benefit, they receive less. That is singularly unfair. How can the Minister justify that position? The action is still unjustified and unfair, even if only a small number are affected.<br/>
The Minister may say that only a tiny number is involved and that the Government are interested in the extent of the imposition, but even if an injustice affects only one person we should try to remedy it. Hon. Members on both sides make a very good living out of trying to remedy, individual injustices in the courts. Should we, therefore, let this taxation injustice go through without question? Of course not. I hope that my hon. Friends will support the amendment to delete the subsection.<br/>
The voting will be interesting. Even though this is an imposition on widows, I suspect that Government Members will flock to the Lobby&#x2014;there has been a three-line Whip &#x2014; as good as gold to support the Government. Alack, alas, whatever the Government do, all Conservative Members troop into the Lobby. Whatever we say is not likely to change their minds.</p>

<p>I do not believe that there are any rebels. There were four abstentions about 10 months ago, which was the beginning of a controlled explosion, but that whimpered out like a damp squib after about 14 dinners that were widely publicised. All the young men of the Conservative Party, newly elected, believed that they could have a great deal of influence on the Government. That has not happened. They have submitted to the three-line Whip to vote for the measure.<br/>
It seems to us that the measure is extremely unfair. It affects a section of the population that is least able to bear the increased tax. It reflects badly on the Government. Those who have had the best tax deal from them are people like the chairman of European Ferries, who has done very well. Conservative Members are all pretty well heeled, with good jobs outside the House as well as their good salaries as Members of Parliament. It is the height of injustice for them all to vote for this imposition on widows.</p>

<p>These women who opted many years ago for a low rate of contributions and benefits did so in order to maximise their incomes. That was the prime defining factor of the group. By their approach they categorised themselves as low-paid, as needing every penny they could get from their wages. It is most likely that since they were low-paid they will remain low-paid, and this swingeing increase in contributions will undermine their incomes.<br/>
These women must be of advancing years because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) explained, it is not now possible for new entrants into the labour force to opt for the lower level of contribution. That means that many of them will be approaching retirement, a lime when they least need to bear the burden of having their contributions increased more than those of any other group.<br/>
These older women are, for the most part, part-time workers with take-home pay of &#x00A3;25 to &#x00A3;30 a week. They are employed in the public sector or in the private sector as cleaners or domestics for people like the chairman of European Ferries. The Government must justify concentrating their attack on this group. We oppose all the contribution increases, but particularly this one, aimed as t is at this most defenceless group. For that reason, the Committee should throw out this obnoxious subsection and retain the 2 per cent. level of contributions.</p>

<p>As my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mr. Race) has already said, this measure will bear most heavily on older women in part-time employment on low pay. All three of those characteristics generally go together. As has been pointed out already, the general trend of the economy is having a more damaging effect on the employment of women than it is even on the employment of men. A disproportionately high number of women work part-time. They tend to be the first to be pushed out of employment when companies shed employees. Considerable numbers are being pushed out of the public sector, almost as a deliberate part of the Government's policies.<br/>
As was pointed out when we discussed an earlier amendment, other women who suffer are those in the wage brackets round the minimum who are paying the full rate of national insurance contribution rather than opting for the reduced rate. I think that someone in the DHSS was Oven the task of looking to see whether there were any women that the Government were not getting at. He rushed in and said to the Secretary of State "Sir, Sir, I have found another little group. Perhaps we could damage them also. We could put them in our nasty, squalid, little Bill."<br/>
It is a nasty, squalid piece of legislation that is being peddled by the Secretary of State and his friends. This is an especially squalid little put of the squalid little Bill. It will not bring in a significant income for the Government. It will not even save very much money for the rich, whom the Government are trying to look after. It will not bring about the savings that the tax evasion companies have been bringing about for the well-off. It will not put the Government in a position in which they can make significant tax concessions to those who have already received tax concessions. It will not make much difference to the totality of the income or outgoings in this measure. It is as if someone went out for a vengeful look for people who had not been caught.<br/>
But those women have already been caught by the equally squalid Social Security (No. 2) Act 1980. The train benefit to which they are entitled is the industrial injury benefit, which the Act cut. This is another example of the way in which the Government, in their petty-minded, rotten way, are doing down any persons or groups who are not well-heeled, well-advised and, consequently, well able to protect themselves. It is the most disgraceful part of the Bill. It is not financially significant. I do not

suppose that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury rubbed his hands with glee at the thought of the amount of money that the Treasury would not have to find.<br/>
I wish that some Conservative Members would show a little rebellion every now and again. The only rebellions are those on the question of whether they will have a two-line Whip on a Private Member's Bill on this very day&#x2014;as we have now reached Friday. I understand that they are feeling rebellious about that. I wish that they would feel rebellious about matters that are more important. I hope that they will rebel over this miserable little measure and show that they have a little heart left, instead of trooping into the Lobby after the Secretary of State.</p>

<p>At the start of this short debate, there seemed to be a good many comments from the Conservative Benches on how much money was involved. The trouble with money is that it depends on how much of it one has and how much it is worth. The extra amount to be paid each week by someone earning &#x00A3;50 is 37&#x00BD;p. Many Conservative Members would not think that that is very much, but I remind them that it still buys a dog licence. Most of the people concerned, on low income, have to save up for many of their expenditures, and they begrudge having money taken away from them, apparently for no good reason except that the Government feel that they can be taxed. There can be no pretence that it is other than a tax. The group of people concerned get no benefit other than industrial injuries benefit from the national insurance system.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) put most of his emphasis on widows, and I spent a good deal of time trying to devise an amendment that would separate widows from married women. Eventually I gave up in despair, because it was very difficult to devise an amendment which would have any chance of being in order. Then I started to reflect that there was no justice in trying to separate the two. The variation in individual cases is startling. In many instances married women can be in just as difficult a financial position as widows. What is needed is to take into account their ability to pay when the tax is being imposed.<br/>
Consider first the woman who is widowed relatively early in life and who has contracted out at an early stage of her employment. She then finds that she has to go back to work. She has a fairly small widow's allowance. On her small income she will be counting every penny. That was the sort of case that my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley was citing. What about the married woman whose husband has left her? She finds that she has to go back to work because she has no maintenance coming in. Having contracted out, she can get no benefits. She may well be forced to accept low-paid work. She still has a considerable number of commitments&#x2014;a house and so on.<br/>
What about the married woman with a sick husband? She finds the payment of what Conservative Members may regard as only a few pence to be a considerable imposition.<br/>
Even worse off than that woman is the married woman in a low-paid job whose husband is unemployed and has been unemployed for a long time, so that he has exhausted his benefit. If he were the only source of income, the family would be entitled to go on to supplementary benefit, but because the wife goes to work he will not qualify for it. So, although the wife is not entitled to any benefits&#x2014;or virtually no benefits&#x2014; as a result of her contributions, she is supporting a husband who has


exhausted his eligibility to benefits. I suggest that the woman in that category is at least as deserving as the widow.<br/>
Then there is the married woman whose husband is earning an average or above-average wage. The deduction from her income is of much less significance to that household.<br/>
One could go on with a whole series of examples, but they all make the point that this tax takes no account of the ability of the family to pay.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that if the Bill goes through several of the categories to which he has referred will be in the group referred to in the Conservative manifesto, where it speaks of far too many people who are

<p>I am aware that those are the categories to which the document was supposed to refer. Most of these people want to work, not just because they want to be independent but because they feel that there are many other benefits. They are just the people who will be the least likely to give up work if it is drawn to their attention that they might be better off in work than out of it. They are the people who have the least right to be clobbered by this increase.<br/>
We ought to be told the global sum that the Government hope to raise and how they justify imposing this increase on this group of people. Some of them will find it extremely difficult to cope with this increase. I suggest that the Minister should take away this part of the Bill and accept our amendment.</p>

<p>I do not profess to have any great specialist knowledge of this area, but I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) for informing me that this amendment was to be put to the Committee. I say that because it is an important amendment for hon. Members who do not specialise in this matter. Those who do not specialise are inclined to look at sensitive areas of legislation such as this and to speak on such matters when given the opportunity.<br/>
We have the pleasure this evening of having with us the Minister of State, Treasury, the hon. and learned Member for Dover and Deal (Mr. Rees). He may recall that during our debates on the Finance Bill some months ago he said that whenever sensitive issues came before us he would price them&#x2014;for want of a better term&#x2014;and on a number of occasions when controversial measures were to be put to the Committee he was kind enough to ensure that the information was available to us prior to the debate. If this area of debate has dragged on this evening, it may be because that kind of information has not been made available to us. It might have helped us if we had had such information, because it might have enabled us to establish, not only in the minds of my hon. Friends but perhaps also in the minds of Tory Members, what our priorities should be.<br/>
I recall the occasion during our debates on the Finance Bill when one Tory Member, who has now left the Chamber, moved an amendment that would have added &#x00A3;200 million to the public sector borrowing requirement. It was only when the Minister of State made the necessary information available to the Committee that we were able

to treat the amendment with the ridicule that it deserved and press our amendments to deal with far more sensitive and important areas of the Bill.<br/>
12.45 am<br/>
If there is a particular reason why we on this side rise to speak on amendments such as these, it is that we see within such measures great injustices. It might be worth establishing what sorts of Members organising what sorts of surgeries are inclined to attract to those surgeries people who have problems of the kind to which my hon. Friends have referred tonight. I wonder whether the hon. Member for Huntingdonshire (Mr. Major), who was enjoying the debate earlier with a few laughs at the comments of my hon. Friends, could think back to the last surgery that he held. I am sure that at that surgery he was confronted with people who fall within the groups to which the amendment refers. I am sure he would agree that invariably at surgeries we are inclined to attract the lower-paid groups, because they have problems. Therefore, one would have thought that when hon. Members, having been confronted by such people at their surgeries, come to the House of Commons they would do their best to protect the interests of those people.<br/>
However, that does not happen. Conservative Members are very quick to allocate tens&#x2014;indeed, hundreds&#x2014;of millions of pounds to the better off&#x2014;the more well-heeled&#x2014;in society and are often inclined to discard the interests of those who have very little. That is a derogation of our function as Members of Parliament, because my understanding has always been that we come here to protect the underprivileged.</p>

<p>I take your point, Mr. Godman Irvine as does the hon. Gentleman, I hope.<br/>
The hon. Member referred to the need to deal in the general rather than in the specific. An examination of the distribution of personal incomes between 1949 and the last year for which figures are available&#x2014;1977&#x2014;shows that the bottom 30 per cent. of income groups increased their share of all income by only &#x2153; per cent. When one considers the legislation that the Government have introduced&#x2014;</p>

<p>I should have thought that it was in order to refer to those who will suffer as a result of the Government's refusal to accept the amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker). I should have thought it in order to refer in passing to that group of people and their problems. Their share has increased by only one-third of 1 per cent. over a period of 28 years.<br/>
In the past year and a half, the Government have introduced two Finance Bills. It is clear that a massive redistribution is being made in favour of those who do not fall within that bottom 30 per cent. I remind the hon. Member for Huntingdonshire that the House is under an obligation. The amount of public expenditure involved is not vast. There will not be any draconian effect on the public sector borrowing requirement. Indeed, some of the amendments tabled by Conservative Members during discussion of the Finance Bill would have had a draconian effect. Such amendments would not have been of any benefit to my constituents.<br/>
Hon. Members would be unfair if they did not consider those who fall within these particular income groups. Income could be raised from several other sources. Only 10 days ago the Government made a statement to the effect that they would allocate a further &#x00A3;350 million to those who enjoyed stock relief. A marginal reduction in that amount&#x2014;which would not have any great effect on the companies that claim stock relief&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Godman Irvine. Given that we are rushing through a Bill that seeks to raise taxation by more than &#x00A3;2 billion, is it not in order to ask where the Secretary of State is? Should he not be present at such deliberations?</p>

<p>You suggested, Mr. Godman Irvine, that my remarks were not in order. I suggest that they are in order. If the Government intend to use the increase from 2 per cent. to 2&#x00B7;75 per cent. as a means of raising revenue, I should have thought it in order to mention other ways in which the same amount of revenue could be raised.</p>

<p>The House should reconsider the changes that have been introduced. A special case can be made for those who can ill afford to pay the Government's debts. The Government have clearly lost control of the economy because they are unable to reach the monetary targets that they originally set. They should not impose these costs on the underprivileged, who can ill afford to pick up the bill.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1789888" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1190.4" hansard_membership_id="2273" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13240" speakername="Mrs. Chalker" colnum="1190" time="00:30:00">
<p>I was beginning to wonder when the moment would come for me to answer the many questions posed by Opposition Members.<br/>
One question was: how many married women are paying the reduced or opted-out payment? About 3&#x00BD; million married women in employment pay the reduced payment. About a quarter of a million widows pay the reduced payment. A further quarter of a million women, not now in employment, who have been opted out from previous employments and are now in the immediate two-year post-employment period, are still eligible for reduced payments.<br/>
I was asked what money comes into the fund. The total is &#x00A3;47 million&#x2014;not quite as small as some Opposition Members seemed to think&#x2014;&#x00A3;31 million of which goes into the national insurance fund. The remaining &#x00A3;16 million will go into the National Health Service. If Opposition Members care to read the Government Actuary's report on the Bill, they will find many other useful figures.<br/>
We made clear in earlier debates&#x2014;hon. Members who arrived after midnight will not have heard those debates, of course&#x2014;that on the advice of the Government Actuary, working on estimates put to him by the Treasury, we must ensure that the national insurance fund remains in balance.<br/>
We have already discussed the full class 1 contributions. We are now discussing what happens to the reduced rate for married women and widows who for the past five years have been paying 2 per cent.<br/>
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) made great play of the fact that the increase from 2 per cent. to 2&#x00B7;75 per cent. for women who are opted out was an increase of 37&#x00BD; per cent. The hon. Gentleman failed to note that women who are opted out of the full contribution have always paid the National Health Service allocation. That is reflected as an increase of 0&#x00B7;25 per cent. in all the primary class 1 contribution rates. So of that 0&#x00B7;75 per cent. increase 0&#x00B7;25 per cent. is going direct to the National Health Service. The remainder is the general cost of the scheme from which married women and widows can benefit through additions to benefit for dependants and through industrial injuries benefit. They also benefit in the long term because they are making contributions to their retirement pensions.<br/>
When rates have not changed for some time, it may seem fair to ask "Why change them now?" Every speaker in the debate has missed one point. When the reduced rate was set in 1975, the standard class 1 rate was 5&#x00BD; per cent.


In other words, the reduced rate was 3&#x00BD; per cent. below that. Even after the increase now proposed, the difference will be 5 per cent.&#x2014;that is, 2&#x00B7;75 per cent. compared with 7&#x00B7;75 per cent. It will be slightly greater than the 4&#x00B7;5 per cent.&#x2014;that is, the difference between the old basic 2 per cent. contribution and the 6&#x00B7;5 per cent. contribution which applied from April 1978. That was when the Labour Government's legislation required married women to consider their position in the light of the new pension scheme. Therefore, the married women's option will now represent a better bargain than when they made their decision to pay at the lower rate.<br/>
The Government are in no way impervious to the problems that face many widows and people on low pay. As the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) said, a woman earning &#x00A3;50 a week would experience an increase of 37&#x00BD;p as a result of this part of clause 1.<br/>
1 am<br/>
In view of the need to ensure that our national insurance fund remains in balance, and in order to make sure that the resources that we want for the NHS are available, I do not think that&#x2014;at a better bargain than the Other increases&#x2014;this is too much to ask of a group of the population that is by no means all in the categories so avidly described by Labour Members. I am sure that many will not begrudge contributing 37&#x00BD;p if they are on &#x00A3;50 a week.</p>

<p>The Minister gave us the figures for which we asked. Perhaps she can give one more figure. She mentioned the 3&#x00BD; million and the 250,000, the 250,000 being the widows. How much of the &#x00A3;47 million is attributable to the 250,000 widows?</p>

<p>It is proportional, as far as I know. From what I have read, I cannot think of any reason to believe that it would be other than proportional. That was my immediate reaction, but I was trying to think whether there was anything that I should add. I believe that it is a proportional amount.</p>

<p>The Committee will be pleased to hear that I shall be able to spend less time moving amendment No. 11 than I spent on amendment No. 10, but it is incumbent on me to explain why we dreamt up the figures of &#x00A3;3 and &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;70 in the amendments. Basically, we want to know why the Government have chosen the figures in the Bill.<br/>
1.15 am<br/>
Amendment No. 11 relates to the class 2 self-employed contribution, which is at present &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50. We simply propose to increase that figure by 20 per cent. in line with average earnings. That is how we get the figure of &#x00A3;3. We want to know why such a large increase is proposed by the Government for this part of the self-employed contribution.<br/>
Amendment No. 12 relates to share fishermen. The hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie) is just about to walk out of the Chamber. Normally, when there is reference to fishermen, he rises to his feet. Perhaps he will be able to contribute to this debate. He may even be able to tell us whether we have share fishermen in the

EEC. I do not know whether that is so. I asked an hon. Gentleman who is a member of the Liberal Party and is now on the night sleeper, but he could not give an answer.<br/>
The present impost on share fishermen is &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;90. The Government propose a substantial increase, to &#x00A3;5&#x00B7;15. We have taken the 20 per cent. increase that we propose for the self-employed, which would give a rise of 50p on the &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;90 in the case of the share fishermen; we have then taken &#x00BC; per cent. of average earnings&#x2014;which takes us back to the unemployment contribution to the national insurance fund. That gives us 30p. We have not endeavoured to be more accurate than that. That gives us an 80p increase on &#x00A3;3&#x00B7;90. Hence we arrive at a figure of &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;70. These figures have not, therefore, simply been dreamt up out of thin air.<br/>
We could not understand why the Government proposed such large increases. In any event, it seemed the worst possible time to impose a further impost, above what was required by the increase in average earnings, upon those involved in the fishing industry. Hence these two amendments.</p>

<p>I regret that I cannot advise the Committee to accept these amendments, but, judging by the tone in which the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) moved them, they are perhaps more in the nature of probing amendments than an indication of the Opposition's policy.<br/>
The short answer is that the increases that are proposed for the class 2 contributions, the flat-rats contribution for the self-employed and the special rate for the share fishermen, are precisely what would be required to maintain the same relationship between the self-employed class 2 contributions and the combined employer and employee class 1 contribution.<br/>
The reduction in the Treasury supplement would account for about 30p of the 90p increase. The increase in the NHS allocation would account for a further 15p of that total, and the balance would be the appropriate share to go to the national insurance fund for the self-employed, relative to the contributions of employees. The effect of the amendment&#x2014;the hon. Gentleman did not say whether this was the intention&#x2014;would be to leave only the contribution to the fund and make the self-employed flat-rate contribution contribute nothing for the reduction of the Treasury supplement or for the Health Service.<br/>
If amendment No. 11 were carried, the loss of revenue would be about &#x00A3;16 million, but much more important than the amount of money involved would be the fact that it would mean that the relationship between class 1 and class 2 contribution rates would no longer be maintained. That would upset the relativity that has existed for a number of years.<br/>
The hon. Member may ask how class 2 and class 4 are fixed. The answer is that they have been fixed precisely according to the rules that were explained in the Government Actuary's report of 1977, in paragraphs 27 and 28. I shall not weary the Committee by reading out the paragraphs. I shall simply summarise them.<br/>
The rates for the self-employed are fixed on the total class 1 rate, which itself is set at a level adequate to keep the national insurance fund broadly in balance, taking account of the Treasury supplement. For the self-employed, this class 1 rate is abated to take account of the benefits for which they are not eligible&#x2014;unemployment and industrial injuries benefits&#x2014;and the earnings-related


components in the benefits. Nearly all the abatement is on account of pensions. It is based on the actuarial value of the pension rights forgone. This method was adopted by our Labour predecessors in 1977, and we see no reason to change it.<br/>
We have launched the promised investigation into the relative contributions and benefits to the self-employed. A paper was published in October, and that investigation is now under way. The increases do no more than maintain the existing relativity. They in no way prejudice the conduct or the possible outcome of the investigation.<br/>
I believe that we are treating the self-employed absolutely fairly, in exactly the same relationship as employers and employed. In those circumstances, the Committee may wish to reject the amendment.<br/>
I turn to amendment No. 12. The contributions and, therefore, the increases are somewhat larger for share fishermen, because they are based on the standard class 2 rate, but an addition is made in respect of the share fishermen's entitlement to unemployment benefit and industrial injuries benefit. The increase proposed in the Bill reflects the increases of 65p for inflation and 45p for the NHS and the effect of the Treasury supplement reduction, as for the normal class 2 rates, and 15p corresponding to the further &#x00BC; per cent. on class 1, because they are eligible for unemployment benefit.<br/>
I hope that the Committee will agree that both increases are justified. They are entirely fair in relation to other groups whose contributions are being increased. I therefore advise the Committee to reject the amendments.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State will not expect us to accept his proposition. We reject the 1 per cent. and the combined employer-employee ratio that he proposes in the rest of the Bill, and we reject them equally in relation to the groups in question. We are not being inconsistent; on the contrary, we are being consistent.<br/>
We heard a great deal before and during the election campaign about the Tory Party's affection for the self-employed. We have heard something about it since, but we have not seen much in the way of deeds. The right hon. Gentleman must know that the self-employed are among those who are being pressed hardest. Many small one-man businesses are going bust under the present Administration. The strain is as heavy upon the unemployed as it is on other working people. This is hardly the time to introduce the spurious 1 per cent. provision that the Government regard as an insurance levy. I know something about share fishermen, as does the hon. Member for Aberdeenshire, East (Mr. McQuarrie). I was in the hon. Gentleman's constituency a few weeks ago&#x2014;</p>

As the hon. Gentleman knows, my family comes from the fishing folk of his constituency, I am sorry that they are being so badly represented. There is a problem facing fishermen. I declare an interest. I have no direct connection with fishing, but I have a sentimental interest in the industry and the people in it because of my family connections. The problem that they are facing was

occasioned by the Conservative Party taking the United Kingdom into the Common Market without any guarantees on fishing policy. The fishermen are now facing the consequence. Herring is being landed in Boulogne while the fishermen off our shores have to dump herring into the sea and waste it if they catch it accidentally instead of sprats.<br/>
The problem facing the fishermen is in line with that faced by the unemployed. That is another reason for not accepting the impost that the Government have introduced.</p>

<p>They are reeling under the effects of Government policy. There have been periods of relative affluence in the fishing industry, but it is facing major


difficulties now and for the future because of overfishing and failure to adopt proper conservation methods, partly because of the inhibitions placed on it by the EEC.<br/>
Share fishermen are men who go to sea, but they are not quite in an employee-employer relationship with the skipper or owner of the boat. Part of their earnings comes from their share in the catch. They are not only paid a wage. In fact, some are not paid a wage at all; they have a share of the profit of the boat as their payment. Fishermen, I am afraid, are highly individualist hunters, and they tend to prefer the chance of a haul&#x2014;even a small haul&#x2014;to a regular wage.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that share fishermen share in the catch, which can be small or large. The national insurance contribution will be based on the physical takings of each share fisherman on the catch. It is right that they enjoy a measure of unemployment benefit, again based on the amount of money they earn It s a question of the income from the catch. Fishermen can earn up to &#x00A3;2,000 on many occasions in a week or 10 days at sea. When, they come back, they pay a proportion of that. We are talking about the flat rate, and the increase on the flat rate will make the difference.</p>

<p>The Committee seems to be getting into difficulty. We are concerned in amendments Nos. 11 and 12 with the flat-rate element of the self-employed national insurance contribution, amendment No. 12 relating to the special position of share fishermen, who, as my hon. Friend rightly said, are remunerated not by a normal wage or even a wage related to work but by a share or by a mixture of a wage and a share. They are, however, entitled to unemployment benefit, and in that way they are unlike the normal self-employed who are not entitled to unemployment benefit. That is why they pay a special, higher rate of contribution and why the increase, which is directly proportional, is, in money terms, bigger than for the self-employed.<br/>
The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) asked me how much of the total sum for the self-employed would be attributable to share fishermen. We do not have up-to-date reliable information, but it would be unlikely to exceed &#x00A3;1 million. The principal issue here, therefore, is not the sum of money but maintaining the same relativity between the different categories of contributor when one is making a change such as that contained in clause 1. That is our justification for the increases for the self-employed and that special category, the share fishermen.</p>

<p>My contribution is a question to the Secretary of State. I am genuinely confused about his explanation of why the amendments should be rejected. I am confused whether his arguments relate to the self-employed or to the share fishermen.

If so, how can that be a special rating when employers are not paying any increase in their rates? If the former is correct, is it not a departure from the way that the increases for the self-employed have been worked out, which in previous years were based not on the weighted increase of both employers and employees but on the lesser rate? The lesser rate was justified because the self-employed do not receive equity and benefits compared with employees for whom benefits are paid from contributions based on both employees and employers.</p>

<p>I hope that I can help the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). I am not expecting my remarks to be printed in the <i>Wanstead and Woodford Guardian.</i> I wish to draw attention to the details in the 1977 Government Actuary's report, in which he spelt out precisely how the contribution of the self-employed was calculated. Paragraph 27 states:
<q>The Government have decided that after April 1978 the rates of contribution for the self-employed should be derived on lines similar to the rates for contracted-out employees, by making allowance for the average cost of self-employed contributors of providing for themselves benefits comparable to the new earnings-related additional components of pension to which the contributions of employees fully participating in the state scheme will be securing title.</q>
Paragraph 28, the key paragraph, states:
<q>On this approach the contribution rates for the self-employed will be obtained by making two deductions from the joint rate for employees who are not contracted-out; first, an adjustment to exclude that part of the contributions for employees which relate to the, mainly short-term, benefits under the present scheme for which the self-employed are not eligible and, secondly, a deduction to allow for the value of the new earnings-related benefits to which employees will be building up title after April 1978.</q>
It obviously does not matter in what ratio the employees' and the employers' contributions stand to each

other, because it is the sum of the two&#x2014;the joint contribution&#x2014;that provides the basis on which the self-employed contribution is calculated, after making the deductions to which the Government Actuary's report refers. I beg to differ from the hon. Member for Birkenhead in his suggestion that the Bill creates any new position. On the contrary, we have gone to great lengths to ensure that we increase the self-employed contribution to maintain precisely the same ratio to the joint employer-employee contribution as has pertained hitherto. We have done that quite deliberately so as in no way to prejudice the investigation that is currently under way and which we promised at the last election.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State recall his speech in Canton on 19 April? I mean Canton in Cardiff, not the one near the enterprise zone. At least, on that occasion the right hon. Gentleman had the courage to go to Cardiff. One understands from today's <i>Daily Express</i> that the Prime Minister is willing to go to Cardiff, but only if the chairman of the British Steel Corporation&#x2014;</p>

<p>The amendment refers to the self-employed. They are frequently referred to by the Secretary of State as small business men. I wonder whether he recalls his statement in Canton when he said:
<q>The list of what we are now doing to encourage small businesses is a long and exciting one.</q>
I wonder whether this exciting little measure was included in the long and exciting list of measures that he was introducing to stimulate small businesses. As in many other instances, this is simply another effort to increase the take from the natural insurance fund in order to try to keep down the general level of taxation.<br/>
The argument that has always been put forward with regard to small businesses is that the general level of taxation was penalising them. This is another example of simply shifting the burden from the general taxpayer on to the small self-employed person&#x2014;the small business man. It is likely to damage those people to whom the Secretary of State's party apparently pays so much attention.</p>

<p>I beg to move amendment No. 13, in page 2, line 7, leave out '&#x00A3;3&#x00B7;30' and insert '&#x00A3;2&#x00B7;90'.<br/>
We take the same view on voluntary contributions as we took on previous amendments, and I do not need to go into detail on the amendment. Basically, we have put a 20 per cent. increase on what is being paid.<br/>
We should like up-to-date information on how many voluntary contributions are paid. I once paid such contributions, but I was never caught in the trap of changing rates. Students sometimes pay contributions in a lump sum in order to gain a pension accrual for the future. What rate will they pay? Will it be the rate that is current when they make their back payment or will they have to pay the rate that was in force during the period for which they are buying stamps?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) has raised an important matter. Students are often asked to catch up with contributions that they have not made because of their studies. Those in post graduate education in universities and colleges have to make up their contribution record in a lump sum.<br/>
At what rate will students have to make the lump sum payment? Will it be the rate at which contributions are levied when they make their payment, or will it be the rate that applied during the period when they should have been making contributions?<br/>
We are talking about substantial increases in such lump sums. The money will not be taken as weekly deductions from a wage packet. The amendment raises different problems from those that have arisen in our discussion of sometimes relatively small weekly amounts paid in increased national insurance employee contributions. The Government's proposals may have a detrimental effect on students and others.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1789954" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1200.19" hansard_membership_id="2023" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2503" speakername="Mr. Campbell-Savours" colnum="1200" time="01:45:00">
<p>If students are unable to make contributions, when they take up work the DHSS informs them what contributions they must make in order to establish a full entitlement. I was abroad for some years in the 1960s and on my return I made arrangements with the Department to make up payments in line with the current provisions.<br/>
I do not understand why it is necessary to increase these contributions, because the payment would be made anyway, through supplementary benefits, if those concerned had insufficient pension entitlement at the age of 65. If the Bill goes through in its present form, the Government will have introduced a disincentive to people to make contributions.<br/>
I should have thought that it would be the Government's objective to ensure that people made as many contributions as possible, thereby relieving the State of the possibility that later in a person's life it might be required to pay supplementary benefits rather than pensions.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1789955" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1205.0" hansard_membership_id="1152" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2420" speakername="Mr. Andrew F. Bennett" colnum="1205" time="01:45:00">
<p>I ask the Under-Secretary of State to give us a little more information. I presume that the hon. Lady will suggest that the reason for this increase and the figures proposed is that they are in line with and on the same scale as all the other figures. But there is a particular problem here.<br/>
We are looking at two groups of people. First, there are those who are out of the system at a particular time&#x2014;now&#x2014;and who want to make a contribution. Secondly, there are those who did not make a contribution in the past. In the case of those who for some reason do not make a contribution now, it is surely logical that they should be charged at whatever is the going rate. But those who, for example, did not make payments last year or some time in the year before should, if asked to make back payments, pay at the rate that applied at that time.<br/>
I hope that the hon. Lady can assure me that if a person is making a back payment he will pay at the rate that was current at the time his contribution was missing rather than at the rate pertaining now. It would be unfair to raise the repayment rate now, because of extra levels of unemployment, for those making back payments.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1789956" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1205.1" hansard_membership_id="8351" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19824" speakername="Mr. Race" colnum="1205" time="01:45:00">
<p>As I recall it, people who have a contribution record which is deficient and which would affect their level of pensions or benefits in the future have a period of seven years in which to catch up on their contribution record. After that time, they are deemed not to want to make that contribution. Therefore, the point that my hon. Friend is making is a genuine one, because we could be talking about national insurance rates that were payable seven years ago and not last year alone.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1789957" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1205.2" hansard_membership_id="1152" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2420" speakername="Mr. Bennett" colnum="1205" time="01:45:00">
<p>Some people are not able to make their back payments because of financial difficulty. Will the Under-Secretary of State tell us whether, under the uprated levels, their difficulties become greater or whether they are able to pay at the existing rates?<br/>
I come across a surprising number of people who opt out of the system. In several instances they are at very low income levels. It is marginal to them whether they are barter off trying to make up the payments. This sort of increase may well tip some of these people into not making up their contributions. The hon. Lady said earlier that it was important to encourage people to make contributions. Does she not agree that this son of increase is likely to discourage people from doing so?<br/>
I give the example of an artist who is not very successful at selling his pictures and may have virtually no income from that source for some period. Many people in that situation do occasional lecturing, which is their only source of income. They face problems in making up their contributions. This sort of increase may discourage them from trying to do so and cause them difficulties in the future.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1789958" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1205.3" hansard_membership_id="2273" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13240" speakername="Mrs. Chalker" colnum="1205" time="01:45:00">
<p>This amendment is consequential upon amendment No. 11, which the Committee has declined to accept, but I will answer the questions asked upon it from the rather depleted Opposition Benches.<br/>
About 100,000 people pay class 3 contributions. I have been asked about the going rate for these voluntary contributions. The payment rate that is applicable is that for the period of the gap in the contributions record. Therefore, in the case of a student who can pay not up to seven years back but up to six years back the rate is the rate applicable where the gap in his contributions was.

Another person able to pay up to two years back would similarly pay the applicable rate for the gap in the contributions record.<br/>
The reason for raising the class 3 rate from its present level of &#x00A3;2.40 to &#x00A3;3.30 is exactly the same as the reason for the increases in the other rates. The contribution paid leads to entitlement to retirement pension. The class 3 rate contribution paid by voluntary contributors is at present l0p less than the class 2 rate. The class 3 rate proposed in the Bill maintains that relationship. The amendment would alter that arrangement and not be acceptable to the Government.</p>

<p>The amendment did not make sense to me when I originally read it, and I have not been able to make sense of it in the past couple of hours. However, my hon. Friend is probably right. I am not throwing the amendment away, but I am not happy about the drafting, and I shall not be too upset if the Government criticise it.<br/>
The main thrust of the amendments is to ease the burden on the self-employed, which is no contradiction coming from the Labour Benches. As the Secretary of State is aware, there was considerable dispute with the Government when the proposal was introduced in 1975. Originally, the figure was 8 per cent., and there was a major row over getting it changed.<br/>
We do not see why the self-employed should be subjected to these imposts. Most of the amendments have related to the 1 per cent. increase. I suspect that the Government's answer to this point, and in relation to the figures that they have used for the earnings band in which the self-employed pay their earnings-related contribution, will be more or less the same as their answers on the previous three amendments.<br/>
Did the Government take into account the possible consequences of the implementation of the Green Paper on sickness benefits? The self-employed are aggrieved about the proposal, as the Minister is well aware. We do not have a legislative proposal in front of us, but there will probably be a further change in the percentage rate for the self-employed, possibly in the same financial year as the legislation on sickness benefit, which the Government intend to put through this Session, according to the Queen's Speech. Will there be two changes in the rate for the self-employed in one year?<br/>
I can imagine that most big employers will be able to cope with the rate changes just as they can cope with the various tax changes, but I suspect that there will be a considerable outcry from the self-employed if they are asked to accept two changes in the rates, especially when the reason for the second change could have been foreseen when the first change was put through the House&#x2014;that is, tonight.</p>

<p>The amendment would delete the 0&#x00B7;75 per cent. increase in contributions on earnings and would raise the lower limit to above &#x00A3;3,200. I take it that amendment No. 16 would raise the upper limit, so that the overall effect of the amendments would be to improve the position by relating contributions by the self-employed to a lower level of earnings. I remember that when just over a million people were unemployed under the Labour Government the National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. claimed that if only a few modifications were made to the Employment Protection Act its members could each take on one additional employee. Since there were around a million self-employed sole proprietors, it believed that it would solve the unemployment problem. That has clearly not happened. I never thought that it was realistic. A very large number of sole proprietors are literally just that. They are employed not in manufacturing industry but in shops, for example. Many of them could not sustain an additional employee.<br/>
The self-employed&#x2014;the small businesses&#x2014;are facing difficulties. This proposal will create even more difficulty


for them. The burden will clearly increase. If the Government are serious in their claim that small firms&#x2014;sole proprietors as well as incorporated enterprises&#x2014;will provide jobs, they must accept that this provision will be more a disincentive than an incentive for that to happen.<br/>
These firms are facing the burden of high interest rates. The wife of a self-employed electrician contacted me last week to explain that she is having to pay more for the stock that her husband has to keep if he is to undertake the wide variety of jobs he is called upon to perform. Her husband is experiencing difficulty because he has a big overdraft. The high level of interest rates means that he faces a heavy outlay in that direction just to keep the firm ticking over.<br/>
The electrician in question is a Labour supporter, but I do not argue the case from a sectarian point of view. I suspect that the bulk of self-employed people voted Conservative at the last election. I doubt that they would do so now, but their inclination then was to favour the Conservative Party because it said that their enterprise would be rewarded. The Labour Government produced restrictive legislation on the employment of individuals, which they did not like. I did not agree with them. Clearly, they will not be impressed, to say the least, by these additional contributions.<br/>
I well, recall when the previous Labour Government increased contributions for the self-employed. The increase was first set at 8 per cent. and then changed to 5 per cent. That caused a considerable amount of controversy. Members of the National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses Ltd had a certain affinity with the view that the Labour Government were doing it because they were not sympathetic or understanding. I am sure that they will say exactly the same about the present Government&#x2014;namely, that they are not a sympathetic or understanding Government because they are increasing the national insurance contributions.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend said he thought that the small business lobby had pressured the Government. The Conservative Party 1978 guide refers to the pressure exerted through the Conservative Party by the small business organisations on the Labour Government. In the guide, the Conservative Party claimed the credit for the reduction from 8 per cent. to 5 per cent. It is there in black and white. If I am called, I shall quote from it.</p>

<p>The reduction from 8 per cent. to 5 per cent. was claimed as a victory for the federation through its lobbying of the Government. Everyone wanted to get on to that bandwagon. The Labour Government of the day made the reduction as a demonstration of their genuine intention to help small firms.<br/>
I mention the matter because I think that the Secretary of State would agree that his Green Paper "Income During Initial Sickness: A New Strategy" has not met with warm enthusiasm from the federation. It has produced a critical document about his proposals. Paragraph 30 states:
<q>It is the Government's intention that employers as a whole should be; compensated for meeting these extra costs and that such compensation, to the extent that it did not take the form of direct reimbursement to employers &#x2026; should be through a once-for-all reduction in their contribution liability. This reduction, it is estimated, would be of the order of one-half of a percentage point.</q>
The Government propose that employers should have the burden of administering sick pay during the first eight

weeks. They propose that that additional burden should be compensated by a reduction in the employer's national insurance contribution of one-half of a percentage point.<br/>
The self-employed could legitimately argue that the sickness scheme, which they do not like, is being imposed upon them and that they are being offered some very modest inducement to carry it out, after having had to face the burden of an increase in their own national insurance contributions. It is a case of taking with one hand and giving back a proportion with the other. That is the view that they will take. I should be grateful to hear the Secretary of State's comments about the relationship of those increases to the Government's proposals for a reduction in the employer's contribution under the sickness scheme.<br/>
I am opposed to the sickness scheme. I do not want to delve into it in any detail, but I am opposed to it. It is a wrong idea. Small firms will suffer, as will their employees, under the scheme. There is an indirect link, because my argument about taking with one hand and giving back a proportion with the other will be raised. I should like to hear the Secretary of State's comments on that position.<br/>
The Labour Government gave rather more assistance to small firms than has been generally recognised. We included among those small firms the self-employed and the sole proprietors, who often employ two, three or four people, although they call themselves self-employed. There are the plumbers, the electricians, the decorators, the shopkeepers, the restaurant owners and so on. We have from time to time instituted provisions for giving them assistance by means of the small firms; advisory service, the small firms counselling service and so on, which were instituted by the Labour Government on a nationwide basis. Those services proved to be of great help. The take-up has been high. The test of their helpfulness has been the reaction of the small firms themselves, not our own assessment.<br/>
It is reasonable to suggest that the self-employed will find the charges a burden which will inhibit their efforts to develop their businesses and to create jobs. We know that in today's economic climate it is the small firms that are being clobbered most of all. They are facing Slighter interest charges; they are facing difficulties with rate burdens. Local authorities, because of Government action, are desperately trying to maintain services and in some instances have had to raise a supplementary rate levy. That again is a difficulty. Now, the small firms are being faced with this additional charge on their national insurance contributions.<br/>
The big firms are also experiencing difficulties due to the Government's policy of high interest rates, the high exchange rate of the pound and cuts in public expenditure, so that they in turn are having to cut back on the smaller firms which supply them with components or services. Where a local authority cuts back on public expenditure, it is sometimes the small firms, the self-employed, who are finding that the contracts are being brought to an end.<br/>
The Government have a moratorium on new council house building contracts, new public sector building contracts. In England and Wales, 92 per cent. of council houses are built not by direct works departments but by private enterprise contractors. I have no doubt that there will be some self-employed or sole proprietor firms among


that number. In Scotland, the figure is even higher&#x2014;98 per cent. of the council houses are built by private enterprise firms.<br/>
The Government are inflicting a burden on the very people who, I imagine, in many instances supported the Conservative Party at the last general election. They have imposed this additional insurance charge, together with the high interest rates. There are the diminution in business and all the problems which the present crisis and recession are presenting to everybody. There is also the new sickness scheme. We know that it has not yet been instituted, but there is a Green Paper and the matter is causing uncertainty. It is causing a lack of confidence in the small business sector, among both employers and employees. I hope that it will never come into existence. Nevertheless, it is another matter of concern, and the insurance increase will be a yet further matter of concern.<br/>
What we have suggested is a fairer application of the burden. It can be reasonably stated to be a better and fairer arrangement than the Secretary of State's. Therefore, I hope that it will have the support of my hon. Friends. I also hope that it may have support from the Conservative Members who are here tonight to vote in great numbers for increased insurance contributions for the self-employed.<br/>
3 am<br/>
I have been to a couple of meetings of the National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses Ltd., one a big one at the Central Hall in Westminster, where I suppose there were about 2,000 people present, and the other the annual meeting at Blackpool, where I suppose there were 200 or 300 present. I was then a Labour Minister, and I suppose that the welcome that they gave me was not wildly enthusiastic. In fact, it was a bit wild, but not enthusiastic. The situation has probably changed. There are not many Labour supporters amongst their numbers&#x2014;but I think that the number is growing&#x2014;and I can therefore say that we are not doing this from a partisan point of view but are putting forward a case that a fairer position can be achieved, and we have tried to achieve a fairer position in their national insurance contributions.<br/>
There is a certain amount of irony and amusement in the Conservatives going into the Lobby on the principle of an increase in contributions by the self-employed, the sector which, during the Labour Government's period of office, they said was inhibited by burdens and charges and that if only they could get into office the energies of all those people would be released. Well, all their energies are being released &#x2014; in the bankruptcy courts, in evergrowing numbers, I regret to say. It is a sad business that so many people should be in the dole queue and so many should be facing the trauma of bankruptcy, because it must be an enormous problem and sense of failure to get into that situation, even though it may not be the fault of the self-employed. Therefore, I urge even some of the Conservative Members here tonight to consider either abstaining or voting for these improvements.</p>

<p>One reason for our complaint about the Bill being bounced through the House is that no one, so far as I am aware, has had adequate time for consultation. Perhaps my hon.

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, because I think that the federation, now that it has got over its teething problems, provides information for its members. It has produced a document on "Income During Initial Sickness: A New Strategy", of which it has kindly sent me a copy. I disagree with many of the points made by the federation, but it is a comprehensive document that represents its point of view. I should have thought that it would have been reasonable for the Secretary of State to have delayed the Bill a little so that the federation, which is specifically affected, could have got its comments together.<br/>
The Secretary of State does not know, but the federation might have been glowing in its praise of the right hon. Gentleman. It might have said that it wanted public expenditure to be curtailed&#x2014;I imagine that that is the federation's view, although I do not know&#x2014;and that this was the best way of doing it, that it was willing to make this contribution and that it was happy to put forward that point of view and support the Government. On the other hand, the federation might well have been critical of the Government and said that there were alternative means of raising this amount of revenue. I shall be interested to know the total sum that the Government envisage in a full year. I know that they cannot be completely accurate&#x2014;because many of the people will be bankrupt by the end of a further full year of Conservative Government&#x2014;but some sort of estimate would be of use to the Committee, and we look forward to that.<br/>
My hon. Friend is right in saying that in getting legislation through the House it is important that we provide people with the opportunity to give us their comments, particularly for a Committee stage. I well recall saying to members of the National Federation of Self Employed and Small Businesses, Ltd., when they were critical of legislation&#x2014;I accept that they were critical of some of our legislation&#x2014;that Parliament represented a democratic process. We must recognise that some of the members of the federation were not too enamoured of democratic endeavour. They said "You talk too much. You should get it done and get it out of the way." I explained to them that in the parliamentary process one of the possibilities was that in Committee on a Bill people and organisations could put forward ideas and hon. Members could table amendments for debate. In this case there has not been time to give full effect to that process. We have tabled amendments. It would have been proper to give representatives of the self-employed a breathing space in which to put forward their views. The National Widows' Association might well have been asked for its views.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend referred to the number of bankruptcies. He may be interested to know that at a meeting of the parliamentary retail group yesterday the Retail Consortium produced statistics to show that 32,500 businesses have de-registered for VAT in the past 12 months. That is a horrifying statistic. Conservative Members challenged the figures. The director-general of the consortium confirmed that the figures were correct.</p>

<p>That bears out my point that these increases in national insurance contributions will be hard-felt. If people are de-registering for VAT, it indicates a diminution in their turnover. We know that the cash flow of many small businesses is under pressure. In an earlier


speech I referred to a constituent of mine who told me that her husband&#x2014;an electrician&#x2014;had had to increase his stock and pay higher interest charges to maintain that stock, and that she had had to raise money on property and had experienced difficulty in that regard.<br/>
The Government have floated the idea of enterprise zones on the basis of assisting small firms, including self-employed persons, to take premises in enterprise zones and to develop job opportunities. I do not think that enterprise zones will be of much advantage. I have always taken the view that small firms do not want to be seen to be inferior and that their standards of employment should be as good as those of large firms.<br/>
There is a lack of consistency in the Government establishing, on the one hand, enterprise zones to encourage firms and, on the other, increasing the national insurance contributions of small firms. There may be times when the national insurance contributions can be increased They were increased by the Labour Government, but at that time the number of bankruptcies was declining and the number of registrations of companies was increasing, certainly in the last two or three years of Labour Government. No account of size is taken in company registration, but the fact that they were new registrations is indicative of the fact that they were small firms. That indicated that there was a growth in the number of small firms.<br/>
It is inconsistent for the Government to impose this levy at a time when everybody knows and understands that manufacturing and service industries are going through a bad time. Through no fault of their own, they are losing profits and losing contracts. Indeed, they are losing their very existence. More and more firms are going to the bankruptcy courts.<br/>
The Secretary of State may argue that the Labour Government increased insurance contributions, but the climate then was different. Industry recognises that. Many industrialists, including those involved in small firms, have told me that they made a mistake when they voted Conservative. I recently visited one industrialist who had received a begging letter from his local Conservative association. He threw it on to the desk and said that it would not get a penny from him. He said that he had made a mistake at the general election and that he did not intend to repeat it.<br/>
The person who borrowed &#x00A3;80,000 at a much lower rate of interest under the Labour Government&#x2014;because he wanted part of that sum for pollution control equipment&#x2014;was deeply disillusioned with the Conservative Party. He did not make any claim, and neither do I-&#x2014;</p>

That is a serious criticism of the way in which this legislation has been introduced.<br/>
I hope that I have not strained your patience too much, Mr. Crawshaw. You have been very indulgent and patient. The measure represents an additional burden.

<p>On Second Reading, the Secretary of State admitted:
<q>Some anxiety has been expressed about the impact of the Bill on the self-employed. No doubt this is something that we shall wish to explore in detail in Committee"&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 8 December 1980; Vol. 995, c. 955.]</q>
If we did not have to rush through the Bill in one night, we should have more opportunity to explore the impact of increases on the self-employed. My hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) was right. The Secretary of State will correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the self-employed have not been consulted. We can understand the reaction of the self-employed to these increases.<br/>
3.15 am<br/>
I have been glancing at the Conservative "Campaign Guide 1977". The Conservative Party in Opposition was very critical of the increases introduced by the Labour Government. It refers to the increases starting in April 1977 and describes them as a form of disguised tax. Under the heading
<q>National Insurance and the Self-employed</q>
it states:
<q>The Party voted against the measures due to be introduced in April 1977.</q>
Clearly, in those days the Conservative Party's attitude was very different from what it is today. The increases were a disguised tax; they were terrible, shocking. Apparently the Labour Government were betraying the self-employed.<br/>
There does not seem to be any wish by hon. Members on the Government Benches to contribute to the debate. Conservative Members are here tonight as Lobby fodder. At least, we can ensure that they are present throughout the night.<br/>

<p>Before my hon. Friend leaves that point, will he make sure that we have all grasped what he was putting?

<p>Yes, that is correct. My hon. Friend has illustrated the point very well. When the insurance contributions were proposed to be increased, the Conservative Opposition voted against them.

<p>I shall not read it again. In the Conservative Party's manifesto there is a chapter headed "Small businesses". The Conservatives promised to do certain things. They said:
<q>The creation of new jobs depends to a great extent on the success of smaller businesses.</q>
That is true to a certain extent. The point is that small businesses have understandably been feeling the brunt of the recession. A number have gone into liquidation. Many self-employed people have found the going increasingly difficult in the past 18 months. Recession, large-scale unemployment and severe cuts in public expenditure are bound to have an effect on the self-employed.<br/>
It is not surprising that many self-employed people, who were promised a new deal by the Conservative Party in Opposition, feel very bitter. They are getting not a new deal but a raw deal. Many of the self-employed who voted Conservative are not likely to forget it or to do so again.<br/>
When there is so much pressure on the self-employed because of the economic situation, it is wrong to add an extra burden. On Second Reading the Secretary of State said that he recognised some of the anxieties. I hope that he will explore those anxieties when he replies to the debate.<br/>
This important aspect of the Bill cannot be taken on the nod. It is often said that people are cynical about politics. It is not surprising when what is promised by the party in Opposition becomes the opposite when that party forms the Government of the day.<br/>
Conservative Members should think seriously about and ponder upon the attitude that they have adopted towards small businesses and the self-employed. Not so long ago, at the general election and previously, they made promises that have come to naught. Unfortunately, there is no opposition to this measure from Conservative Members, even though it will increase the difficulties of the self-employed. For example, a number of people in my constituency who have been affected by the cuts in housing&#x2014;small builders and the rest&#x2014;will not be very cheerful when they discover that, on top of all the other problems they face, they will face increased national insurance contributions.<br/>
I therefore hope that the amendment will be seriously considered by the Government and that it will not be dismissed out of hand, because I believe that there is a great deal of merit in it.</p>

I should like to devote a few minutes to amendments Nos. 15 and 16. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for Perry Barr that we got the wording of amendment No. 16 right, otherwise it would not have been selected. The

amendment goes into the whole question of whether or not there should be an upper limit. We made it absolutely clear at the beginning that as we would have the opportunity, in the clause stand part debate, to go into the whole principle of the upper limit it would be unfair to press that amendment at this stage.<br/>
Amendment No. 15 would give some relief to some of the firms at the margin. It is the sort of amendment that the Secretary of State, at this time in the morning after a long sitting, ought to be prepared to concede in order to make some progress. That would be much welcomed by the self-employed. I suspect that the Secretary of State will not be able to make that sort of concession, because he will be worried about the progress of the Bill and the fact that there may have to be a Report stage, which can be avoided if no amendments are passed.<br/>
It would be a tragedy if, because the Government are so determined to chase the Bill through with such speed, he is not even prepared to consider a small amendment such as No. 15, which would do a lot to ease some of the problems of the self-employed.</p>

Of course, they will not be given that opportunity.<br/>
One of my hon. Friends referred to the number of his constituents who send letters perhaps congratulating the Government on their policy as it affects the self-employed&#x2014;inasmuch as it puts many of them into financial difficulties. It is significant to note that for years before I became a Member of the House Members of Parliament were frequently loaded down by mail from self-employed constituents who objected in principle&#x2014;despite the efforts made by the Labour Government&#x2014;to their existence and to the sort of measures that they were introducing, because they felt that such measures attacked their interests.<br/>
Many are now embarrassed, and it is only when one faces the self-employed across the business table that one finds that they are willing to pour out their hearts. I often ask them whether they will be willing to provide me with correspondence that I can use on the Floor of the House in debate. Few are willing to provide that correspondence. They cannot come to terms with the new reality that it is the Labour Party that stands for their interests and that the Conservative Party is letting them down.<br/>
When I talk about letting them down, it might be interesting to reflect on the comments of the present Secretary of State for Industry on 11 October 1977, in a pamphlet entitled "Small Business&#x2014;Big Future". I am sure that Conservative Members will remember the publication of that document. It was produced by a committee chaired by the present Under-Secretary of State for Industry. In the foreword to that document, the Secretary of State for Industry outlined the need for a completely new economic climate. He said:
<q>Governments cannot create prosperity"&#x2014;</q>
which was followed by a further pearl of wisdom:
<q>but they can prevent other people from creating it".</q>
That is what this Government are doing. They are preventing other people from creating prosperity. We all


know that many hundreds of thousands of self-employed people art; being prevented from creating prosperity. The Under-Secretary went on to say:
<q>At present, that is what the Labour Government is doing"&#x2014;</q>
The cheek of it! He continued:
<q>Nothing less is needed for the revival of small businesses than a new economic climate. We believe that our approach and our proposals will create the conditions in which firms, both large and small, can thrive, prosper and expand.</q></p>

<p>Those were the comments of the Secretary of State for Industry. It is not surprising, and it is significant, that although the Conservative Benches have been fairly full the Secretary of State for Industry has not attended the debate. Perhaps he thought that some Labour Members would find it irresistible to bring forward quotations such as I have just made.<br/>
It is interesting that that same document&#x2014;"The Campaign Guide Supplement" for the Conservative Party in 1978&#x2014;said of the unemployed:
<q>In December l977, the Government announced new national insurance rates under which the self-employed, as from April 1978 will have their 8 per cent. earnings-related contribution cut to 5 per cent., and their flat rate contributions reduced from &#x00A3;2&#x00B7; 56 for week for men and &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;55 for women to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;90 for both men and women.</q>
The Conservative Party then claimed the credit. The document continued:
<q>These changes are a result of pressure exerted on the Government by the Conservative Party and the small firm sector".</q>
We are entitled to know what that same small firm sector is saying.</p>

<p>Does not my hon. Friend accept that the reason why the contribution went down from 8 per cent. to 5 per cent. was that the Labour Government recognised that in certain respects the benefits were being diminished, and we also wanted to end a burden that was the subject of criticism by the self-employed? Basically, we recognised that if the benefits diminished the contributions should also diminish. The Conservative Government are doing the reverse. They are reducing the benefits and increasing the contributions.</p>

<p>That is something which one notes about all the legislation that the Government have introduced in this area. They seem to be increasing contributions all round while reducing benefits. I have just been informed that there is in the House one of the hon. Members responsible for producing the document, and I cannot believe that the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Patten) will be able to resist the opportunity of intervening to comment on the words that he wrote two years ago.<br/>
3.30 am<br/>
It would be wrong for me to finish without commenting on the wider implications for small firms that will stem from any increase in any of their expenditure. All hon. Members know that small firms are going through a difficult period. I do not blame the Government alone. There is an international recession, and the Government's inability to follow a policy in line with the monetary targets that they set is only part of the problem.<br/>
Small firms are suffering other problems. Many have properties that are subject to old lease agreements. With the fall in rental values of property, many small companies arc paying rents that they would not be paying if their lease

fell in tomorrow and had to be renegotiated. A number of charges fall on small businesses stemming from agreements made before the recession, and they should be taken into account by the Government when they introduce charges that affect small businesses.<br/>
A major problem affecting small firms is the collapse of demand. Hon. Members who were present at yesterday's meeting when the Retail Consortium outlined the problems in the economy will appreciate that it was clear from the document and the subsequent discussion that the downturn in demand is destroying much of our retail sector. Unless we preserve that sector, we shall damage considerably the possibility of its future expansion.<br/>
It may be easy to close a firm merely by putting a padlock on the door. But companies are far more difficult to reopen, and any firm that is forced out of business due to a policy introduced by the Government which effectively clobbers the cash flow of the company is in a position which could have been avoided if the Government had pursued another strategy.<br/>
In introducing any policy that may affect small businesses, the Government should reflect in depth on the possible damage that may be caused by that policy, because they may force out of business a company that will not be able to start up again and may have to lay off labour, which will fall as a burden on the Exchequer through unemployment and supplementary benefit payments.<br/>
After the memorable statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer which led to a row that lasted all week and clearly shook the Prime Minister and the Government, I asked a question which remains unanswered. I asked how industry and business would be affected&#x2014;</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours) has read out a number of statements issued by the paid propagandists of the Conservative and Unionist Party before the general election. They included a personal contribution setting out the hopes, aspirations and dreams of the man who is now Secretary of State for Industry.<br/>
In relation to small businesses, the Secretary of State for Industry was entitled to have his dreams. To anyone who thought about it, they may have seemed rather strange and to be based on some perverse Chicago economic doctrines. Nevertheless, the right hon. Gentleman was entitled to them, and to some extent we are criticising them with hindsight, because we know that what has happened to small businesses since the Government took office has been extremely bad.<br/>
But perhaps even more criticism can be levelled at the Secretary of State for Social Services, because he, apparently, does not realise even now that things are going badly. When he spoke in Cardiff on 19 April he said, according to the official press statement from Conservative Central Office:


<q>The list of measures to help small businesses is a long and impressive one. Already there are signs that the climate is changing. Up and down the country there is beginning to be"&#x2014;</q></p>

<p>I was attempting to demonstrate that, despite the present economic circumstances of small businesses, the Government are proposing to introduce a further imposition on them by way of this increase in the national insurance contribution for the self-employed.<br/>
That springs partly from the apparent view of the Secretary of State for Social Services, as enunciated in his Cardiff speech, that things are actually improving for small businesses. He went on to say that new businesses were starting up and new ideas were being developed. That simply is not true. As my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) has pointed out, the number of bankruptcies is increasing while the number of new registrations is going down.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend may be a little behind the times in suggesting that new ideas are not developing. The Prime Minister made a speech last night in Cardiff in which she said that a major plank in her programme was now constructive intervention&#x2014;which sounds very much like a U-turn to me.</p>

<p>I am sure that many people in small businesses in Wales would look forward to constructive intervention. I fear that a lot of people in Wales and in the rest of the country will find what the Government are proposing tonight to be destructive intervention, because it will destroy or reduce some of the funds at present available to small businesses and the self-employed, to whom the Government have attached so much importance in their economic policy.<br/>
The Secretary of State pointed out in his Cardiff speech that when larger firms invest it is often in new labour-saving machinery, so that increased output may not mean increased employment. He added, rather exaggerating his case:
<q>If small firms start up, then because they are labour-intensive more jobs are at once created.</q>
That has always been a doubtful theory, though it applies in some cases. Nevertheless, on the right hon. Gentleman's own views, by these measures he will reduce the amount of money left in the pockets of small entrepreneurs, whom the Government intend to galvanise, to keep in their businesses and do whatever it is that small entrepreneurs are supposed to do with their money when putting it into their businesses.<br/>
It is not simply that the Secretary of State for Industry was indulging in wild dreams. Despite all the evidence, the Secretary of State for Social Services still believes that those dreams are coming to fruition.<br/>
I hope that the Committee will support the amendments, which will help in small measure to protect the small businesses on which the Government have set such store.</p>

<p>We had an enlightening, somewhat strange debate about the problems of the self-employed. Perhaps "crocodile tears" is not too unkind a

phrase to use about what we have seen. I remember the rows when the Labour Government, immediately on coming to office in 1974, slapped up the class 4 rate for the self-employed from 5 per cent. to 8 per cent. It was only after two years' battling in the House and outside that they saw the light, and in 1978 the rate came back down to 5 per cent. Therefore, one treats the remarks of Labour Members about their sympathy with, and friendliness towards, the self-employed with several large handfuls of salt.<br/>
The hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) was right when he said that overwhelmingly the self-employed supported parties other than Labour, because the Labour Party stands for principles and attitudes that are anathema to the vast majority of those who have the freedom and enterprise to run their own businesses. Therefore, I am not sure how seriously we need to treat the panegyrics from the Labour Party.<br/>
The self-employed are an important part of economy. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Industry, the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mr. Mitchell), has carried out a notable task in the past 18 months in a whole range of measures designed to help the self-employed and small businesses. He deserves every commendation for that.<br/>
Contrasted with the swingeing penalty that Labour imposed on the self-employed, the increase proposed in the Bill&#x2014;from 5 per cent. to 5&#x00B7;75 per cent. in class 4&#x2014;is small. It is wholly in line with the increases in contributions that are being sought from other classes of contributor.<br/>
On an earlier amendment I referred to the method by which the contributions of the self-employed are calculated, as spelt out in the Government Actuary's report in 1977. It is fair to maintain precisely the same relativity as has been sustained over the past three or four years, pending the outcome of the investigation that we launched in October. That is exactly what the clause achieves.</p>

<p>Does not the right hon. Gentleman agree that at present&#x2014;it has been so for the past year or so, despite the efforts of the Under-Secretary of State for Industry&#x2014;the self-employed have been especially hard hit? There have been many bankruptcies. Surely it must be obvious to him that, however slight he might consider the increase to be, it will cause extra burdens to fall on those who are already under great pressure.</p>

<p>Businesses as a whole are going through a difficult period during a serious recession that is having an effect on the whole of the Western world.

<p>I feel that at a time when the Government consider it appropriate to raise a substantial additional sum by way of national insurance contributions&#x2014;the Bill was, of course, given a Second Reading&#x2014;the self-employed will accept that they should pay a strictly proportional share on the same basis as that which has applied in the past.<br/>
The hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) asked about the statutory sick pay scheme. He asked whether there would be further changes when the statutory sick pay scheme took effect. In the clause and the amendments, we are talking about the national insurance contributions paid by a self-employed person in respect of himself and his family. There is nothing in the Green Taper, or in what I have called the mark 2 scheme, that has an effect on that. The self-employed person in business on his own account who falls sick will be entitled to sickness benefit from the national insurance fund as at present. There will, however, be changes in certain arrangements for the first eight weeks for employees, including those in small firms and employees of the self-employed. As the House of Commons will remember, in any speech on the Gracious Speech I outlined the substantial changes that the Government were prepared to make in response to the representations following the publication of the Green Paper. It was a consultative paper. We have listened to the representations that have been made, including many from my hon. Friends, and have come forward with a package of changes that have received a fairly warm welcome. There is no question of two changes as the hon. Member for Perry Barr suggested. We are talking of two different matters.<br/>
I am not sure that I can add much more to the debate. We have had long speeches from the hon. Members for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett), for Keighley and for Workington (Mr. Campbell-Savours). However, apart from saying that a burden would be added to the self-employed, I am not sure that they said very much. It is a small additional burden that is being added that is directly proportional to that which others are being asked to accept.</p>

<p>I shall make a brief contribution. The Secretary of State has been rather demeaning about our contributions and comments. I do not think that he is fair in answering the debate in such a brief way and saying that the loss of revenue would be about &#x00A3;9 million and, therefore, he cannot recommend the Committee to accept the amendments. It is such a small amount that we are justified in saying that the burden may be disproportionate having regard to the economic difficulties which small businesses, including the self-employed, are now undergoing.<br/>
The Secretary of State nude slighting remarks about the tone of our contributions. He said that the Labour Government did not help small businesses, so why should he take notice of our comments. I believe that the right hon. Gentleman used the phrase "crocodile tears". I remind him that we, the Labour Government, set up small firms information centres and the small firms counselling service nation-wide, involving the expertise of small businesses, including the self-employed. We introduced

various grant schemes, such as the market entry guarantee scheme, to help small firms exporting&#x2014;which the right hon. Gentleman's Government have continued, so it must have had value; but we introduced it. We, the Labour Government, had a small firms employment subsidy scheme to give direct cash assistance and stimulus to small firms to take on new employees, contributing to the employment of some 50,000 people.</p>

<p>I shall try very hard.

<p>I do not want to follow that path. However, it is fair, as I have done already, to emphasise that the Labour Government's record throughout their term of office with regard to small firms is very reasonable indeed. It is wrong for the Secretary of State to say that our comments tonight are not made from any genuine concern. Our record in office demonstrates that we have genuine concern. Many small firms claim that the CBI does not represent them accurately.<br/>
The increase may well tilt the balance for a small firm's existence&#x2014;possibly a self-employed person employing a few people. It is no good the Secretary of State coming out with such platitudes as that the resilience of small firms will see them through. He knows, I know and the remainder of the House, including the Tory Members, knows that small firms are under great pressure and are increasingly going to the wall&#x2014;to the bankruptcy courts.</p>

<p>Is it not significant that when the Secretary of State referred to the international recession and its effect on small businesses he did not refer to the need to insulate them against it?

<p>I shall conclude my remarks. I do not want to be accused of self-justification. I am picking up the Minister's attack. It is not unfair to say that self-justification occurs a few times too many.<br/>
The insurance increase may well tilt many small firms into bankruptcy. That is a danger and we do not want it to happen. That applies not only to small firms. This is not a good way of raising revenue. It is a bad part of a bad Bill. The self-employed will be affected by this clause and other groups by other clauses. That is why the Government should pursue alternative means.<br/>
We are opposed to the Bill, but we have tabled our amendments in a spirit of compromise. We are doing what the <i>Daily Express, The Sun</i> and the <i>Daily Mail</i> want, and that is to be a united and constructive Opposition.

<p>My hon. Friend referred to the undoubted burden that the self-employed will face from these increases. The Secretary of State regarded that as a slight matter, as no extra burden. However, not one Conservative Member has argued on matters related to the self-employed. Bearing in mind how frequently the Conservative Party claims to represent small business and the self-employed, is it not amazing that Conservatives do not argue points on this subject?</p>

<p>The Secretary of State said that the majority of the self-employed support the Conservative Party. That raised a cheer from his Back Benchers. But he and his hon. Friends know that while that was true in 1979 it is true no longer. As the self-employed have experienced the bitterness and difficulties of being governed by a Conservative Administration, they have shifted their allegiance towards the Labour Party to provide them with the Government they need.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Weatherill, for granting a clause stand part debate. We recognise that during the debates on the amendments we explored a great deal of what is in the clause, but there is one matter which, for technical reasons, could not be brought within the Bill and we appreciate the opportunity to raise it now.<br/>
We attempted to raise the matter in our new clause 2, but it was not technically in order and could not be brought into order. The point at issue is the upper limit for contributions. We had some discussions on this matter earlier, in the context of what we saw as an unfairness between the 17 per cent. lift at the bottom and the 22 per cent. lift at the top. We felt chat that constituted an element of unfairness between the rich and the poor, deliberately brought in under the Bill.<br/>
There is, however another aspect that I wish to raise. If we are right in saying that the clause&#x2014;and, indeed, the Bill and what has been said by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#x2014;represents the development of a poll tax&#x2014;a reduction in the Treasury element, with taxation coming later&#x2014;perhaps we should treat it as a form of taxation and inject into it something of the social justice and fairness that we associate with taxation. The great advantage, in social terms, of taxation over contributions is that there can be graduations and social fairness.<br/>
We think that, on the figures that have been given, there is an element of social injustice here, and not parity of treatment. Secondly, by having a certain ceiling&#x2014;now proposed at &#x00A3;200&#x2014;there is an area of contributions that could be covered if we were to abolish the upper ceiling &#x2014;an area of contributions that could help to finance the national insurance fund, which has brought all this on our heads over the last two weeks. If the contributions are to be used in the pension concept as a form of taxation, and if that is to be treated in all ways as a form of taxation, let us ensure that those who are richest pay more.<br/>
The problem that we had was to relate that to the return in benefits, because we wished to be just to the rich. It would not be possible, on the one hand, to treat as a form of contributions unlimited payment over that if it was technically an insurance scheme without some return. Equally, we are not prepared to allow that return to reach inordinate levels of benefit. Therefore, it would have been necessary to associate with it continually downward graduations of benefits in return for the contributions paid. That would make some sense of the concept that is developing of using national insurance pension methods as a form of tax to deal with an economic crisis.<br/>
Quite apart from that immediate consideration, other ideas are now emerging, such as the reduction in the Treasury element &#x2014; the 18 to 14 per cent. element. There is also the breaking of the consensus that was established when Brian O'Malley spoke on our behalf as a Minister. There was a general consensus on pension problems, allied to the problem that affected the Conservative Party, namely, the question of private pensions.<br/>
All those things are getting cracked. The social basis of national insurance is getting cracked. Using the contributions to the fund in the way that we have seen over the last fortnight is cracking that consensus. Because of that, it is time that we considered the matter afresh. If we require revenue&#x2014;and the Government say that this is a source of revenue &#x2014; is there not now a case for the upper limit to be abolished?<br/>
We should like to hear the Minister's views. I am sorry that the Secretary of State is not here. On the other hand, a Treasury Minister is on the Government Front Bench and he might like to reply to the debate. This is a serious matter. It is one that should be considered, because it has been brought to the forefront by the actions of the Government. If they wish to refer to the consensus, we may choose to be more considerate. If not, we shall have to give serious consideration to the matter.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1790028" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1226.0" hansard_membership_id="8351" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19824" speakername="Mr. Race" colnum="1226" time="04:15:00">
<p>The case for abolishing the upper Limit is very strong. I shall contrast the Government's attitude to the upper limit with their attitude to the lower limit. The Government's attitude is scandalous. They say that they will increase the upper earnings limit by 22 per cent. That is an increase by the full amount. That means that they want to protect the highest-paid in society from this form of taxation and they are prepared to engage in that kind of policy for their own supporters, who are the highest paid in society. Yet they are not prepared to embark upon a policy of protecting the lowest-paid from their policy. That is the political contrast that needs to be made in this debate. The lower threshold is frozen at &#x00A3;27 per week. The upper limit is increased to the maximum possible under the primary legislation.<br/>
If and when national insurance contributions become tax-deductible there may be a different policy on the question of the upper earnings limit. Once national insurance contributions become tax-deductible, part of the pressure to protect the highest-paid in society from this kind of approach will disappear from the Treasury's thinking, because the ability of those in the highest-earnings section to trade off their national insurance contributions against tax may be a very attractive proposition. Some may argue that their contributions should be brought into the tax net for that purpose. For a person earning large amounts it is very important that he should be able to trade off some of his contributions against income.<br/>
This measure is inequitable, because at the same time as the Government are increasing contributions they are cutting benefits. An argument that has been used in the past is that increases in contributions protect the value of benefits. That is not an argument that can be sustained by this Government at this time, because of their action in the Social Security (No. 2) Act, which cuts benefits this year and provides for the Government to cut benefits by specified amounts in the next financial year. That is a denial of the principle that increases in contributions protect benefits.<br/>
This is an argument not about social welfare or social insurance but about income tax. That is why the upper earnings limit has been pushed to the limit, and that is why the Government are indexing the higher tax bands. They are trying to protect the better-paid from increasing unemployment. As has been said, the people will draw their own conclusions. They will see national insurance contributions as part of the stoppages that they suffer every week. People will not be able to distinguish between national insurance contributions and the amount of income tax that they pay each week, just as many council tennants do not distinguish between the amount of rent and the amount of rates that they pay each week. It is the overall sum that matters.<br/>
Those at the lower end of the income scale will contrast their position with that of the higher-paid, who have once again been protected against the economic crisis. This measure is presumably part of the incentive package that the Conservative Party pledged to introduce before it came into office. When will we see a quantifiable result from that so-called incentive package?</p>

<speech hansard_id="1790029" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1227.0" hansard_membership_id="93" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2692" speakername="Mr. Field" colnum="1227" time="04:15:00">
<p>This debate will have been time well spent if it results in a clear statement from the Under-Secretary on why the Government cannot lift the ceiling. Those who have listened to and participated in the debates this week have formed the impression that the Government would like to lift the ceiling but that there are immutable forces acting against that.<br/>
There seem to be two forces at work. First, we are told that if the ceiling is raised it will break a crucial part of the pension settlement of 1975. I have talked to some of those who helped to formulate the 1975 Act. They are certain that the principle behind setting the ceiling was simple. They were concerned that the graduated national insurance contributions should hit a cut-off point just before reaching the higher tax rates. If that is so, the Budget changes, particularly those made in 1979, allow the Government to operate on that front.<br/>
We are all aware that the income tax bands have been greatly widened. The first band at the higher rate is now at a considerably higher level. If the Government wish to stick to the argument that there was some agreement in the Social Security Pensions Act 1975, will they spell it out? Do the Government maintain that those who have not contracted out, and who are now asked to pay a graduated contribution over a wider band of income, will have a significant effect on pensions in the private sector? I should like an answer. These are important questions to which all of us, including Conservative Members, would like answers.<br/>
It would be foolish for anyone to think that this is the last Bill of this kind that we shall see in this Parliament. Because of the Government's difficulty in meeting their monetary and public sector borrowing requirement targets, there will be a similar Bill next year. The argument that at a time of growing unemployment it would be wrong to put any of the increased cost of national insurance on employers and that therefore the total weight of the increase should be put on employees would gain greater weight in the country if the employees' contributions could be graduated in some way. That could be achieved if the ceiling were raised and if we took out of national insurance taxation those at the very bottom.<br/>
What is the argument to which the Government are sticking at this late stage in this one-week Bill? Is it something connected with the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 that prevents them from operating on the ceiling? If so, for the first time this week will they spell out what that connection is? If not, what is the reason? Am I right in thinking that those who drew up the 1975 Act saw it purely in terms of preventing those who were paying the old surtax or the higher rates of tax also paying graduated contributions above the then ceiling?<br/>
These are important, not academic, questions because as each year of this Parliament passes we shall have similar Bills to the one that we are considering today. If we can build some flexibility into the system by getting extra

revenue from those at the top to make national insurance taxation less regressive, the passage of the next Bill may be slightly easier than this one.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1790030" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1228.0" hansard_membership_id="2273" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13240" speakername="Mrs. Chalker" colnum="1228" time="04:15:00">
<p>The questions that have been posed in this stand part debate were put forward earlier by the hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field). I shall seek to answer those questions.<br/>
Whereas some hon. Members may feel that there is a strong argument for the abolition of the upper earnings limit, the Government do not. At the risk of repeating what I said in earlier debates, I shall try to make clear one of the firm reasons why we do not believe that with the arrangements that we have in the Social Security Pensions Act 1975 it would be advisable, practicable or even possible to abolish the upper earnings limit.<br/>
If the upper earnings limit were removed there would be no limit on the size of the pension that could be earned by the very high earners. If we were to limit that pension entitlement and at the same time were to remove the upper earnings limit, those high earners would not be getting value for their contributions.<br/>
There are several reasons why it would not be possible to remove the upper earnings limit. First, as I have said, we need an upper earnings limit for pension purposes and it needs to be fixed at about the existing level to accommodate the contracting-out arrangements. Those contracting-out arrangements represented the fundamental principle on which agreement was reached between all parties in the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. The contribution rates for the contracted-out would run at the full rate up to the lower earnings limit, the contracted-out rate from there up to the upper earnings limit, and the full rate from the upper earnings limit upwards.<br/>
If we were to abolish the upper earnings limit the change would emphasise the need to secure much greater accuracy in the employer's deduction documents in regard to earnings in the middle range. Although I cannot expect hon. Members to understand the detail of this, I can assure them that from my investigation and from the working processes that aim to get the pensions paid accurately it is crucial that the accuracy in the deduction documents that are handled by the employers should be maintained.<br/>
4.30 am<br/>
We would be in the state of having three variable rates, because without an upper earnings limit, the additional components for the State scheme pension simply could not be calculated without having three separate calculations. The guaranteed minimum pensions, which are a prime feature of the second pension scheme, depend entirely on these records.<br/>
I am not saying that at some future time, when all companies were computerised and kept their records absolutely perfectly, such a complicated arrangement could not be achieved, but I must tell the Committee that, from my knowledge of the present system and from the present information supplied to Government Departments by employers, it simply could not be done within the confines of the present system and the present computer capacity of a large number of employers. We would produce total chaos in the calculation of the added components. While that is not the complete argument, it is a severe practical restriction on what could be done at present.<br/>
We know that there have been heavy errors in the present deduction document recording system because of


the inability of many employers to fill in the documents with the accuracy that is required to enable us to calculate the additional components and the guaranteed minimum pension that depend on them.<br/>
We have had so many years of political football with regard to the pension scheme.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1790032" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1229.1" hansard_membership_id="2273" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13240" speakername="Mrs. Chalker" colnum="1229" time="04:15:00">
<p>We are talking about the upper earnings limit. Perhaps some Labour Members do not realise what an achievement it was in 1975 to reach this degree of success between the private occupational schemes and the State scheme. An enormous part has been played by industry. We sometimes forget that when we talk about the difficulties experienced by Government in calculating things correctly. Industry, particularly the pensions industry, has put in an enormous amount of work in order to accommodate the 1975 legislation. It would be totally undesirable, as well as quite unfeasible in the present computer capacity of employers' schemes, to start disturbing or dismantling the arrangements so soon after they have starred.<br/>
One hon. Member suggested that we might make national insurance contribution tax-deductible. Some hon. Members may remember that before 1965 part of the national insurance contributions that went towards the taxable basic pension was indeed tax-deductible, while the part of the contributions that went towards the non-taxable short-term benefits was not. In other words, they were not taxed twice. That was altered in 1965 by the right hon. Member for Cardiff, South-East (Mr. Callaghan), I believe. I shall give the reasns why the relief was then finally abolished and personal allowances increased at the same time.<br/>
First, there was a regressive anomaly in this. By that I mean that the higher an individual's contributions the higher was his relief. The compensating personal allowance was able to benefit more people than the original lax deductibility of the national insurance contributions. Looking back on old schemes, I have no doubt that the administrative complications between taxing one part and not taxing the other part of national insurance contributions were an added factor.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, North (Mr. Howell) asked some time ago what would happen if relief were applied to contributions and what would be the cost. It would be between &#x00A3;1&#x00BD;billion and &#x00A3;2 billion, which would then have to be made up by increases either in contribution rates or in taxes.<br/>
I hope that I have said enough at this late hour to explain that it is not feasible to dc away with the upper earnings limit, and there is not as strong a case for abolition as some hon. Members, would have us believe. We must maintain a period of constant working in our pensions industry if we are ever to make sure that those second pensions, for which we are encouraging people to contribute either through their occupational scheme or through the State scheme, are to become a reality without putting insuperable burdens once more on the British people. I hope that Labour Members will see the sense and wisdom that was shown by the late Brian O'Malley when we achieved this consensus before, and which I hope we shall retain this evening.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister for making such efforts in anticipating the nature of the discussion and

preparing for it. However, she will accept that it is less satisfactory to an Opposition to be told that there are difficulties than to have an outright rebuttal of the arguments involved. We are not satisfied.<br/>
On the question of the unevenness of payment, the concept that could be developed if we move towards abolition is to regard the insurance fund as a social fund, in the same way as taxation is a social income which is used for the good of the community and paid into according to the means of the individuals in the community.<br/>
There are considerable problems on private pension funds, and I admit that I do not know them. I have held this position for 48 hours, and I accept that there are major difficulties. I know that this area requires investigation. We can never use the practical difficulties of schemes as an excuse. It has happened too often in history that the practical has been used to prevent thought. I hope that the Department will look into the matters as deeply as possible&#x2014;certainly Labour Members will&#x2014;to see whether there is progress to be made. The attitude of the Government&#x2014;I am being as pleasant as I can&#x2014;has broken much of the consensus on both sides of the House in relation to the pension structure and its involvement and co-operation with the private sector. We shall have to look at the matter over the next 12 or 24 months.</p>

<p>We wish only to ask about the order-making powers in subsection (4B). Is it right that there is no mechanism for changing the figures of 0&#x00B7;1, 4 and 0&#x00B7;2 per cent by order? If it is desired to change them, will it require primary legislation? Are the figures cumulative if used under subsection (4A)? In other words could the figure be 0&#x00B7;1 per cent. one year and change the following year?</p>

<p>The answer to the hon. Gentleman's second question is "Yes", the figures could be used cumulatively. We have made no decision on the rate of contribution for any years after 1981&#x2013;82, so we cannot say in what circumstances the powers in clause 3(3) will be used. The subsection merely corrects an anomaly in section 122 of the principal Act. At the moment, one can only vary the NHS contributions as a consequence of changes in the national insurance contribution rates and

limits. The purpose of the power is simply to provide flexibility to change the NHS contributions independently of the national insurance contribution rates.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
The effect of the clause has basically been debated throughout the debates on most of the other amendments, certainly those to clause 1. What we are seeking to do is to put into practice what many of us have advocated, namely, that a person should not pay the national insurance contribution on earnings that are less than the lower earnings limit. In other words, we want there to be a national insurance threshold in the same way as there is a tax threshold.<br/>
We admit that we do not know how much the new clause would cost. We suspect that it would be a substantial amount, but we have had no time effectively to cost it, because of the way in which the Bill is being bounced through the House of Commons. [HON. MEMBERS: "A week."] No. It may be that the Bill has been in print for more than a week, but the Government secured the Second Reading of the Bill only on Monday. There has not been much time to consider what new clauses should be tabled.<br/>
We believe that there is a case to be made for looking it the upper and lower earnings limits anyway. By implication, we have not quite tied ourselves to the complete abolition of the upper earnings limit We want to review the whole system. As regards low-paid workers, there is a substantial case for having a national insurance threshold. We cannot see anything technically defective in that method of proceeding. It would require a simple form of words to be inserted into the principal Act.</p>

<p>I had thought that it might be for the convenience of the Committee if I heard the Opposition arguments first, but if it will be helpful for me to state the Government's views on the clause I am happy to do so.<br/>
I must tell the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) that, with the possible exception of amendment No. 5, which would have renewed the entire revenue-raising function, this is by far the most momentous amendment tabled by the Opposition. It would have the effect of reducing the employee contributions by &#x00A3;1.7 billion, the employer contributions by &#x00A3;2.5 billion and the employer surcharge by &#x00A3;800 million. I make that a sum of about &#x00A3;4 billion. We shall be interested to see whether the Opposition vote in favour of their clause.<br/>
What the Opposition have not recognised is that this first slice of income on which contributions is paid by anyone whose income is higher than the lower earnings limit is absolutely crucial to the whole structure of the 1975 pension scheme and is the basis on which agreement was reached with the occupational pension interests.<br/>
Perhaps I should explain to the Committee why this is so. The Committee will remember that it was agreed in 1975 that the scheme would remain contributory and that people would receive benefits and pensions in return for their contributions. The basis of the new scheme was that the retirement pension would consist of two elements. First, there would be 100 per cent, replacement of income for the first slice of earnings. That was up to the lower earnings limit. Then, for income above the lower earnings limit, there would be a 25 per cent, replacement once the scheme had become fully mature, once one had the full 20 years of contributions. That would apply to earnings lying between the lower and the upper earnings limits. Nevertheless, contributions were to be levied at a uniform rate on all earnings up to the upper earnings limit. That was the basis on which the scheme was constructed.<br/>
Thus pensioners will get a very good return on the contributions paid on the first slice of earnings and a less good return on the rest of their contributions. It was for that reason that it became so much more important after 1975 to ensure that as many people as possible had an opportunity to ensure that their contribution records, up to the lower earnings limit, were as complete as possible. That was an important part of their entitlement.<br/>
5.30 am<br/>
It was for that reason that credits were introduced for sickness and unemployment. In addition, the home responsibility protection was put in to ensure that people who had interrrupted work would still qualify for a full pension. Contributors were given the opportunity to pay voluntary class 3 contributions to repair gaps in their contribution records. All of that was to ensure that emphasis was placed on the need to secure a full record of contributions in respect of the lowest slice of earnings, the very slice that the new clause seeks to remove from contribution liability. For the slice of earnings between the lower and upper earnings limit, pension return was to be


strictly contribution-related, and there was to be no help by way of credits, home responsibility protection, class 3 and so on.<br/>
The back-up for ensuring that as many people as possible qualify for the basic pension&#x2014;based on contribution records&#x2014;is linked to that first slice of income. It goes right to the heart of the second pension scheme and to the arrangements negotiated and agreed with the occupational pension interests outside. If the Opposition are hooked on trying to exempt that first slice of income, the entire scheme will have to go back to the drawing board. The whole shooting match will have to be renegotiated.<br/>
The hon. Member for Renfrewshire, West (Mr. Buchan) will discover, as he becomes acquainted with pensions interests outside, that the last thing they want is to see that concordat upset. After "ping-pong pensioneering" from Boyd-Carpenter to Crossman, from Crossman to Joseph and from Joseph to Castle, the Howe-O'Malley concordat was reached. They want to stick with that. The new clause would destroy its basis. In addition to costing &#x00A3;4 billion, it would destroy the basis of the 1975 scheme. I cannot recommend my hon. Friends to do that.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1790070" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1239.0" hansard_membership_id="8351" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19824" speakername="Mr. Race" colnum="1239" time="04:15:00">
<p>There is no reason why the House should not agree to &#x00A3;4 billion of reflation. Conservative Members may believe that it would be damaging to increase the public sector borrowing requirement by that amount. My hon. Friends and I do not. We want the economy to expand and unemployment to fall. To do that, one could increase public expenditure. The Secretary of State's argument to the effect that we cannot afford &#x00A3;4 billion does not stand up.<br/>
One must consider the differences between the national insurance scheme and income tax. Why on earth is tax not paid on income below the tax threshold when under the national insurance scheme there is an impost on income below &#x00A3;27&#x00B7;50 a week? That is an unjustified impost on the lowest paid. We must find a way of protecting the pensions of those who are part-time workers. They pay a substantial marginal national insurance rate once they earn &#x00A3;27&#x00B7;50 per week. If the pensions system is based on people being discriminated against in that unjustified way, it ought to be changed. There ought to be a method of dealing with it during this Parliament.<br/>
I believe that the new clause is correct in identifying this as a problem to be rectified. Many low-paid workers who are seriously affected by this form of taxation, whereby they pay national insurance contributions on anything below &#x00A3;27 a week, will welcome any attempt by Parliament to review that situation, especially as many more people will be brought into that position by virtue of the freezing of the lower threshold.<br/>
For those reasons, the new clause is entirely justified. I hope that we shall vote for it.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1790071" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1239.1" hansard_membership_id="1152" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2420" speakername="Mr. Andrew F. Bennett" colnum="1239" time="04:15:00">
<p>The Secretary of State seems to think that the so-called concordat or agreement that he made can be infinitely varied and yet still hold good. Having broken the earnings link with pensions and having in the Bill started to put in extra expenses for the National Health Service and on cutting back the Treasury supplement, he is altering the rules and the agreement. If

he is changing matters in that way, it seems reasonable for us to insist on making this form of taxation not regressive, as it is now, but more progressive.<br/>
Clearly, there will be much argument on this issue in the future. We now have an extremely regressive tax. Introducing an allowance or pushing back a lot of expenditure into the income tax system rather than the national insurance system is the only way to make the system more progressive and less regressive.<br/>
Therefore, I hope that, as an indication of our feeling that the national insurance system is particularly regressive, we shall vote for the new clause. We are dissatisfied with the present system. We want a change. We do not accept that the concordat that was made has any value now because of the way that the Government have torn so many holes in it.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1790072" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-12-11a.1240.0" hansard_membership_id="179" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3234" speakername="Mr. Rooker" colnum="1240" time="04:15:00">
<p>When moving the new clause, I said that I suspected that the cost was high. I still think that I should not put my figure on record. However, I can correct the Secretary of State's arithmetic. The figure is &#x00A3;5 billion, not &#x00A3;4 billion. My record shows that I have been prepared to put my hand into the taxpayer's, or the Government's pocket, for large sums. In this instance the sum is &#x00A3;5 billion.<br/>
I accept the point made by my hon. Friends that the fact that earnings up to the lower earnings limit pull in &#x00A3;5 billion show the unfairness in the system. In our own defence, because the wisdom of the Chair cannot be challenged, I must say that one of our intentions was to move new clause 2. One of our arguments would have been that one would basically pay for the other. But we could not do the costing in the time that the Government made available to the Committee.<br/>
Because it is not possible for the Opposition to put on record their support for a proposal such as that in the new clause 2 as the other side of the equation, I have to advise my hon. Friends that we would be putting our heads in a noose, and that we would regret. <i>[Interruption.]</i> What is wrong with that? It is all very well for the Conservative Members to come into the Chamber at 5&#x00B7;39 a.m. This is a debating Chamber. We have been seeking information during the past 13 hours, some of which has been satisfactory and some of which has not.<br/>
Given the fact that we cannot put the other side of the equation on record, I must advise my hon. Friends not to vote for the new clause. However, before Conservative Members pooh-pooh that fact, I should point out that the sum involved is the mythical surplus in the national insurance fund. It is of that sort of scale. It represents one-third of a year's outgoings in respect of the national insurance fund. It is roughly the same sum as the Government handed to the well-off within three or four weeks of taking office. A total of &#x00A3;5 billion is an enormous sum which people find difficult to comprehend. The fact remains that about &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;5 billion was handed out to the well-off.<br/>
However, as we cannot put the other side of the equation on the record, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.</p>

<p>The threatened damage to secondary education which I put to the House tonight will be nationwide. It is causing deep concern to teachers and careers officers in all parts of the country. The full impact on parents and pupils has been deliberately blunted up to now, for the very good reason of not deterring pupils preparing for their examinations. Unfortunately, this low key can no longer be maintained.<br/>
The cause of the trouble is the radical alteration in supplementary benefit rules for school leavers flowing from the Social Security Act 1980 and regulations made under it, applying from the end of the present school term. My case is that regulations which the Government have recently made can be unmade so as to restore the much more satisfactory previous position.<br/>
Until now, those who left school and signed on were immediately eligible for supplementary benefit. Likewise, child benefit ceased immediately on their leaving school. Under the drastically changed rules, supplementary benefit will not be available to school leavers until the nearest of three fixed days in each year, roughly corresponding with the end of school holidays. A pupil leaving at Christmas will be able to claim from the first Monday in January and an Easter school leaver will be able to claim on the first Monday after Easter Monday, but&#x2014;and this is the mischief&#x2014;a pupil staying on at school until May in order to sit CSE or GCE O-level examinations will not be able to claim benefit until the first Monday in September, and during this long period of delay child benefit will continue to be paid to the parents.<br/>
For a school leaver under 18 years of age living at home, the average net loss&#x2014;namely, the lost supplementary benefit minus the continuing child benefit&#x2014;will be, at the very least, more than &#x00A3;8 a week. In most cases it will be about &#x00A3;10&#x00B7;50. If the youngster is living away from home, his or her loss will be much greater. These figures mean that a 16-year-old who abandons examinations to leave at Easter will draw about &#x00A3;250 or more in supplementary benefit before his or her mates who stay on to take examinations can draw even a penny. If we take into account child benefit, which is paid not to the youngster but to the parent, the discrepancy becomes &#x00A3;159 at the very least. It is these serious sums that will obviously be a severe disincentive to some youngsters to stay at school to take examinations or even to prepare for them.<br/>
The group of youngsters most seriously affected will be the 40 per cent, of fifth formers old enough legally to leave school next Easter. It is expected that 327,000 pupils will be legally able to leave school in England at Easter next year. In 1979, which is the most recent year for which figures are available, only 14 per cent, of those entitled legally to leave at Easter actually did so. My fear&#x2014;it is not mine alone as it is the fear of informed opinion throughout the relevant professions and is now almost unanimous opinion&#x2014;is that next year the 14 per cent, will tragically grow. It is feared that when the deplorable facts are more widely known the percentage will grow seriously in the following year.<br/>
The new social security temptation will be added to the present attraction of leaving before examinations in order to get early into the desperate job queue and to have a first chance of YOP. The change comes at a most unsuitable time when modest examination qualifications probably seem to some school leavers not to provide much answer to unemployment. Equally, the change conies at this dreadful time when unemployment in the home will make it extremely difficult for many families to make the big financial sacrifice that will be called for to keep a child at school for examinations and when the child is unable to draw any supplementary benefit until September.<br/>
Within the schools, the damage will not be limited to the actual examination period or to children in their last few months at school. The Head Teachers' Association of the metropolitan borough of Kirklees describes the likely effect of these changes thus:
<q>There is no doubt that the prospect of sitting important examinations at the end of the fifth year is a powerful motivation to secondary school pupils. In the light of this new regulation, however, it is likely that substantial numbers of pupils will not be sitting such examinations, and that they may know this for two or three years before they actually leave. The implications of this situation both for the progress of these young people and for the work of the schools generally can only be described as daunting.</q>
It is said that under the previous rules supplementary benefit could be and sometimes was abused by youngsters signing on for the summer although firmly intending all the time to return to school in September and not really seeking work in a meaningful way. I am not hers to dispute that. However, that belongs, unfortunately, to a vanished age when full employment was rightly an objective of Governments and when young people did not have to panic about work opportunities after leaving school.<br/>
My case is that if there is any merit in the change it belongs to a time which has unfortunately gone. This change has been brought cut of a pigeon-hole at a most inappropriate moment.<br/>
The old regulations enabled the DHSS to recover benefits paid where there had been abuse if it was able to do so. In today's dreadful circumstances, it is much more likely that a youngster will genuinely be seeking work, probably desperately, in the summer. If he or she returns to school in September, it will be merely as an alternative to further prolonged unemployment.<br/>
There is also the question of GCE resits, which take place in the early part of the autumn term. A child who goes back for a GCE resit, which may be of great importance to his or her future career, and then leaves school having resat the examination in September will not be able to draw any benefit until the first Monday in January, which is another disincentive to taking worthwhile examinations.<br/>
Of course, cynics might wrongly allege that many fifth formers will leave at Easter anyway under today's grim conditions, irrespective of the benefit regulations. However, certainly on the evidence that has been made available to me&#x2014;and I have had a good deal&#x2014;that is not so. I cite, for instance, a typical comprehensive school in the Coins Valley constituency and give the figures of those who have left at Easter rather than staying on into the examination term. In 1978 only 10 out of 213 fifth form pupils who could have left at Easter did so. In 1979 it was 10 out of 231. In 1980 it was seven out of 213. That shows how anxious children and their parents are for them to take these examinations, as long as there is no manifest and serious financial discouragement.<br/>
I have heard it alleged&#x2014;and this I find extremely difficult to understand, at any rate in West Yorkshire and Greater Manchester, where my constituency lies&#x2014;that the summer months are not any good for job hunting anyway. The only possible grain of truth in that absurd and sweeping assumption is that perhaps apprenticeships tend to be recruited for in the autumn. Howev8r, unfortunately, in the North of England at any rate, the number of apprenticeships is dwindling rapidly. I entirely refute the general notion that the summer months are not suitable for job hunting. It is an out-of-date concept, if ever it had any serious validity.<br/>
These inhumane new regulations entirely ignore the very substantial cost nowadays of job hunting. A youngster going after a job has substantial fares to pay. He has to be properly dressed for the occasion, with an entirely different suit of clothes from the one that he or she wore at school. Then, it is important that visits are paid regularly to careers officers, which again require expensive fares.<br/>
I want to make it plain that my complaint is fully supported by at least the following bodies: the National Association of Head Teachers, the Society of Education Officers, the Institute of Careers Officers, the National Association of Probation Officers, the Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association, the well-known youth organisation Youth Aid and every secondary head teacher in the Colne Valley constituency. I have already mentioned the Kirklees Head Teachers' Association.<br/>
I wonder whether the Minister's constituency has made any representations on this point. I am also most anxious to know, and I am sure that the House will be, just what the extent was of the DHSS's careful consultations with educational interests and with the Department of Education and Science before the regulations were made. There is, I must confess, a prima facie suspicion that the old Whitehall insularity in which Departments do not readily take on board points from other Departments has prevailed in this case. I find it almost impossible to believe that the Department of Education and Science has willingly gone along with this backward step.<br/>
In the Standing Committee on the Bill, when the clause came up under which this regulation has been made, there was, unfortunately, no Liberal Member. However, the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) raised the matter. I must say that the Minister's arguments in Committee seem to me very thin. For instance, he stated:
<q>These proposals, however unwelcome they may be to the Committee, also provide a welcome relief in the burden on staff.</q>
That illustrates the futility of simply playing the numbers game with the Civil Service.<br/>
We all want to reduce the cost of bureaucracy, but playing the numbers game, talking of getting rid of a relatively few clerks at the cost of irrevocable damage to children's careers and the atmosphere of secondary schools, is entirely out of proportion. I register a further protest, as my party always has, against playing the numbers game with the Civil Service Reductions should be made in a much more scientific way.<br/>
These harsh regulations for leavers who stay on at school to sit examinations are unsoundly based, partly on the false idea that a person who has left school still regards school holiday periods as meaningful. That is quite unreal. Further, this mean device has been brought out of a Whitehall pigeon-hole at the worst and most inappropriate


time. Under conditions of full employment it might not have done anything like so much damage, but now the most disadvantaged young people will suffer and there will be a severe effect on motivation throughout secondary education.<br/>
I beg the Government at the least to take immediate action which is still open to them to prevent the change being made at the worst possible time for the welfare of children and for the well-being of our secondary schools.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Wainwright) for raising the question of the deferment of school leavers' entitlement to supplementary benefit. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Science had hoped to be here. I hope that the hon. Member will appreciate why that was not possible. My hon. Friend will, however, examine the matter with me, and I shall come to that matter later. I am aware that this issue has caused some concern in the last couple of weeks&#x2014;some of it rather alarmist in tone &#x2014; and it is helpful to have the opportunity to put on record the background and reasoning behind the change.<br/>
The change was proposed originally in "Social Assistance", a consultative document prepared by a team of officials and published in July 1978 under the previous Government. Under the old arrangements, a school leaver could claim benefit immediately on leaving school provided he was then over 16. Reviewing the effect of this, the team noted that, notwithstanding changes in statutory school leaving arrangements, recruitment practices of employers and the holiday expectations of the young people themselves were as often as not based on the assumption of starting work in the autumn. Entitlement to benefit in the period between leaving school and the end of the next holiday period was out of phase with holiday and employment practices and, in addition, had a number of unwelcome consequences.<br/>
A heavy burden was placed on unemployment benefit and supplementary benefit offices at a time when the staff were already under considerable pressure&#x2014;for example, in handling the uprating. It was a question not of saving posts but of other pressures in the offices at that time. Similarly, careers officers might have been hampered in their efforts to secure employment for those genuinely looking for work by also having to handle cases of people primarily using their services as an avenue to benefit. This tended to create an artificial picture of the extent of real unemployment amongst school leavers. Finally, there were temptations to abuse the system, as the hon. Member has recognised.<br/>
Benefit is, of course, payable only to those genuinely seeking work. Yet some young people quite genuinely do not know, since they are awaiting examination results, whether they have finally left school. And, less creditably, others might misrepresent their intentions in order to claim benefit.<br/>
"Social Assistance" received an extremely wide circulation. A number of outside educational interests were included on the distribution list, including the National Umion of Teachers, the National Association of

Head Teachers and the National Union of Students. The report's proposals were then the subject of extensive consultation.<br/>
The proposal attracted a great deal of attention&#x2014;indeed, throughout its consideration this change has been well publicised. Views tended to polarise. Some saw the proposal as an issue of principle that young people should be eligible for an income of their own right; that attitude goes rather wider than the question of deferment of benefit for a set period. Interestingly, the views of careers officers, who work with young unemployed people, were almost equally divided for and against the proposal. Those who supported the proposal tended to suggest that the immediate availability of benefit acted as an inducement to leave school, undermined a young person's determination to get a job and hampered careers officers' attempts at securing a placement.</p>

<p>I fear that I must speak from memory. The official bodies&#x2014;there are more than one&#x2014;were consulted. Bearing in mind the volume of correspendence that I received from individual careers officers and teachers, I am sure that they, in turn, had circulated the information sent to them in "Social Assistance" to their membership. I received widely flung correspondence and representations. They came from individuals and through the various associations that represent them. If I am in any way in error, I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
The Supplementary Benefits Commission, in its comments, concluded that it saw good reasons for making the change, provided that the interests of a number of special groups were safeguarded. It was particularly concerned that a young person's first encounter with the social security system might be in circumstances which encouraged him to misrepresent his intentions.<br/>
Following consideration of views on this and other changes&#x2014;and it must be remembered that this change is just one of very many in the revised supplementary benefits scheme&#x2014;the Government announced in a White Paper, Cmnd. 7773 published in November 1979, that they intended to proceed with the change recommended by the review team in "Social Assistance".<br/>
The change has been implemented by regulations through an interlocking amendment to the child benefit scheme, which extends entitlement to child benefit during the period of deferment, and a corresponding regulation dealing with entitlement in the revised, regulated supplememtary benefits scheme. But our intention to use regulations in that way has been put clearly on record in the House on a number of occasions. There is no validity in the suggestion that this has somehow been smuggled through by the back door. When introducing the Second Reading debate on 20 December 1979 on what is now the Social Security Act 1980, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State made clear that the change would be implemented, and he reiterated the reasoning behind the change.<br/>
It was also discussed, as the hon. Gentleman said, in greater detail during the Bill's Committee stage on 19 February 1980 on an amendment tabled by the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett). Indeed,


precisely the point on examinations was made on that ocasion and the educational implications were specifically raised. I remember the discussion well as it finished some time after five o'clock in the morning, which appears to be a regular habit. Since that occasion, the Government's intention to proceed has been reiterated on the record on a number of occasions&#x2014;for example, in reply to the hon. Gentleman on 2 June: <i>Hansard,</i> Volume 985, column 551<br/>
I have explained the background at some length because it seemed to me light to emphasise the careful consideration that has been given to this change over the last two years or so, the widespread consultation and discussion that preceded it and the specific attention to the educational implications in the course of taking the decision.<br/>
What will be the position of future school leavers? The hon. Gentleman referred to the position since 24 November. A 16-year-old school leaver will not be able to get benefit in his own right until the first supplementary benefit pay day after either the first Monday in January, the Monday after Easter Monday or the first Monday in September, whichever of those three is the first to follow the date of leaving. For that period, the children will continue to be treated as dependent on their parents. But the deferment will not apply to a number of special groups that can claim benefit in their own right while still at school. That undertaking was given to the Supplementary Benefits Commission. Those groups are young people who have a child of their own, orphans who are not being cared for by a guardian or otherwise maintained, young people who are estranged from their parents and living away&#x2014;a position mentioned by the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;and pupils whose handicap is such that they would be unlikely to obtain employment in the foreseeable future were they to leave school. Nor will the deferment affect those who have reached 19 by the time they leave school. We have, therefore, protected the special groups whom the Supplementary Benefits Commission was concerned to safeguard.<br/>
Treating school leavers as dependent on their parents in the period of deferment has the further effect that their parents will continue to be entitled to social security dependency additions in the period of deferment, as well as continuing to receive child benefit in respect of the school leaver. This is important in relation to the accusation that the change is hitting those least able to cope with the expense of the extended responsibility for their child.<br/>
The fact is that a family which is already receiving supplementary benefit and which contains a 16-year-old school leaver does not lose out by the change. This is because the non-householder scale rate to which a 16-year-old would become entitled is the same amount of money&#x2014;&#x00A3;13&#x00B7;10 a week&#x2014;as the dependency addition that the parent of such a child has included in the assessment of needs for the purposes of supplementary benefit. That is to say, total income of a family already on supplementary benefit is unaffected by the change in the entitlement rules. The parents get what the young person is denied. We have, therefore, in implementing the change, taken care to protect the families most in need.<br/>
We are not convinced that pupils will choose to sacrifice their longer-term career interests for the sake of short-term financial gain. Of course, the Government would be most concerned if pupils were dissuaded from

entering CSE or GCE examinations in order to be eligible for short-term financial gain, but, as I have said, we do not expect this to be the case, and I am sure that teachers need no guidance from the centre about advising their pupils on the value of obtaining qualifications. I have consulted my colleagues in the Department of Education and Science. They, with us, will pay careful attention to the number of entries in different parts of the country for public examinations in 1981.<br/>
I recognise the concern that this change has aroused. If there appears subsequently to be clear evidence that the change has had major unwelcome consequences, of course the Government will be prepared to review the position. We would have to take into account the wider considerations that I want to come to quickly in weighing the advantages and disadvantages of any further change. But I can assure the House that, should the fears that have been expressed prove valid, we shall look again at the merits of the change.<br/>
I should like to put the changes in the wider social context. Too often, Governments are accused of examining issues in a narrow context, ignoring the wider social choices that are at stake. This change is, by contrast, a clear example of a Government balancing priorities on expenditure and coming to a decision on where the money available might be deployed most usefully. As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, the proposal for change was just one in the wide-ranging report "Social Assistance". All discussions on the change have therefore to be set in the wider context. That has been a major task and it has entailed conscious decisions on the best use of money and staff time.<br/>
We have implemented the revised supplementary benefits scheme as a package, in which the cost of the improvements that we have been able to introduce is broadly balanced by the savings made elsewhere. I make no apology for that. Those who call for increased expenditure in this or that area ignore the reality of the total bill for the taxpayer that the accumulation of separate bids represents. Of course, the change we have made will save money. We expect there to be a net saving of some &#x00A3;4 millon a year after taking account of the increased child benefit cost. Some families will receive less assistance from the State than they might otherwise have done, but we have protected those most in need.<br/>
We have simplified many aspects of the supplementary benefit scheme which concern children. We now have three scale rates for children rather than five, with an enhanced benefit on the change over ages. We are offering more help to families with young children under the age of five. We have reduced from two years to one year the qualifying period for the higher-rate long-term benefit rates for claimants under pension age who are not required to register and be available for work. That will help disabled people and lone parents.<br/>
These were changes that we wanted to make, and those who have objected to the school leavers' changes have not suggested that we should go back upon them. But the improvements were bought at the price of savings elsewhere, and it seems to me that we exercised proper social priorities. Put simply, we believed that the money could be better used in other areas. The improvements that we made outweighed the disadvantages.<br/>
I repeat to the hon. Gentleman and to the House that should my colleagues at the Department of Education and Science, in their monitoring of what happens, find that


there are major welcome consequences of the type that the hon. Gentleman fears, the Government will be prepared to review the position. I think, however, that we have to bear in mind the weight of evidence on both sides of the case and see how we can bring together all the various opportunities for young people with the expanded youth opportuinites programme. We have to make sure that we

are doing the best and the right thing, and I hope that the considerations that will take place this year will enable us to come up with the right answer for this very difficult period for school leavers.<br/>
I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's courtesy in putting the debate over in the way that he has done.</p>
