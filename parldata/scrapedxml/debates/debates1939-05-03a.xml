<p>In recent statements I have made it quite clear that there is no foundation whatsoever for the charge that His Majesty's Government have adopted the policy of encircling Germany. What President Roosevelt proposed, and what I understand Herr Hitler to have offered, is the exchange of assurances of non-aggression, rather than a guarantee on a reciprocal basis such as


that recently given by His Majesty's Government to the Polish Government. His Majesty's Government would certainly be ready to consider proposals for an exchange of reciprocal assurances with the German Government.</p>

<p>His Majesty's Government were very happy to receive the Rumanian Foreign Minister in London between the 23rd and 26th April. As was stated in the official communiqu&#x00E9; issued after the conclusion of our conversations, the visit afforded a welcome oportunity for an exchange of views between M. Gafencu, my right hon.

<p>asked the Minister of Transport whether he is aware that the Grampian Electricity Supply Company has a statutory monopoly for the supply of electricity to the rural and agricultural areas in Western Stirlingshire; that the company has recently refused to carry its supplies into an area on the ground that guarantees have not been forthcoming for demands sufficient to meet an undefined percentage return upon its estimated capital expenditure; what is the percentage required; and what steps he is taking to see that the area in question is supplied with electricity at a reasonable rate?</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that under the Act of 1922, under which this concern operates, they may require a prospective profit of 25 per cent. upon their capital outlay before they will take electricity into a rural area; and does he think that that is encouraging electrical development in this country?</p>

Since then the march of events has made it necessary to embark upon the largest and most costly pro-

<p>As regards the first part of the question, the information for which the hon. Member asks could not be made available without very considerable research, which I do not consider would be justified. As regards the latter part of the question, the general power of legislation possessed by Colonial legislatures would enable them to abrogate the right to obtain a writ of habeas corpus from a court in the Colony, but Colonial legislation must be submitted to the Secretary of State for the signification of His Majesty's


pleasure, and is subject, therefore, to disallowance by His Majesty on the advice of the Secretary of State. I am not aware of any Colonial law which contains such a provision except in the rare case of a special ordinance providing for the detention of a political prisoner. In those dependencies to which the Emergency Powers Order in Council, 1939, applies, the Governor may, in case of emergency, bring the order into operation by Proclamation, and he may then make such regulations as appear to him to be necessary or expedient for securing the public safety, the defence of the territory, the maintenance of public order and the suppression of mutiny, rebellion or riot.</p>

<p>In Kenya there has been for some years a Labour Section which is in process of expansion. In Uganda there is a Labour Inspector, but the arrangements for Government supervision of labour are under review. In Tanganyika there is a separate Labour Inspectorate under a Chief Labour Inspector, and there is also a Standing Labour Advisory Board to advise the Government from time to time on all matters affecting the supply and employment of native labour.

There is a Labour Commissioner in Nyasaland, and the creation of a Labour Department in Northern Rhodesia is under active consideration. In this connection, the recommendation of the recent Royal Commission, that consideration should be given to the formation of a single Labour Department for Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, will be borne in mind. As regards labour emigrating from these two territories, the Governments of both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland have appointed Labour Officers to reside in Southern Rhodesia to safeguard the interests of such labour employed in that Colony. The appointment jointly by the two Governments of an officer with a similar function to reside in Johannesburg, is also contemplated. So far as Southern Rhodesia is concerned, the matter is entirely one for the Southern Rhodesia Government, and my Department is not concerned with it.</p>

<p>Figures for 1938 are not available; but returns furnished to the Board of Trade for 1937 showed the amount of blank film used by British film producers to be approximately 58 million feet.

<p>(<i>by Private Notice</i>) asked the Minister of Agriculture whether he is now in a position to give any information for the guidance of farmers regarding the Government's plans for expanding the home production of food in time of war.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1939-05-03a.1886.4" hansard_membership_id="3542" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14185" speakername="The Minister of Agriculture (Colonel Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith)" colnum="1886" time="">
<p>Under the Government's general plans for ensuring food supplies in time of war the function allotted to the Agricultural Departments is that of making the arrangements that would be required in the event of an outbreak of war to bring about an expansion of food production in the United Kingdom. Plans have accordingly been prepared for a central and local organisation which would be responsible for giving effect to arrangements for increasing the production of food and feedingstuffs. The Agricultural Departments would be responsible for the central direction and executive committees would be set up in each county to whom important functions would be delegated. The names of the gentlemen whose services the Government has been able to secure as chairmen-designate of these prospective committees in England and Wales and in Scotland are being circulated in the OFFICIAL REPORT.<br/>
An expansion of home food production would necessarily involve an increase in the arable area obtained by means of a ploughing-up campaign. The particular crops, the production of which we should have to expand, would depend on a number of circumstances including the season of the year when an outbreak of war occurred, the situation in regard to food reserves in this country, and overseas supplies, and the suitability of the newly-ploughed land for particular crops, whether for human consumption or for feedingstuffs for our livestock which provide vital supplies of milk and meat. A


great deal of information has been collected by the Agricultural Departments and prepared in a form in which it would be immediately available for the proposed executive committees.<br/>
A reserve of fertilisers has been secured, and plans have been made to organise and control the supply and distribution of fertilisers, feeding stuffs, tractors and other machinery, fuel, implements, seeds and other farm requisites for the industry's war-time requirements. The problem of labour has been carefully considered with the other Departments concerned. In addition to the safeguards provided under the scheme of reserved occupations, steps are being taken to enrol persons willing to undertake work on the land in time of war, and plans are being made for training by intensive courses, in the event of a war, those who have had little or no previous agricultural experience. This matter is now receiving further consideration in the light of recent Government decisions in regard to the Territorial Army and compulsory military service.<br/>
The Government do not consider it necessary or desirable that the plans for production on the scale or of the character that would be required in time of war should be put into operation in advance of an outbreak of war. They consider that the best preparation for an emergency is to bring the land into a state of greater fertility which would enable it to respond more fully to the increased demands which would be made on it in the event of an outbreak of war. The Government, therefore, desire that farmers should make a special effort this summer to improve their poorer grassland, large areas of which could not in its present condition yield satisfactory crops.<br/>
To assist farmers to improve the potential productivity of such land the Government propose to ask Parliament to authorise the payment of contributions of &#x00A3;2 per acre in respect of permanent grass ploughed up after this announcement and before 30th September, 1939, and brought into a state of cleanliness and fertility by re-seeding, or by fallowing or sowing to an approved crop with a view to re-seeding. The objective would be to encourage farmers to carry out work which in any case is desirable in order

to convert poor or worn-out grass land into more productive pasture and would, if the need arises during the autumn or spring, enable the land to be readily used, as arable land, for raising such crops as might be required to supplement supplies of food or feeding stuffs.<br/>
The Government would urge farmers, in consultation where necessary with the landowners concerned, to make arrangements to plough up during the summer inferior permanent grassland that would benefit by re-seeding and could, if necessary, be put in a condition to produce suitable crops. Notice of intention to plough up must be given to the Agricultural Departments in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, in order that the land concerned may be inspected at the discretion of the Departments, either before or after ploughing. Applicants will be required to satisfy the Departments that the land has been down to grass for not less than seven years. No payment will be made in respect of areas of less than two acres, and fractions of less than half an acre will be disregarded.<br/>
Further details and particulars of the form in which notice of intention to plough up should be given will be issued at an early date. The necessary legislation will be introduced as soon as possible, and it is contemplated that payment of the Government contributions would be made in the autumn, subject to the Departments being satisfied that the work has been duly carried out and that any necessary safeguards or conditions have been observed. The Government are confident that they will have the fullest support and co-operation of the agricultural community in this effort to improve the productive capacity of our soil.</p>

<p>I desire to make a personal explanation in regard to a statement I made during the Debate yesterday on the motor car tax. I made a statement that the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Sir S. Reed) had expressed a desire that the effect of this tax would be to drive small cars off the roads. The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out to me that it was quite the reverse. I said that if I found I was wrong I would apologise. I have read the OFFICIAL REPORT this afternoon and have tried to get in touch with the hon. Member, who is not in his place at the moment. I will send him a personal note later. What the hon. Member said yesterday was:
<q>I welcome the effect of the proposals on social life, because they may drive off the roads the high horse-power cars, the 40 horsepower 'suffer little children,' and the road hogs which cause so many accidents."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 2nd May, 1939; col. 1826, Vol. 346.]</q></p>

<p>I find that I was completely wrong in the statement I made. I misunderstood the hon. Member, and I ought not to have made the statement I did. I express my regret to him and apologise for having made the statement. Instead of condemning him, I ought to have congratulated him, because he showed a solicitude for human life by desiring to have the larger road hogs driven off the roads. I apologise unreservedly to him and to the House, and to you, Mr. Speaker, for having made the mistake.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That an humble Address be presented to His Majesty, conveying to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure for Canada and the United States of America, an assurance of the loyal affection of this House and of the deep interest with which it will follow the progress of His Majesty and Her Majesty the Queen during Their absence from this country,</q>
I have been unable to find any precedent for the Motion which stands in my name on the Paper and which I now move, but I venture to think it is none the worse on that account. Their Majesties the King and Queen are about to set out on a journey which to our loss will take them from among us for a period of some weeks, but which will give immense pleasure and satisfaction to their subjects in Canada and further cement the ties of Empire. They will be going on to pay a visit to the United States at the invitation of the President&#x2014;a visit which, I believe, will be the first of the kind by a reigning Sovereign of this country. The relations between ourselves and the people of the United States have long been of a special character on account of our common language, our common ideals and our common traditions, and we may be sure that the visit of Their Majesties to that country will be warmly welcomed in that great Republic across the Atlantic. I feel confident that hon. Members in all parts of the House will desire to wish Their Majesties God-speed upon their journey.</p>

<p>I desire, on behalf of Members of my party, to support the Motion moved by the Prime Minister. We shall all hope that this voyage will be happy and successful, and that it will increase the close ties which bind this country to the people of Canada and to the people of the United States. In these days anything that can be done should be done to unite the great Democracy of the West to the sentiments of the people of this country and the other peoples of the British Commonwealth.</p>

<p>On behalf of my hon. Friends and myself I wish to be associated with the Motion so gracefully

and happily moved and seconded by the Prime Minister and by the Leader of the Opposition. In going to Canada the King will be going among his own people, and his visit will emphasise and strengthen those feelings, which are shared by all His Majesty's subjects wherever they live, of loyalty to his person, of pride in our common heritage and of responsibility for the wise use of the opportunities which it gives us for service to the common interests of humanity. The visit of His Majesty to the United States of America will be a demonstration of the friendship and understanding which happily prevail between the people of our two countries. In opening the New York World Fair a few days ago, President Roosevelt said that the Americans had hitched their waggon to a star, the star of good will, progress and peace. It is a striking proof of the sincerity with which the British public share those ideals which the President thus eloquently expressed that at a time when our minds are so gravely preoccupied with dangers nearer home, the King and Queen should be leaving these shores on an embassy of good will and understanding to the people of the West, for it is the ideal, the most cherished ideal, of the British people to build up a peaceful and progressive civilisation founded on the principles of justice and freedom. It is right, therefore, that we should to-day express our loyal affection to the King and wish God-speed to His Majesty and to Her Majesty the Queen at the outset of their journey.</p>

<p>I do not wish to say anything to cause offence, nor have I any desire to offer any opposition to this Motion. I only want to ask the Prime Minister and those who support him, when they are wishing God-speed to this trip to America, to consider at the same time the trip that the old age pensioners have to make to the public assistance committee and think about doing something to relieve them of the heavy burden they bear.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution."<br/>
The House will not expect at this stage any detailed explanation of this Resolution, but I understand that hon. Members would like a very brief indication of the scope which it is intended to cover by the Resolution, which is necessarily drawn in very wide terms. To put it very briefly, the changes which it is intended to lay before Parliament in the Finance Bill under the authority of this Resolution are changes that affect one-man investment companies, and therefore, they are a sequel to the legislation which has now had a considerable course and which began in Section 21 of the Finance Act of 1922, which dealt with the evasion of Surtax liability by the transference of property to a company that is in effect under the control of one person.<br/>
The changes will deal with and strengthen the definition of "control" since certain devices have been adopted which have succe&#x00E8;ded in getting round the already wide definition of "control." Secondly, they will deal with the somewhat technical case which arises when, for example, a shareholder in the main company is a second company, and will enable the interest of the tax evader to be followed through the second and any subsequent company until one comes to the person actually interested.<br/>
The third point which falls to be dealt with is the question whether, in considering investment as distinct from trading companies, one should make any allowance for the withholding from distribution of a reasonable amount of the income of the year. In the case of trading companies, whether one-man companies or ordinary public companies, it is, of course, frequently, and indeed usually, reasonable that a certain amount of the

profits for the year should not be distributed in dividends; and therefore, in applying those parts of the Finance Act, 1922, to one-man trading companies, provision is made for that perfectly normal trading requirement. But as the Sections are drafted, the same words apply to an investment company, and certain submissions have been put forward which have been accepted, and had to be accepted under the law as it stands, suggesting that in the case of an investment company an amount might reasonably be withheld from distribution because the capital value of the investments had gone down, and so on. While preserving this principle for trading companies, it is not thought that it has any real application to investment companies which are of this class, namely, companies to which a person has transferred his investments for the purpose of diminishing or avoiding his liability to Surtax.<br/>
The fourth point with which it is intended to deal is to give the Special Commissioners rather wider powers than they have at present to make apportionments of income of investment companies in certain circumstances. It will be seen that the Resolution gives us power to make these provisions retrospective. This will not apply to all of the points, but it will apply to the first two, because my right hon. Friend is satisfied that as far as those two matters are concerned, we are dealing with devices which have been definitely designed to get round the intention of Parliament as contained in the earlier legislation. I am aware that my explanation may not have been entirely lucid, but I hope that it will have indicated to those hon. Members who are interested in the matter the general scope of the changes it is intended to make.</p>

<p>After listening to the Attorney-General, I have a general idea as to what it is proposed to do, but I cannot say that I could pass an examination on the proposals, and I do not think many hon. Members could do so. I would like to ask the Chancellor a question relating to the speech which I made a week ago on the question of the avoidance of Surtax. I then gave several cases in which I believed the avoidance of Surtax was still being practised, in spite of the efforts that have been made to prevent it. I should like to ask


the right hon. Gentleman whether he has yet had time to consult his advisers on this point for the purpose of seeing whether the practices to which I referred did avoid payment of Surtax, and if so, whether there is anything in the present proposals which will check that avoidance.<br/>
Further to the question of the methods that are adopted, I will quote another case with regard to a foreign company. Let us suppose that a man having some &#x00A3;250,000 chooses to incorporate a company in Canada, for instance. The directors of the company, perhaps, may be officers of a Candian trust corporation who cater for this class of work, and possibly they may be friends of the man seeking to avoid Surtax. Let us suppose that the man then transfers his investments to the Canadian company in consideration of the issue to his adult children or friends of debentures of a nominal amount of the original &#x00A3;250,000. The ordinary shares in the company are also issued to the same persons which enable them to wind up the company and to receive the surplus assets on liquidation. The effect of this is that the income of the investment is not liable to British Surtax, and when the company is wound up the assets, with the increment from the income which has been accruing to them, are all treated as capital. That is a further illustration. Of course, I do not expect to receive an answer to this point to-day, but perhaps the Chancellor of the Exchequer will consult with his advisers on the matter before the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, so that then he will be able to tell us whether the provisions he proposes to embody in the Finance Bill will deal with a case of that kind, and if not, whether something can be introduced to cover the matter.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman the Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. Pethick-Lawrence) has stated with great clearness another case, or illustration, which has been brought to his attention. I do not pretend at the moment to have followed it with any precision, although the general description is not unfamiliar to me. I would prefer to examine the case when I see it in the OFFICIAL REPORT and to deal with it at a later stage. As the right hon. Gentleman has reminded

me, in the speech which he made last week he mentioned some other cases which had come to his notice, and those illustrations have, of course, been examined in the meantime. I will not deal with them exhaustively now, and indeed I am not sure that I could, because, I too, suffer from the inability to answer an examination paper correctly as well as anybody else. I am glad to be able to say that some of the illustrations which the right hon. Gentleman gave were found, on examination, to be covered by the law as we have made it, and more particularly as we have made it quite recently. I am glad that in one case to which he referred, the legislation which we passed last year would prevent what he described.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman gave one case in connection with Surtax, and two cases in connection with Estate Duty. In the one case, he spoke of a settlor who transferred his funds to a trust to accumulate the income, but subject to a contingency which was stated, and then the contingency did not happen, and upon that being established, the funds, or money which represented those funds, returned to the hands of the settlor. That class of case is one of the cases dealt with by a section of the Finance Act, 1938. I will not argue the matter in detail, for it is very technical, but Section 38, Subsection (3) of the Finance Act, 1938, deals with that kind of case. Under that provision, which was passed after a good deal of close analysis and discussion, if and so long as the settlor has an interest in income arising under a settlement the income, in so far as it is not actually distributed in any year of assessment, is deemed to be the settlor's income for that year even though he has passed it for purposes of accumulation to the trustee. I ought to add that there is an exception, which I think is quite justified and which does not alter the substance of what I am saying. There is an exception laid down in Sub-section (4) regarding cases in which funds will revert to the settlor only by reason of the bankruptcy of the beneficiary, and certain other genuine contingencies. I think that is right, because a man may very properly make that a condition without endeavouring to escape tax at all on that account. Therefore, without wishing to be too dogmatic on the subject, I think I am entitled to


say that the case which the right hon. Gentleman raised is really covered by the legislation which was passed last year.</p>

Obviously, we cannot argue out this matter across the Floor of the House, but I think he has dealt with a case slightly different from either of the two cases to which I referred in regard to Surtax.

<p>I wish to draw the right hon. Gentleman's attention to one aspect of this matter. On two or three occasions already he has had to pass special legislation dealing with the evasion of taxation, thereby adding to the complexities of our taxation law which was already beyond the comprehension of most people. I never could understand why it was impossible to find a simpler way of dealing with this subject. As the right hon. Gentleman has said himself, he introduces legislation to deal with this

subject, but no sooner is the new law put into operation than new means of evasion are found and further legislation becomes necessary to deal with those further means of evasion. In all probability next year the right hon. Gentleman may find it necessary to appear before the House with a similar proposition.<br/>
What I wish to refer to particularly is the case of the private company. It has always appeared to me that it is not an essential right of the citizen to trade as a private company. It is a privilege and it is accorded to him by law, under which he gets certain advantages, in being able to trade on a basis of limited liability. I am sure it is necessary to grant that privilege, and that it is a privilege which should be continued but I cannot understand why the Government should not bring in a short amendment of companies law to put the private company on the basis of an annual licence, somewhat similar to that which now exists in the case of a public-house. There would be an automatic annual application for the licence which in normal circumstances would be automatically accorded, but it would be a simple matter, when any private company was found to be trading purely for the purpose of evading taxation, to refuse to renew the licence. Such a course would be beneficial not merely in regard to the question of taxation. We know that some of the worst frauds perpetrated in this country in connection with companies&#x2014;indeed the majority of such frauds&#x2014;are perpetrated through the means of private companies. At the present time I believe private companies are being formed by foreigners with English nominees to get round some of the legislation which is being passed. It is high time that those trading under the form of private companies were put under adequate control, and I am sure that there would be no more effective way of achieving the object which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has in mind.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution."<br/>
I will try to give a brief and, I hope this time, a more intelligible explanation of this Resolution. The House is probably aware that under the ordinary Income Tax law, if a trading loss is made in certain years, it can be carried forward and set off against profits made in subsequent years. That is a natural and just principle and it was intended to apply it to the liability for National Defence Contribution and the relevant part of the Schedule regulating this matter provided that losses as computed for Income Tax purposes could be carried forward and set against profits in subsequent years, in the same way as they can in respect of ordinary Income Tax liability. As far as ordinary trading companies are concerned, the intention of Parliament has been carried out and no trouble arises. Trouble has arisen, however, in connection with certain concerns of which insurance undertakings are the best example. In those cases there may be a loss as computed for Income Tax purposes which is not a trading loss at all.<br/>
That arises in this way. A very large proportion of the income of these concerns is from investments. That income comes to their hands taxed at the source. They therefore suffer tax in respect of that amount of their income before they get it. In the case of life assurance companies it is frequently the case that they suffer tax, in respect of their investment income, on an amount of income which is greater than their profit for the year on their business. They may, in fact, suffer tax on an income, say, of &#x00A3;100,000 whereas the profit for the year is only &#x00A3;90,000. The statutory provision made to adjust that, regards the &#x00A3;10,000, the amount by which the income on which they have paid tax exceeds their actual trading profit, as a loss for Income Tax purposes, because they have paid tax on an amount larger than the amount of their profit, but that loss is not a loss in the ordinary trading sense at all and it was not the intention of Parliament that that loss should be carried forward and deducted from profits for the purposes of the National Defence Contribution. The Clause which will be based on this Resolution is a Clause to put that right. My right hon. Friend has discussed the matter with the representatives of the insurance societies and others concerned, and I do not think there is any dispute that this is a reasonable provision, and

that Parliament did not intend losses which are only losses in a technical and statutory sense, to be covered by the principle embodied in the Act of Parliament.</p>

<p>This Resolution does not raise that point. The exact method of adjustment at present under Income Tax law is not a matter which is touched by this Resolution. The effect of the Resolution is to provide that these technical losses, in the sense in which I have described them, are not to be brought into account for National Defence Contribution. Broadly speaking, the adjustment is rather on the lines which the hon. Gentleman indicates, but the Resolution simply says that the difference between those figures which I indicated representing a technical loss, according to a statutory definition, should not reduce the liability for National Defence Contribution.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution."<br/>
This Resolution deals with a method of reducing liability to Estate Duty which was never contemplated, and I think it is best to approach it by considering a not infrequent form of provision which is made by a family man for his family in the event of his death. A man takes out a policy or policies with the view that the policy moneys payable on his death, should be available as provision for his family. He may settle the interest in the policies on trustees and the money which will be payable after his death will be there for his wife and children, or his surviving dependants, according to the terms of the settlement. The position will be that, year after year, he will pay the necessary premiums to


keep up the policies, and when he dies, the policy moneys will go to his family. If he does that, he cannot deduct for Surtax purposes the sums paid year by year and the value of the policies when he dies, under the existing statutory provisions, of course pays Death Duties, because the policies represent an interest arising on his death and the ordinary law at present applies to a provision of that kind.<br/>
Some people have arrived at the same result as far as their dependants are concerned, by a different route They first settle, say, &#x00A3;100,000 on trustees. The trustees transfer that to a company. It is the company which takes out the insurance policy. The company having got &#x00A3;100,000 lends back &#x00A3;95,000 to the prospective deceased. The result is that the prospective deceased at that moment is only &#x00A3;5,000 out of pocket. The legal position is that he owes the company &#x00A3;95,000. The policy is taken out by the company, and the premium paid out of the original &#x00A3;5,000 and the &#x00A3;5,000 comes in every year from the prospective deceased as interest on the loan made. Under the present law, when the prospective deceased actually dies, the policy moneys do not pay Estate Duty because although in fact coming out of his pocket, the premiums are not paid by the deceased within the meaning of the Act, the policy having been taken out by the company. The artificial debt of &#x00A3;95,000 arising from the company lending the man back that amount, is a debt which again diminishes the value of the estate of the deceased. The purpose of the Clause which will be founded on this Resolution is to put the estate in the same position as if that sort of transaction were done by the normal method. Broadly speaking, that is the device that the Clause to be founded on this Resolution is intended to defeat.</p>

<p>I should like to put to the Chancellor of the Exchequer the same question which I put with regard to Surtax, but relate it to Death Duties. Having had the opportunity of looking into the two illustrations of avoidance which I gave last week, can he tell the House whether they are either covered by the existing law or will be covered by these new proposals? I made another suggestion last week that primarily affected the Surtax, but also did affect to some extent Estate Duty, and that is that a further question should be asked of the taxpayer who makes up his Income Tax returns which would elicit from him certain transactions which would be of value for the Inland Revenue to know in both these respects. Has the right hon. Gentleman had time to have that point examined, and, if so, what conclusion has been reached?<br/>
I was interested in the illustration that the Attorney-General gave, because I thought he was going to deal with another matter which has also been represented to me as a means of evading a part of Estate Duty, but after I had listened very carefully to what he said,


it does not seem to me to be a case that is precisely on all fours. The method which has been represented to me as being one of those which are used is to take advantage of the Married Women's Property Act of 1882, and I understand that this is the procedure. A man insures for the benefit of his wife and children under that Act, and on his death the insurance moneys belong to the wife and children and form no part of his own estate. The policy moneys, of course, are liable to Estate Duty, but are treated as a separate estate and are not aggregated with the rest of the man's estate for the purpose of determining the rate of duty applicable. If it is correct that a man can succeed in this way in partitioning his estate into two parts, he does avoid paying a particularly high rate of duty. I do not know whether that point can be answered straight away, but, if not, perhaps that also will be looked into and, if necessary, dealt with in the detailed Clauses of the Finance Bill.</p>

<p>Will the right hon.

What steps are taken to avoid that happening? Some 12 months ago it was stated quite openly that one very rich person had transferred a huge sum of money to his children, but one child had died before the father, and the Chancellor came in for a larger revenue than he would otherwise have got. I am given to understand that that method is largely practised by rich people. Can the Chancellor tell the House the length of time before a man dies that money has got to be transferred in order to avoid Estate Duty? If that sort of thing is happening on a large scale, I think steps should be taken to prevent it. I may be wrong in my assumption. It is only a kind of talk that is going on, and I have no ground for putting it forward as a definite fact, but I shall be pleased if the Chancellor can help me in the matter.</p>

<p>The hon. Member will understand that these questions are necessarily rather complicated in detail. Death

duties are duties which are charged at varying rates, according to the size of the estate or property, at death, on property that passes at death, as their name implies. If, however, you made no provision in the law for giving away property shortly before death, evidently the scheme of the tax would be liable to be defeated, say, on the death bed of a person, whether rich or poor. This duty is not limited, of course, to people of great wealth, and many a man, or woman, feeling that the last day had come might find that he had presents to give to his relations. Therefore, it has always been necessary, in the death duties scheme, to include in the property treated as passing at the moment of death property which did belong to the deceased in his lifetime, but which the deceased made a gift of a short time before his death. Originally, the period was a much shorter period than it is now&#x2014;I think it was 12 months, or it may have been shorter&#x2014;but anyhow it was felt, after some experience, that that was not long enough, and the present period is three years. There is, therefore, included in the amount which has to be vouched for by the executor when the death duty is calculated, worked out, and charged, not only the property which in fact belonged to the deceased at the moment when he died, but also any property which belonged to him within three years of his death, and which he had given away in the interval. If he sold property, say, in the last year of his life for full value, then the property sold would not be included in his estate, because he would only have exchanged one thing for another, but this provision I have referred to applies to gifts between living people which are treated as though they were in fact something which still continued to belong to the deceased at the moment of his death.<br/>
It is true that the period is a period of three years and no more. It would, I think, destroy the character of the tax if you did not have some limit of time, because it is a tax which is charged when property passes at death. The right hon. Member for East Edinburgh (Mr. Pethick-Lawrence) made a very interesting suggestion the other day which would have meant some annual contribution, but that is a different kind of tax. A death duty is a tax collected


at death on all the property which passes, but you have to go back three years and account for everything that has occurred in that time. It has a very good indirect effect from the revenue point of view since, if a person does bestow some of his property away, let us say, to his son, because the son is younger and is therefore likely to survive him, and it does not in any particular case work out in that way, then, of course, death duty is paid by the son instead of by the older person.</p>

<p>Yes. It is the estate that suffers. He did not bring anything into the world and he cannot take anything out. He has to leave something behind and it is his estate which pays the tax.

of B being regarded as passing on A's death. There is an hon. and learned Friend behind me who is more instructed in these matters than I am, and he assures me that I am right. I am interested to have noted the state of astonishment on the benches opposite at the severity of these duties.<br/>
With regard to the matters raised by the right hon.

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth agree with the Committee in the said Resolution."<br/>
This Resolution is the basis for a Clause in the Finance Bill authorising the payment of &#x00A3;1,500,000 to the Exchequer from the Unclaimed Dividends Account of the National Debt Commissioners. Under the National Debt Act, 1870, dividends on Government stocks which are not claimed within a period, which is generally speaking five years, are transferred to the National Debt Commissioners, who have a liability if at any future time they are called upon to repay the dividends. They invest the money and it earns interest. In actual fact, in no year have the claims in respect of unclaimed dividends made upon the National Debt Commissioners been great enough to require them to draw on their investments. Therefore, the fund goes on accumulating. At the present time there is sufficient in the fund for &#x00A3;1,500,000 of that accumulation to be taken out and passed to the Exchequer. This form of transaction is not being done for the first time. The first occasion of this kind was in 1866 by Mr. Gladstone, when &#x00A3;3,000,000 nominal of stock was cancelled. It was done again in 1904


by Sir Austen Chamberlain, when &#x00A3;1,000,000 in cash was paid into the Exchequer. I am sure that it will not surprise the House to be told that such a transaction again took place in 1928 under the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Epping (Mr. Churchill), when &#x00A3;1,000,000 in cash was transferred to the Exchequer. The necessary Clause will be drafted, and I hope it will have the assent of the House.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 22, at the end, to insert,
<q>and also any land reasonably necessary for, the preservation of the amenities of any land acquired or proposed to be acquired for such purposes.</q>
In the Committee stage of the Bill an Amendment was moved by the hon. Membar for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) to enable recognised companies to buy land adjacent to a camp site in order to preserve the amenities of the site. We had a discussion of some length on that Amendment, and in the end I undertook to consider the matter further before the Report stage. In consequence I am moving this Amendment. I think that it fully meets the points which were made on various sides of the Committee. There is no doubt that the Bill as it stands makes it possible to acquire land for necessary playing fields and for any expansion of the camp which may be desirable in an emergency. It does not provide specifically for the acquisition of land for preserving the amenities of the camp, and it was strongly stressed that that should be mentioned in the terms of the Statute. In view of the strong support from all sides of the House for a power of this kind we have put down this Amendment. It confers on the companies, subject to the approval of the central Department, which was included in the original Amendment, powers of purchase, if necessary by compulsion, for the purpose of preserving amenities. The land must be reasonably necessary for the purpose in question. That suggestion was made by the hon. Member for Derby (Mr. Noel-Baker) in Committee, and it will prevent any undue or excessive exercise of the power. Then, of course, the financial resources of the companies are limited. We do not want to spend too much money by buying up ground, because we want to get ahead with the construction of the camps.<br/>
Perhaps a word of warning is necessary that all these proposals for extending sites, improving the conditions, and so on naturally add to the cost of the camps.


So does anything in the way of improvements in design and lay-out. We are as anxious as anyone to make sure that the lay-out and design are satisfactory and that the standard of accommodation which is provided is such as to enable the children from the great cities to get the utmost benefit and enjoyment from their stay in the countryside. We believe that with the help of our skilled advisers we shall fully secure these objects. But all these things cost money, and I warn the House that the original calculations, which were made at a time when the details were not fully worked out and had to be based on the experience of other camps, may prove to be an under-estimate. I have carefully considered the suggestion made from many quarters during the Committee stage that a person of experience in planning should be added to the board. I was anxious that we should not inflate the membership of the board or ask the board to multiply itself unduly, but if the addition is limited to one extra person, that will not affect the working power of the board. Consequently, I put this question before Lord Portal, the chairman of the board of management, and I understand that the proposal to appoint an additional director with the qualifications mentioned will be favourably recommended by the chairman and by the managing director at the next meeting of the board, which will take place early next week.</p>

point I had in mind when I moved my Amendment in Committee, and I am grateful to him. I am glad to hear the right hon.

It will meet the criticism of those on all sides who spoke about this matter in Committee. With these two changes the Bill has been made entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p>I should like to offer a word of congratulation and thanks to the Minister as one of those who troubled him on the Committee stage when we had a long discussion on these points.

That is a complete delusion and one from which the Minister's Department often suffers. Houses and buildings of good design need cost no more money than those of bad design. The things that offend our countryside are not the cheapest buildings but very often the more expensive.</p>

<p>My speech on the Financial Resolution was a little blurred by the prospect of a solemn announcement which was about to be made, and on this occasion I want to remind the House that the purpose of this Bill is twofold&#x2014;evacuation in wartime and education in peace-time. The House has, I think, tended to discuss quite important questions such as amenities but not perhaps to discuss very fully these two main purposes of the Bill. The fact that we are introducing quite revolutionary changes in the technique of education, and the fact that unemployed men who have lost some of their natural strength are going to earn what are really, in effect, subsidised wages, are matters on which the House has preferred not to dwell. I think it is typical of legislation in this country that we introduce important changes by, as it were, a side wind. I must at this Third Reading stage say one word about the peace-time uses of these camps, because that is extremely important. Many of the sites have been chosen and some of the camps will be ready, I hope, by September. Let us picture these camps in the happy event of our escaping war. Much of the talk in the recent Debates about the utilisation of these camps by adults and the possible effect upon seaside resorts is, to my mind, completely beside the point and, indeed, out of place. I wish to see relays of town children filling these camps during term-time. It will be the deliberate policy of the Board to promote this movement.<br/>
So much for the nine months of the year during which the children will be at school. Then there will remain the Christmas, the Easter and the Summer holidays, and at these times I should like to see juvenile associations of various kinds using the camps on reasonable terms from the Corporation. The ideal

camp, I think, is the small one pitched by a few boys. They can be seen every week-end at the side of farms all over the country. The boys have taken their equipment with them, perhaps on bicycles. But there are hundreds of boys' clubs and other organised bodies possessing no sites for their camps, who would welcome this opportunity. It is imperative, therefore, as the Minister of Health said, that there should be adequate space for recreation. The camp sites might well cover, as I believe they will, 20 to 30 acres. I make the suggestion that the juvenile organisations in the various districts might well take over these camps perhaps for the whole period of the summer vacation, and let them out, because they will have a complete knowledge of the various clubs in their districts. In many cases it will be impossible for one club or one Scout troop to take over a camp with accommodation for 350, but if there are four or five there at the same time it will be possible to arrange all kinds of competitions and to organise the camp on a local basis. Indeed, I suspect that some of the bigger authorities would wish to take over the camps for the whole year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1939-05-03a.1926.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Lindsay" colnum="1926" time="">
<p>There are between 18 and 20, and their total accommodation is about 1,400. Therefore, the present arrangements are on a very small scale; but with camps having accommodation for 350 boys between 14 and 18 there will need to be deliberate organisation. I see great possibilities in this movement for the young people between 14 and 18. I see possibilities not only of the ordinary unorganised activities, which are much easier in a small camp, but possibilities of dramatic performances as well as of ordinary sing-songs, perhaps educational films and popular lectures&#x2014;something which I described elsewhere as the beginning of a voluntary youth movement in this country. Therefore, I should like to bring before the House this particular aspect of the camps which has not hitherto been stressed&#x2014;the possibility of using them for those between 14 and 18.<br/>
Let me return to the school side. Here is a chance of doing something far more important. About half of those who attend


the present 20 camps to which my hon. Friend referred are sick and weakly children, and they are sent there on the advice of the medical officers in their districts. By the construction of these camps it will be possible to send relays of children not only to camp but to the country, and here they will live and eat together and will learn to appreciate and to understand each other in conditions which are quite impossible in the ordinary urbanised school. It is my conviction that two weeks in these camps will be worth two months in some of the schools which at present exist. It would be better still if the children could make two visits a year in order to see something of the seasons. Let us remember that many of these children, as those who have any experience of London know, have never heard country sounds, have never smelt country smells. We talk glibly about training teachers who will have a rural background. You cannot gain a rural background in a training college between the ages of 20 and 22. The most impressionable years are the young years. I believe that this may mean a revolution in the technique of education in this country. Only this morning I received very interesting details about an elementary school in South London, situated not very far from here, which wishes to start a young farmers' club on quite new lines in the middle of a big city. The objects are:
<q>To assist in breaking down the ignorance and apathy of urban populations towards rural problems, and to provide backgrounds for classroom study in geography and nature study.</q>
Later the letter says:
<q>It is most desirable that instruction should begin at an age when handling animals is a joy, when fear can be eradicated and soiled clothing is a matter of small account.</q>
Here, I believe, is a chance of restoring what has been lost to many, an early acquaintance with the country at an impressionable age. Two years ago I had the pleasure of moving the Third Reading of the Physical Training and Recreation Bill, and recently this House has seen fit to pass the Access to Mountains Bill. To-night we are, I hope, going to pass unanimously the Camps Bill. I believe this is only part of a great national movement to restore to what is, after all, a rather over-urbanised and nerve-ridden world something of the peace

and simplicity which come from living in and knowing something about the country. I think that a Bill which gives us the possibility of 250,000 children getting a fortnight in the country every year ought not to be passed over as an ordinary Bill dealing with the question of evacuation, important as that is; it is a Bill which has enormous possibilities and is part of a more sensible and healthy approach to education. I believe that with sympathetic leadership we may, through this Bill, give a chance to the education system of this country to change over from its present rather narrow and pedantic curriculum and provide that equality of physical opportunity which, I believe, is at the basis of democracy.<br/>
I wish I could announce this afternoon what I know many hon. Members opposite are desirous of securing, equally with me&#x2014;a bigger grant to local education authorities for the maintenance of the children at these camps. I cannot at the moment give any further undertaking. I can only say that the matter has really nothing to do with this Bill. It will be discussed on its merits between the local education authorities and the Board of Education, and all I can say to my hon. Friend opposite is that I shall press very strongly for this increased grant, because I believe that it is vital to the success of this movement. I go as far as that; and the fact that I cannot actually announce anything this afternoon will not, I hope, be taken as indicating that the Board of Education is not in earnest about the matter. As I say, it has no specific relation to the Bill as it stands.</p>

<p>Everything is different in Scotland. But quite apart from this Bill, and on its merits, I shall press to secure full advantages for elementary education in connection with these camps. For this and many other reasons I hope the House will give the Bill the Third Reading.</p>

<p>I say at once that I fully agreed with the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education when he expressed the hope that the camps would be full throughout the year with relays of school children. I hope with him that during the holidays it will be possible for the juvenile organisations to take them over


as he suggests, and again to keep them in full use. That will very greatly ease the financial problem of the statutory companies and will enable them to charge a lower rate per head per week and thus to maximise the use to which the camps are put. I do not agree with what he said if he meant to exclude the possibility that there should be camps under this Bill for adult holiday purposes. I am delighted that he thinks that the use of these camps ought to be driven forward with all the energy which the Board can put into it, and that he thinks the camps will introduce a revolutionary change in our method of education. I think that he is very likely right, but I am convinced also that there is a great demand for camps for adult holidays as well. I believe that the Government ought and will be compelled to take further powers under the Bill as well as to exercise the powers which they now have, to make camps for adults.<br/>
On the question of money, about which the Minister of Health spoke on the Report stage, the hon. Gentleman suggested that it might be necessary for the Government to come and ask for more money. I have always thought that the basic estimate of &#x00A3;20,000 for camps was very low. I doubt whether in many cases 30 acres will be all that we shall need. I have seen, and I do not know whether the Minister has seen, the plan of the Lambeth Municipal Camp. It is now at the Housing Centre in Southwark. It allows for50 acres, and I am bound to say, looking at the plan, that the camp is far better with 50 acres and that it would have been rather narrowly restricted if it had been confined to 30 acres. It is a question not only of additional land but of expansibility, about which the Minister gave us such a good deal of satisfaction on the Committee stage. The right hon. Gentleman has held out hopes that in time of war the camps will be expansible far beyond the two-fold expansion originally suggested. That will mean more money.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary says that local education authorities are to be encouraged to send children to the camps for two weeks and perhaps for two weeks twice a year. I am not sure that one month instead of two periods of two weeks each would not be more beneficial to their health, but that is another question, and experience will show. He suggested that four weeks might be ordinarily allowed to other children, but 50 camps accommodat-

ing about 350 children each will not go very far, and I think that we shall be obliged to have more camps. If the Government are thinking rather in terms of money, and come to the House and ask for more money, we shall be very glad to vote it. We are very sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary could not announce that the rate of grant for elementary schools for the use of these camps is to be increased beyond 20 per cent. It would be most ludicrous if the Board were to give 50 per cent. for the use of the camps to secondary schools and only 20 per cent. to elementary schools.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1939-05-03a.1930.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Lindsay" colnum="1930" time="">
<p>Perhaps I might just correct what is something of an exaggeration. It is true that everything in connection with secondary schools receives a 50 per cent. grant, but it is also true that secondary schools have their own camps all over the country, and that they do not therefore make use of the 50 per cent. grant specifically for camps. I want to make that point clear.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1939-05-03a.1930.1" hansard_membership_id="9813" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18920" speakername="Mr. Noel-Baker" colnum="1930" time="">
<p>The children are to be taught in the camps, and if the education authorities receive 50 per cent. while teaching the children in their home towns they should receive 50 per cent. while teaching them in camps. If they receive 50 per cent. for secondary school children they ought to receive that percentage also for elementary school children. It is in the elementary school period that the children can receive most benefit from the camps. The years from five to 12 are the decisive ones in which their physical future is determined. I am certain that if we had to choose whether we ought to send to the camps children of elementary school age or of secondary school age, it would be right to choose the elementary school age, and if that is true surely it is desirable that 50 per cent. should be given. It would be an anomaly to give a lower rate than that which you would give for secondary school purposes.<br/>
If it is the case, as the Minister tells us, that the camps are to be ready in September, and if it is desirable then that they should be in full use from the very start, it is also desirable that the Government should make up their minds on the question of grant, because until they do so local education authorities will not be able to lay their plans for the coming autumn. Unless those plans are made


now, the camps will be kept empty for a considerable time after they are set up. We shall continue to press the Government on this matter, and I hope that then decision will be taken with the least possible delay.<br/>
There is only one other point which I wish to raise, and it relates to the siting of camps. Again, I hope that the Minister will be able to see the camp exhibition at the housing centre of which I have already spoken. There are some extremely valuable maps in that exhibition, dealing specifically with the siting of camps. They take account of what I may call the strategic effect, namely, the relation of the siting of the camps to the danger from various targets which the enemy will probably try to bombard in time of war. I think that subject is very important and I hope that the Government are taking it duly into account. There is another factor of which I hope they will take account and which is more important still, and that is that the camps should be put in good country. By that I mean beautiful country. I hope that the Government are not just going to dump them down in a field when two miles away there is a moor or a wood. I hope that they will ensure that the children in the camps will have natural beauty all round and all the time. Let us remember that most of the children will not go far from the camps most of the days they are there. I hope that the Government will bear in mind that what is primarily desirable is natural beauty close to the camps.<br/>
I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary made the speech he did. We think with him that this is a very important Bill, and we agree about its peace-time social purposes, both educationally for the children and for holidays for their parents and older children. We agree much more about those peace-time purposes than we do about the evacuation of children from towns in time of war, important as that may be. We are glad that the Government have at last taken this first step&#x2014;we think a very modest and hesitating step&#x2014;towards providing equality of opportunity for our people to see the countryside.</p>

<p>It is very fortunate that the Parliamentary Secretary was

allowed to introduce the Third Reading of this Bill. I think that the Minister of Health will agree that for the evacuation of school children the Bill is a very small contribution compared with the vast number of children who will have to be evacuated, because only a very small percentage will be accommodated at the camps. I agree with the hon. Member for Derby (Mr. Noel-Baker) that it is a good Bill and that something good has come out of the rumours of war that have influenced our policy so much in the last few months. While I agree with the speech made by the Parliamentary Secretary, I do not think that the impression should be given abroad that the Bill is a novel proposal because we are initiating the first introduction of children under our school authorities to the country.<br/>
I should like to take the opportunity here of paying a tribute to the great and pioneer work done by the School Journeys Association. Hundreds of thousands of children have visited the country during the last quarter of a century as a result of the activities of that society. Sometimes they have stayed in camps near the sea and sometimes in villages under the supervision of their school teachers. The work and the initiative have been provided by associations representing the school teachers with, of course, the good will and financial assistance of the Board of Education and the local authorities concerned. It has been a marvellous thing and the pennies of the children and their parents have been contributed to enable children to go away on those organised school journeys. I am able to say from my personal knowledge that many boys and girls have been prevented from taking advantage of a school journey because of shortage of money and inability on the part of the parents, by reason of poverty or unemployment, to make the small contribution required. I can bear testimony from many years' experience of the school journeys to the important effect they have had on the minds and characters of the children who have been lucky enough to have those facilities. In most of the schools with which I am familiar the journeys are followed by quite amusing and attractive essays which show the new outlook on life which has come from the visit to the country.<br/>
I hope that these camps will be largely organised by that great society, at any rate for London, because they have an accumulated experience and knowledge which it would be a pity not to utilise for this purpose. I understand that the camps will be largely for the advantage of London, which is a great, continuous urban area. Tens of thousands of children very rarely got a sight of the country unless they go on one of the school journeys organised by the Country Holiday Fund. I am glad that the Parliamentary Secretary accentuated the importance of using the camps during school holidays. School journeys take place generally during the school terms and are part of the school education. They are subsidised on that basis and come into the syllabus of training. In holiday time some sites for the clubs are urgently necessary, but there is nothing about it in the Bill.<br/>
I remember the great work that was done by a former Member of this House, Mr. Frank Briant. He was helped by Lord Arnold, and although I will not say it was pioneer work, it was magnificent in the way it organised camps for children who lived in a very poor and overcrowded district. There are dozens of clubs which have been running camps of this kind under great difficulty, both of money and of opportunity, and as the Bill will extend that work it is all to the good. It is good also to know that the State, the Government, have recognised the utility of this movement and that they will now bring school holidays within the reach of tens of thousands more children.<br/>
We do not want the rules to be too strict, or the regulations too severe. I hope that the new trust will be under the control of men and women with knowledge and experience of young people and sympathy with their ideas, that there will be that freedom which is the essence and foundation of the holiday spirit, and that the rules for the control of these camps will be inspired by that spirit, so that, when young people go into the country, they will go there in a spirit of inspiration, not fettered by severe State regulations drawn up by officials and tied up with red tape. If the Board has an understanding of the purpose of the Bill, I believe that great advantages and benefits will accrue from it to the permanent well-being of the community and of the nation.</p>

<p>I should like to say a word of thanks to my hon. Friend for his speech in moving the Third Reading. The view he put forward that the 50 camps to be established under this Bill should be for the children in the first place will appeal to everyone. Whatever provision may exist at the present time, it is certain that hundreds of thousands of children who could make use of camps do not get the opportunity of doing so. The hon. Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris) said that there was nothing novel in the Bill, and it is true that great pioneer work has been done by private individuals and private subscription, but here, after a quarter of a century, we have, not a Socialist or a Liberal Government, but a National Government, stepping in and giving an enormous impetus to the movement. No doubt that impetus originates in one sense from sources abroad, but what we have mostly been discussing is the use of these camps in peace-time. I do not want hon. Gentlemen opposite to think I do not appreciate, as they do, the desirability of holiday camps for adults, but I felt some anxiety when listening to their speeches in Committee, because there seems to be a great desire on their part that these first camps should be appropriated, at any rate-partly, for use by adults. I hope that the hon. Member for Derby (Mr. Noel-Baker) will agree with me that the first object should be the children.</p>

<p>I personally should like the great majority of these camps to be devoted to children, but it would be extremely difficult to make camps which would be suitable for use by children at one part of the year and would be usable by adults for the rest of the year. I hope that under the Bill the Government will establish new experimental camps for adult holidays, because there is an enormous demand for such camps, and it is very important that experiments should be made in this direction at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>I am much obliged to the hon. Member; the difference between us seems now to be reduced to something comparatively small. I agree with him on one point, namely, that these camps should be placed in proper country, and, as one who represents an area where we have these camps, I should say that


proper country means the really rural parts of the country. Such areas, however, are sparsely populated at the present time, and a 1d. rate brings in but a very small amount. Experience teaches us all along the Kent coast that, if you have a series of children coming from school during the summer, it is certain that in one summer out of two, or one out of three, they will bring infectious disease with them. In one case scarlet fever broke out, and a great number of children got it. Naturally, under the Ministry of Health regulations, those children had to be sent to the local isolation hospital, and they all had to be nursed and attended there, so that that hospital, which normally might have only two or three patients, was more than full for a series of weeks, and the expense incurred came to a very substantial figure. Those who were responsible&#x2014;I mention no names and no bodies&#x2014;for sending those children to that camp, refused absolutely to pay a penny towards the cost of nursing them in this local hospital, and the local ratepayers, in a very small area, had to suffer an increase of 3d. in the &#x00A3; on their rates to cover the expense of nursing their guests. I mention that because it is one of the sort of troubles that come to the local population in such cases, and I hope the Government will consider it in the arrangements that are made. Apart from that, I welcome the suggestions which have been made this afternoon, and wish the experiment all the success that the Parliamentary Secretary has voiced to the House.</p>

<p>I welcome the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary. We in the distressed areas in South Wales have had some experience of camps. I remember that years ago our views on the question of camps were not accepted, because it was said that it was as much as we could do to provide schools. Year after year we sent deputations, but our request was refused, until the depression came, and even then we were unable to get anything done except through the Social Service Council. We were, and still are, anxious that the camps should be run by the education authorities, because we know how valuable have been the camps that we have had in South Wales, particularly for weakly children. I want to know where South Wales will

come in under this Bill, and whether there are to be any additional camps in Wales. There has been no definite promise that we are to have one in Wales, and we should like to know. The camps that we have at present are being run by the Social Service Council in conjunction with the education authorities, who hold joint meetings once or twice a year to make the necessary arrangements. I should also like to be assured that the camps to be set up will be permanent&#x2014;that they will not consist merely of sheds and wooden structures, but will be permanent, well-equipped camps, so that the children may have every possible opportunity of improving in health and in their general condition. I am glad that the Government are contemplating an area of 20 or 30 acres of land for these camps, because we want, not only to feed the children, but to give them plenty of opportunities for recreation in the open.<br/>
Another very important factor, which has already been mentioned, is the suitability of the site, so that water, drainage, lighting and other facilities may be available, and the children, particularly from the industrial areas, may have an opportunity of going to rural areas and benefiting from the fresh air. I hope that people from London will not be sent to tell us where these camps should be. I think that the people in the areas concerned are entitled to be consulted before the camps are set up, and I hope that such consultation will take place, particularly in Wales, where we may be able to give advice and assistance in the selection of the best places. I am anxious, too, that the grant should be increased. The 20 per cent. grant for elementary schools is unreasonably low for school camps. If the Government are considering, as I think they are, the health and the future of the children, a 50 per cent. grant is the lowest that ought to be expected for these elementary school camps. I hope that the accommodation and arrangements will be such that the education authorities will get full value from them, both on the educational and on the health side. I know that an application is to be made to the Board for a school camp near the Duffryn gardens. We have recently received a magnificent gift of gardens, on which something like &#x00A3;350,000 has been spent, and we want a school camp near to those gardens. They are 40 acres in extent, and contain all kinds of trees,


flowers and so on. We should like our children to have the opportunity of seeing these beautiful things for themselves&#x2014;of seeing something other than coal, steel and iron. I hope that the distressed areas, and particularly South Wales, will be considered in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>I want to join in the chorus of congratulation to the hon. Gentleman who moved the Third Reading. As one who has seen something of school camps, I heartily welcome the Bill. I put a question to the Parliamentary Secretary asking how many school camps there were in existence at the present time, and I was rather alarmed at the smallness of the number. The question that concerns me now is when we are going to have a larger number. The camps I have seen in Worcestershire and Staffordshire are excellent examples of what such camps should be. I attach no importance to whether this is an innovation, or whose suggestion it was; I want to give full credit to the Board and the Government for what they are doing now, and I rather resent the implied charge made by the hon. Baronet the Member for South-West Bethnal Green (Sir P. Harris), and also by the hon. Member for Neath (Sir W. Jenkins), that little help has been given by the Board in the past. Let us be quite fair. I suppose one of the greatest pioneers of school camps, and all that appertains to school camps and school boy life was an Inspector of the Board&#x2014;I think his name was Sir Roger Curtis. No one knew better what the life in those camps should be.<br/>
I would like to join with the hon. Gentleman opposite, and say that I hope we shall get a larger grant for these camps. There should be no differentiation in grants between those for elementary children and for secondary schoolchildren. I hope the new camps will be arranged so that they can be easily doubled or trebled, so that, instead of having only 350 camps, we can get two or three times that number in a very short time. I have nothing to say this afternoon about the question of the protection of these children in the event of evacuation&#x2014;I suppose there will be an opportunity for discussing that on another occasion&#x2014;but I hope satisfactory arrangements will be made at all these camps. That is a very important factor. These

children will require very careful and ample protection. I am sure the whole of the teaching profession and others concerned with children will welcome this Bill.</p>

<p>It was quite refreshing to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education this afternoon. As one who has been trying to extend. open-air education in one form or another for over 30 years, I was glad to hear that a little fresh air is getting into the Board of Education. In the early days, those of us who were pioneers had no help, and considerable hindrance, from the officers of the Board, and I welcome the new attitude adopted by the Parliamentary Secretary. If the Bill is worked by the Board in the spirit of his speech he will have no cause to complain of lack of co-operation, either from the local education authorities or from the teachers. I hope his warning to the Treasury, from the Treasury Bench, that he intended to put up a stiff fight for additional grants will be heard and understood by the Treasury, and that he will be successful in the fight.<br/>
I was very glad to hear the point he made about juvenile organisations that will be expected to use these camps during school holidays. I hope that both they and the senior children in the schools will be allowed to carry out some measure of improvisation in the camp and in their lives there. I know nothing more heartening than the way in which in suburban areas children will get a few sheets of canvas&#x2014;not always altogether waterproof, I am afraid&#x2014;a couple of sticks, and a piece of string, and make a camp of their own for Saturdays and Sundays. They get the real camping spirit. They may not get the creature comfort that comes from being in weatherproof huts, but, after all, they are enjoying a healthy open-air life. I hope there will be arrangements in the camps for children for whom such arrangements are suitable to pitch tents, strike the tents, and live in the tents when they desire. A very great deal of the advantage to be gained from this kind of life comes from doing as many things as possible for oneself, so that at some future occasion one can carry on in one's own way with a small party. Having seen this sort of thing going on for the


past 30 years, I am sure that it is in such improvisation that the greatest delight is obtained.<br/>
I recall&#x2014;over 30 years ago now&#x2014;taking a party of boys up the Thames in a boat from Mortlake to Oxford, where we had a very rough time indeed, but when we came back every one of the boys considered he had had a wonderful time, because we had not known where we should be at any future time and had had to improvise things all the way. I see a well-known Thames Conservator opposite. I regret to say that that sort of thing came to an end because the Conservators put up the fees for the locks to such a height that the funds of the boys were no longer adequate to meet the expense. I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will realise that, for many of the boys and girls going to these camps, it is very difficult for the parents to provide from their incomes even a small sum. The boys of whom I was speaking saved up for a long time until they had enough to cover their expenses. I welcome the Bill; I especially welcome the spirit in which the Third Reading was moved this afternoon, and I sincerely hope that the Parliamentary Secretary is going to be successful in his fight with the Treasury for the extra grant, because on the success of that depends the final triumph of this scheme.</p>

<p>I whole-heartedly welcome this Bill, but there are one or two points in connection with it that I would like to mention. One relates to the selection of the sites and the areas in which the camps have to be placed. The Minister of Health, in his Second Reading speech, referred to what was happening as far as the North-East of England was concerned. I come from Durham County, a county which is highly industrialised, with a school population of approximately 120,000 or 125,000. Although we are not in the evacuation area, one is concerned as to what would happen to those children in the event of air raids. The Parliamentary Secretary said this afternoon that these camps had two purposes: evacuation in war-time and education in peace-time. As I have said, Durham at the moment is not an evacuation area, but we are hoping that, although the Government have decided

along those lines, they will in the near future, owing to our vulnerability, reverse that decision. It is absolutely necessary that some provision should be made for the evacuation of our children to a part of the county that would, to an appreciable extent, be immune from air attack. Although Durham is a highly industrialised county, there are in the upper reaches of Weardale, the Tyne, and Teesdale beautiful areas, which, I should think, are far away from any possibility of bombing.<br/>
Surely, if it is imperative, in the interests of the elementary school population in the other areas of the country, that something should be done on educational lines as far as camps are concerned, Durham ought to be brought into this scheme. I asked the right hon. Gentleman, in the Second Reading Debate, what was going to be done in regard to Durham County, and I am afraid he did not give me a very satisfactory answer. In view of the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that those camps will have to serve the dual purpose of evacuation in time of war and education in time of peace, I would ask the right hon. Gentleman whether something cannot be done to meet the position of Durham by selecting sites in the North-Eastern area, and so bringing a certain measure of justice to that large school population which we have.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede), than whom nobody is more qualified to speak on this question&#x2014;I regret that he has left his place&#x2014;made reference to the Thames Conservancy. That body is most anxious, within its limitations and statutory obligations and its small income, to do its best to provide facilities for camping and bathing in the Thames Valley. I can assure the hon. Member that, so far as I can, I will make his appeal known to the Conservancy. May I take this opportunity of adding my voice to the congratulations of the Parliamentary Secretary? Even from some of the most evil things good sometimes comes, and it is a very good thing that out of the present international situation has arisen this provision of camps. I welcome the Bill, and I hope that very great good will come from it.</p>

<p>I do not want to say anything this afternoon on the evacuation side of these camps, as I have expressed my views in a previous Debate on that subject. This afternoon we have the very attractive subject of camps for purposes of education, and I want to say something from the medical point of view. As the hon. Member for South Shields (Mr. Ede) said some time ago, it has been the objective of Socialist propaganda for over 30 years to have open-air education for school children, and these camps go some way towards providing it. The speech of the Parliamentary Secretary really made me almost imagine that I could see him piping, with the little lambs following him into the meadow, so poetical had he become, and I hope that the idea of these camps from the educational point of view will seize on the imagination of the country. If we are able to return at some time from our uncivilised preoccupations with questions of bombing and other things of that kind to really civilised matters of dealing with child life and the humanities, I hope that there will be a very great development of these camps, and that they will develop on the medical side.<br/>
The hon. Member for Neath (Sir W. Jenkins) said something about wanting the camps to be solidly built. I agree that they ought to be substantially built, but&#x2014;and I think that I have the backing of the medical authorities on this matter&#x2014;do let us get away from the idea of providing permanent structures which will last for hundreds of years, like some of the elementary schools of the London County Council, which, in spite of the presence of my right hon. Friend the Member for South Hackney (Mr. H. Morrison), I say are absolute atrocities from the architectural point of view.</p>

<p>They should be camps to last for, say, 20 or 30 years and not for an indefinitely long period. I urge the Parliamentary Secretary to take into consideration the possibility of using these camps more extensively than is perhaps at present contemplated, for the purpose of open-air education of large classes of children. As he knows, large classes of

children go to the few open-air schools that are in existence and have special food and so on. These children, in the country as a whole, comprise a very large number, and if they could have their education in school camps they would be enormously improved in health, and, if taken early enough, many children might be restored to real normality. That would be an enormously important thing.<br/>
My hon. Friend sitting behind me has spoken of the need of camps in Durham, and the same can be said in regard to Lancashire, Yorkshire and all the industrial areas of the North. I would point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that in these counties you very often have a contact town with tramway routes running out, and the open county within five, six or seven miles, where you could easily erect open-air camps and use them as schools. Many of them would be very easy of access and within almost walking distance of the town. I hope that the idea of camps will seize upon the imagination of the country and will very rapidly develop, and that the question of using some of them, at any rate, for the purpose of open-air education will not be lost sight of. I would suggest as a new motto for the Parliamentary Secretary that he should look forward not only to 250,000 children having school holidays in these camps, but to every child in the country having a holiday. It ought to be just as much the right of every child to have a holiday, as it will soon become the right of every worker to have a holiday with pay</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. Member for North Islington (Dr. H. Guest) brought Lancashire and Yorkshire into the picture. It is essential that camps should be put amid delightful surroundings, and I hope that at least some of these camps may be established in Lancashire. There you get not only delightful surroundings and all the amenities that are required, but the type of educational body that will be prepared to co-operate and make a success of this undertaking. It is strange, and to me it is a tragedy, that we should have to be brought right up against the problem of evacuation before we realise the needs of school children. For 30 years demands have been made for school camps and open-air education. I have been to the


Board of Education on more than one occasion to plead for the opportunity to set up an open-air school, and time and time again we have been turned down, and it has been said that there was no money. Now that there is money to burn, I hope&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>]&#x2014;Oh yes, there is money to burn; it may not be for educational purposes, but at any rate for evacuation and other purposes, in the interests of the Defence of our country, and I say unhesitatingly, after the last 12 months' experience in this House, that there is money to burn. Do not let anybody tell me again that we are short of money, because I will not believe them.<br/>
I hope that these camps, which are now to be used for peace-time work, will be utilised to the full, though it will depend upon whether or not funds are made available so that they can be fully used. I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will win in his fight with the Treasury, for I realise that he will have to fight. He has said that he will put the case on its merits. The word "merits" in the English language has two different connotations, one used by the Board of Education, and the other by the Treasury. It does not mean the same thing at all in the two different Departments, but I trust that on this occasion, in dealing with the case on its merits, the educational point of view will come put successfully. I have been helping to provide funds for the last five or six years in order that children might have an opportunity of visiting camps in the summer time. I know of many education authorities willing to provide these facilities for the children, but they are dependent upon the coppers which can be saved, and when the coppers are not available the holiday is not forthcoming. I do not want these camps to be utilised merely as holiday camps for children, but as school camps. I believe that the children would benefit in physical health and attain greater advantages from close contact with the countryside.<br/>
The Minister of Health is entitled to our thanks for having seen the necessity for including the Amendment passed this afternoon and now incorporated in the Bill, so that the amenities round the camps may be preserved. If, as I hope, these camps are always to be used for educational purposes and never for evacuation purposes, the amenities of the

camps and the preservation of the amenities surrounding the camps become all the more important. However, much as I realise the necessity for the camp site being preserved, I would put in a plea for setting aside some level ground. I know something of the beauty of the mountainside and something of the inspiration which comes from the hills and the woods, but that is not of much use if you want to play football. Boys do want to play football and cricket occasionally, and therefore, I hope that that aspect of the camp site will be kept in mind when the educational value is being considered.</p>

<p>I have been particularly pleased, as, I believe, have other Members of the House, at the generally favourable reception the Bill has received. The only criticism I have heard of the Bill at any time has been that it is inadequate. I am confident that if the Minister had shown greater courage in introducing the Bill, he would have been able to get a larger amount of money and the sanction of the House in order to make a bigger job of it, instead of being limited to 50 camps. In the last Debate a long discussion took place as to the desirability of circumscribing a good deal of the land around the camps in order to prevent ugly buildings being erected and un-favourable trading opportunities created and so prevent a bad environment being introduced, and to all that I willingly subscribe. As to the amount of money allowed for the construction of each of the camps, I really think that the official of the Government Department responsible for giving the Minister a round figure as to the possible cost had either old Army huts or something of that character in mind. Though the provision of these camps has been subjected to the closest possible examination, the money allocated at the present time is not sufficient for the task of building them. I hope that the House will take note of that. After taking into consideration all these factors, including the fact that one public-spirited man has given a site, and, as I understand, other people are inclined to do the same because they like the idea of camps, I would ask the Minister seriously to recognise that the amount of money for the construction of the camps is not sufficient. Not only should the camps be constructed in such a way as to be


used as holiday camps for school children, but plans and precautions should be adopted at the present time to meet the needs that would arise in the event of war breaking out and evacuation taking place.<br/>
We have considered the question not only of having an assembly hall, but classrooms for children in bad weather, and everyone will agree that that is a desirable thing. With the present amount of money available, however, I am afraid that they will have to be cut out in many instances, unless the House agrees to increase the provisional estimate on which the Minister based his figures. He is not to blame, but those who advised him must have had in their minds such things as Army hats, not dormitories suitable for camps. I rise to strike that note, that in spite of the fact that land is being given and that more will be given, in order to be able to produce an ordinary administration block and an assembly hall and to make some provision for class rooms for the children in the event of bad weather, with a minimum cost of production and the standardising of all the parts, I am sure the money allowed now, on the basis of &#x00A3;20,000 per camp, will be unequal to the task. I ask the Minister to take that matter into his serious consideration. I can guarantee that, so far as the Board is concerned, it will do all that it can to keep the costs down and to have them subject to any examination that may be required, but if the House is called upon to meet the difference between what is provisionally allowed and the actual cost, I hope it will recognise the need of doing it, in order that we may have something decent and respectable for the children to occupy and something of which we shall not be ashamed.</p>

<p>The young Minister opposite has cast himself for the role of David, but I rather gathered from his speech and from the discussion that has followed that he is much more likely to play the role of the smoking sacrifice for the whole Government. This is really a miserable Bill, brought in for a miserable reason, and that is the necessity of doing something about evacuation. The whole thing, even now that it has been amended, gives the impression that the Government are doing something about this subject when really they are doing

very little indeed. The Bill is already out of date by the time it has reached its Third Reading stage. The Minister himself has admitted that the amount of money available is terribly small, and presumably, if he wins his battle with the Treasury, he will have to come to this House and ask for more money, which will take more Parliamentary time. He is faced with rising costs every week, and if the Government are going to do even a small amount of what they suggest with regard to evacuation, the sum of money that is proposed to be given is utterly inadequate. It was inadequate when the Bill was first introduced, and it is more than inadequate now.<br/>
We are told that we are starting on an experiment. I would like to ask the Minister whether, as a result of the discussions that have taken place since the Committee stage, he feels satisfied that he will get what he wants with regard to the evacuation of schools. When the Minister was speaking at a very large and most unenthusiastic conference at Newcastle-on-Tyne on this matter, he pooh-poohed the idea of those of us who at that conference advocated very wide expenditure on camps on the moor-side next to the private areas. The difficulty in dealing with any legislation is, of course, that events are moving much more rapidly than we can provide legislation for, and in between the Minister's speech at that conference and the Third Reading of the Bill, I gather from the A.R.P. authorities in my own constituency and area that that area is now almost certainly being marked as an evacuation area.</p>

<p>If that is the case, the situation is even blacker than we thought. You have this Bill, this talk about camps, this assumption that something is being done, and that this small amount represents something like a contribution to evacuation, and then you have the whole of this crowded area on Tyneside, and what is going to be done with those children? I suggest that we are almost crystallising the position round the &#x00A3;1,300,000 which is mentioned in the Bill, and we could use that amount of money for the six Northern counties alone, and then want more. It is not a question of just running these camps only for holiday or school camps. The


Government's idea is that they can be extended for evacuation purposes. What then? Is nothing going to be done towards laying down sewerage and water systems? Those of us who feel some responsibility for the child life in these teeming, crowded areas, where nothing is being done at all, really feel that we cannot join in the congratulations over this miserable little Bill at this time, when the least that the Government should do is to ask for something like a token Vote in order to get on with a reasonable scheme for evacuation purposes.<br/>
I have been specially asked by the chairman of the A.R.P. committee in my constituency, the deputy mayor, to raise this matter, because he was under the impression that this Tyneside area was to be evacuated. It is on a clear line of river in the very centre of munition works and of a shipbuilding area, and if the area is not to be evacuated, what justification is there for any area to be evacuated? There are wide sweeps of moorland which are extremely suitable for the evacuation of children, and the building of camps, and apparently the Government have not even considered them. The more one sees what is happening for the safeguarding of our population and of our children, the more concerned one gets about the Government's lackadaisical attitude to it. Any amount of money can be raised for the killing of other people's children, but what we are concerned about is the safeguarding of our own children, and it is really appalling that this &#x00A3;1,200,000 should be considered as any sort of contribution to the problem.<br/>
This is not the time to discuss whether, as a pleasant piece of educational policy, it is rather nice for the Government to give a bit of money for an experiment to take slum children out for a fortnight's holiday. We could have discussed that five years ago or even a year ago, but the situation now is much too serious for us to be talking merely as though it were a question of a pleasant experiment in holiday camps. This is a point about which the A.R.P. wardens and committees are much concerned. They know that it is not a holiday camp Bill, and therefore they want to know to what extent this really represents the Government's attitude towards camp evacuation. I feel certain that the Government will find that hos-

pitality evacuation will probably break down, for all sorts of reasons, but the one type of evacuation that will not break down is where you get evacuation under teachers into properly prepared sites and camps, in areas that are very unlikely to be bombed, areas that can be properly safeguarded. When the Government are appealing to people to give great care and thought and time to these problems, it is very worrying when the Government come along with this sort of Bill and when they are not even frank about it, but dress it up as a holiday homes sort of Bill, when really what they are doing is trying to get away with that issue, when we try and pin them down to the evacuation of children.</p>

<p>It would be discourteous not to reply to the hon. Lady, although I had not intended to go further in my remarks than those made by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education. Nearly all the hon. Lady's remarks did not refer to the question which we have to discuss on the Third Reading of this Bill, but rather to the general question of evacuation, and it would be out of order for me to go into that at all. She asked how the matter stood about the areas on Tyneside which were evacuable. I think she herself very well knows the promise that I gave to the conference in Newcastle to send up officers of my Department to hold technical discussions with the technical officers of the local authorities there. The head of my evacuation department went up there and held that conference, and the officers of the local authorities there unanimously decided to leave to my local inspector, in consultation with the local authorities, the demarcation of the areas on Tyneside which would be evacuable areas and which would not. My inspector is now engaged on that work, and I hope to see the result of that demarcation at a very early date. That result will be published along with the results for the other areas that are now under consideration.</p>

<p>No. I was indicating that the matter was under consideration and that I was not going to let it be thought that it had been decided that


the whole of the hon. Lady's constituency was to be evacuated. The whole thing was under technical consideration and the results are not yet published. It is true that the camps, as I said at the time&#x2014;and the Government still hold to it&#x2014;do not provide a large scale alternative to billeting. They are an experiment in the way of evacuation, and they are more than an experiment; they are an extension of a proved and tried method of social progress in school camps. I do not think anyone will agree that the billeting scheme is bound to break down. If so, this country would be confronted with a very serious problem, which it would be quite impossible to solve by the construction of any number of camps which it would be possible to provide in any reasonable time. But it should not go out from this House that billeting is bound to break down. It is on billeting that we must rely in the main for the evacuation of the children, the school children, the young children, the mothers, and the sick people whom we intend to evacuate.</p>

<p>All of us on this side of the House will agree that the billeting system must be exploited to the utmost extent, but we are convinced that the Government are working on far too modest an estimate of the number of people to be evacuated. Whatever the Government do by way of billeting, even if they pack people much more closely, there must be far more accommodation found than is being provided. Therefore, we hope there will be a very great extension of camps, in order that the chaos that will ensue if there is air bombardment will be reduced to the least possible limit.</p>

<p>The hon. Member is now arguing that accommodation ought to be provided for classes other than the priority classes&#x2014;children, young persons, sick mothers and so on&#x2014;on whose evacuation the Government is working. The hon. Member for Jarrow (Miss Wilkinson) said that the position was not satisfactory even as regards the priority classes. I strongly differ from that statement. The response that we have had from the country is good. Plans have been closely worked out, and on those plans we must rely for the accommodation for the priority classes. I do not deny that we may have to provide further accommoda-

tion, over and above that already existing, for other classes who may have to be evacuated in case of heavy and long-continued air bombardment.</p>

<p>I must not be led away into a discussion of policy and into admitting that the more children that can be sent to camps the better for the children. That is a view which the right hon. Member for South Hackney (Mr. H. Morrison) and other hon. Members opposite contested. It was said again and again during the Second Reading Debate that the children could best be cared for in the households of the country. I do not think it is right to say that the more children that can be taken away from their homes and put into camps the better for the child population of this country. That is not so, and it is not accepted on his own side of the House.</p>

<p>We say that the Minister is now planning the billeting of people, particularly children, in many places which are certain to be targets of air bombardment, and we should like those places to be free of children. Therefore, we think that there ought to be more camps away from the vulnerable areas.</p>

<p>That may very well be, but the hon. Member's point is that the children are better in camps than in billets. That is a contention which was strongly contested on his own side of the House. I will go no further than that. I have been asked about the areas in which camps are being constructed. The camps are being constructed as far as possible within reasonable distance of the great towns. The camps must be regarded as for the purpose of the housing of school children during peace and the receiving of evacuated population during war. Several of the points made by hon. Members did not seem to take that phase of the position into consideration. I have been asked to put camps in the Special Areas. As is well known, a number of camps have already been constructed in the Special Areas. There will be camps in Wales and in the Durham area, but the larger proportion of the camps will no doubt be nearer to the


big centres of population which will be liable to the heaviest and longest air bombardment in case of war.<br/>
The hon. Member for East Woolwich (Mr. Hicks), whose informed contributions to Debates on this subject we all value very much, warned the House on a point to which I myself drew attention on the Report stage, namely, that the cost of the camps will probably make it impossible for the programme of 50 to be fully completed with the money at our disposal. That is a point which the House must keep in mind. It is probable that the money which the House has voted will not be sufficient to complete the 50 camps. Therefore, any unnecessary expenditure will make it the less possible to complete the programme which was originally thought possible.</p>

<p>Then I must have been unsuccessful in my attempt to make myself understood. I do not think the hon. Lady fully appreciated what was said by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education. He was not discussing the amount of money for the construction of camps but what percentage of the maintenance charges could be paid by way of grant by the Board of Education. I have tried to make that clear to the hon. Lady that the Parliamentary Secretary was not dealing with the point to which the hon. Lady drew attention.</p>

<p>Really, this Debate is not taking place in the Glasgow University Union, where members score debating points over each other. This is a matter of extreme importance to a large number of air-raid precautions com-

mittees. The right hon. Gentleman says that the total amount of money will not be sufficient for the programme recently foreshadowed with respect to 50 camps. He is replying as a Cabinet Minister, and I ask, what is the Cabinet going to do about it, seeing that the money provided will not complete the Cabinet's own programme?</p>

<p>The hon. Lady has certainly no reason to feel that she is not able to give tit for tat, and that in the strongest measure. I will not say anything about the remarks she has made, because on Third Reading it would be very undignified if we fell into a wrangle on the lines towards which I am afraid we are tending. This is not a question of scoring debating points in the Glasgow University Union or in any other union. The Parliamentary Secretary was discussing the point as to the amount of the Exchequer grant to Local Education Authorities towards the cost of the maintenance of children using the camps. The hon. Lady has brought up a different point, which was first mentioned by myself on the Report stage, and later by the hon. Member for East Woolwich and the hon. Member for Derby (Mr. Noel-Baker), namely, that the camps are liable to cost more per unit than the estimate originally given. She knows as well as I do that the money voted by this House remains. Our task now is to press on as rapidly as possible with the completion of the camps for which the House has voted money. When we have completed the programme, or we are in process of completing it, then we shall have to consider whether any further programme should be embarked upon or not. That is a perfectly reasonable statement, and it is not scoring a debating point. That is facing up to the problem and giving a frank answer to the question that has been put, and I hope it will be accepted by the House in the sense that I give it.<br/>
We are approaching the end of a Debate in which points relating to war and peace have been raised. The hon. Member for Jarrow is bitterly apprehensive of the dangers that may come to the people of this country as a whole as the result of air warfare, and her apprehensions are shared in every part of the House. These camps will be valuable to our educational system, but we all have fears as to the other use that may have to be made of


them. Let us remember, however, that we are about to pass this Bill without a Division, that the Measure is one which commends itself to the Whole House, for a variety of reasons, not the least of those reasons being that we may get some real advantage from this expenditure to which we are committed on account of the dangers of war. It would be wrong for us to overlook the dangers of war. It would be wrong for us to omit any necessary consideration in regard to war problems. And it would be wrong for us to overlook the chance which is here given to us&#x2014;that, most fortunately, we may do a real piece of work which will redound to the benefit and health of the school children of our country. We all welcome that fact, and I am sure the House will now unanimously give the Third Reading to the Bill, and part with it with our blessing.</p>

This is a Clause dealing with mortgages on future interests, and in such a case the future interest may mature or be realised on different dates. The Clause, as drafted, does not very aptly or clearly cover that contingency. We have made some in-

This Amendment also deals with mortgage interest.

In a case of that kind it would be unreasonable to have the period running until the date when the parties contemplate that the actual interest would be paid.</p>

Hon. Members know that as the law stands the period within which an action may be brought against a defendant in the ordinary way is six years, but in a case in which a public authority is the defendant, the period is only six months and in fatal cases 12 months. It is well known to those who are familiar with the subject that that state of the law leads to great and undeniable injustice. Even those hon. Members who opposed us in Committee upon this matter did not attempt to deny that that was so, and that there are cases, though I do not say a great number, in which plaintiffs have been deprived of their rights by the operation of the Public Authorities' Protection Act. I give one example. It is a case reported in the Law Reports, of


Freeborn versus Leeming. I read the head note as showing the sort of thing that happens as a result of the Public Authorities' Protection Act:
<q>The plaintiff being injured in an accident was taken to the workhouse infirmary and placed in the care of the defendant, the medical officer. The defendant negligently failed to diagnose the nature of the plaintiff's injury and made no attempt to give him the treatment which, if given at the time, would effectually have cured him. On 15th October, 1923, the plaintiff left the infirmary and from that time ceased to be under the defendant's care. He consulted another doctor who discovered that his hip was dislocated. As it was then too late to apply the necessary remedy, the plaintiff's injury was permanent. On 25th April, some six months after he had ceased to be under the defendant's care, he brought his action claiming damages for negligence:</q>
<q>Held: That the action was barred by Section 1 of the Public Authorities Protection Act, not having been brought within six months next after the act, neglect or default complained of.</q>
I need only add that the report of the case shows that it was the fact that the plaintiff was to some extent disabled, that his wage-earning power was impaired and that the results of the defendant's negligence were undoubtedly grave. Is there anyone who would defend that state of the law or say that it was not a gross injustice of the kind which this House exists to remedy? It will be said that this Bill effects an improvement, because it raises the period from six to 12 months and, naturally, we welcome that proposal, but I think it is the unanimous verdict of hon. Members who are familiar with these matters that the period of 12 months is not enough. As I have said, there is already a period of 12 months in cases where negligence results in death. There was before the courts towards the end of last year a case which received considerable publicity and which showed that the 12 months period was not enough. Sometimes a plaintiff may be under a misapprehension; the wrong defendant may be sued, and by the time the mistake is discovered, the statutory period has elapsed and it is impossible to sue the public authority which is the real defendant. Is there any reason, in logic or justice, why that state of affairs should exist?<br/>
Let me take, as an example, the position of the London Passenger Transport Board. A few years ago they took over the various transport undertakings in

London and by Section I of the Act then passed the Board was declared to be a public authority. What is the result? If any hon. Member going out of this House has the misfortune to have been knocked down and injured through the negligent driving of the servant of a private firm, he has six years in which to bring his action for damages. If he is knocked down by a vehicle driven by an employ&#x00E9; of the London Passenger Transport Board, he has only six months, and if this Bill becomes law in its present form he will have only 12 months in which to bring his action. Thus we have this fantastic result. Supposing that someone had been injured by the negligent driving of an omnibus driver in the employment of Tilling's company on the day before the London Passenger Transport Board took over its duties, he would have had six years in which to bring his action, but if he had been injured on the following day he would have had only six months. In Committee we proposed to put public authorities on precisely the same basis as ordinary defendants, but that proposal was turned down and I am now proposing a limitation of two years.</p>

<p>There were two proposals. The first was to give the judge power to extend the time, and the second was to put public authorities in the same position as any other defendants and make the period six years. I wish to make it clear that I am not in any way attacking public authorities, and in particular I am not attacking local authorities. I think there was some misapprehension about that during the Second Reading Debate. I think the House ought to express admiration for those who, without any tangible reward, give their services to local authorities and this Amendment is not brought forward as a criticism of them. But what is the position supposing an action is brought against a public authority after


the statutory time has expired? The members of that authority are, it seems to me, in a real difficulty because they know, and they must be advised that this defence under the Public Authorities Protection Act is open to them, and they have to decide whether to avail themselves of it or not. A private defendant might say, "I could avail myself of this defence but it would be shabby to do so and I prefer not to do so." But the member of a public authority is in a different position. He is not dealing with money which belongs to him. He is dealing with money for somebody else and for the administration of which he is responsible, and it is a difficult question for him to decide, whether this defence is to be used and the plaintiff deprived of his rights.<br/>
I wish to deal with some of the arguments advanced on the other side. It is fair to say, without any disrespect to any other hon. Member, that the principal opponent of the Amendments which we suggested on Second Reading and in Committee, has been the hon. Member for Brightside (Mr. Marshall). In the Committee he used one of the most remarkable arguments I have heard since I have been a Member of this House. This is what he said:
<q>I was about to say that when a claim comes before a local authority it is not decided by the town clerk as the hon. and learned Member seems to think but by a committee. You could get no more if you went to court where a jury sits round a table in order to do justice to the individual."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT (<i>Standing Committee C</i>), 21st February, 1939; col. 26.]</q>
The obvious point is that the committee which is deciding the matter is itself a party to the dispute. It is bound to act on the advice of its servants. In a great many cases of this kind such a committee will probably act on the advice of a city engineer. Probably it is the conduct of the city engineer's department which is being called in question and however anxious he may be to be fair, one can understand the city engineer wishing to defend his own subordinates. No one will dispute that it is a fundamental principle of justice that no man should be judge in his own cause, but according to the argument of the hon. Member for Bright-side, the local authority is the judge in its own cause. The members of the public authority may honestly take the view that they are not liable. If they do, and if the statutory period of limitation has run

out there is no impartial tribunal to which the injured person can appeal.<br/>
There came before the courts a few months ago a case which, although it is not a case in which this defence was applied, I give as an example of the kind of action which is brought against a local authority. A corporal in the Army was cycling through the streets of a city and was killed by falling off his bicycle on to the road. His widow had reason to believe that the cause of the accident was the state of the tramlines and that the tramway authority, which was also the local authority, had failed to carry out its statutory duty by making the road level with the tops of the tramlines with the result that the rails stood out an inch or two above the road level. The widow had the good sense to consult solicitors at once and they communicated with the town clerk. The town clerk was advised that the road had been in a perfect state of repair at the time of the accident and refused to make any offer. He told the widow's legal representatives and no doubt advised his own committee that the corporation were under no liability. The widow availed herself of the Poor Persons rule and went to the Assizes. On the morning when the case was due to be tried, the local authority settled for a substantial sum. Supposing she had not been aware of her rights or had been dissuaded, as people sometimes are, from taking legal advice in time, what would have happened? The corporation would probably have accepted the advice of their own servant and said, "We are not liable," and instead of receiving a substantial sum, she and her six small children would have been left penniless, apart from a widow's pension.<br/>
That is the kind of thing which happens not in a large number of cases but in some cases. I do not know whether any hon. Member is prepared to defend that state of the law. I have said that this Amendment is not intended as an attack on local authorities but I think it is well-known that there are cases, fortunately rare, in which those representing the public authority have led the injured party to believe that they intended to settle, and have, so to speak, played out time. It happens occasionally that the representative of the public authority deliberately prolongs the negotiations until the statutory time has expired. As soon


as the six months or 12 months period has elapsed his tone changes.</p>

<p>When there is a case where negotiations are spun out and there is a prolonged correspondence between the parties, as in the case which the hon. Member and I have in mind, and then as soon as the time is up, the representatives of the public authorities point out that they can now avail themselves of the Public Authorities Protection Act, one is entitled to assume a deliberate course of conduct. Are we really to suppose that they never think of that Act until after the six months are up? These may be rare occurrences, but they do take place. There are public authorities, very occasionally, which take advantage of their own misconduct in this way. I would like again to refer to the argument used by the hon. Member for Brightside in the Standing Committee. He said:
<q>While a couple of cases may be quoted to the contrary, there are hundreds of thousands of cases settled in. this country over a number of years by local authorities; they never see the court and they are settled amicably and justly. Members of this Committee should take that fact into consideration in adjudging this matter."&#x2014;OFFICIAL REPORT (<i>Standing Committee C</i>), 21st February, 1939; cols. 26&#x2013;27.]</q>
I entirely agree with the hon. Member, but I do not think that argument in any way affects the merit of the Amendment. I am concerned with the one or two cases the existence of which the hon. Member

admits, and if the Amendment is adopted, and the period is made two years instead of one year, it will not prevent those hundreds of thousands of cases from being settled amicably and justly. A public authority such as that on which the hon. Member has served, which wishes to deal fairly with claims and to settle them out of court, will be just as free to do so if the Amendment is carried. Their position will not be prejudiced in any way. The only public authority that will be prejudiced is that which wants to avail itself of this special defence in order that the case shall not go before an impartial tribunal. No doubt we shall be told that the period of 12 months was recommended by the Statute Law Revision Committee. That is true, but I will quote to the House what that committee said:
<q>We have carefully considered how far it is advisable to interfere with the policy of the Public Authorities Protection Act. That policy is quite clear, namely, to protect absolutely the acts of public officials, after a very short lapse of time, from challenge in the courts. It may well be that such a policy is justifiable in the case of important administrative Acts, and that serious consequences might ensue if such Acts could be impugned after a long lapse of time. But the vast majority of cases in which the Act has been relied upon are cases of negligence of municipal tram drivers or medical officers and the like, and there seems no very good reason why such cases should be given special treatment merely because the wrongdoer is paid from public funds.</q>
I ask hon. Members to note those words. The committee went on to say:
<q>We do not suggest that the Act should be dispensed with altogether, but we think its effects in two respects should be mitigated.</q>
I need not deal with the second of these.
<q>We recommend that in cases of civil actions the period of limitation should be extended to 12 months.</q>
The Committee gave no reason for choosing that particular period of 12 months, but I think it is clear that their reasoning could be used just as well to support a period of two years. The Committee made it clear, as I think it must be clear to every hon. Member, that in these cases where there is negligence by a municipal tramdriver, and so on, there is really no foundation for this distinction. I want to say two things about the Committee's report. First, clearly it is a compromise. Certainly, when I look at the names of those who sat on the Committee and signed the report, I should be very surprised to learn that some of these eminent gentlemen were against the Amendment now


under discussion. If they could be asked, we should probably find that they would be strongly in favour of it. Secondly, the Committee was merely one to codify the law and to deal with certain minor Amendments. It was not going back to the first principles upon which these things rest. For example, it did not touch on the period of limitation of six years. I agree with the statement made by the hon. Member for Oxford (Mr. Hogg) in the Second Reading Debate that the six-year period is too long; but the Committee did not really deal with that matter, because they were not going down to the foundations of our law, but merely making certain minor amendments and endeavouring to codify the Statute Law. Therefore, I do not think it is fair to say that the period of 12 months is recommended in the Committee's report. I will make one more quotation, because I want to deal fairly with the arguments against an Amendment of this sort. I know that some hon. Members receive a great many circulars and memoranda from various associations of public authorities. A typical passage from one of those memoranda was read in the Standing Committee. I will quote it to the House:
<q>Public authorities administer public funds and are more subject to speculative actions than private individuals. It is, therefore, in the interests of the public and the authorities themselves that there should be a statutory deterrent to the bringing of actions which are often instituted in the belief, either that it will be difficult for the authority concerned to rebut the claim owing to lack of evidence, or that the authority, although not liable, may prefer to settle the claim out of the public funds at their disposal rather than to contest it."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT (<i>Standing Committee C</i>), 21st February, 1939; col. 19.]</q>
There may be a certain amount of truth in that statement, but if it be true, it applies to a great many other bodies besides public authorities. All sorts of large firms are affected in precisely the same way. The public authorities are not in any special difficulty in this respect. We are also referred to the old bogy of speculative actions and told that it is difficult for the public authorities to rebut claims. As regards speculative actions, I would say that the man who is caught by the Public Authorities' Protection Act is not the plaintiff who goes to the speculative solicitor. The speculative solicitor who wants litigation immediately issues a writ. Where the Act

comes into operation is in cases where the solicitor prolongs the negotiations and does not issue a writ in time, or where the party has not taken legal advice within the statutory period. One does not rule out speculative actions by having this particular provision.<br/>
It is then said that after a long period of time it is difficult for public authorities to rebut a claim. That may be true, but a private defendant is in no different position. It is equally difficult for a private firm or a private employer, or any private defendant, to rebut a claim after a period of years. I should have thought that, on the whole, it would be easier for a public authority to do this. In their case, there is greater continuity of employment, and the witnesses coming before the court generally would be employ&#x00E9;s; and it would also be much easier in most cases for the public authority to look back to see what happened a year or two previously than it would be for a private firm. Another argument that was put forward in the Committee upstairs referred to school authorities. Particular emphasis was laid on this matter. It is true that if an action is brought against a public authority in respect of an accident to school children, after some years it may be very difficult for it to find evidence to rebut the claim. That argument might apply if we were proposing to make the period six years, but I do not think it has very much application in respect of this Amendment, in which we are asking for a two-year period.<br/>
I have read some of the memoranda that have been sent in from associations of public authorities. Their chief argument is that we ought not to interfere with what has been the settled policy of Parliament since 1893. I know that this matter will be dealt with by my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Silverman) and I do not propose to go into details, but I have been at some pains to go through the records of the House and find out the way in which this Statute came into being. Prior to 1893, these periods of limitation were put into certain Statutes, certain private Acts and also in Public Health Acts, but there was no general period of limitation regarding actions against public authorities. In 1892 and 1893, in two Bills&#x2014;one in each Parliament&#x2014;it was proposed, for the first time, that this protection should be


made general, and from the records of the House it is clear that Parliament passed that Act under a complete misapprehension. There was scarcely any discussion on the matter either in 1892 or 1893. On each occasion the House was assured that it was purely a consolidating Measure and made no actual difference to the law. We know now that that was not correct.</p>

<p>It altered the law in this respect, that previously a limitation was attached only to specific administrative duties imposed upon public authorities. In 1893, for the first time, the protection became general. The protection under the 1893 Act applied not only to those duties which had already been imposed upon public authorities, but to any duties that might afterwards be imposed upon them. The general principle of limitation was established for the first time in 1893, and Parliament was assured that it was a purely consolidating Measure.</p>

<p>The hon. Member is not quite correct. It was first introduced by a Conservative Government in 1892, and that Government gave those assurances. It is true that it was taken over after the General Election by the Liberal Government, and that shows how dangerous it is for the Liberal party at any time to take over its opponents' Measures. Therefore, this evening is the first occasion on which the House has ever considered the principle in its general application. Is it really to be said that because the House passed this Act under a mistaken impression in 1893, we must not interfere with the principle now? Is there any hon. Member who argues, as apparently some public authorities do, that we are bound to perpetuate an injustice simply because it is hallowed by the lapse of time?<br/>
There is one other ground of opposition, based not entirely on argument, but rather upon prejudice. In the Second Reading Debate there were some hon. Members who felt suspicious about the objections on the ground that the objectors were nearly all lawyers. I am not going to embark upon a general defence

of the legal profession, but I will make one or two observations on this matter. First, those who want to see this Amendment adopted are by no means confined to the legal profession, as hon. Members will see if they look at the proceedings of the Standing Committee. Secondly, even lawyers are not always united, but this Amendment is supported by lawyers in all parties. I am not trying to make a party matter of this, but I would remind hon. Members above the Gangway that the Haldane Society has declared itself in favour of getting rid of the Public Authorities' Protection Act. I would like also to say that the reason members of the legal profession, in particular, dislike the Public Authorities' Protection Act is that in their practical experience they have seen the hardships which that Act has created.<br/>
May I remind hon. Members of something which happened last Session? A Bill was introduced by the hon. Member for Wednesbury (Mr. Banfield) to deal with night baking. He carried that Bill, not perhaps in its original form, as Members in all parties voted for it because the hon. Member spoke from a wealth of practical experience of grievances with which he was actually acquainted in his own working life&#x2014;and he was able to make a deep impression on the House, The legal profession may not be quite so popular as that to which the hon. Member belongs, but I suggest that the same thing should apply in this case. Members of the legal profession are raising these objections because we know the very hard cases which have occurred as a result of this legislative accident in 1893. There is no power here to extend the time as there is in the Workmen's Compensation Acts. Once the year is up there is nothing to look forward to. May I make one more comparison? Hon. Members with trade union experience know that a considerable number of actions are brought against employers for negligence or breaches of statutory duty under the Factory Acts. In every one of these cases the injured man has six years in which to bring his action. Suppose it was proposed that the period should be reduced to 12 months, hon. Members would rise up and oppose it.<br/>
But what is the difference? A man is injured in a colliery or shipyard and has six years in which to bring his action, but a man who is injured in an accident


on the roads, who may be just as seriously affected in his earning capacity as the man employed in the mines, is in a different position. Is there any reason why they should be in two different categories? We are considering here, not technicalities, but a very important principle. It is true that if my Amendment is passed it might mean a certain amount of inconvenience to public authorities but, on the other side, we have considerations of justice. This House has to decide whether it is more important to secure justice to the individual than to consider the administrative convenience of public authorities. I should have thought that there was only one way of deciding that question. One of the principles which we always seek to realise in our legislation is that of equality before the law. We all learned at school that everyone in this country is subject to the ordinary law of the land administered in the ordinary courts. We have been taught that if a Minister of the Crown exceeds his authority he is as liable to the ordinary processes of the law as any other citizen. This is an exception to the general principle of equality before the law. Here is a special privilege given to one particular class of people, and on grounds of theory and practice I suggest that there is no good reason for resisting the Amendment, which I ask the House to accept.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I should like, as my first point, to echo something which the hon. Member has said. I appeal to hon. Members, and particularly to hon. Members of my own party, not to regard this as a legal point. It is true that lawyers have contributed most to the argument upon it, but in this Amendment we are not concerned with the interests of lawyers. If on a fair view of the facts the House can bring itself to believe that there is no injustice done to ordinary people, and particularly to the working classes, then we shall find that the Amendment will be defeated, but I do ask hon. Members not to be prejudiced in any way by the fact that so many lawyers appear to be interested in it any more than I myself would like the House to be prejudiced by the fact that the interests of local authorities may be involved.<br/>
I want to give an instance within my own experience, and I invite hon. Members to consider it carefully and to say whether the law which permitted it should remain or should be amended. I am not going to mention any names, but it is a case of which I have a personal knowledge. It is the case of a small boy, aged two, treated in a city hospital. The nurse quite properly put that child into the electric blanket. There is no complaint about that; it was the proper treatment to be adopted. But, having put that child into the electric blanket, she went away and, perhaps under the pre-sure of other duties, or perhaps in a moment of forgetfulness, did not come back until the child was very dreadfully burned&#x2014;so dreadfully burned that the position is that the child will have to undergo an operation every 12 or 18 months during the period of growth, and when mature the best that can be hoped for is that the child will have a permanently deformed, shortened, twisted and maimed right leg. These are facts not to be controverted; I know them. The child's guardians went to a councillor representing the ward on the city council in which he resides and said, "I think I had better consult a solicitor about this." The councillor replied, "If the facts are as you say there is no need for any litigation. I cannot imagine this city, if these facts are correct, refusing to do the right thing. You leave the matter in my hands. Do not go to a solicitor; do not start any litigation. I will look after it for you."<br/>
I am certain that the councillor meant that; it was not a trap. He was honestly and conscientiously trying to help his constituent. He went to the hospital and ascertained that the facts were as stated. He went to the town clerk, who himself verified that the facts were as I have stated, and the town clerk said to the councillor, "You are perfectly right; no one would dream of repudiating liability here, or of not doing the right thing by the child. It is only a question of how much." The councillor went back to the parent and said, "I told you it would be all right. How foolish you would have been to have gone to a solicitor. Do not take any steps at all, leave it to me, and I will negotiate this matter to a successful issue, and there will be no trouble about it." The parent, of course, was quite right in accepting that assurance and


doing nothing, and the councillor was right in accepting what the town clerk had said. This is a big public authority and the town clerk had a great many things to do, and the councillor had a great many things to do, and it so happened that time passed until one fine day when the councillor went to the town clerk he said, "I am very sorry, this is not at all what I intended, but, in fact, the six months have gone by. We have not agreed, we have not paid, no writ has been issued, and we are now debarred by law from paying one penny of damages to that child."<br/>
I am not saying for a moment that there was conscious and deliberate fraud in that case&#x2014;certainly not. Indeed, I think I am right in saying that if we could have proved there was deliberate fraud on the part of the local authority we might have got outside the Act. But let it be granted what I am sure is the case, that no fraud was intended or designed, that it was an honest and reasonable course to take by both parties. It is no good hon. Members saying that no public authority would take advantage of its rights under the Act in circumstances of that kind. A public authority has no right to do other. It is administering public funds, and it has no right to make a payment out of its public funds which it is not obliged by law or entitled by law to make. They are bound to plead it; and if hon. Members want a recent and extremely interesting example they have one in the case of Croydon. A little while ago there was an outbreak of typhoid fever in Croydon which lasted a long time, caused a lot of damage and many deaths. It took a long time before it was decided whether or not the local authority was or was not at fault. Ultimately it was decided in a friendly action&#x2014;the authority was not acting in any way improperly in taking the friendly action&#x2014;in the High Court that the epidemic was due to faults on the part of the authority, and damages were awarded.<br/>
But by the time that had been established it was a long way outside the period of six months. The Croydon authority wanted to do the right thing and to pay appropriate damages, but in order to do it they had to come to this House and present a private Bill, which is now before the House, to enable them to do what under the Public Authorities Protection

Act, and under this Bill as it is now, they would not be entitled to do. I know that many of my hon. Friends are particularly concerned with local authorities as I am myself. I was a member for nine years of a local authority, and I am a member of the political movement which is represented on these benches. It is part of our policy that the rights and duties of local authorities should be extended to cover a great many things which they are not now allowed to do. I believe that, because I think in that way greater justice is done to the population. We do not want less justice but more justice to be done. Therefore, I put this question to my hon. Friends who are doubtful about the position of local authorities. Take the case of that child of two years. Is it right or wrong that because of this perfectly arbitrary time limit that child should have to go through life with a permanently deformed leg, unable to perform ordinary work and earn its living, without a penny of compensation merely because the hospital in which the injury was sustained happened to be owned by the city instead of being a voluntary organisation?<br/>
My hon. Friends would like to see hospitals run by the State or the local authority. If that came about and there was no amendment of the law in this respect the result might be that a child, as a result of a perfectly natural but certainly a careless act, would have less right to be compensated for what had occurred than if the voluntary hospitals had remained. I cannot see that the local authority has any interest in allowing injustice to persist which it could prevent. It is said that the local authority is vulnerable. Certainly it is vulnerable, but, as has already been pointed out, it is not the unjustified claim, or the fraudulent claim, or the try-on claim that is prevented by a period of limitation. Any period of limitation would protect you from that.<br/>
I hope I am not in my professional practice more unscrupulous than other people, but I do assure this House that the very first thing I do in my own office, if I am consulted in any case in which any public authority might possibly be a defendant, is to issue my writ. I cannot afford to take any risk. I do not say that, after doing that, negotiations may not proceed in a perfectly friendly way. They can then proceed in a friendly


way. Then, if I am not satisfied that justice is being done, there is nobody who can prevent me from going to the court and asking the court to determine what is and is not in that case the right thing to do. The existence of a period of limitation, so far from preventing litigation, encourages it, because but for that period of limitation it would not be necessary to issue the writ before you had first ascertained whether you could get justice for your client without litigation at all.<br/>
Then it is said that the local authority is in a worse position than others. Really I do not understand that. If I go outside from here and am knocked down by a taxi I have six years to bring my action; but if I am knocked down by the London Passenger Transport Board's bus I have to do it within six months. It is difficult to understand why. If I go to my native city of Liverpool, the position is reversed. There the buses are a private undertaking, and the trams belong to the local authority. If in Liverpool I am knocked down by a bus I have six years to bring my action, but if I am knocked down by a corporation tram I must do it in six months. I do think this protection was not meant for that kind of case at all. The report, quite clearly, says that where a public authority is performing an administrative act of importance, that is one thing, but where a public authority is performing, not a public administrative act, but exactly the same kind of act which I perform myself when I drive my motor car home at night, then that is quite another thing; and, whereas in the first case I am entitled to full protection, in the other I ought to be in exactly the same position as other people are.<br/>
I am sorry I have been a little long. This is a matter on which I feel strongly. I would say this. When you find, as I suggest is found here, that the only defenders of a privilege are those who profit by it, I think there is a case for considering carefully whether that privilege ought to be retained, ought to be limited, or ought to be abolished; and I suggest that there is nobody to-day who defends the privileged position of the public authority before the courts except where it is performing an administratvie act of importance, except the public authorities themselves. Where that is so, one ought to be very careful to see that it really is the will of the legislature that that privilege should still exist.<br/>
Finally, I do a little regret that the Amendment designed to take the protection out altogether should not have been debated. I say that for this reason that, so far as I can make out, although this privilege in its present form has been enjoyed for nearly half a century and in some forms for a longer period than that, so far as I can trace there has never been an occasion when the principle of it has been debated and discussed in either House of Parliament, or when deliberately, after full discussion, investigation and analysis, the House has determined that the principle is a right one. This, I think, is the first occasion on which the House has considered it deeply at all, and I think it might have been advisable if we could possibly have considered the whole principle. We cannot do that. We may consider one or two of the applications of it, and this is one of them. But I do urge hon. Members, considering the case as a whole as it has been presented, to say that if we cannot abolish it altogether, if we cannot limit it altogether as we would like to do, at any rate if we can extend the period from one year to two years we shall go some way, perhaps a considerable way, towards removing what is, I venture to suggest, an injustice which cannot be founded on reason or truth.</p>

<p>An hon. Member has said that this is a matter in which the legal profession was taking a great interest. Well, I am no longer a practising lawyer and I have no personal interest in it, but I am interested in the cause of fair play and justice to the citizens. My contention is that from the time this Act was passed in 1893 which made this free of universal application and permitted it to be put forward in all actions against public authorities, there has been hardly a year that has passed when some of His Majesty's judges, especially in Scotland, have not fulminated against the injustice of the Act. Lord Salvesen, a very great judge, has time and again animadverted on it in the gravest possible terms.<br/>
I well remember the Act being passed, and there really was no discussion on it. It was assumed it was a mere codification of the law. No one had the slightest suspicion that this monstrosity of cutting off from his legal rights a man who had been wronged was being brought into being. I was a very juvenile practitioner


then, and the deputy town clerk of Glasgow, who was the then Lord Advocate and was the cause of it being enacted, was a very dear friend of mine, and he and I frequently discussed it. The profession in Scotland did not know of the Act when it was passed, it had got through so quietly, and they and their clients suffered severely by its being put up to them after it had become law. The practice was to negotiate till the time was up, and then to interview the plaintiff lawyer, or pursuer lawyer as we call him, being nearer the primitive, and when he saw that, he was so shocked that he had not been aware of it, that he took whatever sum was offered then <i>ex gratia.</i> Many members of the legal profession could not believe that such an Act had been passed. They did not think that this great Imperial Parliament could possibly pass an Act so unjust.<br/>
Now it has been suggested that public authorities are not bound to plead the Act, but I say this must be wrong. They are there in a fiduciary capacity, and they are bound to plead every defence that is open to them; and if anybody criticises them, their answer is that if there is an injustice in it then the blame must be put on the Parliament that passed it. I do not mind admitting that lawyers are a little different from normal citizens. Many of them are more delighted at winning a bad case than a good one. Anyone can win a good case, but it takes a clever lawyer to win a bad one, and to get off a guilty man is a much greater forensic triumph than to get off a man who is plainly innocent.<br/>
Now you have all legal men advising these authorities, and it is their duty to do their best for their clients, and to get away with the minimum sum of damages. If you take the different associations which have sent in representations about this Bill, every one of them is composed of members of the legal profession, and, as I have said, it is up to them to get the maximum for their clients, the local authorities. But it is for us as Members of Parliament to see that justice is done to the citizens, and not to pay any attention to the representations of interested parties.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, and I have no doubt that the Lord Advocate thought it was perfectly just, because the attitude of the Glasgow Corporation in those days was that anybody who served an action on the Glasgow Corporation did a public wrong, because the Glasgow Corporation was so just itself that it could never do a wrong to anybody, and I remember one time the town clerk took me to task, when I had acted in two or three cases against the corporation, and I said to him, "Here John, the only way you can prevent my being against the corporation is to take me into every case, and then I cannot be against them." I do not think I was firmly appointed, but I had most of the cases. In tram accident cases the corporation used to get particulars from the drivers and conductors and the names of the witnesses, and for years after 1868 they objected to producing them. I had a case in which I disputed that this evidence was confidential and the High Court eventually came to the conclusion that I was right. After that we always got the names and addresses of the witnesses, although they tried in every way to prevent us getting them.</p>

<p>It does not matter whether they were privately-owned. The point is that one could not get the report of an employ&#x00E9; to his employer because it was said to be confidential. I said it was not and I got that plea upset. The result was that I was struck off the roll of the council. Then I afflicted them for years. Some time afterwards after a case I was taken back to their list of pleaders. Glasgow Corporation were a first-class corporation but they took themselves far too seriously. They took the attitude that anyone who raised an action against them was a blackmailer. There is


another injustice in this Act in a Section which provides that if the plaintiff loses his case he can be mulcted in double expenses, that is to say expenses as between agent and client. That is a most unjust thing and it leads to the lawyer of an ordinary small man having to give the advice that as there was a risk of judgment going against him and he would have to pay heavy expenses, he should not pursue the case but accept a sum much less than he would get on a trial. We hear very much about the speculative lawyer but I think he is very much nonexistent. I have often taken a case for a poor man because I thought his case was just. I have never asked a man for money if his case was just. The speculative agent was not affected by this provision because his client did not pay anything, anyway.<br/>
I ask the House to get back to fundamentals. Can it be just that, simply because damage is caused through negligence by a public authority, they should not be liable for the ordinary results that affect other great corporations and private individuals? Great wrongs are done every now and again because of this protection, and I maintain that if we leave this weapon in the hands of public authorities they are bound to perpetrate injustices for they are bound to use it. Conclusive evidence of that is seen in what happened in Croydon. One man got damages because his solicitor got off the mark at once, and the rest have been done down. So the corporation come to the House and ask for leave to act honestly. I believe that practically all members of public authorities are against this protection, and I am sure that if we put it to each one in his private capacity he would be ashamed of it. I do not believe that if it were put to them on a vote, with all the facts, they would support it. A corporation, however, has no body to be kicked and no soul to be damned. These authorities do in a public capacity what their members would never do in an individual capacity. If we extended this period it would not lead to more litigation, but would lead to far more settlements because nobody in his senses ever enters into litigation if he can possibly get out of it. As long as we keep this Act standing we are asking for trouble. It may be said that six years is too long, but if it were extended to two years it would greatly mitigate the

hardships that occur again and again in many cases that we never hear of. I am sure that every one of the authorities really wants an opportunity of dealing justly towards those whom they may happen to have injured.</p>

<p>I was under the impression that a public authority consisted of its members and that without the members there would be no public authority at all, but I do not press the point. Those who supported the Amendment have made a great point of suggesting that the Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, got through the House only by a sort of accident and that members did not realise what they were doing. I do not know what time of the night it went through, but when the hon.

<p>I have carefully read the Debate which took place upstairs, and having heard the reply of the hon. Member for Dundee, I still find difficulty in understanding in what way, so far as the ordinary public are concerned, the Public Authorities' Protection Act took away any right which they had previously held. This protection which the public authorities have has continued for centuries, and I submit that what we are not debating now is whether it is right that they should continue to have it; the issue on this Amendment is, it having been conceded that they ought to have the protection, whether it should be limited to one year or two years. That is the only question before the House, and I propose to direct myself to it. It may be that hon. Members would have liked another Amendment, but they have not moved it, and although the House does sometimes wander from the proper course I am not going to wander but shall discuss the Amendment which is on the Paper. I invite the House to say whether there is any justification for extending the protection to two years instead of one. The hon. Member who moved the Amendment quite fairly admitted that only a few cases suffered under the existing limit of six months. I recognise that those cases may be serious, but he admitted that they were few in number. He quoted one case. I did not quite follow the dates he gave, but my impression was that in that case the difficulty would have been met by an extension from six months to one year. So that if the law had been what it is proposed it should be, he would not have been able to quote it in justification of his argument. The case quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Silverman) was one in which a person had a perfectly good cause of action, but, instead of going to a solicitor, went to a member of the council, and asked that member to intervene for him, and that councillor actually conducted negotiations with the town clerk. I submit that that is most improper procedure and that we should not defend it or justify it. [HON. MEMBERS: "It is often done."] It is none the less irregular.</p>

<p>&#x2014;and I think that is a very proper procedure. But I am endeavouring to deal with an individual case which has been quoted by an hon. Member and I feel that it is not a good case in support of his argument, because the aggrieved party deliberately chose a course which was ill advised and ought to take the consequences.

<p>I also referred to a case which was before the courts a few months ago and obtained a great deal of publicity, in which the period of 12 months proved not to be long enough.

<p>And there is less likelihood of hardships arising if the period is extended from six months to 12 months. I submit that it is a reasonable extension and would meet the large majority of cases&#x2014;I am not suggesting every case&#x2014;with which local authorities are concerned. Hon. Members supporting the Amendment have referred to the disadvantages of individual members of the public, but the general public have to be considered. After all, public authorities are only bodies which represent the general public, and we must not lose sight of the fact that while we may be helping individual members of the public we may be injuring the public as a whole. What this House has to do is to endeavour to hold the scales evenly between individual members of the public and the public as a whole. It seems to me that by extending the period from six months to 12 months a reasonable attempt has been made to hold the scales fairly, because while we shall not be causing public authorities to suffer to any great extent individual members of the public will have

a better opportunity of making their case than they had before.<br/>
It is as difficult to say that one year is right as to say that two years are wrong, but at any rate I have the authority of the Law Revision Committee, which considered this very carefully indeed, for the view I am taking. Hon. Members have quoted various portions of that report to suit their case, and I could quote other portions to suit my case, but all I want to do is to quote their conclusion. It was a conclusion which these eminent lawyers&#x2014;for they are eminent&#x2014;arrived at after very careful consideration of all the circumstances. From the quotations given by the hon. Member for Dundee we realise that they were very much alive to the problem which he is putting before the House, and at the end of their report they stated in specific terms, after having given the matter every consideration, that the case would be met by extending the period from six months to 12 months. I think the House would be well advised to accept the conclusions of that Committee.<br/>
Hon. Members who support the Amendment have endeavoured to make a lot of the special and peculiar difficulties which public authorities suffer from in connection with actions which are brought against them. I do not think that they are particularly alarmed by the speculative solicitor. He is not necessarily their worst enemy. I quite agree with what has been said by the hon. Member for Dundee and the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne, that the speculative solicitor can look after himself every time and that he will undoubtedly take action within the proper time, whether it is six months or 12 months.<br/>
The difficulty of the local authorities is in obtaining evidence to repudiate improper claims after too long a period. Anyone who is associated with a large public authority will agree that that is a real difficulty. I have been endeavouring to enumerate the duties of a large local authority in respect of which claims might be brought. I got as far as 15 when you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, called upon me to address the House. There is undoubtedly a considerable number more, but in respect of any one of those duties


the local authority is likely to be shot at. When a person claims damages from a local authority he is not required to give notice of his claim and under the law, even as it is proposed to be amended, the first intimation that a local authority would have would be the writ issued against them, perhaps 11 months after.</p>

<p>I am sure that my hon. Friend does not want to mislead the House. He is himself a lawyer and he has probably read the Public Authorities Protection Act which clearly lays down that unless a plaintiff against a local authority gives the local authority an opportunity to treat and tender amends before his action, he cannot recover in that action. The issue of the writ cannot therefore be the first intimation that the local authority gets, and with that position nobody is proposing in any way to interfere.</p>

<p>The real point is that a long time may elapse, practically the greater part of the 12 months, before the local authority even hears of the claim. A claimant may easily come within the law if he has waited for nearly nine months and then has given notice of his claim and issued his writ within the two years&#x2014;if the period is extended to two years as is proposed. I submit that a local authority is very greatly handicapped in meeting such claims, which may be made a long time after the event.</p>

<p>I can give the answer, which may not please my hon. and gallant Friend. It is that a large variety of different kinds of claim may be made against the local authority and that the authority operates on so much larger a scale that the difficulties are increased.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1939-05-03a.1979.4" hansard_membership_id="9340" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29941" speakername="Major Milner" colnum="1979" time="">

<p>It means that the local authority has to be specially protected. With that principle I think nobody in this House is in dispute, because there is no question of giving to local authorities a period extending to six years. The difference is between one year or two

years, and I cannot too strongly emphasise that the principle is thereby conceded that public authorities are entitled to special protection by reason of their special difficulties. I submit that they have special difficulties and are entitled to this special protection. Having regard to the existing period of six months, which it is proposed to extend to 12 months, I submit that no substantial hardship will be caused to members of the public. The protection to which I refer is reasonable and necessary in order to safeguard the interests of a wider public who, after all, are entitled to be considered at least as much as any individual member of the public. For the reasons I have given I shall oppose the Amendment and accept the Clause as it stands.</p>

<p>The House must approach this subject with due regard to the limitation under which we work, namely, that we are not considering the matter of principle as to whether local authorities should have the same period of limitation. We are considering the very limited question indeed as to whether the proper period is 12 months or two years. I cannot pass one of the interruptions of the last speaker without a meed of correction. The hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Silverman) said that if the plaintiff against a local authority did not give an opportunity to the local authority to make amends, he lost his cause of action; in fact, he is penalised only in costs. That was a slip on the part of the hon. Member, and I am sure that he will be glad to see it corrected.</p>

<p>I am very much obliged to the hon. and learned Member. I do see that it was a slip to say that the plaintiff would lose his cause of action altogether. What is the case, especially when so much has been said about speculative solicitors, is that unless that opportunity of amends is given before the action commences, the plaintiff, even though he win his case, cannot recover any costs.</p>

<p>The point is, of course, quite good. The first question to which we have to give consideration is whether there is


anything magical at all in any period of limitation in the law of this country. As I understand the position, there is nothing magical in the period of six years, except that it has existed for some 300 years. I cannot imagine anyone who supports the Amendment being particularly enamoured with that argument for the basis of the period. We have to consider one general question: Is this period that we now suggest going to avert injustice? There is no injustice in it being a different period from that of the private individual, if there is any basis, in principle, in the period which the private individual enjoys.<br/>
With regard to the period of 12 months, I ask hon. Gentlemen who have considered it at all from the point of view of legal practice, or of the approach of the ordinary citizen to the problem, in how many cases is it going to be difficult to decide in 12 months whether you should issue a. writ or not? The case that springs to our mind is where the plaintiff is very badly injured and is still in hospital. Obviously he would have a writ issued and would stake out his claim, but the fact that he is in hospital does not put a difficulty in his way, as every hon. Member knows. The authorities in the hospital are always ready to place before him the position in which he is situated, and the necessity for staking out his claim in the field of litigation. As far as the solicitor is concerned, I cannot imagine a case, and I speak with absolute sincerity, in which a solicitor cannot decide, within 12 months of an accident or of some claim of a different kind, whether he should issue a writ. In what difficulty is he or his client placed by the issue of a writ? It costs, if my recollection is right, about 30s., and it is not going to prejudice the position of the client or make the position of the solicitor more difficult. Therefore, when we come to consider the actualities of the case, we are not seeking to perpetuate an injustice, but are providing the litigant with a reasonable opportunity for presenting his case and a reasonable time in which to make up his mind. The only remnant of argument to which the Mover of the Amendment can then cling is, why should there be a difference at all between a private individual and a local authority?</p>

<p>If the hon. and learned Member will allow me to interrupt him,

he has not met a very important part of the case which we sought to put before the House, and that is that it sometimes happens that the plaintiff does not discover within the limited time that he has a claim against a public authority. There are other cases, as the hon. and learned Member knows, in which the plaintiff is under a misapprehension and brings an action against some other defendant, only finding out when it is too late that the real defendant is a public authority.</p>

<p>The position in which the plaintiff does not know that the defendant is a public authority arose in a well-known case against the London Passenger Transport Board, and the matter had to be litigated before the point was cleared up. But I would ask the hon. Member to try to envisage any similar case in the future where that difficulty is likely to recur.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the hon. Member has chosen a case in one portion of which I appeared as counsel. I would only say that, if at every stage of that case the plaintiff had taken the precaution of joining the local authority, as in fact the solicitor for whom I appeared had done, that difficulty would not have arisen; and if those who prepared the case had considered it necessary to join all the parties, no difficulty would have arisen at all. There must be cases where people choose the wrong parties. That must arise sometimes, and they must be penalised for it. The mistakes of lawyers must be penalised, just as the mistakes of everyone else are penalised. These cases are bound to arise. I am sorry that I cannot remember for the moment the second point that the hon. Member put to me; perhaps he would be kind enough to repeat it.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens&#x2014;it happened quite recently&#x2014;that the plaintiff sues the wrong defendant. In a recent case the plaintiff sued contractors, who, he thought, were in charge of a building at the material time, but, when he brought his action more than 12 months afterwards, he found that the


building had in fact passed into the occupation of a public authority. That is an actual case which arose in the courts a few months ago.</p>

<p>There again I would ask the House closely to examine the facts. At a point of time the building passed from the contractor to the local authority, and, somewhere about that point of time, injury was occasioned to someone by the works, or as a result of the works. Does the House seriously think that an ordinary wide-awake plaintiff and wide-awake solicitor cannot discover within 12 months whether the contractor or the corporation was then in charge of the building?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1939-05-03a.1983.1" hansard_membership_id="4528" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14979" speakername="Mr. Foot" colnum="1983" time="">
<p>In the case I have in mind the solicitors communicated with the local authority in order to find out who was in occupation of the building, and the local authority informed them that the contractor was in occupation, but actually it turned out that the local authority themselves were in occupation. I do not say that they meant to mislead, but in fact they did mislead, the plaintiff, and, as a result, he lost his right of action.</p>

<p>The hon. Member has certainly quoted a very extreme case where a local authority does not know whether it is in occupation or not, but I would remind him of the provisions of the Rules of Court by which anyone can, when there is any doubt at all, join parties and is safeguarded in costs. The hon. Member will recollect that the test is not whether he succeeds against the parties joined, but whether it is reasonable in the circumstances to join them. I submit that there is an answer to both the points which the hon. Member put to me, and I have endeavoured to give it in what I hope is a detached and fair way.<br/>
I should like to follow the hon. Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) on the wider aspect of this matter as it affects local authorities. We are too apt to consider the local authorities simply from the point of view of their trading powers&#x2014;from the point of view, for example, of their running tramways or omnibus services, or carrying on similar activities. I would, however, ask the House to look at other aspects of the matter. Take, for example, the watch committee of a local authority,

who have to deal, among other matters, with appeals of police constables from the decision of the chief constable under the various Acts which govern our police forces. That is one case in which members of local authorities have to sit and act in a quasi-judicial and quasi-administrative capacity. In other capacities they have to take administrative decisions of great difficulty, which may have far-reaching results. Not only does the constitution of the council change with each November election, but every member of the old and of the new council has a host of new duties, and I think there is a great hardship on members of these bodies who are challenged with delayed actions a long time later. Their case is different from that of the individual, who is concerned with actions connected with the affairs of his own life which are well in his own mind. The members of a committee of a local authority, on the other hand, are dealing with the affairs of countless numbers of their fellow-citizens, and, in view of their duties, which are not trading duties or anything of that kind, I think they are entitled to the consideration which we are suggesting.<br/>
As regards the period of 12 months, if we were perpetrating an injustice we should be ready to change it, but when the question is examined from that point of view, and it is found that no injustice or difficulty is caused to the litigant and his solicitor, and when we consider that public authorities are concerned with the welfare of their fellow-citizens in innumerable aspects I think we should maintain something that has existed since 1893, but something which goes back for nearly 100 years beyond that&#x2014;to the time when public opinion recognised that there was a difference between the acts of persons acting merely on their own behalf and the acts which they might perform when they were acting either for the community or for large bodies of their fellow-citizens. For these reasons, I ask the House to reject this Amendment.</p>

<p>I desire to support the Amendment. I regard two years as a very moderate limit to impose. I have listened to the Debate as a layman, with no legal knowledge, and I have learned&#x2014;as I often do from Debates in this House&#x2014;many things that it is good for me, as a public representative, to know.


But I hear from time to time of the difficulties of people who may be the victims of accidents in consequence of which they have claims against local authorities. Considering the arguments which have been advanced in the light of my own experience, I am compelled to vote for the Amendment. Has the hon. and learned Member for West Derby (Mr. Fyfe) ever known of cases in which after an accident it took a certain time for the effect to be felt? I know of a case in Glasgow where a man died one year and eight months after the accident. He had injured his back and spine, but he decided to take no action, because he thought that it was only a matter of bruising and that the effects would disappear. Thirteen months after the accident grievous consequences developed, but he was debarred from taking action. His friends came to me and I endeavoured to get something done, but it was too late; and one year and eight months after the accident the man died, as a result of the accident. I have known cases in Glasgow where people have suffered from the effects of accidents and have not taken action for a certain time, and then have gone to a solicitor. The solicitor has been negligent and has failed to take action within a reasonable time, and his clients have been debarred from obtaining compensation as a result of his negligence.<br/>
The hon. Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) maintained that it was most irregular for a councillor to have to negotiate with the town clerk in order to get a settlement for people whom he represented. I asked him whether he was aware that there are members of councils who are solicitors and who themselves negotiate settlements. I had an example only this morning of a case against the Glasgow Corporation, in which the agent, who was a solicitor, was the convenor of the police committee, and was actually in charge of a case against the police committee for a policeman who, it was claimed, died as the result of an accident. I am not saying that it is improper&#x2014;because I do not believe that it is improper&#x2014;but if it is not improper for a solicitor who is a councillor to negotiate a settlement for a client with the town clerk, surely a layman who is a councillor is as much entitled to do so. But I understand that on the legal side there is always an objection to a councillor or a

Member of Parliament negotiating a settlement, because if he does so he is doing the solicitor out of a job.</p>

<p>My contention is that in both cases it is wrong: that a member of a council has an undue influence over a town clerk, and is in a position to extort a better settlement than might be the case if the other was a free agent.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1939-05-03a.1986.1" hansard_membership_id="8607" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18189" speakername="Mr. McGovern" colnum="1986" time="">
<p>In most cases, what happens is that the town clerk comes to the appropriate committee, reports the claim and intimates that an action is proposed; and he puts before the committee the question as to whether a settlement should be made. The town clerk is not the person who completes the settlement, but very often the members of the committee themselves appoint a sub-committee to meet the other person's agent and come to a conclusion. I am just as much alive as any person in this House to any avenues of impropriety in regard to public authorities, but I do not look at this as the hon. Member for Peckham looks at it. I look at it from the point of view of an ordinary layman who has the right to expect justice and decent treatment if he or she suffers from the negligence of a public authority. The hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot) says that you have the right to sue an ordinary individual or private firm during a period of six years. I can conceive that some people might say that that is too long a period. If there had been a suggestion that there should be a three years' period to apply all round I could have seen the force of that. No one could deny that 12 months is better than six months, but two years would be very much better indeed.<br/>
The case stated by the hon. Member for Dundee was an extreme case, and surely we are entitled to deal with extreme cases and to make the law sufficiently elastic so to give an opportunity for action by those who may at present be debarred on account of being extreme cases. The hon. Member mentioned that the judge said that he would have awarded &#x00A3;2,500, which means that that family were denied the redress that they ought to have had if there had been the two years' limitation in this case. The hon. Member for Dundee dealt with one or two such cases, but there are cases all over the country that never come to light. They come before private individuals. Last night there was a suggestion that we were overdoing the question of the


10s. payment to old age pensioners when we were considering putting taxation on motor bicycles, but surely we are entitled to argue, for example, that the case of the poor woman whose husband may have died as the result of an accident, and who may have to go through life without receiving the compensation which, but for this limitation, would have been taken into account. If it only means a few cases, there is all the greater reason for elasticity.<br/>
I would like to hear the argument&#x2014;I have not heard it yet&#x2014;on the justification for the difference of six years in respect of a private firm and of six months in respect of a public authority. The hon. Member argued that the public authority ought to have protection. Public authorities can protect themselves; at least that is my experience. I recognise the dangers to ordinary individuals. The right hon. Gentleman the Member for South Hackney (Mr. H. Morrison) has become the custodian of a public authority. I do not object to his defending the interests of the public authority, but I am entitled to ask that the people who sent him to the public authority should receive some consideration also. I am keeping in mind both the public authority and the people who send me to express their difficulties on the Floor of this House. I try to keep that in view, and that is why my Socialism is sometimes more prominent than that of hon. Members above the Gangway. [An HON. MEMBER: "Do not apologise."] I do not need to apologise. I do not require to assure anybody of my Socialism. When a man has to go on to the platform and assure people that he is a Socialist, it is a sign that he is not a Socialist.<br/>
In dealing with this matter purely from the point of view of the ordinary layman and taking all the difficulties into account, my experience leads me along the avenue of attempting to protect these extreme cases. If it was only a question of half a dozen cases being protected, I should still consider the Amendment justified. Therefore, looking at these difficulties, having had experience of a number of such cases in the past, knowing that they can be multiplied all over the country, and that solicitors may sometimes fail in their duty, I am in favour of this two years' protection. I support it, because there is justifiable reason behind it.</p>

<p>I said on the Second Reading that there was a remarkable unanimity on the part of the lawyers on this particular matter. It has not been quite as evident to-night. I think that the legal gentlemen who have spoken are about evenly divided, and that fact constitutes a reason why I should stick to the local authorities. The hon. Gentleman the Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot) went to some pains to-night to prove that he was not making an attack upon local authorities, and he was supported in that argument by my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Silverman). However, it appeared to me to be an attack, or an endeavour to render local authorities liable to extensive litigation to which they have not hitherto been subjected. The hon. Gentleman is in very bad company. He quoted me on the Committee stage of the Bill, and as I happen to have a copy of the OFFICIAL REPORT of the Committee, I want to quote part of the speech of the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Argyllshire (Mr. Macquisten). The hon. and learned Gentleman was talking about the local authorities and said:
<q>They want to escape the law courts. They do not want the light of day to enter upon them. That is the one thing they want to avoid. All this talk about speculative actions is 'bunkum,' for no man raises an action unless he has a <i>prima facie</i> case. Any public authority rejoices in litigation.</q>
In the first place, hon. Members will notice that they want to avoid the law courts, and in the second place that they rejoice in litigation.
<q>Why should they not? They arc not litigating with their own money. It is the ratepayers' money."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT (<i>Standing Committee C</i>), 21st February, 1939; col. 21.]</q>
If that does not constitute an attack upon local authorities I have never heard one, and I congratulate the hon. Member for Dundee and my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne on the company they are keeping to-night. I had to point out to the hon. and learned Member for Argyllshire in Committee that when we on this side of the House had submitted a Bill or Bills to improve the law with regard to Workmen's Compensation and to do away with some of the anomalies in the Act, we always found the hon. and learned Gentleman in the other lobby. I am amazed at the sentiments which have been expressed by the hon. Member for


Shettleston (Mr. McGovern), and I am going to challenge him to tell the House whether there has been any demand for this drastic alteration in the law as it relates to local authorities? He may have had some experience, and, at any rate, I can say that I have had 19 years' experience of a local authority and have never yet known one case where a person has come forward and told the council or any councillors or aldermen that he has suffered any hardship as a consequence of the Public Authorities' Protection Act.</p>

<p>It seems to me that I am interrupting somebody else's speech. The case which the hon. Member quoted would have been dealt with under the proposed amendment of the law. The case which my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Silverman) quoted is a most peculiar one. It almost reads like a fairy story, from some points of view. That case needed, first of all, a fool for a councilor&#x2014;and they appear to have found one&#x2014;and a knave for a town clerk, and these two people apparently were in an atmosphere of ignorance. That case could not have been consummated unless you had those

elements present. For my part, I should want to know a good deal more about the cases that have been quoted.<br/>
The hon. Member for Nelson and Colne said that he had been nine years on a local authority. He did not, however, bring forward one case in which, during that period, hardship had occurred through the operation of the Local Authorities Protection Act. He seemed to have an entirely wrong idea of what a local authority is. He seemed to have the idea that a local authority is something apart altogether from the citizens of the community. This protection is not for a few councillors or aldermen, the town clerk or the lord mayor. It is protection given to the citizens of Glasgow, Sheffield, London and other communities. What I do not like about the legal profession in this matter is that they seem to think that the Parliamentary and Law Committee of a public authority, which may be comprised of 21 individuals, are engaged in a conspiracy to deprive injured parties of their rights. That is not only incorrect but it is a vicious travesty of the position. It is an insult to the honesty, decency and intelligence of members of local authorities.<br/>
I have already spoken about the views expressed by the hon. and learned Member for Argyll, and I say that the charge that he makes against local authorities, that they are always wanting to enter into liquidation and then they try to avoid it, is a charge that is not only untrue but unworthy. It only shows how a mind can become warped when it misunderstands people who are doing a really important job. This protection has been given to local authorities in one form for the last 300 years. It is true that the hon. Member for Dundee questioned that in Committee, but I think it is agreed that this protection was given in some degree for 300 years. It has not been given without some good cause. I do not profess to be a lawyer, thank goodness, but I do not imagine that something has been given to these great public bodies for 300 years without good cause.<br/>
My second point is that the local authorities have considered this matter very carefully and seriously, and they tell us honestly and frankly that if this matter is extended to a point any further than the Bill proposes to extend it, it will open them to a vast area of litigation that is


not open to them to-day, unfair litigation, and it will place them in a very parlous condition. My third point is that this is a consolidation Bill, and if we are to use Bills of this character to introduce far-reaching changes into the law which will open up these vast new fields of litigation to local authorities, those authorities will have to look at the matter very seriously. I say again that there has been no general demand for this change.<br/>
Hon. Members seem to suggest that local authorities are in the same position as private individuals. They are not. The local authority has many administrative acts to perform. It literally looks after the individual from the cradle to the grave, in some form of administrative compulsion or other, and I contend, and I think the House will contend, that in that capacity local authorities ought to be protected. I know of certain hospitals where the local authorities are practically performing modern miracles. They are taking the limbs of crippled little children and straightening them. They are taking feet which have turned backwards and turning them into the proper position. They are curing curvature of the spine. It is possible that here and there mistakes are made. It would be almost a miracle if that was not the case. You cannot find individuals who are doing this work in the same sense as our local authorities, or who are compelled to do it. Nearly every person who does it, other than a local authority, is doing it for profit.<br/>
There is a vast difference between local authorities and private individuals. Take the case of the fever hospitals. They are compelled to do their work, they have no option, and I am sure the House will feel that while local authorities are performing these great administrative acts they are entitled to special protection. That is why protection has been given. The local authorities have agreed to the period of limitation being doubled and to certain modifications in a later Clause. I sincerely hope the Attorney-General will stand firm and will protect these great public institutions, which are doing enormous work, possibly even more precious work than this House is doing. I ask the Attorney-General to protect the local authorities from the speculative lawyer and from the new area of litigation that will place upon them dangers that they have not hitherto had to face.</p>

<p>With great respect to the hon. Member who has just addressed the House, with such vigour, I rise to support the Amendment of the hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot). I cannot follow the arguments that have been put forward against it. The principal point which was raised by those who spoke against the Amendment appeared to be that the House was not concerned with any general objection to privileges given to local authorities and, therefore, certain hon. Members appeared to attach weight to that point. It was a good debating point, but I submit that there is not the smallest substance in it. The House will ask itself three questions: (1) Has there been injustice under the existing law; (2) under the law as it is proposed, without the Amendment, is it possible or likely that injustice will continue to any degree; and (3) if the answers to the first two questions are, as I believe, in the affirmative, does the proposed Amendment do anything to alleviate the injustice which would otherwise be caused? When hon. Members, in supporting the Amendment, say that they are convinced that the local authority ought not to be given any privilege at all, then, in my submission, they are justified in doing so and in asking the House to support the Amendment, because they are satisfied that the Amendment, inadequate as it may be, will reduce the amount of injustice which they have proved to exist in existing practice, and under the law as it is proposed in the Bill as it stands.<br/>
Why are we asked to reject the Amendment? We are asked to do so, first of all, by the hon. Member for the Bright-side Division of Sheffield (Mr. Marshall) on the ground that no injustice has been caused under the existing law. He asks us to reject the Amendment because he says that in his large experience as a member of a local authority no injustice has been caused. If that is so, why has this Bill been introduced? Why has the six months' period been extended to a year? There is not a barrister practising at the Common Law Bar who does not realise that grievous injustice has been caused to litigants, and to poor litigants who cannot afford a good solicitor by the existing law. We have been asked by an hon. Member to reject the Amendment on the ground that the injustices


will be few. I cannot follow that argument at all. Why should any injustice be caused by law unless it can be justified on the grounds of absolute necessity? No such justification has been suggested. Why are we to be comforted by the thought that injustice will be caused only in a relatively small proportion of cases, unless it can be shown that it is absolutely justified?</p>

<p>I am sure, having heard what has been said in support of the Amendment, he will support it as being in accordance with true Socialist principles. Has any necessity been shown why these injustices should continue? In my submission no such necessity has been put forward at all. Hon. Members who have opposed the Amendment have, without exception, spoken as if the only type of authority which is covered by the Public Authorities' Protection Act is a local authority. That is not the case. We are concerned here just as much with the Departments of State. I can speak out of my own experience&#x2014;it was not a case in which I was personally concerned, but it occurred in the Chambers which I occupy&#x2014;of a case where one of the great Departments of State deliberately led the litigants in negotiations until the period of protection had expired and then proceeded to put forward the Public Authorities' Protection Act as a bar to the claim. The member of the Bar who was concerned in that case, with very great courage indeed, and, I think, with technical impropriety, put forward the plea of fraud on the record, and the result was that the Department of State immediately compromised and paid a sum of, I think &#x00A3;2,000 by way of damages. It is absurd to talk as if an attack is being made on local authorities alone. It is inevitable that the official mind should make every use it can of official privilege, and official privilege is a thing which this House has always very jealously regarded. If it can be shown, as it has been, that it has been abused in the past, then surely it is right to limit its use for the future.<br/>
It has been suggested by hon. and learned Members that litigants have only themselves or their solicitors to blame if they do not issue their writs in proper time. I confess that again I fail to see the force of that argument. It is, as I conceive it, the purpose of good legislation to limit the scope of negligence in lawyers and the public, not to extend it, and if it can be shown that the law is already so complicated and difficult that members of the legal profesion habitually make mistakes in not issuing writs in proper time, then I submit that the hon. Member has made out his case for a simplification of the law and for approximation to a general standard. An hon. Member has also suggested that the difference in principle between a local authority and a private litigant lies in the fact that the constitution of a local authority changes from time to time in accordance with democratic practice. The answer to that is that a local authority has a very efficient permanent staff, and that one of the duties of that permanent staff lies in the investigation and settlement of claims made by parties who are aggrieved by the action of the local authority. I fail to see why that permanent staff is there at all if it is not there in order to inform the changing members of the council of the state of affairs which exists.<br/>
Two hon. Members have said that the general public have an interest, and that these priviliges are put in for the purpose of protecting members of the general public. I have not understood, and I still fail to understand, what possible interest the general public can have in inflicting injustice on its individual members, and I fail to understand why the general public should be supposed to desire to bar poor litigants, who for one reason or another have allowed six months or a year to elapse before issuing their writs, from getting the justice which they would otherwise obtain. That is another of the objections to the Amendment which has no substance in it at all. It is said that local authorities experience difficulty in getting evidence to rebut claims. Where is the reason for supposing that local authorities find it more difficult to obtain evidence than an ordinary litigant? On the contrary. My experience has been that a local authority, as soon as an accident takes place, prepares a very careful and


adequate report showing all the names of possible witnesses, with the fullest report from their own servants, which is filed against a future contingency, whereas a private litigant has no such system at his disposal, no such experience of previous cases and, in fact, is very much more embarrassed than a public authority in obtaining the evidence necessary to resist a claim.<br/>
I have taken note, I think, of every single objection which has been put forward in the course of the Debate to the Amendment. I have attempted to deal with each one of them. I have not the slightest prejudice against local authorities. I have no great desire, as the hon. Member for the Brightside Division seems to think, as a lawyer to extend the number of cases for litigation, because in the last resort&#x2014;I hope he will accept it from me&#x2014;members of the legal profession, whether they belong to that branch graced by the hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Silverman) or that to which I myself belong, have one great object at heart, and that is justice. They have learned to study justice and to love it. In this matter it is love of justice and a desire for justice which leads me to support an Amendment, which has been moved by hon. Members who do not support the party to which I belong. I hope the House will accept it. I ask the House to answer the three questions I have put in the affirmative, and if they do so, then the Amendment will be passed by an overwhelming majority.</p>

<p>I think it would be desirable to clear away one or two preliminary points. May I say, with due modesty, that I do not give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside (Mr. Marshall) in my support, after a good many years' experience, of local authorities and their work. I had the honour to be vice-president of the Association of Municipal Corporations for many years. I made my first speech in this House in support of the extension of the powers of local authorities, and I do not think that I have on any previous occasion found it necessary or desirable to oppose anything which was considered to be in their interest. Therefore, I start off with, if anything, a prejudice in favour of local authorities.<br/>
A good deal has been said about lawyers. I ask my hon. Friends to believe that lawyers in this matter are personally disinterested. To-day the only safeguard for the individual who suffers injury by the neglect of a local authority or its servants, is to go at once to a lawyer and to have his interests protected, whereas, if this period is extended, it will be possible for the claimant to have greater opportunities of arriving at a settlement with the local authority, without the intervention of a lawyer. Thus, if anything, the prolongation of the period would be contrary to the interests of the legal profession as far as employment and remuneration are concerned. But our interest in this matter arises from the fact that we know that great hardships are suffered as a result of the law as it stands. I would like to put this point to my hon. Friends on these benches. When miners' representatives bring forward questions affecting the interests of miners, on which I cannot claim the same knowledge as some of my hon. Friends possess, or when my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside brings forward something affecting the general workers, for whom he can speak with greater knowledge than I possess, I willingly accept and support the views thus expressed. On this matter of claims, mostly in respect of accidents against local authorities, I submit that members of the legal profession have greater knowledge of the hardships caused by the existing law than hon. Gentlemen who are not lawyers can have. I assure my hon. Friends that it is not a matter of one or two cases but of hundred of cases in a year in which hardships are suffered and people are penalised for life by a law which discriminates between the rights of local authorities and the rights of private individuals.<br/>
Frankly, I should like equality before the law. I should like the six-year period of limitation to apply to local authorities as to individuals. The hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot) suggests a two-year period which would be a great improvement on the present period of six months or the proposed period of 12 months. As I think his proposal affords a greater likelihood of justice than the proposal in the Bill, in the circumstances I accept it and support it, though, as I say, I would like local authorities to be put in the same position as private individuals. Perhaps the Attorney-


General will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that the period of one year was recommended by the Law Revision Committee, not because they thought it was the right period&#x2014;they point out that there are no real grounds for discrimination&#x2014;but because they were making recommendations for a Consolidation Measure, and we know how desirable it is, not to make any greater alterations than are absolutely necessary in a Consolidation Bill, so as to avoid controversy and expenditure of time in this House.<br/>
I also believe that the period of one year was suggested because the local authorities agreed to it. There is, however, no special virtue in it, and the House is competent to increase it to two years or even six years, if the House so desires. It is a curious thing that neither the hon. Member for Peckham (Mr. Silkin) nor the hon. Member for Brightside, thought fit to tell the House whether their respective local authorities turned down one claim, or 10 claims or 100 claims in a year on the ground that they had not been brought within the requisite period. I venture to suggest that if they asked their local authorities how many times a year the Public Authorities Protection Act was pleaded, they would find that it was pleaded very frequently. When I say "frequently," I speak in a comparative sense.</p>

<p>Because I assert that there are many cases in which hardship is suffered at present. My hon. Friend speaks for a local authority which has for many years been under Labour control, and is no doubt at least as generous in its view of these things as any other authority. It may be that the Sheffield Corporation make payments in these cases, but that is not so with the great

majority of other bodies, and we are dealing here with urban and rural district councils as well, and not with the great municipalities alone. It is, therefore, a striking fact that no figures have been brought forward on behalf of the local authorities and I wonder whether my hon. Friend, for whom I have the greatest personal regard and who is president of a very important trade union, has asked the legal advisers of that union how many cases of that sort have had to be dealt with by them. The fact is that my hon. Friend is working on a brief which has been supplied to him by one of the local authorities' associations and has made no independent investigation of any kind. He has asked neither his local authority nor his union about these facts, and I venture to assert that, if he made those inquiries, he would have come here in a rather more chastened spirit than he has shown.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Member is saying something to which I must take exception when he suggests that I am merely working on a brief supplied by the local authorities. I have tried to put forward a proposition which, from 19 years' experience, I believe to be commonsense.</p>

<p>But the hon. Gentleman cannot tell us whether his local authority has pleaded the Public Authorities Protection Act once or a hundred times, although he has been a member of that authority for 19 years. There is another important point which has not yet been mentioned. Many local authorities insure themselves with insurance companies. What the Act has done in the past&#x2014;and what it will continue to do if the period is not extended&#x2014;has been simply to free the insurance companies of their responsibility. My hon. Friend the Member for South Tottenham (Mr. Messer), who is not now in his place, told me before he left the Chamber of an accident which occurred in a laundry belonging to the Tottenham Corporation. The accident resulted in a serious and permanent injury to a person's foot. My hon. Friend told me that it would have justified a claim for &#x00A3;500 or &#x00A3;1,000, but for some reason or other, the period of six months was allowed to elapse, and afterwards no claim could be made, and it was only with the greatest difficulty that it was possible to


obtain an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of &#x00A3;150 from the insurance company which insured the local authority. That individual, according to my hon. Friend, was entitled to receive &#x00A3;500 or &#x00A3;1,000, but had to be content with &#x00A3;150. The insurance company had received premiums which made them responsible for paying whatever sum might be legally adjudicated, but the company was able to get away with it and need not have paid anything in law; but, as my hon. Friend said, it was a very reputable insurance company and made an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of about one-seventh of what the person might have received had a claim been made in time.</p>

<p>Frankly, I cannot answer that question, although I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Member for South Tottenham could answer it. The fact is that people do not know the law. They do what is the reasonable thing. They go to hospital. If it is a case of an accident to a child, the parents do their best to look after the child and to repair the injury if possible, and the question of making a claim is a secondary and later consideration; but eventually it arises, and when it does arise, frequently the period has elapsed and the child, although perhaps maimed for life, has no claim of any kind. I submit that this question of relieving the insurance companies from a liability which they would otherwise have is a very important one.<br/>
It seems to me that no justification has been made for any differentiation between a local authority and an individual in this matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Peckham and my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside spoke about the

multiplicity of departments in a local authority, and said that for that reason the local authority is entitled to special protection. But the railways have a multiplicity of departments; Imperial Chemical Industries and the Yorkshire Electric Power Company, a great public utility corporation employing many thousands of men, have a multiplicity of departments. [An HON. MEMBER: "What about the London Passenger Transport Board?"] By Act of Parliament, the London Passenger Transport Board was made a public authority for this purpose, although in fact it pays dividends to private individuals and is not, in the real sense of the term, a public authority as we are discussing them to-night. Why should there be any differentiation on grounds of complexity or multiplicity of duties between local authorities and the great railway companies, the Yorkshire Electric Power Company or Imperial Chemical Industries? My hon. Friends and I stand for an extension of municipal enterprise. Little by little the position is becoming more and more difficult. The local authorities are taking on fresh duties and responsibilities&#x2014;with which I entirely agree&#x2014;and more and more this Act is becoming important, and it is being increasingly brought to the notice of the public that it causes hardships.<br/>
When the Act was brought in 300 years ago, it was brought in for entirely different reasons. In 1623, it was introduced for the purpose of preventing actions concerning estates and so on from being carried on <i>ad infinitum,</i> for scores of years, if not for hundreds of years. In those days, it had no application to the cases for which we are pleading to-day. Therefore, it is quite beside the point to say that the Act has been in existence for 300 years. I submit to the House that at the present time it causes great hardship to a constantly increasing number of our constituents. I am sure that if any of us were consulted, as ordinary members of the public, as to whether it would not be a great hardship if our son or daughter or some relative were involved in an accident as a result of the negligence of a local authority or its servant and was unable to make a claim&#x2014;as would be the case if the accident had been caused by a private individual&#x2014;by reason of this Act of Parliament, we should agree that there was reason to complain of such a state of


affairs. Is there a single member of the general public who would object to a claim being brought against a local authority? We are merely asking for the ordinary law, as it affects the ordinary individual, to be applied to local authorities, and even if the Amendment were accepted, there would be in the case of a local authority a period of only two years, whereas in the case of an ordinary individual the period is one of six years. I sincerely hope that the House will pass this Amendment, which at any rate would give a greater likelihood of justice and go a long way in removing hardships.</p>

<p>It is not everybody who consults a solicitor to begin with.

<p>As the hon. and learned Member says, there are many cases where the injury continues over a period of 12 months, or even does not become apparent until after 12 months have elapsed. It is essential that the longest possible period should be given. A solicitor is consulted, and the only safeguard, with the law as it is, is that a writ should be issued, but a writ costs money. It is not every poor man who has even the 30s. which it costs to issue a writ. But the real reason for this Amendment is that the majority of people do not consult a lawyer early enough, and do not know their rights, and in some cases an injury is not apparent until after the 12 months. I sincerely hope that the House will pass this Amendment.</p>

<p>I have great pleasure in supporting the Amendment. The only

complaint I have to make is that it does not go far enough. The Sub-section says:
<q>No action shall be brought against any person for any act done in pursuance, of execution, or intended execution of any Act of Parliament, or of any public authority, or in respect of any neglect or default in the execution of any such Act, duty or authority, unless it is commenced before the expiration of one year from the date on which the cause of action accrued.</q>
The result of that is that anyone affected in a variety of ways is entitled to the protection of this Act, and this ought to be borne in mind, that we are getting an ever-increasing number of services performed by statutory bodies, of which, of course, there was no idea when the Act of 1893 was passed. For instance, in London the omnibuses formerly were owned by private companies, now they are owned by the London Passenger Transport Board, and in their case only six months is allowed for the commencement of an action. I have never heard it suggested that the old companies suffered because they were subject to a six years' limitation. The old companies managed quite well, and I quite agree with the hon. Member for Oxford City (Mr. Hogg) that if there is one class, body, or institution that is able to look after itself in litigation it is the public authority. Unlike the private citizens, local authorities can investigate a claim immediately, they tabulate the evidence, and they have the advice of their lawyers. If there should be any differentiation it is the private citizen who needs the longer period.<br/>
I have listened to most of this Debate and I have not heard a single argument why a private person should be subjected to a six years' limitation and public authorities are to have only six months or 12 months. If the private person should be liable for six years, it is surely right that the public authorities, who are much better able to look after themselves, should have a similar limit. Several speakers have said that if this Amendment is passed, there will be all sorts of actions sprung upon the public authorities, which will place them at a great disadvantage. I venture to suggest that that is quite imaginary. There will be some cases, but not many, and they will be cases which will not be taken up unless there is a really good cause of action, because it generally means in


those cases that the plaintiff has no money. Somebody has to find it, or take a risk, and that is not done unless there is a belief in the genuineness of the case.<br/>
I heard an hon. Gentleman ask my hon. Friend who spoke last why a writ was not issued in the particular case he was referring to. A very frequent reason why a writ is not issued is this: Negotiations are opened with a view to a settlement, the correspondence goes on and on, and it is when the correspondence ceases that the public authority says, "We plead the Act." The first case under the 1893 Act was a London County Council case, and the facts were these: There was correspondence as to the amount of compensation, six months elapsed, and then the London County Council pleaded the Act. It was held they were entitled to it. I think the learned judge saw them afterwards and there was some sort of compromise. There was a London County Council case in which three claims were entered. In two cases there was no dispute and payment was made. In the third case only the amount was in dispute. One doctor said one thing and another doctor said something else. The parents agreed with the London County Council that they would wait for some months, when it would be possible to say which of the doctors was right and then there should be a certain amount paid. In that particular case the insurance companies later pleaded the Act. They went down on another legal point but that was not their fault; it was their misfortune.<br/>
If a person has a good case for action he ought not to be barred by this sort of technicality. The person who can afford legal advice is in no danger, but there are persons who do not know about the Poor Persons' Defence Act. There is another class of person, often overlooked, who ought to be considered. That is the person who is too well off to take advantage of the Poor Persons' Defence Rules a man with means over &#x00A3;50 or an income of &#x00A3;2 a week. If he is over that limit he cannot get free defence, and perhaps cannot afford to obtain legal advice. He muddles on, having correspondence, and the six months expires, and the public authorities set up the Act.<br/>
Hon. Members say, in how many cases is this defence pleaded? That is not the point. In how many cases are claims never started, because directly people go to a solicitor they are told "It is too late, nothing can be done"? We are getting legislation ever more complicated because of the multiplicity of authorities, and it is almost impossible in many cases to find out the right defendant. If you happen to pick the wrong one you are too late to find out the truth. The hon. Member for one of the divisions of Liverpool said "But you can join the various people to the action." Of course you can, if you have a solicitor to advise you, and if you do not mind spending a lot of money. If a man is injured he ought not to be deprived of a remedy which he would have against a private person simply because the body responsible comes within the definition of this Act. I venture to hope that the House will do something to restore some measure of justice to a class of litigants who have been deprived of their rights far too long through this antiquated provision.</p>

<p>One cannot help thinking that if there had been this Debate before the Public Authorities Protection Act was passed in 1893, there would have been no such Act passed at all. It must be evident to Members on both sides of the House that Members from Scotland have taken a deep interest in this Bill. It is a Bill designed to apply, not to Scotland or to Northern Ireland, yet in Clause 21, which is intended to extend only to England, an Act of Parliament which extends to the whole of the United Kingdom is sought to be amended, and one asks what will happen in Scotland if this Bill is passed. There will be a diversity of the law as affecting public authorities in England from what will appertain in Scotland. Accordingly, it seems to me that there has been a lamentable lack of departmental co-ordination in the framing of the Bill, and the result will be that the legislative machinery in Westminster will produce an unfortunate diversity and confusion in this branch of law as between Scotland and England. It may be that there is to be introduced another Bill affecting Scotland, and I hope that if such a Bill does come before the House, Members from England will attend and give us the benefit of their


assistance. On the other hand, one result may be that this diversity of the law as between the two countries may give a great impetus to the movement that is strong in Scotland for a separate Legislature in Edinburgh to look after our own Scottish legislative affairs.<br/>
It may interest Members representing English constituencies to know that it sounds strange in the ears of a lawyer coming from Scotland to hear of a six years' limitation in connection with an action grounded on negligence against an individual. There is no such limitation in Scotland, where the only defence, in regard to time, to an action of this sort is the defence of <i>Mora,</i> taciturnity and acquiescence. There is no time limitation. The hon. Member for Oxford City (Mr. Hogg) was speaking about a case in his chambers in which negotiations were carried beyond the time limit, and another example was given from his own practice by the last speaker. In my own experience, I remember a case that was closely akin to these, but the facts of the case were so very unfortunate that I have never forgotten them. The injured person was a lady, a graduate of a Scottish university, and was seriously injured. The liability of the public authority was clear, but the local authority's solicitor, who was in the town clerk's department, asked the pursuer's solicitors&#x2014;I use the Scottish term&#x2014;not to serve the summons because he wanted an examination of the lady who was injured by a medical specialist on behalf of the authority. There was one examination, and there was another, and then deliberately, apparently, there was a still further examination, arranged for a date beyond the six months' limitation. In view of the previous correspondence, the summons in the action was not served, and that examination of the injured lady by the medical specialist, instructed on behalf of the local authority, took place. Then the summons was served, and immediately the Public Authorities Protection Act was pleaded, and it was impossible to get over that plea. The action was thrown out, because of the six months' limitation. I know of other cases too.<br/>
Some hon. Members on this side seem to be under the impression that a local authority may at its own hand waive the protection that is provided by this Act, but I do not see how they can do that at all, and in practice they do not do it.

Suppose the six months had passed, and it was sought to settle an action, what would happen if the accounts of the local authority were carefully scrutinised by the auditor? He would be bound to look into that payment and to say, "Why was it made?" There is in the Public Authorities Act a right given to a public authority, and that right following the rule of the Bishop of Oxford's case must be exercised. The auditor is bound to look into the matter; and if a sum is paid, I cannot understand how he would not have the public authority surcharged for that payment made without legal justification and in the face of the provisions of the Act.<br/>
I do not want to repeat what was said by the hon. and gallant Member for South-East Leeds (Major Milner) with regard to insurance companies. We know that with regard to most local authorities the risk in this connection is taken up by an insurance company, but the Act goes far beyond local authorities, as the last speaker pointed out. In Scotland the Public Authorities' Protection Act applies to an officer in the Army who is in the execution of his public duty, and he may plead the Act. The Amendment before us is to extend the period of one year which appears in the Bill. That period of one year is a certain relaxation as against the restrictions of the Act, which in itself fixes the time limitation at six months. A year is not long enough, and two years is better than one year, though two years is not, I submit, enough. In so far as the issue in this Amendment is two years as against one year, I have no hesitation in supporting the Amendment.</p>

<p>The House will have realised that the subject which we are discussing cuts across party divisions, and consequently hon. Members who are sitting behind me will be taking their own line and will vote according to their own particular point of view. Anything that I say will represent my own point of view and will certainly not bind my right hon. Friend the Member for South Hackney (Mr. H. Morrison) and others who take his point of view. At the same time, although I propose to vote for the Amendment, I disagree with a great deal that has been said by some of those who have spoken in its support. I strongly


disagree with the view put forward by the hon. and gallant Member for South-East Leeds (Major Milner), that there is no case for differentiation between local authorities and individual citizens. I should have thought that, in so far as administration is concerned, in a case where the members of a local authority were not acting on their own behalf but were acting in their official capacity and controlling the affairs of their particular locality, they were definitely in a different position from that of the individual who was, for example, looking after his own business.<br/>
That being so, it does seem that in the case of personal injury a different consideration might arise. When this Act was first passed in 1893 local authorities were not responsible for the great concerns which come under their care to-day, and the great transport undertakings which are being operated by them to-day were then on a much smaller scale. Therefore, the background has changed, and I think there is a case for suggesting that where private citizens have suffered personal injury as the result of the negligence of a servant of a local authority the protection of the Act should operate. What we are discussing to-night is not a question of principle. There has been a good deal of heat engendered by some of the speakers, but I do not understand why that should be so. The question we are discussing on this Amendment is simply whether local authorities should be given 12 months' protection or whether that protection should be for two years. The fundamental question does not arise on this Amendment. I would go further and say that I believe this increase from six to 12 months is an improvement and an extension of time which is to be welcomed. I believe that the extra six months provided for by the Bill will be out of all proportion to the apparent face value of the extension, and that a great number of cases which were prejudiced by the existence of the six months limit will be brought within the purview of legal remedy as the result of the extension to 12 months.<br/>
There, again, however, I cannot understand why there should be any real violent opposition to the extension from 12 months to two years. One might argue, why not extend it to three of four years, but from the practical point of view I

think it almost beyond expectation that any case would operate as to necessitate action being taken in the third, fourth or fifth year after an accident. There are, however, many cases where it might operate so that action could not be taken until the second year, and there is a practical reason for extending the period from 12 months to two years which would not necessarily operate if the proposal were to extend it to three or four years. Therefore, I suggest, apart from the fact that the local authorities themselves have agreed to increase the period from six months to 12 months, that in view of the fact that there is a limited number of cases which would still be barred by restricting the period to 12 months, there is a case for asking the Government to accept the Amendment and extend the period from 12 months to two years.</p>

<p>We have had an interesting discussion, which has gone on for three hours and more. It has shown some variety of view in various quarters of the House. As the hon. and learned Member for Kingswinford (Mr. A. Henderson) said, what we are discussing is whether one year or two years is the appropriate time limit. Of course, it is obvious that whether we are discussing whether one or two years is the appropriate period, either for a limitation of action or for some other purposes, arguments can be produced for a shorter or for a longer period. I should like to make one or two observations on the principle that lies behind a special period of protection for local authorities. The hon. Gentleman who moved the Amendment, did not, I think, do justice to the Liberal Government of 1893 or to the Parliament which passed that Act.</p>

<p>I know, but a Government that takes over a Bill from another Government takes the responsibility for telling the House what it does. If a Conservative Government had remained, there would no doubt have been a fuller and more lucid explanation. The position before that was that in public health matters there was a general legal limitation, applying to all local authorities, of six months. Other activities of public authorities were dealt with by a series of Statutes, nearly 100 in number,


some of them public and some of them private, but in all of them Parliament had put a short period of limitation on all statutory undertakings performing a statutory duty. This is not something that went through the House inadvertently, for there was a large number of separate Acts.</p>

<p>I am not talking about the Act of 1893. That Act consolidated the principle involved in 100 Statutes, and I have a greater respect for my predecessors than to suppose that 100 Statutes went through without anybody noticing that they involved this particular principle. The principle is that the bodies which might be made liable for actions were being placed under a duty by this House. The principle may be a good one or a bad one, but there was an obvious duty. If I am driving my motor car for pleasure in the country or driving it as a private individual, earning my living, and I injure someone, I am in a different position from somebody on whom Parliament has placed a duty. There may or may not be a good reason for making the differentiation&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not say it is a logical differentiation, but it is a principle which has been kept on by this House in a 100 cases and in the Statute of 1893. Without exaggerating the effect of that, I thought it was worth pointing it out as what seems to me a reason for the distinction. There is another point, and I do not want to exaggerate it or any other point. It is in the interest of justice that claims should be brought promptly. It is, of course, in the interest of justice that a reasonable time should be allowed for claims to be brought, but it is also in the interest of justice that claims should be brought promptly. The necessity for bringing claims promptly will occasionally involve exceptionally hard cases of claims being cut out by a period of limitation.<br/>
Earlier in the Debate somebody quoted a case in which it was alleged that an accident was due to the improper state of some tram lines. The lines were not level with the road, as they should have been, or there was some other defect which

caused the accident. Obviously, it is in the interests of justice that in such a case the claim should be brought promptly, while the tram lines can, if necessary, be looked at, while those who have driven the trams are available, and the full facts can be investigated. Some Members seemed to suggest that unless a longer period was allowed all the injustices would be on one side, but they do not, I think, sufficiently recognise the importance of claims being brought promptly in the interests of justice as a whole. Then we come down to the actual provisions of the Bill. The Law Revision Committee were faced with the fact that the special period of limitation in the case of public authorities had been on the Statute Book for 50 years, and, in the form which I tried to describe, had been in existence for at least 100 years. I do not go back to the time of Queen Elizabeth. I think that may be rather far.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking the public authorities were those defined in the Public Authorities Act, 1893, but before that Act they had, under their own special Acts, a limited period of protection, which was usually six months, and that special protection had been sanctioned by this House for a great many years. The Law Revision Committee came to the conclusion that six months was too short and recommended an extension to a year. They also recommended, what I do not think has been referred to, that the disability period during which time does not run should apply to actions against local authorities, whereas it had not applied under the Public Authorities' Protection Act.</p>

<p>No, what I was saying they recommended, and what is carried out by this Bill, is that the disability period which applies to private persons should also apply to local authorities, and that is carried out by this Bill. I agree that there is an alteration which we may or may not discuss, but the principle that the disability period should apply to public authorities as to private persons is in the Bill. I agree very much with the hon. and learned Member for Kingswinford&#x2014;although he is going to vote for the Amendment and I shall vote against it and also recommend the House to do so&#x2014;that six months is really a much larger extension than would appear on its face value. For this purpose 12 months is really a great deal more than twice six months. It is the early weeks which go by so very easily without people realising that they have passed, and I suggest to the House that a year is a fair and reasonable period for claims of this kind which have enjoyed in the past this special protection.<br/>
It may be said, "Why do you have the much longer period of six years for private persons?" This is a Bill, not simply to codify, but to codify with minor Amendments, the law as it was found on the Statute Book, so that we should have the great convenience of finding the whole of this law in one Act. I think there is a lot to be said for the view that six years is an unnecessarily long period, but it has been sanctioned for many hundreds of years&#x2014;going back to the seventeenth century&#x2014;and the Law Revision Committee did not feel there was sufficient evidence of grievances arising from that long period to justify an alteration in a Bill of this kind. They might have taken the same line with regard to public authorities, but although they came to the conclusion that six months was too short they felt that an extension to one year, coupled with other provisions, was a reasonable compromise.</p>

<p>There is no mystery concealed about this. As I understand it, those who represent the local authorities' organisation and the associations of municipal authorities and others agree that the recommendation of the Committee was a reasonable one.

<p>The alteration of the law embodied in the Bill is a reasonable one. I believe it will meet the vast majority, if not all, of the hard cases. I also say that, however hon.


Members may vote, this discussion and the publicity which has arisen from it will play a very useful purpose in making the public realise the existence of this limitation, and will make local authorities realise that if, with this extended period of time, there are still cases of injustice, this House will jealously watch and see that under the new provisions injustice such as has occurred in the past will not occur again.</p>

<p>With regard to the Attorney-General's repudiation of the idea of a bargain, I would point out that, while no bargain can bind this House, it is well known that interests, quite legitimately, often talk over matters with the Government, the interest agrees with itself, say, that a year would be a reasonable compromise, the Government agrees with itself that possibly a year would be all right, by some means each of them knows that the other has agreed with itself, and the Whips are put on. To pretend that such things do not happen really qualifies the Attorney-General to answer questions on foreign policy. I invite him to prove that there is no bargain in the simplest possible way, by saying that there shall be a free vote on this not wholly unimportant matter. On the merits of the matter I heartily support the Amendment, for reasons which have been given from both sides of the House. Experience, though it is true that it only applies to the period of six months, has shown in case after case that such a short period of limitation has worked the gravest injustice, and, although I agree that 12 months is three or four times as good, it is not enough.<br/>
The Attorney-General put forward two or three specific arguments with which I should like to deal. The first was that in a good many cases public authorities figuring as defendants are in that position because Parliament has compelled them to carry on the activity which has led to the litigation. That undoubtedly is an important point, but we are not discussing, as the Attorney-General himself pointed out, a proposal to put public authorities on the same basis as ordinary defendants. If the Amendment is carried, they will be, so to speak, three or four times as well off as ordinary defendants. It is not a question of theory, but of practical common sense, and I am

sure the Attorney-General would agree that, even against a public authority, plaintiffs ought to have a reasonable and proper chance to sue. We all know that many potential litigants are poor and bewildered and ignorant, and that many will not come forward with their claims.<br/>
The second argument will be seen, on examination, to be utterly irrelevant. The Attorney-General said that claims ought to be promptly brought, in the general interests of litigation, and at the same time he said that litigants must have given a reasonable time to sue. Everyone agrees with that, but the argument that claims should be promptly brought is an argument for reducing the general level of limitation. We are dealing with a specific limitation to one year in place of a general limitation to six years, and, if claims should be promptly brought, every claim should be given a limitation of about three or four years. That point is utterly irrelevant to the question whether this particular and very short limitation should be made a little less short. The Attorney-General's illustration is very useful to show how completely inapposite that point is. He said that surely, if a local authority is old-fashioned enough to have a tramline, and is unfortunate enough to have one that is out of order and is sued for an accident arising out of the defective tramline, it is vital that the action should be brought pretty early by people who can really gather evidence about the condition of the tramline. Exactly the same thing happens if you get a defective railway line; and yet in the one case the period is to be six years, and in the other case one year. That shows, in my submission, that that point is really not relevant to this Amendment.<br/>
Cases are not exceptional which will be cut out by even the 12 months' limitation, especially when one remembers, for example, that the Poor Persons' Department, when people get to it, often keeps them waiting 12 months, because it is so congested with work, before it can tell them that they can issue a writ under its aegis. They are, perhaps, not the great mass of the general run of cases, but they are fairly numerous; and this House ought not lightly to deprive anyone of the chance of bringing an action within a reasonable time. The hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out that the committee said that a reasonable time to bring an action is six years. There is a general view in the


legal profession that four years is enough for anyone, but the same committee that advanced that opinion is referred to by the hon. and gallant Gentleman in support of his case on this point. I do not want to keep the House any longer on a matter which has been fully discussed, but I urge that the Whips should be taken off and a free vote allowed.</p>

<p>I have listened to the whole of this Debate, and I remembered quite early in the Debate that when I was a youngster my mother suggested to me, speaking from experience, that I should have as little as possible to do with the law. I never dreamed at that time that I should be taking part in a Debate of this kind so many years later. The principal argument I have heard put forward has been concerned with solicitors' expenses. All the arguments used by hon. and learned Gentlemen have convinced me that the principal reason for this extension which is proposed from one year to two years, is that there would be more time for them to get going. If there is to be an amendment of the law every time lawyers want an increase in their fees, this House will always be discussing Limitation Bills. We heard of the experiences of the hon. and learned Member for Argyll (Mr. Macquisten) with local authorities. They were interesting, no doubt. He convinced the House that in his young days it was the custom for the local authorities to throw sprats to catch mackerel, and that he and his professional colleagues intended to be mackerel and not sprats&#x2014;although they developed into sharks afterwards; because he admitted that the local authorities engaged him on every occasion, to prevent him from being on the other side.<br/>
He suggested that no argument had been put up for this limitation; but three or four hon. and learned Members, after saying that no argument had been put up for it, proceeded to deal with the arguments that had been put up for it. They said it was no more difficult for a local authority to bring evidence than for an individual. I submit that it is, and it will be, particularly if this time is extended. An ordinary individual may be interested in a particular branch of business and may spend more of his time dealing with

a particular subject than he devotes to any other subjects, but a local authority, in spite of the fact that it has been pooh-poohed, has a multiplicity of interests, and, therefore, a multiplicity of liabilities. If a case is allowed to be brought under the Amendment many months after the local authority has learned of it for the first time, it may be impossible for the local authority to gather any evidence to rebut it. I am not prepared to accept the estimate of the honesty and high purpose of the legal profession to which testimony has been given in this House. That is not the opinion held by the common people in the country. There are many members of the profession for whom I have the greatest respect, but as regards the profession as a profession, I believe that my mother's advice was good. I am not sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside (Mr. Marshall) was not right when he suggested that, even if that was not the motive, it would extend the period during which exploitation could take place for another 12 months.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman who spoke from below the Gangway opposite put his finger on the pulse of this question when he suggested that the only cases which were not brought were those of poor people. There is no difficulty concerning the people who have money. They always make their claim within the first six months, he said. That is true. They know the ropes, and the poor people do not. That is the best argument of which I know for making the law available to the poorer people in a shorter time, and not for extending the period during which claims could be brought. If poverty is the reason why they do not come within six months, will not that poverty exclude them from coming in 20 months? That is an argument which shows conclusively that it is simply extending the period of exploitation.</p>

<p>The interruption of the hon. and learned Member reinforces my argument. If poor persons' solicitors are crowded out with cases, we do not want an extension of the period to two years,


but an increase in the number of people who will take cases for nothing. They will all come in the first six months if you do that. The experience of members of local authorities is just as valuable on a question of this kind as the experience of solicitors in the courts themselves. Where is this mythical army about which we have heard so much this evening? Hon. and learned Gentlemen have spoken of numerous cases of which they know. We have been given illustrations of three cases, all of which would have come under the 12 months had the period been 12 months at the present time. One case was mentioned&#x2014;I do not know whether it was a real or a hypothetical case&#x2014;where a man could be knocked out for 12 months. The assumption was that an individual who was knocked out by an accident might have no relatives, friends or anybody to take any action for him, and that if it were 12 months before he came round, the period would have expired. Are you going to legislate for cases of that kind?</p>

<p>I gave an actual case which occurred in the courts where the 12-month period was not enough and the widow was penalised and deprived of the compensation which she and her children would have otherwise received. Does the hon. Member think that that is a small matter which should not be altered by this House?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1939-05-03a.2018.0" hansard_membership_id="10563" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29472" speakername="Mr. Tomlinson" colnum="2018" time="">
<p>No. I do not think it is a small matter. That was a case where if the widow had not been left poor and if her husband had been in such a position that she could pay for legal advice, the probabilities are that the case would have been met earlier. Without knowing the case I feel that I can make that statement. I cannot understand an accident taking place and having that effect and anything other than poverty preventing the case being taken. I said that the experience of those on local authorities were worth something. I am only a young man, but I have spent 28 years in connection with three local authorities, one small, one fairly large and one very large. If these cases to which hon. Members have referred are happening constantly and local authorities are pleading this Limitation Act, surely one would have heard disgruntled people in these areas saying something about it. During the whole of my 28 years' experience I have not come across a single case in connection with the local authorities with which I have been associated. I hope that the 12 months will remain, in order that justice may be done, as I believe justice will be done.</p>

<p>In regard to the Amendment in my name&#x2014;in page 12, line 39, after "default," to insert "or the damage thereby occasioned"&#x2014;I am in this difficulty, that those words ought, in order to effect the purpose intended, to be inserted after the word "default," in line 36, as well as after the word "de-

fault," in line 39, so that if the Amendment were carried a consequential Amendment would be necessary.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 12, line 36, after "default," to insert "or the damage thereby occasioned."<br/>
If the Amendment is carried the same words will have to be inserted after "default," in line 39. The purpose of the Amendment is quite simple. It is intended to overcome a difficulty to which attention was frequently called during the Debate which has just concluded, where an injury turned out later to be more serious than was at first supposed. There are a number of cases where no action is brought and no action is threatened because the injury appears to be a trivial one, then it turns out later to be more serious than was at first thought, and perhaps the person suffers by reason of his own good feeling in not having brought his case earlier when the injury was hardly worth while making a claim for at all. A great deal of the injustice to which reference has been made during the Debate would be reduced, and some of it would disappear altogether, if the period of limitation, whatever it might be, did not begin to run while the injury caused by the default continued to exist. There was a time in the early history of litigation under the 1893 Act when it was thought that this was the case, but the matter went before the court, and, most unfortunately, in the opinion of many people&#x2014;and, I think, in the opinion of the committee on whose report this legislation is founded&#x2014;the court did not decide that the words of the 1893 Act were capable of the interpretation which, by this Amendment, I am now seeking to place upon them. All that is suggested in the Amendment is that while the damage continues the period of limitation shall not begin to run.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Silverman), in moving to insert these words at an earlier place in the Clause, has made clearer to me what his purpose is; but I am bound to say that I think it would be impossible to insert these words. There are, unhappily, many cases in which the damage thereby occasioned is permanent, and if the time of the limitation is to begin when the damage or injury has ceased, then it will never begin.</p>

<p>It may be that my Amendment is so badly drafted that it would have that consequence, but that is not what I intend. What is intended

is that the special period of limitation shall not begin to run, so that if the damage continues the action can be brought while the damage is continuing, but with the over-riding period of six years in any case. It is not pretended to go beyond that.</p>

<p>I would remind the hon. Member that this Bill is now in the last stage in the second House, and therefore, it would be difficult to reconsider words which would certainly require very drastic redrafting to effect the purpose the hon. Member has in mind. Everybody appreciates the case to which the hon. Member has referred, but I think these words would produce an impossible situation. The case he has in mind is one which it would be extremely difficult to cover by any form of words of which I can think. The hon. Member wants to provide for a case in which an injury becomes serious only some time after the accident. I do not think he wants to give a person a year from the time when the injury has ceased. What would be reasonable, if it could be defined, would be to give a period from the time when the injury became sufficiently serious to make it obvious that a claim should be made if it was thought that there would be a liability. It would be extremely difficult to find words to cover that, and at this last stage of the Bill, it is no good my attempting to look into the matter, because we should have no chance of inserting the words.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 12, line 39, at the end, to insert:
<q>Provided also that this section shall not apply in the case of any act, neglect, or default unless the person entering a claim in respect of such act, neglect, or default is notified that the claim will be invalid if action is not taken within the period prescribed in this Section.</q>
The object of this Amendment is to secure that the protection provided by this time limitation shall be available to a public authority only if that public authority when the claim has been intimated, notifies the person concerned of the privilege, namely, that an action to enforce the claim will only be good if


it is laid within the time mentioned in Clause 21.<br/>
I think it has been made clear in the Debate this evening that even South of the Border, this is an unusual privilege. The act or default giving rise to the action will, in general, be the act or default of some individual and the public authority will be liable in a vicarious fashion. So far as the particular act or default is concerned, there may be no difference between the person who is injured and the person who is guilty of the default or negligence causing the injury. Accordingly the ordinary law would appear to apply. The object of the Amendment is to secure that when the claim is intimated the protection will only be granted to the public authority or to the person who is protected by the Clause if the person intimating the claim is notified of the privilege provided in the Clause. In view of the argument which has taken place this is, I submit, a very necessary safeguard as the two parties are not on equal terms. If the person injured and the individual are subject to the ordinary law in Scotland the person might bring the action at any time at all. South of the Border apparently, there is a time limitation of six years, but the person who is injured, finding himself against a public authority, should have this privilege of the public authority brought specifically to his notice, in order that he may not thereby lose his right of action.</p>

<p>As far as the Amendment seeks to emphasise the desirability of members of the public realising that this period of limitation exists, everybody will sympathise with it and everybody will reprobate cases such as, it is suggested, have occurred occasionally, in which there has been a deliberate or semi-deliberate concealment of the existence of the period of limitation with a view to preventing an action being taken. But I feel that there are the same difficulties about this Amendment, as there were in the case of the last Amendment. In the first place, the local authority may take the line that they are not in any way liable. I agree that it might be possible to devise a form of words to the

effect that the notification should not take the form of appearing to admit that the claim was valid, but that it should be some sort of general notification that, if any claims were made, they had to be made within a certain period. But then there would be this difficulty, that you would have to define what constituted a claim which the local authority should notify within a certain period. For instance, a local authority notified on the 364th day of the year would fulfil what is in this Amendment, but that would be futile, because it would only reach the claimant half an hour or half a day before the time expired. It would want a rather elaborate provision specifying how there was to be this general notification, and while I am in much sympathy with the idea of the Amendment, I am afraid I cannot recommend the House to adopt it as a workable scheme. I feel what is behind the Amendment, and I sincerely hope that this discussion, and the publicity that has been given to it, and the fact that it has turned our minds to the matter, may serve a useful purpose in making more generally known the existence of this period of limitation.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 13, line 2, at the end, to insert:
<q>or to any action in which the act, neglect, or default complained of is not, in the opinion of the court, of an important administrative character.</q>
I realise that the House has had a very full discussion on the first Amendment on the principle involved in this legislation, and although I am tempted to deal with what I consider to be the fallacious defences of this privilege that have been put forward, perhaps the House will forgive me if I refrain. Still, I cannot resist the temptation to say that this Amendment ought really, on the arguments that have been presented in this Debate, to receive universal approval, and I invite the Government to accept it. It satisfies every one of the arguments put forward in defence of the special


privilege of the authority, it is completely in line with the report, an extract from which was read by the hon. Member who moved the first Amendment, it protects local authorities absolutely in all those activities in which those best qualified to judge have ever claimed that they ought to be protected, and it protects the public in all others.<br/>
The only possible objection that I can anticipate, though I dare say I shall find that I am not so fertile as the Attorney-General is, that he will say that the words are so vague and so general and so difficult to define. I am seeking to say that this special protection shall not apply to any action in which the act, neglect, or default complained of is not, in the opinion of the court, of an important administrative character. If I were asked to give a list of actions of that character, I dare say I could do it in a very long time, but I do not think it is necessary to do that, and I do not think there is any great force in the objection that the words are wide and general. The Amendment leaves the decision of the point to the court, and I do not think anyone will seriously contend that the High Court would be in any serious difficulty in determining whether the act complained of was or was not an important administrative act. It may not be easy to define, but it is extremely easy to recognise. On this matter the report said:
<q>It may well be that such a policy is justifiable in the case of important administrative acts and that serious consequences might ensue if such acts can be impugned after a long lapse of time.</q>
It goes on to say that the vast majority of cases are not of that kind. It was said during the Debate that the public authorities upon whom this House imposes a statutory duty is entitled to a special position in the courts in the performance of that duty. I want my hon. Friends on these benches to consider this, especially my hon. Friend the Member for Brightside (Mr. Marshall). He is president of a powerful trade union, which, like many other unions and this party as a whole, would like to see nationalised a number of activities which are now carried on by private enterprise. We would like to see the mines and the railways nationalised. That can only be done by an act of Parliament and a statutory duty would be placed on certain people to run them. Suppose there

was a railway or mine accident. Does my hon. Friend suggest that it is one of the advantages to be claimed for nationalisation that in that case anyone who is injured would have his right of action limited? Surely not, but that is one of the arguments put forward tonight. I am suggesting that where an important administrative duty is being performed by the authority of Parliament that should be exempted, but that when it comes to things like driving motor buses or tramcars and doing other simple ordinary, everyday acts of that kind, no case has been sought to be made out for this privilege. My Amendment draws a distinction between these two cases as it was drawn by the report on which this Bill is based. I claim in support of it the arguments which have been brought against the Amendment with which we have just dealt.</p>

<p>There are two objections to this Amendment. The first is that it would be inconsistent with the decision to which the House came a short time ago. The House approved the priniciple of the Public Authorities Protection Act, and by far the larger number of cases covered by it are the kind of cases which this Amendment would exclude. The other, and I think fatal, objection to it from any point of view is the vagueness of the terms used. It is lucky for the hon. Member that the hon. Member for Farnworth (Mr. Tomlinson) is not here, because he really might have some ground for the suggestion that this Amendment was put down to encourage litigation. It would have the most unfortunate result that in border line cases a man would not know whether he had a right of action until the case had come into court. The court would have to determine whether the act complained of was of an important administrative character. Words of this character would lead to the creation of a large number of border line cases in which there would be complete uncertainty if it was desired to bring a case after 12 months had elapsed, and there would be no way of settling the point other than by taking proceedings in court. I hope, therefore, that the hon. Member will be prepared to withdraw his Amendment.</p>

<p>Was it not made perfectly clear by the language used in the report that the vast majority&#x2014;I think those were the words used&#x2014;of cases would not arise out of "important administrative" acts, and would not my Amendment, therefore, protect the vast majority of cases, even allowing that there would be border-line cases?</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 13, line 39, to leave out paragraph (<i>d</i>)<br/>
The main purpose of this Clause is to deal with persons under a disability, that is, those who are infants or lunatics. It is proper that time shall not run against them until the disability comes to an end; that is to say that if a person is an infant and has a cause of action the period of limitation shall not be taken to run until he reaches the age of 21, or if he is of unsound mind shall not begin to run until he recovers his sanity. That is an obviously necessary provision, but there is this unfortunate exception in paragraph (<i>d</i>):
<q>this Section, so far as it relates to the disability of infancy or unsoundness of mind, shall not apply to any action to which the last foregoing Section applies"&#x2014;</q>
that is to say an action against a public authority&#x2014;
<q>unless the plaintiff proves that the person under a disability was not, at the time when the right of action accrued to him in the custody of a parent.</q>
That seems to be a monstrous provision. It means that if a child receives some injury at the hands of a servant of a public authority, and if its parents, being perhaps ignorant people, and not understanding its rights, do not bring an action on the child's behalf, the child will lose its rights. When he reaches the age of 21, he may possibly be injured for life, but nevertheless he will not be able to bring an action. In any other case, if the

defendant were a private firm or a private person, he would be able to bring his action on reaching the age of 21.<br/>
Answering the first Amendment this afternoon, the Attorney-General based himself almost entirely upon the report of the Statutory Law Revision Committee, and he told us how carefully the matter had been considered and how the Committee had arrived at a very reasonable recommendation. As he knows, this particular matter does not appear in any way in the recommendations of the Committee. It is fair to say that the Committee would never have recommended anything of the kind. When the Bill was first introduced last Session, this paragraph was put in at the instance, I believe, of some public authorities. It seems extraordinarily unjust that we should deprive a small class of people of their rights in this way.</p>

<p>I would ask the Attorney-General what this Sub-section means. I have had considerable difficulty in understanding it. Is a child who is at school or in hospital in the custody of the parent or in the custody of the hospital or school? The Sub-section provides that it shall not apply when the right of action occurs, that is to say, at the moment when the act of negligence occurs&#x2014;if it is that&#x2014;and the child was not in the custody of the parent. The very reason why the exception was recommended by the local authorities was that so many children attended the schools. I thought that was one reason put forward by the defence. How is this provision to be interpreted? If there was an act of negligence in the school during school hours and the child suffered, that was the moment when the right of action occurred. At that moment was the child in the custody of the parent or of the school?</p>

<p>In such a case the child is in the custody of the parent. The paragraph which the hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot) proposes to delete was not recommended by the Statutory Law Revision Committee. The point which this Sub-section was designed to meet seems to be one of substance. There are these education authorities and estab-


lishments and local authorities carrying out their duties, and no doubt there are possibilities which materialise from time to time of accidents which may or may not be negligent as alleged. If you say that here is a limitation which shall in no case begin to run until the child has attained the age of 21, you are giving to that class of case, which is an important one, a period of limitation which in fact will probably extend to 18 or 20 years. I agree that a proposal of this kind can be criticised, but it seems to me to afford a good rough-and-ready solution which does substantial justice and which, I think, is unlikely to do any injustice. It seems to me that, if a child is living with its parents and has an accident, one may reasonably assume that the parents will take the necessary steps to see that damages are recovered if damages are recoverable, and that it is not unreasonable to provide that, if a child is in the custody of its parents, the disability period shall not apply. It is right not to apply this generally, because you might have a child in the custody of the local authority by whose education officer the accident might have been caused, but in other cases it is not an unreasonable provision, and I commend it to the House.</p>

<p>This Order deals with works of art. In the Import Duties Act, 1932, books were placed on the original free list, but it was not till 1937 that arrangements were made for the exemption of sculptures, etchings and engravings. Such exemption can only be given on the receipt of a certificate from the Director of the Tate Galley. The Import Duties (Exemptions) (No. 15) Order, 1937, provided, broadly speaking, that sculptures, whether in the round, in relief or in intaglio, and hand-etched or hand-engraved blocks, plates, or other material and hand-printed impressions framed or otherwise thereof should be exempted from duty but only if they received such a certificate, with the condition that the number of replicas of any one sculpture which could be imported on the free list was limited to three. The procedure established in 1937 worked on the whole quite satisfactorily, but since then it has appeared as a result of experience that there is room for improvement. There has been some difficulty with regard to what I might call "works of traditional or conventional craftsmanship," which are not exactly works of art in the accepted sense. I have in mind, for example, marble tombstones, which are


sometimes works of art and sometimes of traditional or conventional craftsmanship. Secondly, it was felt that there should be some limit to the number of engravings which could be imported free. Accordingly these two Orders have the effect together, first, of removing from the free list works of traditional or conventional craftsmanship and putting them on to the ordinary basis of <i>ad valorem</i> duty, and second, to limit to 25 the number of impressions of any one engraving that may be imported free of duty.</p>

<p>This is the most amazing performance I have ever witnessed in the House. It is a condition for the exemption of any article that it shall be certified by the Director of the Tate Gallery to be a work of art. Does he determine what is or what is not a work of art in this case?</p>

<p>If it helps the hon. Gentleman, I might say that that has been accepted since as long ago as the Finance Act of 1937. It is the fact that he decides, not on the artistic merit of the particular article but whether he considers it falls within the definition of the Exemptions Order.</p>

<p>I remember that on one occasion I had to raise a matter in this House about a piece of sculpture which had been produced in Rome by a British artist, whose education had been paid for out of public funds in this country. The

statue was not allowed to be brought into this country without the payment of a heavy tariff. The artist was advised to take the statue back to Italy, and when it reached the Mediterranean the Italians would not have it in Italy. That is the kind of ridiculous situation which arises when you deal with works of art. I protest that the Director of the Tate Gallery, whether he knows if art is good, bad or indifferent, should have been appointed to hold a position under this Order. I would not mind if you called me in to define works of art under this Order, but I object to his doing it.<br/>
As to the question of what is traditional and conventional craftsmanship, I submit that there are many works of art which might come under this heading and be deemed to be traditional and conventional. A good many foreign tombstones come into this country, and I daresay that it is not the art which is really bothering the people who are promoting this Order. It is the objection to the importation of slabs for graveyards. I do not mind people playing about with tariffs and tariff Orders in the field of commerce. They can be as mad as March hares in the field of commerce and get away with it, but it is rather an insult to Art, or to what is really a work of art, to drag in works of art in this way. This is an Order not to protect works of art, but to protect the tombstone-makers of this country. What I object to in the main is, that a person outside this House should have this power of discretion and of advising what is and what is not a work of art. We have come to a nice state of affairs when a director of an art gallery has to be appointed for this purpose, and I take this opportunity of protesting in this House against an appointment being made in this manner.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman takes exception to the fact that the Director of the Tate Gallery should have to give his certificate as prescribed by the Act of 1937, but the fact remains that this House agreed to this form of procedure two years ago. No doubt for reasons of his own, the hon. Member would consider that he himself would probably be a better judge than a Customs officer, which is presumably the obvious alternative. The hon. Member must bear in mind that there are other cases than tombstones. I only mentioned


tombstones as one possible case. When he asks what is meant by works of traditional and conventional craftsmanship, I should say that they are the kind of works which are made to pattern and can be produced in very large numbers. The first one may be of artistic merit, but by the time you go on repeating and repeating it, you get into a different field. The hon. Member asked who invented the wording. It is the phrase used in the report of the Import Duties Advisory Committee which precedes this Order.</p>
