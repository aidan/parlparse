<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will arrange for records to be kept of the wives and children of polygamous marriages who enter the United Kingdom as dependants of immigrants, in order that some estimate may be made of the likely charge to public funds caused by such dependants.</p>

<p>Is it not strange that the Government are prepared to spend public money in support of polygamy when our United Kingdom citizens in like circumstances would be sent to jail for bigamy? How can the Minister say&#x2014;as he said to me&#x2014;that there are very few of these cases when he has no records and will take no steps to get records?</p>

<p>It would be a very time-consuming operation for the immigration officers and would lead to delay if we kept particulars of everyone who arrived, but I assure the hon. and learned Member that the number is very small, that there is no known incident of a man arriving with two wives and very few cases in which a second wife has joined a husband. As for the benefits of the Welfare State, there are no benefits for second wives&#x2014;even though there are very few such cases&#x2014;and there are benefits only in respect of the children.</p>

<p>While I recognise that the problem is numerically probably quite unimportant, may I ask whether the Under-Secretary does not recognise that a serious point of principle is involved&#x2014; that when immigrants come here they are expected to observe the laws of this country, which involves the proposition that a man has only one wife at a time?</p>

<p>I think that that applies to the vast majority of immigrants, but the legal situation, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows, is that a marriage which is legal in the country in which it was undertaken and at the time it was undertaken is also considered legal in this country. It would be very difficult if it were otherwise.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) why 2,115 men from India and 2,096 men from Pakistan were allowed to enter Great Britain under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962, in the month of April, 1968, in view of the fact that there were over half a million permanently unemployed persons, and many more on short-time employment; and if he will now stop all further immigration until those unemployed are provided with work;<br/>
(2) if he is aware that 1,321 children and 1,318 women from India, 448 children and 296 women from Jamaica, 919 children and 709 women from Pakistan entered Great Britain under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act, 1962, in the month of April, 1968, besides large numbers from other countries; and when he expects the flow of immigration to cease.</p>

<p>The hon. Member's figures are of all admissions, including returning residents, visitors and others coming for temporary purposes, and ignore figures of departures. The number of those coming for settlement is much lower in every case. From the whole Commonwealth only 355 men arrived with employment vouchers in April. The majority of those coming for settlement were dependants.</p>

<p>Since unemployment is at its highest for 30 years and the Government are quite impotent to cure it, surely it is reasonable to expect that jobs at home should be safeguarded for our own people before any more are allowed in.

<p>Secondly, the Home Secretary&#x2014;and I wanted him to reply&#x2014; voted twice on Second Reading and Third Reading against the 1962 Act, which he is now implementing. Since he has changed his mind once, why cannot he change it a second time?</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, too much to expect some hon. Members to be reasonable about this. I gave the hon. Member the figure. It was only 355 men who came in for employment in the month in question. The vast majority had skills such as those of doctors and nurses, which the country very much needs.</p>

<p>Would not my hon. Friend agree that the great majority of recent immigrants have been taking jobs in which there is no shortage of vacancies and that the serious problem is not so much employment but the depression of


wage levels in such unattractive occupations as immigrants tend to take?</p>

<p>When such a distinguished legal body condemns the 1968 Act as violating human rights, creating second-class citizens, worsening race relations and legislating on racial lines, does not this make the hon.

<p>I have read the article with care, but I must point out that it is not a report by the International Commission of Jurists but an article published in their bulletin. I have no evidence that they as a body have made any pronouncements on this subject. I certainly would not reach the conclusions reached by the hon. Member. The Act is working effectively and it seems to me that the number of people who apply for vouchers can be properly dealt with.</p>

<p>Will my hon. Friend bear in mind that, quite apart from that expression of opinion by the International Commission of Jurists, the Act was the subject of considerable condemnation during the recent conference on human rights in Teheran and that it is considered by some people to be a violation of the Universal Declartion of Human Rights? In those circumstances, will my hon. Friend consider having further consultations with the Governments of India and Pakistan as it is now believed that the vast majority of these people

would prefer to go to India and Pakistan, and it might be possible to reach an arrangement with those Governments if we would relax our own restrictions?</p>

<p>There is a later Question on the Order Paper concerning that matter to which the hon. Gentleman has directed his question. There have been criticisms, but this was carried by an overwhelming vote of the House. I would remind the hon. Gentleman of the words of the Solicitor-General in the debate:

<p>Is not the Home Secretary aware that nursing staff is available? One of the chief reasons why they do not come is that they have to walk about a mile and a half through a borstal centre.

<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will take steps to carry out a nation-wide organisation-and-methods inquiry into the use of manpower by the police forces, with the aim of cutting down the proportion of working time spent dealing with minor traffic offences, and concentrating more of the available manpower on crime prevention and detection.</p>

<p>Many forces have already taken advantage of O. and M. advice to make the most effective use of their resources, and the establishment of the Home Office Research and Development Branch is of further assistance. But it is for each chief officer of police to decide on the relative importance in his area of the different responsibilities that Parliament has laid on the police.</p>

<p>Does not my hon. Friend feel that such an inquiry is urgent in view of the high crime figures? Will my hon. Friend accept that such an inquiry might reveal that there is a strong case for setting up a separate "traffic cop" organisation to deal with traffic movement and prosecutions, leaving the other side of the police entirely free to deal with crime prevention and detection?</p>

<p>Many forces have commissioned O. &amp; M. studies either by local authority teams or by trained police O. &amp; M. officers of various force departments. The statistics concerning crime show that the number of indictable offences known to the police continued to increase in 1967, but at a much lower rate than in 1966. The rate of increase was actually 0&#x00B7;6 per cent., the lowest since 1955.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman realise that I have raised this matter with the Home Office time and again over the last three years? There is strong public feeling that every available officer should be devoted to crime detection and prevention and not be wasted on these other duties which can be undertaken by others.</p>

<p>It is not for me to say whether, where or when any particular police responsibility under the law should be given precedence over any other. This raises a question of substantial constitutional importance. The hon. Gentleman should not take for granted that the fact that officers should be diverted, for example, from minor traffic offences to more serious offences, of necessity makes those officers suitable for that specialist type of work.</p>

<p>Whilst the hon.

<p>I am sure that the House is aware that traffic wardens are available to help the police with certain traffic functions. I do not think that the House should accept that a mere increase in manpower of necessity leads to direct beneficial results proportionate to the amount of manpower which has been channelled.</p>

<p>As that Answer said that the matter will be referred to the Prices and Incomes Board, is it not another example of the Government shuffling off responsibility on to the Board?

<p>Not at all. The application would have been for an increase of about 11&#x00BD; per cent. and it was proper that my right hon. Friend should refer it to the Prices and Incomes Board for its adjudication. Because my right hon.

<p>It is because the Government take this view that they introduced the Measure that passed through the House a short time ago. I recognise that there is some evidence of excessive charging from London Airport, which is to be deeply regretted. I believe that it affects only a small minority of the taxi drivers concerned. To introduce new fares now would mean changes in meters, which would affect the amount coming into the pockets of the taximen at this moment when awaiting the report from the Prices and Incomes Board, which would be inappropriate.</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) whether he will take steps to

place an immediate ban on the sale of polystyrene tiles which are not of the self-extinguishing type, in view of the fact that such tiles have been shown to have accentuated fires;<br/>
(2) what action is being taken to investigate the possible fire hazards from all types of polystyrene tiles.</p>

<p>The Joint Fire Research Organisation is at present investigating the extent to which polystyrene tiles of both normal and self-extinguishing grades may contribute towards the spread of fire.

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware of the growing evidence of the great danger of these tiles, if not causing fires, being a considerable hazard when one breaks out?

<p>I think that my hon. Friend is over-stating the case. There is no real evidence that polystyrene tiles have been a significant factor in accelerating the spread of fires in dwellings.

<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that his requirement that probation officers who work in prisons shall sign the Official Secrets Acts, restricts such officers' freedom to discuss their work; whether he will give the reasons for this requirement; and if he will make a statement.</p>

<p>Access to confidential information in prison records necessarily involves the restrictions on unauthorised disclosure imposed by the Official Secrets Acts. There is no reason why this should inhibit probation officers from discussing their work with their professional colleagues and I have had

<p>I should explain to my hon. Friend that the application of the Acts is not restricted to members of the prison service. Anyone working in a prison is subject to them.

<p>Perhaps I should explain that criminal conduct&#x2014;that is to say, where an officer has been found guilty by a court of law of a criminal offence&#x2014;is a specific offence under the Police (Discipline) Regulations, 1965. A disciplinary charge would not, however, follow automatically as a result of a court conviction. It is for chief constables, who have discretion in the matter, to decide whether a disciplinary charge should be brought. The situation with regard to the Fire Service closely approximates that with regard to the police.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member knows, the position is that with all the efforts which have been made, and the new situation, there are abundant opportunities for our manufacturers to get export orders.

<p>It is too high, but I believe that the right way to get it down is by deployment in the export field, for which there are abundant opportunities.

lessons in selective misrepresentation, his hon.

<p>May I ask the Prime Minister a serious supplementary question. Does he not agree that the considerable increase in exports since devaluation has, unfortunately, been offset by two basic weaknesses&#x2014;namely, the heavy increase in the volume of imported manufactured goods and the substantial private outflow of capital to advanced countries in the sterling area, most notably to Australia to buy gold mining


shares and other shares? Does not the Prime Minister feel that we should bring in selective short-term import controls and put a ban on the private capital outflow at least until the balance of payments is again in surplus?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is aware that I answered that question when it was put by one of my hon. Friends last week, and I then gave my reasons against accepting either of those remedies. I agree that the very great increase in exports and the even larger increase in export orders has been matched in the last few months by rising imports about which, as I said, no one is complacent. We have to see how far the measures which we have taken will deal wi:h the situation. I certainly do not agree that the use of import controls as proposed by my hon.

<p>An Ambassador aircraft operated by B.K.S., and engaged in flying horses and grooms from Deauville to London Airport, crashed into the side of the new North-East Face Building at 17.28 hours yesterday, killing the three crew members and three of the passengers. The remaining two passengers were injured and are in hospital. In addition, four airport employees were injured and a further 11 members of B.E.A. staff are being treated for shock. All the horses were killed as a result of the accident.<br/>
The weather was fine and sunny and the aircraft made a normal approach to land until it was about 200 feet above the area of the airport boundary. A few seconds afterwards the port wing dropped and inspection of the airfield shows that the port wing tip and later the port main wheel touched the grass for a distance of about 200 feet. The aircraft then became airborne again, banking to the left and with the nose rising, travelling straight towards the North-East Face Building.<br/>
Whilst steeply banked, the port wing and undercarriage struck two B.E.A. Tridents parked on the apron, which resulted in the port wing of the Ambassador being torn off and severe damage to the two Tridents&#x2014;one may be a


write-off. The Ambassador rolled over on its back and crashed into the ground floor of the North-East Face Building.<br/>
The aircraft caught fire immediately upon impact with the first Trident and separate fires in the main wreckage, the severed wing and in a damaged Trident had to be dealt with.<br/>
The Chief Inspector of Accidents instituted an investigation immediately.<br/>
May I express sympathy with the relations and friends of those who lost their lives and wish a speedy recovery to those who were injured.</p>

<p>Has my right hon. Friend seen the Motion standing in my name and in the names of 49 other hon. Members about the dispute between the clerical workers and the British Steel Corporation?<br/>
[<i>That this House is profoundly shocked at the continuing dispute between the British Steel Corporation and the members of their clerical, administrative and technical staffs following the refusal of the Corporation to allow their staff to be represented by a union of their own choice; and calls upon the Government to take the necessary action to try to end this dispute.</i>]<br/>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 188, in page 12, leave out lines 24 to 29 and insert:
<q>(ii) subsection (3)(<i>e</i>) of that section (exemption for interest etc. not exceeding &#x00A3;100 in the case of other premiums each of which is one of a series of equal premiums payable at equal intervals of not more than one year) shall have effect without the exclusion of premiums falling within the said subsection (3)(<i>d</i>), and, in the case of premiums payable under a qualifying policy within the meaning of Part I of the said Schedule 9, with the omission of the words from' each of which' to' one year'.</q>
This is the first of a series of Amendments which are broadly relieving, and relate to technical tax matters which have been mostly, but not entirely, discussed with the interests concerned. I imagine, therefore, that it might be the wish of the House that I should deal with this Amendment and the other related Amendments to the Clause and to Schedule 9 very shortly indeed. I am, of course, at the disposal of the House as regards any questions that hon. Members may desire to ask and which I have not covered in an opening statement.<br/>
I therefore merely say of this Amendment that it relaxes the conditions on which interest of up to &#x00A3;100 may be allowed as a deduction for Surtax, and provides that in the case of a qualifying policy any premiums come within the relief.</p>

<p>I appreciate that, Mr. Speaker, and I am grateful to be corrected. I should have suggested that they should be considered in groups, and that any hon. Member can then ask questions. These are highly technical matters and, as the right hon. Gentleman has pointed out, they have for the most part been very fully discussed with interests outside. I therefore do not think that we would be failing in the duty resting on Parliament in passing legislation like this if we were not to discuss it as fully as might be appropriate in other circumstances.<br/>
May I also express, on this Amendment and the proposed Amendments, great satisfaction that the Treasury went as far as it did in engaging in very full consultations with interests outside, particularly the Life Offices Association. The Treasury has done this since the Committee stage, and I am perfectly certain that it has been to the advantage of the whole insuring public and to the whole economy.<br/>
4.0 p.m.<br/>
When this suggestion of consultation was mentioned in Committee by a number of hon. Members, the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) appeared to take objection to it. He said:
<q>What his hon. Friends are saying in effect is' Let the vested interests write the policy.' That is what he is saying."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT,

<i>Standing Committee A,</i> 22nd May, 1968; c. 1317.]</q>
All I can say, and I place it firmly on record, is that I entirely support and fully endorse the Treasury's action in this regard. The Bill will be the better for it. I hope that the precedent will be followed when dealing with technical legislation of this sort that full consultations can be entered into&#x2014;of course, in strict confidence&#x2014;even before the Budget statement, so that we are not once again faced with a Clause and a Schedule which have to be amended at this stage with 55 separate Government Amendments.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be appropriate if I were to say a word or two about my Amendment. Briefly, subsection (2) is intended to exempt from the requirements of a qualifying policy insurance policies which are taken out to protect mortgages&#x2014;so-called mortgage protection policies&#x2014;and it is quite right that it should. Clearly, these are separate animals, and all the restrictions in Schedule 9 should not apply to them.<br/>
When the Bill was first discussed, however, it was apparent that the Clause was extremely narrowly drawn. We drew attention to this in Committee and, in particular, to the words
<q>to any policy of life assurance the only benefit secured by which is the payment".</q>
We emphasised the word "only" and we moved an Amendment to suggest that the right word should be "may" on the ground that if it were strictly construed,


a policy containing any collateral benefits of any sort might fail to qualify for the exemption.<br/>
The Financial Secretary took the point and agreed to consider it. We now have Amendment No. 190, but it does not seem to me that the Chancellor has succeeded in meeting the point which we made. He has removed "benefit" and substituted "object". He is also taking account of the circumstances that it may not be exactly the same sum which is payable by the policy which may be necessary to meet the mortgage debt. Presumably, the argument rests on the proposition that the word "object" in Amendment 190 is to be construed as equivalent to "purpose" and that it would, therefore, be distinguishable from any subordinate advantages which would be benefits and that, therefore, there is a distinction to be drawn between "benefits" and "object".<br/>
Amendment No. 190 uses the words
<q>having as its sole object the provision on an individual's death".</q>
The Government would, no doubt, argue that they have taken the point and that if there are any supplementary collateral benefits, they will not disqualify the policy from the exemption. One must, however, remember that the court will come afresh to this matter, It will not have had the advantage of reading the arguments which we have had in Committee and on the Floor of the House. It will not have realised that "object" has been substituted for "benefits". The court will look at the policy as a whole. It will see that the object is to provide a sum and to provide a number of other benefits. It will look at the Section, which will say that the sole object is
<q>the provision &#x2026; of a sum</q>
and it will say that because the other benefits are provided, the policy will be excluded.<br/>
I cannot believe that it is the Government's intention that it should be the sole purpose of a policy to provide the capital sum and that if any collateral benefits are included, that will disqualify it. I do not believe that the Government have remedied the defect the force of which they recognised when we raised the matter in Committee. I therefore

suggest that my Amendment to leave out "sole" and to insert "main" is necessary to achieve the Government's intention.</p>

<p>I suggest that essentially we have met the reasonable view of the interests concerned and the reasonable arguments put forward by the Opposition, but not precisely in the way that the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Patrick Jenkin) has interpreted it. The situation is, as the hon. Member says, that to be excluded completely from the effect of the legislation, the objects must be narrowly defined as he has indicated; and as he has said, the court would come fresh to an interpretation. That, however, is so that the policies in question should be completely excluded from the provisions.<br/>
If further elements are brought into the policy as a result of which it would not be excluded from the provisions, we then get the situation that the provisions apply. There is nothing wrong with that, however, because if the policy is still a qualifying policy, there is no difficulty. There is, therefore, no reason to remove these policies wholly from the provisions of the Bill to achieve what the hon. Member wants to achieve and what I am glad to co-operate in giving him. In these circumstances, I think that the hon. Member would not wish to press his Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 10 in page 13, line 20, at end add&#x2014;
<q>(5) A policy of life insurance issued in respect of an insurance made on or before 19th March 1968 shall be treated for the purposes of subsection (4) above and the said Schedule 9 as issued in respect of one made after that date if it is varied after that date so as to increase the benefits secured, or to extend the term of the insurance:</q>
<q>Provided that a variation effected before the end of the year 1968 shall be disregarded for the purposes of this subsection if its only effect is to bring into conformity with paragraph 2 of that Schedule (qualifying conditions for endowment policies) a policy previously conforming therewith except as respects the amount guaranteed on death, and no increase is made in the premiums payable under the policy.</q>
This Amendment is essentially an anti-avoidance proposal, the object being to stop people using pre-Budget policies as a vehicle for avoidance. The position is that if a pre-Budget policy conformed with the tests in Schedule 9, any variation must conform with the new rules if it is to continue to qualify for tax reliefs.<br/>
The general effect of the Amendment is that if anybody has a pre-Budget policy which does not satisfy the conditions, he may keep it as it stands and the new legislation will not catch it, provided that he does not vary it&#x2014;because the Clause applies to policies entered into after Budget day. If, however, he varies the policy to increase the benefits or extend the term of the insurance, he will become exposed to the new legislation.<br/>
Therefore, the proviso to the Amendment allows certain pre-Budget policies to be rectified by the end of 1968. They will then be qualifying policies for all purposes. This provision was asked for by the unit trust movement, whose pre-Budget policies have failed to conform with the 75 per cent. guarantee test on a formality.</p>

<p>I am grateful, Mr. Speaker.<br/>
As Amendment No. 192 is the first to Schedule 9, perhaps I may now reply to what the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Patrick Jenkin) said about the number of Amendments. He was right to say that there are a large number to the Schedule. There are 50 altogether, but they are very largely repetitions and consequential Amendments to provide the same words in a number of different places.<br/>
Because I was also interested in the same point, I obtained an analysis in which the hon. Gentleman may be interested. There are 23 substantive Amendments, which is still a substantial number, 10 Amendments meet requests in Committee, and five meet direct


requests by the life offices. Seven rectify defective drafting and one consists of a machinery provision which has been agreed with the Life Offices' Association and the Industrial Life Offices' Association.<br/>
I now turn to the group of Amendments, one of which is starred. It differs from its predecessor, an unstarred Amendment with the same number, in having the words "the policy" added at the end. They are added purely for drafting purposes, so that the English flows.<br/>
The effect of the group of Amendments is twofold. First, they allow policies to qualify if the capital sum secured is payable on disability as an alternative to death or maturity, and, second, they deal more adequately with joint and contingency assurances.</p>

<p>Amendment No. 194 includes the word "until" in sub-paragraph (i), which begins
<q>until the happening of the event or the earlier expiry of the said term, &#x2026;</q>
If the use of that word means that the premiums under a policy must be payable until the happening of the event but not thereafter, there seems to be a possible conflict between the sub-paragraph and other parts of the Bill. For example, if one has a mortgage protection policy for &#x00A3;1,000 which also involves a small residual benefit of, say, &#x00A3;200&#x2014;that is, a constant endowment assurance benefit, one has left a sum assured of &#x00A3;800 dropping eventually to zero.<br/>
For this, a level annual premium is paid throughout the term of the policy, but the decreasing sum reaches zero before the last premium is payable, so that there are still two premiums payable referable to the declining sum after it has reached zero. It could be said that the policy would be disqualified because the use of the phrase "until the happening" implied that if there are no premiums payable thereafter a policy does not come within the Clause.<br/>
It may well be that "until" here is to be interpreted as "at least until", and that it is quite irrelevant that, provided the premiums are payable at least until

the happening of the event, any further premiums may be payable, thereafter.<br/>
That is a possible interpretation, but the alternative that I have suggested is also possible, and we owe it to those concerned to make sure that there shall be no doubt about this. I very much hope that the Chief Secretary will be able to reassure us, or, if necessary, introduce a retrospective Amendment next year.</p>

<q>(5) Notwithstanding sub-paragraph (1)(<i>b</i>) above, if a policy secures a capital sum payable only on death, it may also secure benefits (including benefits of a capital nature) to be provided in the event of a person's disability; and no policy is to be regarded for the purposes of that provision as securing other benefits by reason only of the fact that it confers a right to participate in profits, that it carries a guaranteed surrender value, that it gives an option to receive payments by way of annuity, or that it makes provision for the waiver of premiums by reason of a person's disability, or for the effecing of a further insurance or insurances without the production of evidence of insurability.</q>
<q>(6) In applying sub-paragraph (2) or (3) above to any policy&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) no account shall be taken of any provision for the waiver of premiums by reason of a person's disability, and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) if the term of the policy runs from a date earlier, but not more than three months earlier, than the making of the insurance, the insurance shall be treated as having been made on that date, and any premium paid in respect of the period before the making of the insurance, or in respect of that period and a subsequent period, as having been payable on that date.</li>

<q>(7) References in this paragraph to a capital sum payable on any event include references to any capital sum, or series of capital sums, payable by reason thereof; and a policy secures a capital sum payable either on death or on disability notwithstanding that the amount payable may vary with the event.</q>
The Amendment sets out to achieve four purposes. First, it states explicitly that a whole life policy may offer the "normal incidents of a policy". Second, it allows waiver of premiums on disability. Third, it allows back-dating of policies for up to three months. Fourth, it states explicitly that a capital sum payable on death includes a capital sum payable at a later date or a series of capital sums, and that the amount payable on death, disability or maturity need not be the same figure in all events.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No 201, in page 65, line 16, at end insert:
<q>'and</q>
<q>(<i>e</i>) the policy must not secure the provision (except by surrender) at any time before the happening of the event in question of any benefit of a capital nature other than a payment falling within paragraph (<i>d</i>)(ii) above, or benefits attributable to a right to participate in profits or arising by reason of a person's disability.</q>
<q>(2) Sub-paragraphs (6) and (7) of paragraph 1 above shall, with any necessary modifications, have effect for the purposes of this paragraph as they have effect for the purposes of that paragraph.</q>
<q>(3) For the purposes of sub-paragraph (l)(<i>d</i>)(i) above, ten per cent. of the premiums payable under any policy issued in the course of an industrial insurance business as defined in section 1(2) of the Industrial Assurance Act 1923 shall be treated as attributable to the fact that they are not paid annually'.</q>
The Amendment has two purposes. First, it states that an endowment assurance policy may not provide payments of capital during its term except through surrender or bonuses, or, indeed, on the return of premiums in the case of an industrial assurance children's policy. Secondly, it provides that 10 per cent. of the premiums payable under industrial assurance policies should be disregarded in deciding whether death benefit is at least three-quarters of the total premiums.</p>

<p>On a point of order. To expedite matters, may I say that, as the Chief Secretary pointed out, we are entirely content with many of the Amendments. They are largely to meet points which we made in Committee, and there are no observations which we wish to make until we reach Amendment No. 293.

I should like to echo the gratitude of my right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) for the speed with which you, Mr. Speaker, have been able to deal with the Amendments. It has saved us a lot of time and will help us in discussing parts of the Bill on which not a single word has been said during its passage.<br/>
The Amendment has not, I understand, been discussed with the interests concerned. I stand to be corrected, but I

believe that that is so. We raised this matter in Committee and we received what I regarded as a very unsatisfactory answer. That is why I felt it right that we should press it again. It is to do with the Surtax charge on the gains which arise on non-qualifying policies. The House will be aware that "gains", in this case, represent any excess of the policy moneys over the aggregate premiums which have been paid.<br/>
The justification for the Surtax charge is that the gains represent sums which, in the hands of the insurance company, have borne only Income Tax at a conventional rate and, where appropriate, Capital Gains Tax. Therefore, if the policy moneys reach the insurer free of further taxation, this will be, and has been in the past, a way for the avoidance of Surtax. In the case of an individual, the charge is only to Surtax, but in the case of a close company&#x2014;and the Amendment is related to close companies &#x2014;there is a most extraordinary provision which the Financial Secretary tried to explain in Committee, but failed entirely to do so satisfactorily, namely, that the gain is subject not only to Surtax but to a second charge&#x2014;Income Tax. I say "a second charge", and I emphasise it, because the money has already borne Income Tax in the hands of the insurance company.</p>

<p>The money represented by the gain, which is the difference between the aggregate premium paid and the policy monies which become payable when the policy matures. That represents the accrual in the hands of the insurance company. Any interest which the premiums have earned have been subjected to Income Tax. Any capital gains from the premiums which have been invested have been subjected to Capital Gains Tax. That is why I say that this gain, in the hands of an individual or of a close company, should in fairness be subject only to Surtax and not to a second charge of Income Tax. Yet that is the effect of the Bill. My Amendment is intended to remove this anomaly.<br/>
The Financial Secretary sought to justify the anomaly by saying that it was


a sort of gamble. He used the phrase, "Heads they win, tails they lose", and the gamble depended on whether the company needed the income, remembering that this is a close company, for the purposes of its business&#x2014;that is, whether the money would come within a short fall assessment. He argued that if the money was not assessed because it was needed in the business, it would not be taxed in the company's hands, to which I can only say, "I jolly well hope not". But if the money is assessed on the ground that it was not needed, it should be taxed as investment income.<br/>
The Financial Secretary used significant words in Committee which gave the impression that he still did not appreciate the nature of our case. He said:
<q>&#x2026;in the close company, have a certain advantage, for whereas a chargeable gain would be made on an individual, the same policy held by a close company would be entirely exempt from tax unless the close company, a trading company, could not show that it needed the money for the purpose of its business ".&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee</i> A, 22nd May, 1968; c. 1296.]</q>
I emphasise that the hon. Gentleman said that the same policy held by a close company would be "entirely exempt from tax". That is not so. The money has borne tax in the hands of the insurance company and, for this reason, if the money became payable to an individual it would be subject only to Surtax. There seems to be no reason why, when it reaches the hands of a close company in circumstances in which it becomes a charge for tax, it should be charged not only to Surtax but to Income Tax.<br/>
In a close company, an individual cannot enjoy benefit if it is not distributed, and that is the disadvantage, if one needs to look for a disadvantage, of a policy inuring for the benefit of a close company. If the proprietors of the close company leave the policy money in the company, it does not swell their own spending power; they are forgoing the personal advantage, I agree that if it is distributed it would be entirely in conformity with the Schedule that it should be subject to the Surtax charge. But I cannot see why it should be charged to Income Tax, because the interest on the premium moneys has suffered Income Tax in the hands of the insurance company. I believe that if this Clause goes

through in the form in which it is at present it will do great injustice in these cases&#x2014;there cannot be many of them, I concede that&#x2014;where a non-qualifying policy will inure to the benefit of a close company.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
The Financial Secretary also went on to ask, and I suppose that he was entitled to ask, in what circumstances would a close company have the benefit of a non-qualifying policy. In a sense, he asked me to produce a case. I can retort, if there are no cases in which a close company would have the benefit of a non-qualifying policy, why include that provision in the Bill at all? I gather the Chief Secretary takes the point. He simply cannot refuse to remedy a potential injustice by claiming that it would never become an actual injustice, because there will be instances in which the paragraph would apply.<br/>
The paragraph is there, and if it is applied it will give rise to the injustice which I have described to the House, and it is Parliament's duty to prevent that injustice before it happens, and not after. It has never been the practice, when discussing potential tax anomalies, and before any fiscal injustice should be righted, that one should have, as it were, to produce a victim to display the gory wounds inflicted by the Treasury, so that the Treasury may see what is likely to be the damage done.<br/>
Suffice it to say, we have a family company; the founder takes out a single premium policy, held in trust by the company, perhaps on the grounds that, if the founder dies, there will be greater need of capital than otherwise would be the case, and to ensure that it is available to the business. Because it is a single premium non-qualifying policy it incurs the penalty of this tax, not only Surtax but also Income Tax twice. This is an appalling hazard for a company which has perfectly reasonably entered into such an arrangement. It is to treat a reasonable financial arrangement to a sort of fiscal Russian roulette, and it is Parliament's business to prevent that sort of thing from happening.<br/>
The Amendment by which we seek to prevent it would leave the potential charge to Surtax in cases where that would be appropriate&#x2014;and I make no


complaint about that&#x2014;but it would remove the double charge to Income Tax. I get the impression that the Chief Secretary has taken the point, and I hope that although this is the Report stage, and although the Amendment has been drafted with such skill as I can command, he will, nevertheless, feel it right to accept the Amendment. The damage we seek to prevent cannot happen often, but if it does happen great injustice will be done.</p>

<p>I rise only to tell my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Patrick Jenkin) that when he rose this afternoon I had not the faintest idea what this Amendment meant, but now I have got a glimmer of its meaning, and I am quite certain that he is right and that the Government ought to accept the Amendment.<br/>
There is a real case here for saying that the Conservative Party has reached the stage of preventive medicine whereas the Government are still acting as but chers, and, as my hon. Friend said, have to have a body with gory wounds before the Government can see that there is a patient to deal with. We say that this is a situation which can happen, that we have no need to wait till we can prove that it has happened, that it is absurd to leave this injustice in the Bill.<br/>
Our Amendment would remove it. I admit that there may be very few occasions when it would happen, but in certain circumstances it is bound to happen to a close company with this sort of policy, even though the occasions may be few. It may be rather like that mythical man, the bachelor with &#x00A3;100,000 a year and no dependants, the classic case which is argued across the Floor of the House on so many occasions. It may not exist, but it may, and if it does there is quite clearly an injustice which would be done to a close company, and I hope that the Chief Secretary will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I believe I understand exactly the point raised by the hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Patrick Jenkin). I apologise to the House that it has not been possible, in the circumstances in which I appear here instead of my hon. Friend, for me to read fully the wise and authoritative com-

ments which he made in Committee, but I have no hesitation in saying that what he said and what I shall be saying will be identical, because although truth is many-sided, there is only one truth, and the truth of this matter is, of course, that the hon. Gentleman is mistaken, and I hope that if he will be patient I can show him, and that is why I rose to ask him a question.<br/>
There is a broad measure of agreement between us at least on the acceptance of certain principles. The hon. Gentleman agrees that what is not at issue is Surtax-ability. The hon. Gentleman agrees that if a close corporation can satisfy the Revenue that it needs not for business purposes to distribute this standard figure it would not be distributed, and to that extent the element which is income would thereby be retained. There is in issue here whether there has been double taxation, be it by Income Tax or Corporation Tax, of certain income.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman recalls very well the discussions we had when Corporation Tax was introduced, and its effects on companies, and the distinction between the company and the shareholders. The hon. Gentleman recollects well that an individual holding investments direct is in a different position from an individual holding his investments through an investment company. I am talking of an investment trust at the moment. He recollects that an investment trust is not bound to pay, first, Corporation Tax&#x2014;subject to certain exceptions which I will come to, because they are the nub of the argument&#x2014;not required to pay Corporation Tax on its income. It then distributes part to the shareholder who is required to pay Income Tax, by means of withholding the tax, and, where relevant, Surtax. If the investment trust in question receives its income also taxed in such a way that it is accurately described as franked, then of course Corporation Tax is not levied again on that amount of income.<br/>
What the hon. Gentleman is, therefore, saying, and what he said specifically in reply to my question, when I asked, "What income?" is referring to the whole of the income which the life company receives and by means of which it is enabled to increase the value of the policy so that the question of gain arises;


and what the hon. Gentleman is, therefore, saying is that the whole of that income, which I define&#x2014;I am sure we are at one in what we are talking about&#x2014;as franked.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman is not accurate in that assumption, and I would not be in saying that none of it is franked, and if the argument has proceeded on the basis that it is entirely franked or entirely un-franked, both of those arguments are not wholly accurate. This is in fact a mixed bag. It is income both franked and un-franked, and the accretion to the policy is drawn from a mixed fund of income, and to the extent that there is an element of franked income within it the hon. Gentleman would be right in saying that this is unfortunate, but I cannot separate out, or provide any means of separating out, or even of apportioning, that element. I take his point.<br/>
I say that if there were an injustice I would be the first to want to remove it, but I cannot eliminate from that mixed fund such part, if any, which might be a small part, but which may nevertheless exist, as is already franked income which, in other circumstances, would not be subject, therefore, to Corporation Tax, which is, for this purpose, the same as Income Tax which, he says, is thereby being levied twice. I do not see how we can meet that point. It is a mixed fund, and the only way we can deal with the matter is as the Act provides. I therefore cannot accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I am sure the Chief Secretary realises that that must have been a painful reply for him to make, since he was good enough to appreciate that, at any rate to an extent, which he did not attempt to quantify and neither will I, the injustice of which I complained is there.</p>

<p>The question of whether the income is franked or not&#x2014;one could use a different language; if it has suffered tax or not&#x2014; has been resolved in the case of the individual insurer in favour of the individual, in that no further Income Tax is charged on the gain that arises when policy moneys accrue, whereas with a close company it is decided in favour of the Revenue in that Income Tax is to be charged on the whole of it.</p>

<p>This is but one more example of the Government trying to have it both ways when dealing with close companies. They tell us, on the one hand, that close companies are no more than tax avoidance devices to allow private individuals to trade with the benefit of a corporate entity and that they should continue to be taxed as though they were individuals, but, at the same time, they always argue that close companies are subject to all the features of Corporation Tax and to all the conditions. The net result is that close companies, as we have said over and over again in the House and in Committee, are "clobbered" by the Revenue.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-07-04a.1730.2" colnum="1730" time="">
<p>This may be a relatively unimportant example because it cannot happen very often, but it is a classic example of what happens if one chooses to conduct one's business affairs through a small family company. The Chief Secretary has given no assurance that he is prepared to meet the legitimate objection, an objection which he went a long way towards admitting had validity. In these circumstances I ask my hon. and right hon. Friends to express their displeasure in the Division Lobby.</p>

Questions were raised as to the meaning of that and I promised to give the matter further consideration. I now agree that the Bill as originally drafted was unnecessarily restrictive. Therefore, the Amendment would substitute for the requirement of a written notice to the Inspector of Taxes one that a decision had been taken before Budget day to prepare accounts reflecting the change, and any argument about whether a decision had been taken or not would be settled in the ordinary way.</p>

<q>9.&#x2014;(1) Where an individual who is chargeable to tax under subsection (1) of the principal section pays a premium or other consideration under an annuity contract for the time being approved by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue under this paragraph (hereinafter in this paragraph referred to as 'a qualifying premium') the amount of the qualifying premium shall, subject to the following provisions of this paragraph, be deducted from the amount which would otherwise be chargeable to tax by virtue of that subsection for the year of assessment in which the qualifying premium is paid, and if the qualifying premium exceeds that amount the excess shall be carried forward, and shall be treated for the purposes of this paragraph as the amount of a qualifying premium paid in the next following year, and so on for succeeding years (if necessary).</q>
<q>(2) Subject to sub-paragraphs (3) and (4)' below, subsections (2) and (3) of section 22 of the Finance Act, 1956 shall have effect in relation to this paragraph as they have effect in relation to that section.</q>
<q>(3) The Commissioners shall not approve the whole of a contract for the purposes of this paragraph unless it appears to them that the aggregate value of the benefits, of whatever nature, afforded by the contract and by any other contract or contracts made by the individual and approved by the Commissioners under this paragraph or under section 22 of the Finance Act, 1956 is reasonably comparable to the value of the benefits usually afforded


by statutory superannuation schemes to persons who have held an office or employment during the period in which the trade, profession or vocation was carried on by the individual and whose emoluments therefrom were equal to the profits or gains which arose to the individual from the trade, profession or vocation, and the Commissioners may, if they think fit, aporove a contract made by an individual born before 6th April, 1917 subject to the condition that the relief afforded by this sub-paragraph shall be taken in substitution for the whole or part of the relief which the individual would otherwise obtain under section 19 of this Act.</q>
<q>(4) The Commissioners may approve a contract under this paragraph notwithstanding that it provides for the annuity payable to the individual to commence after he attains the age of seventy if it provides for that annuity to commence within one month of the date when the contract is made.</q>
<q>(5) The Commissioners may, if they think fit, approve a part of a contract, and where they do so this paragraph shall have effect as if the part of the contract which is approved and the part of the contract which is not approved were separate contracts, and the premium or other consideration paid by the individual shall be apportioned between the two parts in such manner as may be just.</q>
<q>(6) The Commissioners may at any time, by notice in writing given to the persons by and to whom the premiums are payable under any contract for the time being approved under this paragraph, withdraw that approval on such grounds and from such date as may be specified in the notice.</q>
<q>(7) Where an election is made under paragraph 6 of this Schedule as respects sums received in any year of assessment a qualifying premium paid in that year may be deducted from those sums notwithstanding that the tax is to be charged as if those sums were received immediately after the discontinuance, but no amount shall be deducted more than once under this paragraph.</q>
<q>(8) Where an individual pays a qualifying premium within six months after the beginning of a year of assessment he may, by notice in writing sent to the Inspector before 6th October in that year elect that for the purposes of relief under this paragraph the premium shall be treated in the same way as if it had been paid in the preceeding year of assessment and not in the year in which it is paid, and any relief given in consequence of the election for the earlier year shall be given by way of repayment of tax.</q>
<q>(9) Any annuity paid under a contract for the time being approved by the Commissioners under this paragraph shall be treated as earned income of the annuitant to the extent to which it is payable in return for any amount deducted under this paragraph, but this sub-paragraph shall only apply in relation to the annuitant to whom the annuity is made payable by the terms of the contract.</q>
<q>(10) No relief shall be given under section 23 of the Finance Act, 1956 in respect of any amount deducted under this paragraph, and

section 27 of that Act shall not apply in relation to any annuity to the extent to which it is payable in reurn for any amount deducted under this paragraph.</q>
The Amendment looks enormously long, but is in fact immensely modest and small. It makes a very small amelioration in the case of pensions for the self-employed. We have put down three or four new Clauses hoping to make some serious Amendments to the 1956 provisions for pensions of the self-employed, but they were not selected and I shall not attempt, on the peg of this Amendment, to hang the arguments which I would have liked to deploy then.<br/>
As is well known, under the self-employed pension arrangements, first there is no right of commutation; second, there is no effective carry-forward of any under-contributions for any year due to an insufficiency of earnings for that year; third&#x2014;this becomes relevant to the Amendment&#x2014;there is no provision whereby the income of the final 36 months, whether of trading or of professional earnings, can be related to the pension scheme, that is, the well-known two-thirds rule which applies in every other calling; and fourth, no regard is had to subsequent inflation.<br/>
The Amendment is really concerned only with the third of those objectives. Under the Bill as drafted, those who have to pay tax from now on on their post-cessation receipts are, of course, allowed to write-off, although they have discontinued trading, certain expenses of the trade. Even though they have discontinued trading, they are allowed against the receipts subsequently received after the dates of cessation of trading to write off expenses. Schedule 10, by paragraph (1), provides for certain allowable deductions on the footing that, if the trade had not been discontinued, they would have been admissible in computing for tax purposes the profits or gains of the individual.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
What we seek to do by this Amendment is, basically, to add to that permission the premium for a self-employed person, that is to say, he would be able to debit against the new subject matter of the charge, the post-cessation receipt, the cost of providing for his retirement annunity. This is a modest Amendment because even that opportunity, modest as


it is, is hedged about with many restrictions. It will be subject to precisely the same requirements as are laid down by the Finance Act, 1956, but with an additional safeguard. Only where the individual can show that the retirement annuity secured by him at the date of the discontinuance is less than two-thirds of the yearly average of his final three years' income or salary, could he use the amelioration at all, and even then his chargeable contribution will be limited to securing the difference between the annunity provided at discontinuance and the two-thirds ceiling.<br/>
The two-thirds test is precisely that which is applied in relation to schemes approved by the Commissioners under Section 388 of the 1952 Income Tax Act. Even after that safeguard, there is a further safeguard. There can be no duplication under the fading provisions of Clause 19 to those of a certain age under the Bill as it is drafted. In other words, one cannot have it both ways. If one wishes to take advantage of this Amendment, one cannot also take advantage of those fading provisions.<br/>
I marvel at the modesty of the Amendment considering what a blow the self-employed have been struck by these two Clauses and the Schedule in the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Member marvels at the modesty of this Amendment. I marvel at his capacity to use the word"modesty"in describing an Amendment which would wreck the whole scheme. Perhaps I had better concentrate on his use of the word. I hope that he will bear with me while I take him through the figures.<br/>
The aggregate value of the benefits usually afforded on a statutory superannuation scheme&#x2014;and on that the hon. and learned Member was modelling his proposal&#x2014;is roughly for the full lifetime service, 40 years' service, six times the average annual salary in the last three years. A professional man who has just retired and wishes to provide equivalent benefits for himself to start immediately would have to pay a premium of something like six times his average annual profits over the last three years. It is almost inconceivable that post-cessation receipts will ever be as large as that, so the relief under the Amendment would complete!)' wipe out the tax charge on

the post-cessation receipts if they were used to buy an annuity.<br/>
The proposal, modest though it is, is a proposal to eliminate completely the liability for practical purposes to tax of post-cessation receipts. It would return to the situation where those who have their tax calculated on an earnings basis pay their normal, proper, fair tax, and those who have their profits and accordingly their tax, calculated on a cash basis are sought to have this benefit of having their post-cessation receipts entirely free, in the majority of cases, of tax.<br/>
In those circumstances, as obviously the hon. and learned Member wishes to make progress, I do not think I need deal with any of the other points in the proposal. I hope that, in those circumstances, he will not wish to press it.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether I require the leave of the House to speak again. If so, I ask for it. I am amazed at the attitude of the Chief Secretary. This is a modest proposal. It would apply only where the individual can show that the lifetime annuity secured by him is less than two-thirds of the average of his yearly income. Even if he can use that, his chargeable contribution would be devoted to securing the difference between that and the two-thirds ceiling.</p>

<p>I hear what the hon. and learned Member is saying about an annuity, but I am sure that he has taken my point on board. I am not talking about the amount of the annuity, but the sum set aside to purchase an annuity which has to come out of the post-cessation receipts.</p>

<p>I think that is a misunderstanding. One takes account of the premiums paid under the 1956 Act. I agree that by a fell swoop one cannot buy an annuity to be paid for out of the post-cessation receipts and seek to put oneself in that favourable position, but the professional people who would be hit by this Clause would already have taken out self-employed insurance under the 1966 Act to a greater or lesser extent. What we are seeking to do is to ensure that out of their post-cessation receipts they should be allowed to pay sufficient to bring themselves up to within the two-thirds rule. Of course, many would not be able to do so because they would not


have sufficient post-cessation receipts. All we are seeking is in a modest, moderate and partial way to treat those who are hardly hit by the Clause in the same way as others.<br/>
Since we want to make progress and the Chief Secretary has taken an extreme opposition view to this proposal, all that I can ask him to do now is to recognise, as I thought he partially recognised in Committee, the fact that on commutation of the two-thirds rule the difference between the self-employed and those who can have the benefit of Section 388 of the 1952 Act is now monstrous. I hoped that if he could not accept this Amendment, he would at least say that the Treasury was thinking how to reconcile these two classes of Her Majesty's subjects so that there would not be the unfairness which here will prevail.</p>

<p>These six Amendments amend provisions in the Capital Gains Tax law which contain elections for the taxpayer to have his liability to tax on capital gains paid in one way rather than another. The effect of the Amendments is that, in the case of a company, the time limit for the election to be made is related to the date at which the company's accounting period ends instead of the end of the year of assessment, which remains the date for individuals. The end of the accounting period is the natural and sensible date to use in the case of companies. Indeed, the Amendments

have the support of the accountancy profession.<br/>
The three decisions with which the Amendments are concerned are, first, the election under paragraph 25 to Schedule 6 to the Finance Act to have the gain on certain assets which were acquired before 6th April, 1965 computed by reference to their value at 6th April, 1965 and not on a time apportionment basis. The second election with which the Amendments are concerned is the election under Section 33 of the Finance Act, 1967, under which a taxpayer can elect to have gain on disposals of land with development value computed, not by reference to changes in its current value, but by reference to changes in its overall value. The third provision is that under Schedule 11 to the Bill, under which a taxpayer may elect to have his gain on quoted shares or securities acquired before 6th April, 1965 computed solely by reference to their value at that date.<br/>
The time limit for these elections would in all cases run out at the end of the second year of assessment; that is, the second year following the year of assessment in which the disposal was made. Under the Amendments the time limit for companies would be two years after the end of the accounting period in which the disposal was made. The position now is that, both for individuals and for companies, the election period is two years from the date when he would normally be considering his tax affairs. I repeat that this has the support of the accountancy profession. I therefore hope that the Amendments will commend themselves to the House.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment No. 131, in page 27, leave out lines 14 to 19 and insert:
<q>(2) A payment of a premium on a policy of assurance on the life of the deceased, or a gift of money or money's worth applied, directly or indirectly, in payment of such a premium, shall not for the purposes of subsection (1) above be regarded as part of the normal expenditure of the deceased if, when the insurance was made, or at any earlier or later time, an annuity was purchased on the life of the deceased, unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the Board or, on an appeal under section 10 of the Finance Act 1948, of the court entertaining the appeal, that the purchase of the annuity and the making or any variation of the insurance, or of any prior insurance for which the first-mentioned insurance was directly or indirectly substituted, were not associated operations.</q>
The Amendment widens the terms of subsection (2), which is designed to ensure that premiums paid on a policy of assurance in cases where there was a back-to-back arrangement cannot be exempt as normal income gifts. In the common back-to-back arrangement, as the House will be aware, someone whose life may be uninsurable in the ordinary course insures his life and at the same time buys an annuity out of which the premiums are paid. The purchase of the annuity enables the insurance company to undertake the insurance. The annuity is income and has had to be taken into account in applying the normal and reasonable test in the past; and, without special provisions, it would be taken into account for the new tests in subsection (1). In these cases the premiums are in effect being paid out of the capital which the deceased used to buy his annuity.<br/>
Hence subsection (2). This tackles the problem by dealing with the case where, as an associated operation, the deceased effected a policy of assurance on his life and bought an annuity and was denied exemption for premiums which he paid on the policy. There is an easy way round this provision. An existing back-to-back arrangement could, in effect, be continued in such a way that the premiums qualified for exemption as normal income gifts. This could be done by substituting for the policy originally taken out by the husband a new one which is taken out on his life by the wife and</p>

I shall return to the point and hope that I shall be more successful.</p>

understood a word that he said we were uncertain. We certainly did not.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-07-04a.1751.0" hansard_membership_id="3434" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30098" speakername="Mr. Diamond" colnum="1751" time="">
<p>There is nothing like starting off on an agreed basis&#x2014;that the Opposition did not understand one word. Perhaps in these circumstances it would be wiser and safer for me not to risk misleading anyone by using words which have been fairly carefully prepared to make this group of Amendments clear.<br/>
The main purpose of the Amendments is to implement the undertaking which my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary gave in Committee to extend the relief for policies of assurance taken out before Budget day. The relief as it stands gives an exception from the new rule of aggregation only when the total benefits arising under all pre-Budget policies which are to any extent within the charge to Estate Duty on the death of the assured do not exceed &#x00A3;25,000.<br/>
The Amendments which we are now discussing add to this relief where the total benefits exceed &#x00A3;25,000. This new relief consists in excluding from the new rule of aggregation the proportion of the amounts chargeable to Estate Duty in respect of such policies which &#x00A3;25,000 bears to the total benefits. The intention underlying the original relief, where the total benefits involved were not more than &#x00A3;25,000, was to provide for the case in which it could be said that the provision for dependants was "comparatively modest". It will be remembered that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor used those words in his Second Reading speech. The figure of &#x00A3;25,000 was selected as representing a reasonable judgment of what a modest provision was. But it would be unfair to leave the matter there and to give no relief at all where the total benefits exceed &#x00A3;25,000, perhaps by only a small amount.<br/>
There are various possible marginal provisions which could be devised, but the Chancellor has chosen what I hope the House will agree is the generous one of excluding from the new rule of aggregation in all cases the chargeable amounts rateably attributable to &#x00A3;25,000 of the total benefits. The total benefits arising under a policy will commonly be greater than the amount on which Estate Duty is chargeable in respect of the policy, because there are two limitations on the

charge. The first limitation is by reference to the premiums paid in the period since March, 1963, and within seven years before the death compared with the total premiums. Second, there is a limitation on account of taper relief, that taper relief being 15 per cent., 30 per cent., or 60 per cent., as the case may be, on premiums paid in the early part of the gifts period.<br/>
Thus, the new relief following the approach in the existing Clause 33 has regard to the total benefits arising under the policies as the fundamental basis of the relief and not the amount on which any Estate Duty is chargeable. It is the total actual benefits arising which are the proper measure of a comparatively modest provision. On that footing, only the amounts chargeable which are attributable to &#x00A3;25,000 of the total benefits ought to be relieved.<br/>
The various Amendments have been tabled on that basis. The main purpose of the Amendments is achieved in the new subsections (7) and (8). There are some other changes to which I shall now shortly refer. The relief is extended so as to embrace single premium policies which are described by the words in the new subsection (7) as "a gift of &#x2026; a policy". This relates to an Amendment put down by hon. Members opposite in Committee, and repeated on Recommittal but not reached and, therefore, not debated.<br/>
Another change is that any pre-Budget policies which have matured or been surrendered before 20th March are completely excepted from the new rule of aggregation. That is provided under subsection (9).<br/>
Subsection (10) deals with policies which are varied after Budget day so as to increase their value. The subsection allows relief only for the part attributable to the policy before variation. A policy may be varied in amount or terms without constituting a new policy, and provision is necessary to prevent someone who had pre-Budget insurances for, say, &#x00A3;1,000 from taking advantage of the relief under the Clause by increasing the value by means of a variation to, say, &#x00A3;25,000.<br/>
The new subsection (2) extends the relief to cover deferred annuities payable


on the death of the deceased, thus meeting the point made in Amendments put down in Committee by hon. Gentlemen opposite but, again, not reached.<br/>
I have attempted to describe accurately and slowly the precise proposals embodied generally in these Amendments. I dare say that hon. Gentlemen will have points to make and will wish to discuss the matter at length. I think that the most convenient course now would be for me to leave the matter there and listen carefully to the ensuing debate.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-07-04a.1753.0" hansard_membership_id="6927" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32380" speakername="Mr. Patrick Jenkin" colnum="1753" time="">
<p>The Chief Secretary will not be surprised when I tell him that there are many people who regard Clause 33, next to the aggregation of minors' income, as one of the most important matters in the Bill. It makes a major change in the pattern of Estate Duty and removes what has hitherto been regarded as a settled and well established method of disposing of one's property in such a way as to reduce liability to Estate Duty. There is little doubt that the aspect of this change, far-reaching thought it is for the future, which has given rise to the greatest indignation on the part of the public is the manifestly retrospective effect of the Clause on policies taken out before Budget day.<br/>
There can be little doubt that, even with the relief which was embodied in the Bill&#x2014;of which no word had been said in the Budget&#x2014;and even with the minor addition, for such it is, in the Amendment now before us, this retrospective abrogation of the benefits of non-aggregation which applied to policies taken out before Budget day has caused a grievous disruption of the carefully planned provision for dependants made in many thousands of families throughout the country. In some cases, the change effected by the Clause, and hardly ameliorated by the relief which the right hon. Gentleman has just described, has been little short of catastrophic. Men have entered into irrevocable transactions, divesting themselves of property in circumstances in which they relied upon the existing law, and the effect on their transactions has been virtually to destroy them overnight. To my mind, this comes manifestly within the category of cases in which a change in the law should not be made with retrospective effect.<br/>
Several of the Amendments which are being taken at the same time would achieve the object that the change in the law&#x2014;which we could, perhaps, discuss separately as to its merits&#x2014;should apply only in respect of policies taken out after Budget day. I am absolutely convinced that that would be right. The Chief Secretary may or may not have heard the speech which I addressed to the Committee on Clause 30, the extension of the gift period from five to seven years, in which I put what seemed to me to be the appropriate distinction between cases in which it is legitimate to legislate with retrospective effect and cases in which it is wrong so to legislate.<br/>
I shall not repeat those arguments now, save to say that there is a clear distinction between cases, on the one hand, in which one is changing a law which has been well settled for many years, which has been recognised over and over again in subsequent legislation passed by the House and which has been relied on by the taxpayer, with the full knowledge and consent of the Revenue&#x2014;and in this particular case with agreement made by the Revenue with the Life Offices Association &#x2014;in which retrospection is manifestly unjust, and, on the other hand, those cases in which one is seeking to close loopholes exploited by clever accountants and lawyers, that is, cases in which a measure taken one year to deal with one form of tax avoidance device or another can be seen in the following year not to have succeeded in its purpose because someone has by his ingenuity found a way round it. In such circumstances, there might well be a case for retrospective legislation.<br/>
5.30 p.m.<br/>
I recounted to the Committee a number of examples from Finance Acts since the war which showed that the distinction which I put to the Committee had been followed to the letter. There were many cases in which changes had been made in Estate Duty legislation&#x2014;and it is particularly in Estate Duty legislation that this sort of situation arises, because one is dealing wih transactions in which the tax becomes chargeable in the future&#x2014; and in which exactly that distinction had been followed. I shall not repeat them.<br/>
Whatever else one may say, it is clear that the benefit of non-aggregation of


policies in which the deceased never had an interest falls without any doubt into the case in which retrospective legislation should not have been introduced. The first reason for that is that non-aggregation has existed since 1894. It was built into the Finance Act of that year in that property in which the deceased never had an interest was not to be aggregated with the rest of his estate.<br/>
It has become an established feature of the Estate Duty picture. It has been recognised over and over again by the courts and by Parliament. Parliament itself cast a benevolent eye on this relief, for such it is, in 1954, when Parliament legislated to close a manifest avoidance device by which people were taking out a whole series of separate policies in favour of a single beneficiary. Parliament legislated to stop that but did nothing to alter the benefits of non-aggregation.<br/>
Secondly, in 1959 Parliament put on to a firm statutory footing the dutiability of policies by reference to the number of premiums paid within the gift period, then five years, now seven years. There was no reference in the Section on that occasion to non-aggregation. It was assumed to be a permanent feature of the legislative scene.<br/>
Thirdly, there was the agreement to which I have referred with the Life Offices Association. It is to be found in a letter which that Association put out and from which I will read only one paragraph:
<q>The whole purpose of the offices' self-imposed restrictions in this area of 'combinations'"&#x2014;</q>
that is, the combined policy, the back-to-back&#x2014;
<q>is therefore directed to ensuring that there is proper underwriting&#x2014;in other words, if the life to be assured does not measure up to a minimum standard of health, then the contract will not be issued.</q>
The reason for that is that the life offices knew perfectly well and they had discussed it with the Revenue that that sort of underwriting represented a tax avoidance device.<br/>
The letter continues:
<q>There are two long-stops to this important underwriting restriction. The first merely affirms the normal practice of most offices of not taking a life over age 80&#x2014;the other limits

the combination effected in any one year to &#x00A3;50,000, if both contracts are issued by the same office.</q>
The agreement was there. Policies were issued on the faith of it. It does not lie in the mouth of any Chancellor of the Exchequer thereafter unilaterally to abrogate the basis on which those policies were issued, yet that is exactly what the Clause and the Bill do.<br/>
The excuse which was offered to a member of the public who wrote to the Chancellor was as follows, and I quote from a letter dated 13th May and signed by the Private Secretary to the Chancellor to a Mr. Shaw. I should make it clear that I am not referring to my hon. Friend the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Michael Shaw). The reply states:
<q>The Revenue, whilst welcoming it"&#x2014;</q>
that is, the voluntary limitation&#x2014;
<q>made it clear that it would not be treated as limiting Ministers' freedom to take such legislative action as they might think fit about these policies.</q>
I ask the Chief Secretary, to whom did the Revenue make it clear that it did not regard itself as bound by that?<br/>
I have a letter from a leading firm, perhaps the leading firm, of insurance brokers&#x2014;these are the people to whom it was supposed to have been made clear that the agreement was regarded by the Revenue as not binding upon it&#x2014; stating:
<q>For many years there has been an agreement between the Treasury and the Life Offices Association under which it has been regarded as reasonable for policies to be effected up to a maximum figure of &#x00A3;50,000 (securing in appropriate cases non-aggregation). If the Clauses are to stand as drafted, therefore, I would suggest that there is an irrefutable case for altering the &#x00A3;25,000 to &#x00A3;50,000.</q>
There is an Amendment which would achieve that.
<q>To do otherwise would, it seems to me, be retrospectively discrediting an agreement between Her Majesty's Treasury and a recognised trade society.</q>
How can it possibly lie in the mouth of Treasury Ministers to say that it has been made clear to all the people in that case that it did not regard itself as bound by the agreement which it made with the Life Offices Association? Indeed, the Chancellor admits that there is justice in the argument about retrospection because


he is prepared to introduce the &#x00A3;25,000 exemption. This provision for &#x00A3;25,000, both as in the Bill and subject to the Amendment moved by the Chief Secretary, is, as I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate, a very modest one. What is still worse is that it has the most wildly haphazard results. I will deal with those presently.<br/>
Despite the relief, however, the Clause represents a break in faith with responsible bodies who have acted in full accordance with the wishes expressed over many years by the Treasury and the Inland Revenue. The result is to cause serious disruption of people's legitimate expectations.<br/>
The cases that one will quote, and which have, I am sure, been quoted to many hon. Members, on both sides, will, of course, be of people of some means, because it is in cases where the rates of duty are very high, as they are in this country, that the effect of the removal of the relief of non-aggregation has a correspondingly swingeing effect.<br/>
I would like to quote one or two of the examples which have come to me. Perhaps, with the leave of the House, I might read this letter in full:
<q>As one of the trustees of a life policy annuity scheme, it is my duty to distribute the proceeds arising from two policies, which have become payable as the result of my mother's death on 5th April this year.</q>
<q>One cannot fight for oneself, but on this occasion I have no personal interest except to try and fight for the 30 beneficiaries under these two policies who were due to receive varying amounts up to &#x00A3;5,000. This was not a haphazard figure but was the one chosen because at that time moneys due under a life policy were assessed as a separate estate and benefits up to &#x00A3;5,000 per individual were not liable to tax.</q>
<q>When my mother made these arrangements, she was delighted to be able to help so many people. She died a few days too late in the knowledge that these arrangements had probably failed in part, as the policies amounted to more than &#x00A3;25,000. Arranging one's affairs prudently today is rather like sitting down to play cards, when the rules can be changed in the middle of the game to suit the house.</q>
<q>If you can do anything to put right the injustice of Clause 33 of the 1968 Finance Bill, I should be extremely grateful".</q>
That is a typical example of the sort of reaction to which the Chancellor's proposals in the Bill have given rise.<br/>
My next quotation indicates that one is dealing not only with wealthy people disposing of their wealth, but with people

in close companies who have built up businesses by their own hard work and who have seen their life's work virtually disappear overnight. A letter to my right hon. Friend the Member for En-field, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) states as follows:
<q>I joined this company"&#x2014;</q>
a well-known company&#x2014;
<q>as a director in 1926 at the age of 24. I invested &#x00A3;500 in the company, and each year I ploughed the profits back into the business, living on a very low income which I believe at that time was about &#x00A3;450 a year. The business continued to expand year by year, until in 1947 my accountant drew my attention to what a serious position would arise in the event of my death.</q>
A little lower down he goes on:
<q>I realised that by all my hard work and enterprise I was going to leave my wife and four children with a very serious problem had I died at that time.&#x2026; I immediately took steps to increase my life cover and to spread my estate amongst my wife and my four children. I effected life insurance policies to a total of just over &#x00A3;85,000. &#x2026; Until yesterday"&#x2014;</q>
the letter was written the day after the Budget&#x2014;
<q>the situation was adequately covered, and in the event of my death adequate insurance was going to be available to meet death duties, as these policies had been written under the Married Women's Property Act for the benefit of my four children. The news this morning that these are now aggregable in my estate has completely altered the position, and all my plans for the last forty years have gone in the last twenty-four hours. How I shall finally resolve this position I do not know, but my immediate reaction is to surrender all my life policies, and thereby reduce my estate, and go on a buying spree for the remainder of my life. There does not appear anything now that I can do that will avoid the necessity of selling the company shares to meet Death Duty liabilities. This company, in which I invested &#x00A3;500 in 1926, today has a market value of &#x00A3;1,750,000, but I feel almost a criminal for having done it. Certainly all enterprise and initiative have been finally knocked out of me, and I am sure there must be thousands more in industry who feel in exactly the same manner.</q>
Did the Chancellor realise that this would be the effect of the Clause? Does he seriously believe that by this fiddling little Amendment for the &#x00A3;25,000 exemption he is doing anything to resolve the case of those people who took out policies on the faith of the existing law and arrangements made by the life offices with the Inland Revenue? One can well understand the despair of professional advisers faced with this. I quote a letter


from another leading firm of insurance brokers:
<q>How can we or any professional insurance adviser give advice based on insurance law to any client when an act of this long standing can be changed by a few words from a socialist chancellor&#x2014;changed not only for future life policies, but for those too which may have been in effect for thirty or forty years? We can now no longer give advice on matters with confidence.</q>
One can well understand the writing of the leading tax commentator, Alun Davies, in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> on 14th May:
<q>Like the restriction of the marriage allowance to the period of marriage in the first fiscal year, the gesture on M.W.P.A. policies is a mean one, worthy only of a fiscal Scrooge.</q>
In Press article after Press article in the financial and quality newspapers, writers have been appalled at what the Government have done and certain that it could not go unamended. What have we got? We have an Amendment which makes the most marginal effect and does virtually nothing to help the tens of thousands of cases where people will be penalised to the extent of hundreds of thousands of &#x00A3;s. However, even the Government recognised that they could not defend the position where the exemption was to be for policies of a total value of &#x00A3;25,000, and with full aggregation if the policy came to &#x00A3;25,001. Therefore, we have this so-called marginal relief&#x2014;if that is the right word&#x2014;for the first &#x00A3;25,000.<br/>
But that is not what it means. This is where the Financial Secretary's instinct was right when he first introduced the Clause, but when he was put right by his advisers he had to tell us exactly what the Amendment meant. We had some bizarre scenes of confusion in the last moments before the Guillotine fell in Committee when the Financial Secretary announced this concession. It relates to the dutiable slice of the policy relating to the premiums paid in the last seven years.<br/>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
We now know what the Financial Secretary said was all wrong. The Revenue issued a statement, and the relief is now as it was spelt out in the Amendment &#x2014;to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West referred as the Mark II. This has produced results&#x2014;I

hope that the Chief Secretary appreciates this&#x2014;which are hardly less bizarre than those which would have occurred before. The formula involves bringing into the calculation the non-dutiable slice of the insurance policy. The relief is to be quantified by reference to property which is not subject to duty. Why confine oneself to the non-dutiable slice of insurance policies? Why not bring in all the gifts made beyond seven years ago? It is a weird way of quantifying any relief.<br/>
The position is complicated by the effect of the tapering provisions, and in my calculation I shall exclude them because they make it complicated to understand. The figures, therefore, are not strictly right, but I hope they will illustrate the point.<br/>
The bizarre effect of the Mark II concession is that the longer the policy has run the smaller is the slice which is non-aggregable. Let us assume that one has a policy worth &#x00A3;100,000 and that it has run for four years, and the whole of the policy money is dutiable and the first &#x00A3;25,000 is non-aggregable. But if it has run for 28 years only seven-twenty-eighths or one quarter is dutiable. Yet the slice which remains non-aggregable is reduced from &#x00A3;25,000 to a quarter of that, which is &#x00A3;6,200. I emphasise that I am ignoring the tapering provisions. When one comes to longer periods virtually the whole of the dutiable slice becomes aggregable and the benefit of non-aggregation is virtually valueless. It is a weird result. It would not have happened if the Mark I concession had been adopted. Our Amendment would restore the Mark I position. I believe that even now the Government must accept it.<br/>
We abhor this retrospective legislation. We believe that it is entirely wrong in this case and is doing a grave injustice to those who relied on the word of the Chancellor, the Treasury and the Government. This modest Amendment to the Chancellor's Amendment is one way in which the right hon. Gentleman can put right the grave wrong which has been done.</p>

<p>This is not only an odd Clause but an evil one. It was begotten in muddle and dishonour. I agree with the very strong condemnation that my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Patrick Jenkin) has just uttered against it.<br/>
One particularly odd characteristic of the handling in the Standing Committee, it seemed to me, was that the Financial Secretary, the meaning of whose words was almost entirely lost upon me, made an announcement which meant one thing and an explanation was issued the following day by Ministers' mentors, the Press officers at Somerset House, London, W.C.2, explaining what the Minister meant. I wonder whether the Chief Secretary to the Treasury would care to comment on this at some stage, or perhaps the Minister of State, who is to reply, would like to get up now and say whether it is normal for Ministers in the present Government to be corrected by Press officers at Somerset House. To my mind, it seems undesirable and wrong.<br/>
I endorse all the comments which my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford made about retrospection. To us it smacks of bad taste. I wonder whether the Ministers and their advisers have questioned themselves as to what are the likely long-term consequences of Government behaviour of this kind. My hon. Friend has produced two very telling examples of two people who made perfectly legitimate disposals of their assets to people who hoped to benefit out of this, and then, at the last minute in one case, the Government intervene callously, without thought, without knowledge of the grounds on which they are treading, and alter the whole basis on which those plans depended. I cannot believe that the Government have contemplated what the long-term effect of this sort of action will be on the confidence of the industry and individuals.<br/>
My hon. Friend has already referred to the question of the insurance industry's understanding with the Inland Revenue. We are told that the Inland Revenue had informed the industry that it might renege on its promise, that it did not mean what it appeared to mean. We are entitled to a much more adequate explanation than we are likely to have from present Treasury Ministers of this kind of conduct.<br/>
What importance are the life offices to attach to any future understanding they may have with the Inland Revenue? Is any such understanding, though reached in good faith on their part, and though they base their business plans on it, to be liable to reunciation on the whim of

Ministers, Ministers, moreover, who are not trusted and no longer command credit throughout the country?<br/>
When the decision was first announced in the Chancellor's Budget Speech, I singled it out as one of the more vicious things in a Budget that was intended to be vicious. Few of us will forget the Chancellor's peroration then, when he turned to gather the harvest of Left-wing cheers as he announced that he was really giving the cane to those who were not his political supporters.<br/>
Two of my constituents wrote to me about this. Neither is a very rich man. One happens to be a very distinguished public servant whose record of service to the State is far greater than anybody now on the Treasury Bench can claim. Yet at one time it looked as though the whole of his arrangements had been made worthless, and there was very little sympathy from the Government. The present proposal has helped these people slightly, but I assure the Minister of State&#x2014;I know not whether he cares&#x2014; that such people have a residue of deep resentment and distrust. They have made their arrangements, which have been undermined at the Government's whim and in disregard of a promise made by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue. What kind of integrity is that?<br/>
I have put down an Amendment, Amendment No. 277, proposing that instead of being &#x00A3;25,000 the figure should be &#x00A3;50,000. I do not see why the Government should not give way on this. We are deeply disappointed that they did not see fit to exempt all Married Women's Property Act policies entered into before the Budget. Then, whatever may be said about the breach of the understanding with the life offices, at least it would not have had retrospective effect.<br/>
I have been a Member of Parliament for about 17 years. On previous occasions when we had a Tory Government these little retrospective horrors were inserted in Finance Bills. Although the services of back-benchers to the State are not always noticed, there were on those occasions Members who were prepared to vote against their own party and not put up with that kind of conduct because they thought it dishonourable. Certainly on all those occasions when


such provisions were in any way offensive, the nasty, obnoxious content was removed from the Bill. But this time we have had no one on the Government side, no one on the Front Bench opposite, who has felt even the slightest reaction of disgust. One would not expect anything so strong as that, but there has not even been a slight twinge of unease. Yet the Government are playing ducks and drakes with relations between themselves and the public at a time when public confidence in our institutions is not very strong.<br/>
I have often wondered to what extent thought is given in the councils of the Inland Revenue to the relations between the tax-gathering authorities and the public I admit that they have an odious job, and for the most part they do it with great skill and fairness. I am sure that that is their objective, but I question whether that very desirable state of affairs can be expected to continue if Governments are encouraged or allowed by their advisers to perpetrate actions which many fair-minded, honourable people regard as dishonest.<br/>
What I have said was a fairly restrained version of the views widely held by those of my constituents who have fairly and legitimately made arrangements for the disposal of what they own. They have been affected by these arrangements for some years, as they are irrevocable so far as they are concerned, and the arrangements have now been seriously and to a large extent undermined There is not a note of apology from the Government, not a note of regret The Government lick their chops and look for cheap cheers. That is utterly disgusting. A plain appeal to the mob and to prejudice was what we had from the Chancellor at the end of his Budget speech.<br/>
This wanton inflicting of injustice, this contravention of the unwritten rules of fair play, is a discredit to Parliament and, if it is needed, a further measure in the great load of disgust which the Government deservedly bear on their shoulders.</p>

<p>I support what has been so eloquently said by my hon. Friends the Members for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Patrick Jenkin) and Yeovil (Mr. Peyton).<br/>
I wish to make three points. First, it was a serious mistake not to exempt all policies which were in existence before 20th March this year. Secondly, harm has been done to the relationships between the Revenue and the life officers. I do not know what goes on in other countries, but I believe that this type of relationship is valuable in our society. So complicated is life these days that without this sort of relationship we should often be in very serious trouble. In the long term, it is bad that doubt should be cast on this relationship. I do not say that there will be distrust overnight, but in future those concerned must be more wary than they were in the past. They cannot have the same confidence in future as they had in the past as a result of what has happened. Anyone with experience in these matters knows that the types of policy which we are discussing have always been tailored to meet the requirements of the Revenue. This has been a very important factor in preparing this type of policy. When it is done with friendly understanding, such actions should be honoured.<br/>
As drafted originally, there was no exemption from aggregation in the Bill. After the pressure which was applied, exemption in respect of the first &#x00A3;25,000 was granted. My complaint concerns the way in which it has been granted. We tabled an Amendment in Committee showing how we believed exemption from aggregation should be effected. The Financial Secretary, speaking <i>ad lib.,</i> gave his view of how it should be effected. The hon. Gentleman is regarded by all of us in this House, not as a fool, but as a shrewd and knowledgeable man in these matters. The significant thing is that both he and us came to the same natural conclusion as to how exemption from aggregation should be effected. Is it not extraordinary that hon. Members and people outside&#x2014;in fact, everybody except the members of the Treasury Bench other than the Financial Secretary &#x2014;should come to the same conclusion about the common sense way of exempting the first &#x00A3;25,000?<br/>
Apart from that being the logical way, in view of the size of the Amendment and the computations which have to be made in implementing the Treasury's method, there is not the slightest doubt that ours was not only the common sense and fair


way of proceeding, but also the simple way. This year, we have heard quite a bit about the hope for simplicity in future. I have no great faith in that hope, because this year more and more complications are being built in to our taxation system. One of the complications will be the method of working out this form of exemption.<br/>
I very much regret that the right hon. Gentleman will not accept an Amendment along the lines suggested by us. I am sure that everyone in industry and in the House believes that ours is a better and simpler method and that it should be adopted.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was not present during the earlier part of the debate. Amendment 87, which is in my name and that of one of my hon. Friends, concerns a restricted and limited point, namely, the non-aggregation of policies payable by reason of accidental death.<br/>
The Clause provides for the aggregation of all policies unless they were taken out before 20th March or possibly unless premiums are paid out of current income. It is, no doubt, contended that this is necessary, in the eyes of the Government, to avoid evasion of estate duty. But such an argument cannot apply to the type of policy covered by Amendment 87, because, by its definition, a policy payable for accidental death cannot be a policy taken out as part of an estate duty saving plan. No one can plan his Estate Duty affairs on the basis that he will die by accident. Therefore, exemption for accidental death policies comes into a different category.<br/>
I ask the Minister to consider the types of people affected. Take the man who has a small business worth perhaps &#x00A3;25,000, which the Financial Secretary said was a modest sum these days, and who, in order to protect his famiy from the grave consequences which might fall upon them if he should be killed and the business had to go under, takes out a life accident policy for a similar amount. Under the Bill, that would be aggregated with the value of his business and duty at the rate of 31 per cent. would be payable upon it.<br/>
Take the case of a man with a life interest amounting to a rather more substantial sum, &#x00A3;50,000, which does not,

under the terms upon which it was settled, pass to his family. He takes out an accident policy for, say, &#x00A3;30,000 of which &#x00A3;18,000 would go in estate duty if he should suffer a fatal accident.<br/>
Is this the way to encourage people to provide for their families? Is not a widow bereaved by an accident in which her husband has been struck down in the prime of life entitled to more consideration? Is the family tragedy to be treated as an opportunity for rich Treasury pickings? That is what will happen if accident policies are aggregated with all other policies.<br/>
Perhaps one of the worst features is that the form of aggregation suggested penalises the poor wife but not the rich wife. The wife with means of her own who can take out a policy on her husband's life from her own resources can avoid aggregation. The employee who is fortunate enough to be employed by a firm who takes out a policy against accidental death, the benefit of which would pass to the estate of the deceased employee or the widow or family of the deceased employee, would escape aggregation. But in the case of the wife with no means of her own, who is devoting her time to building up the home and is not going out to work to earn money and is unable to pay the premiums on a policy, the policy moneys payable in the event of her husband's accidental death are aggregated, with the consequences that follow.<br/>
I commend Amendment No. 87 to the House.</p>

<p>I think that my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South-West (Mr. Tom Boardman) has explained the case for this Amendment most admirably.<br/>
I would refer the Chief Secretary to several things which I consider could form precedents concerning the way that the State has already treated sums of compensation which become payable on death. Payments made under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, the Fatal Accidents Act, the Carriage By Air Act and the Industrial Injuries Act have never ranked for Estate Duty purposes. Therefore, we are asking here for something less than that. We are asking that there should be special treatment for moneys


coming into an estate flowing from death caused by accident.<br/>
Certain payments in the event of death under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act form part of the estate, but these are of a minor nature. Normally, they are for loss of expectation of life and for pain and suffering. Under the Fatal Accidents Act, which is the nearer precedent of all, because, by its nature there has to be death by accident, any damages awarded to the widow and children do not form part of the estate for Estate Duty purposes. I understand they are free from that charge. Where there is a private arrangement during the lifetime of the parties, we suggest that there should be some concession when it comes to Estate Duty. This has always been so under the Fatal Accidents Act. I do not think that we are asking for a great deal more when we ask the Chief Secretary to look at it in this light.<br/>
We on this side, throughout the Finance Bill, have in many ways tried to protect the positions of widows and children of men killed in their prime. My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, South-West has very cogently argued the need for this. Therefore, I hope that, even at this late stage, the right hon. Gentleman will consider whether something can be done.</p>

<p>I will deal with the last point first and come back to the main stream of argument which has been put forward from the Opposition.<br/>
The suggestion made by the hon. Member for Leicester, South-West (Mr. Tom Boardman) and the hon. Member for North Fylde (Mr. Clegg) is that there should be some exemption where there is a policy covering death by accident. I was not clear whether what was meant was the ordinary type of life policy where perhaps a fixed sum is payable in the event of death or an additional sum payable in the event of death by accident. I do not think that alters the situation, because I take it that the hon. Member for Leicester, South-West was concerned with cover against accident and an accident arising. The hon. Gentleman suggested that this does not form part of any tax avoidance device and, therefore, there should be no aggregation.<br/>
The hon. Member for North Fylde sought to support his hon. Friend the

Member for Leicester, South-West by reference to the Fatal Accidents Acts, claiming that here was an example of an exemption from aggregation. The hon. Gentleman is not on solid ground in making that statement. Here is a case where the Estate Duty does not apply, because it is not property passing at death. It does not therefore, come within the scope of Estate Duty.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for nodding his assent. It does not come within the scope of Estate Duty. Therefore, there is no question of exemption from aggregation. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman was helping his hon. Friend's argument.<br/>
The hon. Member for Leicester, South-West sought, in a way which did not persuade me in the slightest, to say that a widow whose husband met with a motor car accident is someone for whom one should have sorrow, pity and understanding, but that a woman who is bereaved because her husband has a heart attack and drops down dead in the middle of his life, leaving a young family, is to be treated differently. I do not share that view. Both instances are equally regrettable. In my view, one cannot distinguish between death by accident and death arising through natural causes. It is a most unfortunate happening if it occurs early in life and the widow is left with difficult responsibilities to carry. But there is no reason why one should pick out one class of widow, as the hon. Gentleman did, and say that she is to be distinguished from other widows. I do not share that view. Therefore, I cannot possibly recommend that the Amendment we are discussing&#x2014;I gather it has not been specifically moved, but we are discussing it&#x2014;is one which should meet with the approval of the House.<br/>
6.15 p.m.<br/>
I turn now to the main argument dealing with retrospection and breach of faith. I think these are the main points. There is also the argument that the concession which has been made is in some respects inadequate. It is never the case that a concession meets with wholehearted approval, but this concession, at the figure of &#x00A3;25,000, will inevitably go a long way to remove any question of real hardship.<br/>
I will deal, first, with the argument of lack of faith. The hon. Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Patrick Jenkin) referred to a letter from a firm of brokers denying that there was an absolutely, pellucidly clear understanding that the Government, in acknowledging the help they were Teceiving by the self-discipline that insurance companies were placing on themselves, were nevertheless retaining their complete freedom of action. The hon. Gentleman referred to a letter from brokers. This arrangement and this making clear of the Government's freedom of action by the Government's officials, as the hon. Gentleman can imagine, is likely to have been done in all cases. Officials are always extremely careful about these matters. This was made clear at a meeting with the life offices. The brokers were not present. The life offices have never challenged what we are now saying. Up to this moment, there has been no challenge that what we are saying is not absolutely right. Our records show this. We have checked to make absolutely sure. There is no question but that it was made absolutely clear that the Government were retaining their freedom of action, as every Government must.</p>

<p>I think it is important to get one thing clear. Nothing has ever appeared in print about this agreement. No Press hand-out has ever been made and no public statement has ever been issued. This understanding was perfectly properly reached behind closed doors&#x2014;I make no complaint about it&#x2014;between representatives of the Inland Revenue and representatives of the Life Offices Association. After an announcement in the Press that I was to be the Opposition spokesman responsible for the handling of Clause 33, I received many letters. I have read only one to the House from insurance brokers complaining that they regarded this Clause as in breach of the arrangement. They say they knew nothing about it. It was wrong of the Chancellor's Private Secretary to write to one of them and say that it had always been made clear. Therefore, I ask the question again: to whom does the Chief Secretary allege this has been made clear? The right hon. Gentleman has so far told us that it was made clear to the life offices. What about everybody else?</p>

<p>I am going further than alleging. I am affirming, after a recent review of the records so that memories alone are not to be relied upon, that the parties with whom the Government had discussions were left in no doubt that the Government retained their freedom of action. There is no argument after that to say that some insurance brokers, to whom this was no doubt a profitable business, in a perfectly proper way, are annoyed because that business has become somewhat limited. Of course they are likely to protest, and so is the Chairman of the International Fiscal Association, a body set up to keep down Income Tax, and in fact all taxes. That is the function of the organisation. I am saying that there is no breach of faith of the slightest kind by the Government. The Government entered into discussions and made their position clear, as I am sure every right hon. and hon. Gentleman realises anyone but the most thoughtless and irresponsible person would do. That deals with the argument whether &#x00A3;25,000 should be &#x00A3;50,000.</p>

<p>When Governments, with their mighty machines, give undertakings to a limited number of people, or reach an understanding with a limited number of people, they cannot be heard subsequently to say that their undertaking was limited to that small audience in that small room. It goes right through the community. The right hon. Gentleman said that brokers found this a profitable business. They legitimately relied on that understanding. That is the point.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-07-04a.1770.2" hansard_membership_id="3434" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30098" speakername="Mr. Diamond" colnum="1770" time="">
<p>The hon. Gentleman is putting far more than he is entitled to into what took place. In this respect, as in some others, the life assurance companies took the view that what was at &#x00A3;2,000 a head&#x2014;as it originally was under the Married Women's Property Act&#x2014;a reasonable matter to regard as a non-aggregable estate, had become a ramp, and it was no good for the business of the life offices that they were participating in a ramp. They co-operated because there is only one end to that kind of business. All that was said was that the Government recognised the position, but were free to act, as any Government must be, in the way they


thought right to protect the revenue and to raise revenue. There is no question whatsoever of any breach of faith, and there is no justification whatsoever for alleging that the &#x00A3;25,000 ought to have been at least &#x00A3;50,000.<br/>
I come, then, to the broader argument, that of retrospection. The argument here is that where we are dealing with Estate Duty which is duty collected on the net assets of a deceased person, and which always speaks as at the date of death, any arrangement entered into during the lifetime of an individual must be protected against any subsequent variation in Estate Duty law. That is an impossible proposition.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman ought to know that I have never advanced that proposition. I am sorry if he has not had a chance to read my speech in Committee on Clause 30. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was kind enough to approach me about it afterwards, as indeed was the Financial Secretary. That speech contained my full statement. Where there has been a long-settled, well-established practice, on the basis of which people have carried out their transactions and ordered their affairs, the matter should not be upset by retrospective legislation. That is the only proposition to which I have ever committed myself.</p>

<p>That is a limited form of it and I am grateful for the correction that the hon. Gentleman has given. I have explained why I am not as fully informed of all the details of the previous debates on this topic as I would wish to be. The argument which is generally put forward&#x2014;and the argument which lies behind the hon. Gentleman's assertion&#x2014; is that we are unable to alter the Estate Duty provisions with regard to any matter as to which for some time there has been an exception or a mitigation. That is something which, equally, we cannot accept.<br/>
In the earlier debate a reference was made to the action of the then Conserva-

tive Government in introducing a modest form of partial aggregation in this very field. It was justified up to the hilt by the Treasury Minister of the time. This is a situation which one is bound to refute. It cannot be the case that a sensible accountant or solicitor&#x2014;and I noticed with care that those who were either accountants or solicitors spoke with a good deal more moderation&#x2014;would dream of advising his client that what is an appropriate arrangement to make to alleviate the Estate Duty position at the present time is something which will continue, and will be reliable for all time until the client dies. Any accountant or solicitor who wrote to his client and said, "I advise you to do so-and-so. It will help you in Estate Duty matters now, and you can rest assured that however long you live it will be of benefit to your estate", would be liable for damages in an action for negligence, because would be acting irresponsibly, knowing, from the practice of the law, that alterations take place every year. In my experience the matter is always made especially clear to a client because Estate Duty provisions are of necessity long term.<br/>
Advising a client on company matters, on business matters, on commercial matters and on Income Tax matters means giving advice on current affairs, but Estate Duty matters, by the essence of the thing, are long-term, and the person giving advice always dwells on that. It is untrue to say that a professional adviser would not have regard to this situation. People expect the law to change from time to time with regard to Estate Duty, and it does so change. It changes quite frequently to give retrospective benefits. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not argue about that. It changes from time to time to alter the position with regard to deaths in the future, and has immediate effect. If we were to accept what the hon. Gentleman is proposing we would never be in a position to change the rates of Estate Duty while anybody living was still alive.</p>

<p>All that we are maintaining&#x2014;and I should have thought it was abundantly clear to anybody who wished to understand it&#x2014;is that there should not be alterations to the ground rules on which actions have been based. If a man makes a binding and final arrangement for the disposal of his assets, meaning that he no longer has any control over those assets, we say that it is wrong to engage in retrospection which affects that transaction.</p>

<p>I have listened carefully to what the hon. Gentleman has said. I can only repeat that the argument, basically, as I see it is: there being no distinction between a practice which has lasted for two years and a practice which has lasted for 10 or 15 years, it does not affect the fundamental principle, which is: are the Government entitled to alter the law concerning Estate Duty so as to have an effect on those at present living?</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment 280, in page 28, line 34, at the end:
<q>(7) Nothing in this section shall render aggregable any pension, annuity, lump sum, gratuity or other like benefit which is or may become payable in consequence of, or in connection with, the retirement, disability or death of any individual under&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) any enactment, or</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) any fund, scheme or contract, and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing words in particular&#x2014;</li>
<ol>
<li>(i) any fund or part of a fund approved under section 379 of the Income Tax Act, 1952;</li>
<li>(ii) any scheme approved under section 388 of the Income Tax Act, 1952; or</li>
<li>(iii) any contract approved under section 22 of the Finance Act, 1956.</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</q>
This is a very short Amendment which is designed to clarify the position. I hope that the Chief Secretary will be able to give a favourable answer to my question, in which case it will not be necessary to spend much time on it. It would be extremely difficult to devise a retirement benefit for the pensioner&#x2014;the man for whom the retirement benefit scheme was devised&#x2014;in a form in which it would become liable to Estate Duty. These are, for the most part, benefits which follow upon retirement, and to the extent that they give rise to any liability it is a liability for the dependants.<br/>
But there are circumstances in which it would be very unjust if the benefit of non-aggregation were lost. This is in circumstances in which a man is entitled to a pension on his retirement but exchanges that right for the right to a pension of a lesser amount during his life, followed by a separate pension for his widow from his death and during her life. This would be a gift and would give rise to a passing under the Finance Act, 1894, in Section 2(1)(<i>c</i>). Under that legislation, if the husband did not survive the seven-year period from the making of the gift there would be no doubt that the


pension would have escaped aggregation if the value of the rights was less than &#x00A3;5,000&#x2014;and if it was less than &#x00A3;5,000 it would not be dutiable.<br/>
Under the Bill, however, it seems that there might be a charge under Section 2(1)(<i>d</i>) of that Act as an interest purchased or provided and the prevailing charge would, under Section 33(3), have to be brought in. Under Section 2(l)(<i>c</i>) the Bill creates a risk that that sort of benefit would be liable to aggregation. This is a benefit which would arise indirectly under a retirement benefit scheme &#x2014;under any statutory superannuation scheme or any Section 379 retirement pension or a Section 388 retirement benefit scheme. It could also arise under Section 22 of the Finance Act, 1956, which we were discussing earlier. Under any of those schemes it would be open to a man who retired to surrender part of his pension in return for a lower pension for himself and then, on his death, a pension for his widow for the rest of her life.<br/>
Is it really the intention that in those cases the benefit arising should be aggregated with the rest of the estate, or can the Chief Secretary assure us that there will be no question of aggregation in those few cases where the policy would be dutiable? If he can give the assurance for which I have asked we need not delay too long over the Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-07-04a.1775.0" hansard_membership_id="3434" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30098" speakername="Mr. Diamond" colnum="1775" time="">
<p>I think I can give the hon. Member the assurance that he desires. It is not always easy to give an assurance on the basis of a speech that has been made, because the speech sometimes goes further than the Amendment on which the speech is based. I limit my assurance by saying that I assume that the hon. Member was not talking about ordinary insurance policies and was not seeking an assurance about them. I assume that he was talking as though the Amendment did not include them. It is possible to read the Amendment in that way. I feel sure that he was not intending otherwise, and I am therefore saying that I am not giving an assurance with regard to that part of the Amendment which might refer to insurance policies.<br/>
With regard to the rest of the Amendment, I can put the position shortly by saying that it is the Government's view

that there is no need for the Amendment in relation to approved superannuation or other death, disability or retirement benefits because they do not come under aggregation in any event.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked whether, as there was no liability under Section 2(l)(<i>d</i>) but there might be under Section 2(l)(<i>c</i>), I could help him. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Then I misheard what he said. I can confirm that it is not under subsection (l)(<i>c</i>) and that if there is any liability it is under paragraph (<i>d</i>), which charges annuities or other interests purchased or provided by the deceased to the extent of a beneficial interest arising on death. I assume that the Amendment is based on the view that part of the superannuation contributions could be regarded as laid out in order to make a gift to the beneficiary.<br/>
This is not so. Therefore, the main part of the Amendment&#x2014;that is, the part designed to protect benefits under approved superannuation schemes and schemes for the self-employed&#x2014;is superfluous.</p>

<p>I beg to move Amendment 284, in page 28, line 34, at end add:
<q>(7) Where the relevant gift or disposition occurred before 20th March, 1968, no person shall in consequence of this section be liable for any estate duty merely as a trustee or former trustee of a settlement or a trustee, guardian, committee, or other person in whom any interest in property passing or the management thereof is at any time vested, in excess of the estate duty which would have been payable by him if this section had not been enacted.</q>
This Amendment also has been tabled to give the Treasury an opportunity to make it entirely clear that trustees will not be made personally liable for any increase in estate duty liability which may arise by virtue of the Clause in circumstances in which they may have distributed property or otherwise disposed of


assets before the change comes into effect. This was raised in Committee in connection with Clause 30, under which, again, trustees could have become personally liable for an amount higher than they would have retained to meet estate duty liability.<br/>
The Financial Secretary said on 29th May:
<q>When a trustee, relying on the five-year gift period, has insured on that basis and therefore, not unreasonably has released the funds, it would be very hard if he were to be called on personally to make good any shortfall in the duty. I certainly undertake that in such cases the Revenue will rely exclusively upon its concurrent right to proceed against the beneficiary. I do not know whether that would be sufficient for the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;"&#x2014;</q>
at which point I am reported as intervening to say, "Yes", and the Financial Secretary went on:
<q>&#x2014;or whether he feels it ought to be incorporated in legislation. However, I can assure him that in a case of that kind the Revenue would exclusively rely upon its right against the beneficiary."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A;</i> 29th May, 1968, c. 1755.]</q>
I am sure that the Chief Secretary appreciates that exactly the same or a similar situation arises under this Clause, for instance, where a Married Women's Property Act or other trust policy has matured or been surrendered before the Budget, but the life assured dies after the Budget, having paid the premiums in the seven years before the death. In such cases, there may be premiums payable on his death for which the trustees would be accountable and although they may have kept sufficient money to pay the duty on a non-aggregable basis, they would not have had the foresight of a Hebrew prophet, which is what would be necessary, to retain sufficient duty to pay the difference between the non-aggregable and the aggregable duty.<br/>
Clearly, no personal blame could attach to trustees in these circumstances, so I hope that exactly the same assurance can be given in the case of a possible liability under Clause 33 as was given by the Financial Secretary in Committee about the potential liability under Clause 30. If the right hon. Gentleman can give that assurance, once again, I do not think that we need waste much time with this Amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. Member referred to a matter which was discussed

earlier and which relates to the responsibility of trustees arising from the new charge which we are discussing. In the normal course, there is no problem at all. That is to say, where the trustee knows the position before he disposes of the realisation of the policy, he is under the normal responsibilities and no special care need be taken. What the hon. Gentleman is referring to is a special difficulty which may arise when the policy has matured or been surrendered before Budget day, the policy moneys have been disposed of by the trustee and this difficulty now arises.<br/>
I am advised that, in effect, where the gift was a transaction entirely completed before the Budget, the trustees ought not to be required to account for tax, that they have, in these circumstances, acted reasonably in parting with the funds. We have had representations on this from other interests, and the Chancellor accepts that there is a case for relief for trustees in these circumstances. That is to say, when a policy matured or was surrendered before Budget day, an exception from the new rules of aggregation for such policies is provided. Therefore, there is no problem with regard to that matter.</p>

<p>It has, obviously, occurred to me that the substance of any complaint may have been removed by Amendment 132, which we discussed earlier, in that aggregation was not to apply in the case of surrenders or where policies had matured.

<p>I am obliged.<br/>
I should perhaps begin by apologising for inflicting myself on the House again in a discussion on the Finance Bill. I am sure that the House had looked forward with the same relief that I had to the prospect of my not taking part in these debates again.<br/>
The first of these Amendments, No. 73, is the substantive one and is designed to meet the point of an Opposition Amendment in the names of the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton), the right hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann) and others in Committee, which was not reached. It substitutes a new subsection (3) for the present one in Clause 35. The effect of the alteration, if the House should approve it, is to give a right of election in all cases, that is to say, election whether to be assessed on the existing basis or on the new one.<br/>
Mineral leases are at present dealt with, for levy purposes, substantially the same as other leases. Therefore, subject to certain deductions in respect of base value, levy is, broadly speaking, assessed on the capital value of the lease at the time that it was granted, the capital value, that is, of the right to receive the rent or royalties. Because of the nature of mining leases and the royalties, it is seldom possible to quantify accurately in advance that value, and it has to be estimated. This has led to considerable complaints and to very few, if any, mining leases being granted. That was the reason for the provisions of Clause 35.<br/>
The serious objections from the landowner's point of view were, first, that he was charged by reference to an estimate of future royalties, second, that that estimate might be found to be materially excessive, and, third, that there was no provision for adjusting the levy by reference to the actual royalty income.<br/>
Second, the levy is assessed as a capital sum and ordinarily becomes payable shortly after the granting of the lease, whereas royalties may not begin to come in until some years later. Again, owing to the nature of mining leases, it is not possible for the grantor to meet this by taking a premium at the outset of the lease. There was a further difficulty where the grantor was a Surtax payer in that, whereas for levy purposes his liability to Income Tax would indirectly be taken into account, his liability to Surtax would not.<br/>
For those reasons, we introduced the Clause providing the new basis of assessment under which the levy would be chargeable from time to time on the royalties received or receivable under the lease. We thought it right to provide for an election in the case of leases which were granted before April this year so as to avoid any element of retrospective legislation. We gave people the choice, if they wanted it, to remain on the existing basis rather than be assessed on the new basis.<br/>
We did not provide any right of election in respect of leases granted after April this year for the simple reason that we thought, for the reasons which I have given, that it would always be to the benefit and advantage of the levy payer to be assessed on the new basis. But it


has been represented to us that there may be occasions when, in the case of future leases, people would prefer to be assessed and to pay their levy on the capital basis at the outset. We see no objection if that is the way they prefer to have it. The Amendment will accordingly give the right of election always in those cases.<br/>
Under this Amendment, unlike the Opposition's Amendment, we propose that the matter should be dealt with by regulations, but we make it mandatory by the Amendment that the regulations shall provide for a right of election. Perhaps I ought to give the House an indication of what we have in mind by way of provisions in the regulations.<br/>
The election would have to be irrevocable and would have to be made at the time of, or shortly after, the assessment of levy was sent to the person liable, which would normally be in the period of two months allowed for objecting to an assessment and serving a counter-notice. The assessment would in either case contain enough information to enable the levy payer to decide which was the more favourable basis for him. We should achieve that by seeing that it contained information about the amount which the Commission considered to be the capital value of the lease, the amount which appeared to the Commission to be the base value realised by the disposition, the amount appearing to the Commission to be the amount of any expenditure on improvements and ancillary rights allowed for in calculating the amount of the levy, and, finally, the amount appearing to the Commission to be the levy which would be charged on the net development value realised by the disposition if levy were to be charged on it at the prescribed rate.<br/>
One would then go on to state the percentage appearing to the Commission to be the effective rate in respect of the disposition, with a statement that the levy would be charged on royalties at the effective rate unless the levy payer within the two months to which I have referred exercised his election to pay it as a lump sum, that is to say, the principal amount of the levy. That notice would be subject to a counter-notice by the levy payer.</p>

Our discussion, alas, will not be as great as we had wished, but, in the few minutes remaining, I hope to make sufficient points to convince the Government that our Amendment is acceptable.<br/>
The Chancellor described the reason for the special charge in these words on Second Reading:
<q>The burden on those who can supplement their incomes out of capital is relatively less severe, and it is equitable that they should be called upon to make some additional contribution."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 24th April, 1968; Vol. 763, c. 265.]</q>

<p>I beg the hon. Gentleman's pardon. I failed to say exactly when I ceased to quote, but, if he refers to the paragraph, he will see the point.<br/>
Clearly, the Chancellor's logic was tailored to fit the proposals which he made in the Budget. In my view, the special charge cannot be reconciled with


the overwhelming need of the country to encourage initiative and enterprise and the need for greater and greater investment by the people. The reasons for the tax are two. In the short term, sweeteners had to be handed out. In other words, this is a "cookie for the Kremlin", a sop to the Left wing. Even in Committee, the reactions of certain hon. Members made all too clear that that was one of the reasons. In the long term, throughout the period of the present Government, it has become more and more apparent that they are completely lacking in control of their own expenditure, and this is the second reason why additional money is needed.<br/>
We are now seeing more and more differences between earned income and investment income. Whatever arguments there may be for such differences, they are not valid in relation to people reaching the age of retirement, and it is to this that our Amendment is directed. We consider that the method by which a person prepares for his retirement, either by savings or by way of pension rights, is and should be a matter for his own judgment and not a matter which our taxation laws should inhibit.<br/>
If a person, when he retires, has, for example, an investment income of &#x00A3;3,000, apparently that is all right and his income is not subject to a special charge. If he has a pension of &#x00A3;5,000 a year he will have no Surtax to pay on &#x00A3;3,000 of it and he will have no special charge. If, however, he has had to save to provide such an income for his retirement, the additional income comes to him as investment income on the savings which he has made and he has to pay &#x00A3;1,150 special charge and, in addition, about &#x00A3;1,000 additional Surtax. We regard that as wrong. Those who are retired should be exempt from the special charge.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
This brings us to the last stage of what has inevitably been a controversial Finance Bill. It has been so, I think, for two reasons. First, it has raised a great deal, an almost unprecedented amount, of additional revenue. Second, the Committee stage for the first time has been taken upstairs, and as a result there has been a lot of complaint from hon. and right hon. Members opposite that they have not had adequate time or an adequate audience to whom to deploy their arguments. There may have been inadequacy of deployment, I do not know, but that has not been due to lack of time.<br/>
In Committee we spent 118 hours 45 minutes net of meal breaks&#x2014;more time than on any Finance Bill, save that of 1965, for 40 years&#x2014;and since we have spent 39 hours on the Floor of the House on Recommittal and Report, longer than on any Finance Bill since the end of the war. If parts of the Bill have not been discussed, this I think has been by the choice of hon. Members opposite. Other parts have been discussed and re-discussed almost <i>ad nauseam.</i> So far as the adequacy of the audience was concerned, I could not help noticing that on most occasions more hon. Members were present in the Committee than were present on the Floor of the House.<br/>
I thought that some of the debates upstairs, particularly after the Guillotine, when we had given up discussing whether the windows should be opened or how long the dinner break should be, were of

a higher standard and reached more across party lines than those on the Floor. I do not, however, think that we arrived at the ideal arrangement this year. Largely this was because many hon. Members opposite were determined not to give the new scheme a fair trial, but I think there were other faults too. In particular I am sceptical whether the two and a half days of Recommittal&#x2014;in effect another canter round the same course mostly by the same horses&#x2014;proved worth while. I am more attracted by the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Chapman)&#x2014;and I believe that the right hon. and learned Member for Wirral (Mr. Selwyn Lloyd) made a similar suggestion in the past&#x2014;that we should continue to take the more technical Amendments upstairs, but that the wider issues of some general interest&#x2014;the standard rate of Income Tax, the regulator Clause, and this year the aggregation of income principle, the main Purchase Tax changes, and Vehicle Excise Duty&#x2014;these are obvious examples&#x2014;should be taken downstairs. But that would require agreement. I hope it will be forthcoming.<br/>
I turn from how we have dealt with the Bill to its contents and its purpose. First on the contents. The object of the Bill has been to raise a very large sum of additional revenue in as fair a way as possible without impairing incentive.<br/>
The balance of the measures has, I believe, stood up reasonably well to many weeks of searching criticism. On the scope of the measures, I must confess that the attitude of the Opposition causes me some confusion. Hon. and right hon. Members opposite claim concern about the high level of consumption, although their concern, as I shall indicate later, is not, I believe, in accord with the facts. Yet the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod), when I pressed him in Committee, said that he inclined to the view that I have done too much in the Budget. They also argued &#x2014;and it is now well-worn argument on both sides&#x2014;that I should have used the regulator before the Budget; yet in Committee and on Report the Opposition spoke and voted against almost every Finance Bill proposal which marched alongside what the regulator would have done. So I do not detect much consistency here.<br/>
Inevitably, in the circumstances of this Finance Bill, we have had to be very sparing in concessions in getting the Bill through its various stages, and my right hon. and hon. Friends in the Treasury, who have borne the heat and burden, not of the day but of many days and some nights, have had to give a somewhat stony-hearted impression, far removed from their true natures. But we have made a number of concessions, including a very substantial addition to the parts of Scotland in which hotels are exempt from S.E.T.<br/>
I come to the Bill as a whole, and to its main purpose. This is to give effect to the broad economic strategy of modifying the pattern of economic demand and activity so as to enable us to take full advantage of devaluation and establish a substantial and continuing balance of payments surplus. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary began that process with the measures taken last November; the January measures to restrain the growth of public expenditure followed, and the Budget concluded the process, with massive measures to restrain private spending and notably consumer expenditure. This was by any standards a formidable&#x2014;indeed, an unprecedented &#x2014;combination of measures, bound in due course to produce a significant and beneficial structural change in the economy.<br/>
There has recently been expressed in some quarters some impatience in case the measures may not be working as we expected. One of the lessons we should all have learned from experience of the post-war period, and perhaps before that, is that it takes a considerable time for fiscal measures to work through and for their effects to show up in the statistical indicators. Decisions in the field of public expenditure, in particular, take a long time to affect activity unless they are of the brutal and totally uneconomic kind that stops in its tracks work already started.<br/>
But budgetary measures also take some time to work through, and the measures which I announced on 19th March&#x2014;still only 15 weeks ago&#x2014;are no exception. Even those that took immediate effect on Budget Day would only begin to be reflected in the indicators after several weeks, and some&#x2014;notably the increase

in S.E.T.&#x2014;have still to come into operation. The effects of the Budget measures are thus only now beginning to be apparent, and their impact can be expected to grow in the weeks and months to come. The same thing applies to the intensification of credit restrictions which were announced at the end of May. As the banks themselves made clear, and as I recognised at the time, they needed time to review overdraft limits and bring down outstanding advances. This could not be done in a few days.<br/>
Where then do we now stand in relation to the forecasts that I gave to the House at the time of the Budget? Hon. Members opposite now like to believe that those forecasts have all gone wrong. They also like to combine deep scepticism about all forecasts with pressing me at every Question Time not merely to rest on publishing more than any Chancellor has even done before but to publish a new forecast each month.<br/>
I take a more moderate view on both counts. But I can assure the House that on the domestic front we are broadly where we expected to be. Our latest figures suggest that consumer spending at the end of 1967 was, in fact, at a slightly higher level than we believed at the time of the Budget, but the signs are that it is coming down very much as we expected. The seasonally adjusted index of retail sales fell from 106 in the first quarter of 1968 to 102 in April and to 100 in May. Differences in the timing of the Spring Holiday in different years make the seasonal adjustment a little uncertain, but it seems reasonable to deduce that the volume of retail trade is now running at a level not very different from that in the first half of 1967, before consumers' expenditure began to expand through the second half of that year.<br/>
Instalment credit debt fell by &#x00A3;9 million in April and by &#x00A3;6 million in May, compared with the rise of &#x00A3;31 million in the first quarter. New credit advanced by finance houses in April and May was well down on the level for the first quarter. The available evidence suggests that new registrations of private cars are running at a much lower rate than in the first quarter, and well below the average for last year. On consumer spending, therefore, the measures have begun to bite, and the effects are beginning to show up in the indicators.


These effects should become more pronounced in the coming months as we adjust to a new level of consumer spending.<br/>
Public expenditure this year is running very close to the figures given in the January White Paper. I am keeping it closely under review, so that any corrective action which may be necessary at the margin can be taken.<br/>
We are also at least fully up to forecast with our exports. Allowing for the diminishing importance of shipments delayed by last year's strikes in the docks, the trend of exports is clearly upwards. The export order position is also encouraging: large increases in the shipbuilding and textile industries, an increase in the engineering industry, and car production for export during the three months March to May nearly two-thirds higher than in the second half of last year. The latest C.B.I. survey shows a continuing and high degree of optimism throughout export industries.<br/>
It is only in the field of imports that progress has been disappointingly slow. The June figures will not be available until next week, and in any case it is always dangerous to deduce trends from figures for a single month. But the level of imports in April and May, though a little better than the peak levels of February and March, was still a good deal higher than we allowed for in the forecasts on which the Budget was based. The visible trade deficit has thus been continuing at a high level.<br/>
We can, however, look forward with reasonable confidence to a considerably better result on the balance of payments on combined current and long-term capital account in the second quarter of 1968 than in the first, despite the high visible trade deficits for April and May. Net receipts from invisibles are keeping up reasonably well, and the long-term capital account for the second quarter will have nothing corresponding to the Shell rights issue that dominated the first quarter's figures. In addition, we may see some reduction in the outflow for portfolio investment.<br/>
The date at which we pass into balance of payments surplus must depend largely upon what happens to the visible trade balance. However, I shall not give any

forecast on that tonight. Indeed, it would be idle to do so without a clearer understanding than we can as yet have of the reasons for the continuing high level of imports, for which there is no simple or straightforward explanation, in relation to the movements of the main components of domestic demand. The recently announced French trade measures certainly will not make our task any easier, although their direct effect on us can be exaggerated: France provides under 5 per cent. of our total overseas market.<br/>
As the effects of the Budget and of the intensified credit restrictions work through, imports should fall back from the recent level, and the combination of that with the growth of exports should lead to a steady improvement in the trade balance during the remaining months of this year. This is what I expect to see.<br/>
I do not in any way under-rate the magnitude of the burdens that this Bill imposes, nor the difficulties of asking for the degree of restraint on spending and on incomes that the strategy demands. But I am clear that the strategy itself is right and necessary, and I give notice that the Government intend to continue the policies that are necessary for the attainment of the objectives at which the strategy is directed. It involves the cooperation and understanding of all of us, inside and outside the House, and the realisation that failure to adhere to the strategy would mean something a good deal more unpalatable than this Bill and the two years hard slog that I predicted a few months ago.<br/>
It would be interesting to know what easier alternative the Opposition have to offer. The right hon. Member for Bexley (Mr. Heath) has been making a few much-heralded, but sparsely reported, speeches on the economic situation recently. He expanded his views, this time without any lack of space, in the <i>Sunday Times</i> last weekend. But he was even thinner about specific proposals than his right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West has been throughout the stages of the Bill. I wish to say nothing more about the right hon. Member for Bexley, although I would like to say something more about his recent speeches on a later occasion.<br/>
I sum up by saying that the Bill gives effect to the Government's strategy, as


described in my Budget speech, as a way of distributing additional burdens equitably among the various categories of taxes and taxpayers. It also effects some significant, but not this year major, improvements in the efficiency and equity of the tax system. It has, I think, stood the test of scrutiny in the House and it is therefore with confidence that I commend it to the House.</p>

<p>We have been asked to accept the Motion that the Bill be read the Third time. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will join me in the Division Lobby in opposing the Motion.<br/>
On Third reading we are concerned with what is in the Bill. It contains 57 Clauses and 20 Schedules. It is right to stress the fact that some of these have been debated under unprecedented conditions. The Committee stage was taken upstairs, and while I do not intend on this occasion to expand on the arguments against this course&#x2014;they were admirably adduced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) in a recent article in <i>The Times</i> &#x2014;two points should be made.<br/>
The first is that by taking the Committee stage upstairs the debates lacked tempo. [HON. MEMBERS: "NO."] I say that because we were in a congested atmosphere, which meant that there could not be the same distinction, because of the atmosphere, between debates on important topics and those which were concerned with relatively minor matters. This distinction tended to be blurred, which meant that a great deal more time was necessarily taken. This would not have occurred with the emphasis that more important matters get when they are debated on the Floor of the House.<br/>
The Chancellor said that the attendance in the House had been smaller than the attendance in Committee upstairs. I do not accept that, and I dispute his comment as one who has spent a considerable amount of time taking part in the various debates on the Bill. In any event, it would not be surprising if what he said were so, after the Committee stage had been taken upstairs. Certainly it would not be surprising on the Recommittal stage, which all must consider to have been completely abortive, since it was

not clear whether we would debate the major issues which many hon. Members were deprived from debating in Committee upstairs since they were not members of the Committee. We were, therefore, left at that stage with the crumbs which fell from the Committee's table. It is not surprising, therefore, if there was not as large an attendance in the House as one would normally expect.<br/>
Linked to this must be our consideration of hon. Members with constituency interests who would normally have put those interests forward in Committee and would then, if they felt that they had received a sympathetic reply or that they could make further progress, have pursued the matter as a natural sequence of events. It is not surprising, therefore, that on Report it was found difficult to get a reasonable debate going on some of the Clauses.</p>

<p>There is obviously a wide difference of opinion developing about the value of taking the Committee stage of the Finance Bill upstairs. Would not the hon. Gentleman agree that had the Bill been timetabled from the beginning all issues could have been discussed, including the special levy? I suggest that the debates which we had on many subjects were outstanding in quality and that it would have been to the benefit of the whole discussion had a different approach been taken. I therefore do not accept the hon. Gentleman's point of view on this matter.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-07-04a.1794.1" hansard_membership_id="6067" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31177" speakername="Mr. Higgins" colnum="1794" time="">
<p>I cannot accept the hon. Gentleman's statement, because when the timetable came into being it was subdivided and the Guillotine fell immediately, with the result that the special charge was not debated. It often happens that when a matter is discussed one finds a flaw in the Bill which should be pursued. That cannot be done if a Measure is divided up in the way the hon. Gentleman has suggested.<br/>
It is, in any event, unfortunate that we did not have an opportunity to debate the special charge. I prepared three different speeches on that subject and I finally reached the point of feeling that I was taking part in an athletic race with a number of false starts. Eventually, there having been three false starts, I got shot in the back by the starter at the last minute. It is unfortunate that complex


matters which need to be discussed cannot be discussed because of the procedure that is adopted. That happened on this occasion and many matters were not fully discussed. On the other hand, because of the procedure adopted this year, we went over earlier parts of the Bill on a number of occasions. While they were important, other matters were not adequately discussed.<br/>
This is largely the same Bill as we were discussing on Second Reading. There have been some minor Purchase Tax changes relating to calendars and an important change, as the result of pressure brought to bear by my right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West, about the aggregation of minors' incomes and a concession concerning thalidomide babies. Other minor concessions have been made &#x2014;about interest earned abroad and the matter which we were discussing a short while ago, the &#x00A3;25,000 limit&#x2014;but, by and large, it is the same Bill as we were discussing on Second Reading.<br/>
It is necessary, therefore, to deal with some of the points that were made at that stage. It was implicit in some of the Chancellor's remarks that the Conservative Party would have had to do the same and that this is virtually a Conservative Finance Bill. This is not true.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Gentleman is not crediting me with saying that either on Second Reading or on this Motion. I did not use those words, and I do not believe that what he said is the case.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1968-07-04a.1795.1" hansard_membership_id="6067" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31177" speakername="Mr. Higgins" colnum="1795" time="">
<p>I take the right hon. Gentleman's point and I assure him that I do not wish to embarrass him unduly. When he spoke about the relationship between direct and indirect taxation he created that impression, but I accept that it was, perhaps, erroneously created.<br/>
We are told that this is the toughest Finance Bill ever. It is designed to raise &#x00A3;923 million. It should be stressed that this has come about as the result of the disastrous mismanagement of the economy, culminating in the devaluation of last year. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I appreciate that hon. Gentlemen opposite may not like listening to this. If one looks at what was said in the Third Reading debate on the Finance Act, 1967, one sees that the then Chancellor said:

<q>The economy is moving along the course that I had in mind when I made my Budget speech.</q>
Later he said:
<q>If that is exuberance, heaven help me when I really throw my bonnet over the windmill. I promise the House that there really will be something to talk about then. This is the course we embarked upon. This is the course we intend to stick to. I see nothing to make me depart from what I said earlier, namely, that a 3 per cent. growth rate can be combined with a balance of payments surplus &#x2026;".&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 30th June, 1967; Vol. 749, c. 1142.]</q>
We should be given an explanation because the Bill stems directly from the mismanagement of the former Chancellor last year. The mistiming of economic measures has been the hallmark of the Labour Party since they took office in October, 1964, through every summer period since that date.<br/>
One reason why last year was so disastrous was because we did not have published forecasts which, had they been made available and had the Chancellor's assumptions been spelt out, would have enabled us to explain what might have been done in time. Public opinion would have built up by that means. I gladly agree with the present Chancellor that it is a great advance that forecasts have been published this year. That has been of great assistance and has enabled us to have more sensible debates about our economic situation. I would very much hope that nothing which has been said will in any way deter him or future Chancellors from continuing to publish forecasts, and, I hope, to publish them in more detail.<br/>
We are sceptical about forecasts, as I am sure that the Chancellor is. However, it means that we have an explicit statement tying up the various aspects of the figures, which is a great advantage. Therefore, although it is not easy to relate the day-to-day figures to those in the forecasts, because largely they are on different definitions, we are able to appraise the Bill this evening in the light of a sensibly stated set of forecasts. Even though we may have grave doubts as to whether the forecasts will turn out to be right, none the less the fact that they are set out is, I believe, a great advance in our Parliamentary procedures.<br/>
I want to ask two questions on this which are directly related to the Clauses.


The Chancellor of the Exchequer will know that the forecasts do not include any allowance for price or cost changes. He has been very reluctant indeed to say what allowance he has made in putting forward the Bill and its various Clauses with regard to incomes policy. Yet at the end of last week in a debate on prices and incomes the figures which we have been searching for so much and which the Chancellor has been so reluctant to give, came out when the Under-Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity said, regarding the incomes policy:
<q>&#x2026; I insist &#x2026; that the minimum aim is not insignificant. Its outcome will, perhaps, be a reduction of effective demand of about &#x00A3;200 million."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 27th June, 1968; Vol. 767, c. 895.]</q>
If that is so, and if that is the basis on which the Bill has been constructed, it is right and proper that whoever is to reply to the debate should tell us whether the Bill is put forward on the assumption that the prices and incomes policy would reduce he aggregate demand for &#x00A3;200 million or whether it has not been put forward on that basis, because this is a very important point indeed and it should be clarified.<br/>
The other point upon which the Chancellor himself touched in putting the Bill and its contents in context was the whole question of what is happening to exports and imports and the level of unemployment. In this context, we certainly share the view that there is some tendency for exports to be rising; and we are glad about that. However, we have some doubts about the import position, because in his Budget statement the Chancellor said this:
<q>&#x2026; higher import prices in sterling... will tend to increase the import bill, as we have seen from the January and February trade figures But the price rise relative to home production should encourage import substitution, offsetting the rise in the volume of imports that would normally have accompanied rising demand and output; this should lead to a much reduced growth of imports in the coming months."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th March, 1968; Vol. 761, c. 256.]</q>
We are glad that the Chancellor this evening has agreed that the import performance has been disappointing, because I am sure that it is much better than the Chancellor, if events are changing as we progress through time, should say so frankly, rather than feel obliged from day to day to adhere to the view which

he originally took. This is surely the more sophisticated and more sensible way of tackling it than to say, "We must stick to our forecasts and it is a shame to attack them".<br/>
We appreciate that, as things develop, this is likely to change. Some of the expectations&#x2014;for example, that of the Financial Secretary, who said on 24th April
<q>&#x2026; we shall see a declining level of unemployment over the months ahead,"&#x2014; [OFFICIAL REPORT, 24th April, 1968; Vol. 763, c. 404.]</q>
seem scarcely to have been vindicated.<br/>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the article of my right hon Friend the Leader of the Opposition which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> I want to quote one passage. My right hon. Friend was asked this:
<q>Do you think that raising the question in the way which you have done"&#x2014;</q>
that is, about the economy&#x2014;
<q>may itself tend to erode confidence &#x2026;?</q>
My right hon. Friend said this:
<q>No &#x2026; Of course all these facts are widely known in Europe and North America and are openly discussed daily. It is not the discussion of these facts which can cause damage to the national position. It is the failure to face up to the facts which causes anxiety to our friends overseas.</q>
It surely is the case that we should be failing in our duty as an Opposition if we did not look at the facts as they are produced and comment in a sensible and rational way upon them. It is the idea that it is wrong to discuss the facts which jeopardises the Government's measures, rather than anything else.<br/>
I turn now to the more detailed side of the Bill. We are certainly in a difficulty here, because, although there are lots of analogies of devaluations which were followed by no deflation and of devaluations which were followed immediately by deflation, there are very few devaluations which were followed by a delayed deflation, because normally no Government are so stupid as to adopt that course.<br/>
The point which I want to make here, because it did not seem to come out at all in what the Chancellor was saying is that it is not merely that the Government did not take action soon enough by using the regulator, and so on. The fact that the spending spree took place


means that it will be followed by a restocking spree. Therefore, the effect of the delay will last, not for three months, perhaps, but for six or seven months as regards the effect on aggregate demand.<br/>
We do not accept the Chancellor's argument that, although we said that he should use the regulator, we voted against those parts of the Purchase Tax in the Budget which were concerned with it. We were debating there, first, the increase in the number of Purchase Tax rates&#x2014;the wider spread; the increased anomalies; the fact that the luxury rate at 50 per cent. had been introduced. Clearly, the only way in which we could reasonably debate this was by tabling Amendments to reduce the rates. This in no way contradicts, as the Chancellor sought to suggest tonight, our belief that action should have been taken further.<br/>
I want to return to the point which the Chancellor made just now about this not being a Conservative Budget. I am glad that he confirmed that, because I certainly do not regard it as such; and I shall spell out precisely why. In doing so, I hope that I shall make some of the alternative proposals which the Chancellor said he would like to hear. The first point which needs to be made is that the Chancellor says that he is in favour of a change from direct to indirect taxation. So are we. This is a generally accepted view. I think that it is generally accepted that a move from direct to indirect taxation is a move in the right direction&#x2014; [HON. MEMBERS: "Not by everybody."] &#x2014;with the exception of the Left wing of the Labour Party.<br/>
What the Chancellor has done is to increase indirect taxation without reducing direct taxation. We believe that he has been wrong, first, in changing indirect taxation in the way he has&#x2014;because of the anomalies which have been created, the broadening of the rate, and so on. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West has pointed out, we believe that the logic of the situation leads us more towards a broadly based, low-rate, value-added tax, rather than this.<br/>
Secondly, it is a basic principle of the Government that they are always concerned with the immediate revenue, without looking further forward. For ex-

ample, on the question of putting 2&#x00BD; per cent. on Corporation Tax, we believe that there might well have been a stronger case for not doing that if it was desired to get an export-led boom. Exports were penalised enough at the time of devaluation by the removal of the export rebate, the imposition of the S.E.T. premium, higher import costs, higher labour costs, and so on. Then to tax all profits they made as well was, we believe, a wrong step.<br/>
A concession could have been made here and the Corporation Tax not increased. This would have meant that in the longer run the Revenue would have done better, because the export-led boom would have been more likely to have come about at an earlier stage. I believe that there is a case for moving from direct to indirect taxation. We are sorry that the Chancellor seems to us on this occasion to have done it in the wrong way as regards indirect taxation and not made any change as regards direct taxation.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has said that he will tell us what his policy is. He said that he would have a value-added tax to replace the Selective Employment Tax, the Corporation Tax, and all sorts of other taxes. Which items would he bring into it to make it more broadly based?</p>

<p>We had discussed that matter before. I should be out of order if I attempted to go into it in this debate. It has been spelled out in speeches elsewhere. It is fairly clear what form of value-added tax is normally advocated by those who have studied this subject in any detail.<br/>
I turn from this subject to the question of Corporation Tax. I will answer directly the point which the hon. Gentleman has just made. We do not believe that the Corporation Tax as it now is is the right kind of Corporation Tax, because it discourages overseas investment and it encourages the plough-back of profits rather than the distribution of profits and a reinvestment of those profits elsewhere through the stock market into enterprises which are growing fast and which desperately need capital. That is a fundamental difference between the two parties, because, as my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition


pointed out when Corporation Tax was introduced, we believe that the survival of the fattest is not likely to lead to efficient action in the economy.<br/>
Another point has radically affected the Government's view throughout the Bill. It is right that any Government should be concerned about tax avoidance, but that is a vastly different matter from becoming obsessed with tax avoidance. The Government seem determined to block completely every minor loophole, regardless of the effect which that may have either on the economic situation or on various choices which may already have been made or even regardless of humanity. I take a couple of examples. The first was admirably deployed this evening by my hon. Friend the Member for Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Patrick Jenkin)&#x2014;the retrospective change which has been made in life insurance policies. That has meant that people who, rightly, over the years anticipated a certain outcome and invested in policies for 30 or 40 years, find that, by arbitrary act of the Government, those expectations are frustrated, all in the name of closing a loophole.<br/>
A similar comment applies to the whole structure of life insurance. We shall find reduction-of-premium policies which have been in operation for many years, perhaps for a century or more, suddenly wiped out because the Government are concerned in a quite different context, not with encouraging the insurance market or enabling it to operate efficiently but simply with closing yet another loophole. We must have a due regard to avoidance, but it is important that it should not become an obsession, and it is even more important that we should weigh the cost of one against the cost of the other.<br/>
I will not digress into the whole question of the mortgage option scheme and the effect which the Budget will have on those who believed what the Government said and who opted for the option mortgage scheme. That was admirably deployed by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Darwen (Mr. Fletcher-Cooke) last evening on Report.<br/>
Certainly some of these tax changes are not changes which we on this side of the House feel ought to be supported. There is a vast difference between the

two sides of the House on the question of the aggregation of an infant's income with the parent's income&#x2014;as was shown in moving speeches by my right hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, West in Committee on 15th May, as reported in c. 851 of the OFFICIAL REPORT. He stressed that the Opposition Amendments were most important Amendments to the Bill, and certainly the most important Amendments to that Clause. We were given a concession on thalidomide babies, but we still have no concession in the case where&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am seeking to do that, Mr. Speaker. Within the Bill we still have Clause 15, which changes the law in such a way that many people who are in dire circumstances, and children in families where the main earner has died, will be penalised. There is a fundamental difference between the two parties.<br/>
That is true, too, of the special charge. We are forced to the conclusion that that was put into the Bill only because the Chancellor wished to raise the fort in a Budget and Finance Bill debate. We do not believe that it is a reasonable tactic to adopt. Next, there is Selective Employment Tax, which we on this side of the House are firmly committed to abolish. That is a fundamental difference between the two parties. We believe that the anomalies of this tax are legion. It is to be increased by 50 per cent., which will further increase these anomalies. While we are glad that some concession has been made in a few areas to particular hotels, nevertheless, we take the view that there is only one solution to this tax, which has been increased in the Bill by 50 per cent., and that is to abolish it.<br/>
As we totally disagree with all those taxes which I have mentioned, I very much hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will join me in voting against the Finance Bill, which we believe is wrong in principle, which still includes many Clauses which will have a dire effect on a number of people and which is not an answer to our present economic situation.</p>

<p>We have had some differences of opinion between the two sides of the House whether the Bill should have been debated upstairs in Standing Committee or on the Floor of the House. A great deal of humbug has been spoken and written on the subject. We all know that it is open to an Opposition to frustrate any Bill, including a Finance Bill, whether it is debated upstairs in Committee or downstairs on the Floor of the House. By so frustrating the Bill, it is possible for them to ensure that the House has no debate on a number of Clauses, and it was possible on this occasion for them to see that the House had no debate on the special charge, other than the start of a debate on it this evening.<br/>
The Opposition made it clear from the beginning of the Bill that they had no intention of co-operating in the way in which the Finance Bill should go through the House. It is a little hypocritical for them now to argue that we lost an opportunity to debate many Clauses. I do not argue that the Opposition have deliberately filibustered. As hon. Members know, it is not necessary to do that. One could take any Finance Bill&#x2014;not only this year's rather long Bill&#x2014;and debate a quarter of it for the whole of a year. It is quite simple to do that. But, as we all know, normally the Government and the Opposition join in restraining back-bench Members&#x2014;that is a normal practice&#x2014;so that we have a reasonable discussion on all Clauses of the Bill. That did not happen this year, and some Clauses were not debated.<br/>
I know that the right hon. Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) believes that it is impossible to restrain back-bench Members when we are in Committee upstairs. I respect his view and I know that he genuinely holds it. It is not strictly correct. I recollect that when we were in Committee there was an occasion on which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport was reading rapidly from a brief and back-bench Members opposite were clearly dying to get into the debate. They were restrained and held on a leash, presumably by instruction.<br/>
Of course I recognise that the right hon. Member or anyone else leading an Op-

position team in Committee upstairs would find it difficult to restrain backbench Members when everybody is present in Committee to debate a particular Clause. Leadership is not easy. But it needs to be exercised, and it was not exercised on this occasion&#x2014;and that was not because of lack of ability, because, clearly, the right hon. Gentleman has the ability. It was because of a genuine constitutional desire to frustrate the will of the Government. That is fair enough. Those are legitimate tactics. But that does not represent an argument against debating the Bill upstairs in Committee rather than on the Floor of the House, because the same tactics could be deployed downstairs on the Floor of the House as in Standing Committee.<br/>
I believe that the idea of taking out the non-controversial Clauses and debating only those Clauses upstairs is a non-starter, and I am sorry that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor appeared to agree with it. If one looks through the 57 Clauses of this Bill, one sees that very few of them are non-controversial &#x2014;perhaps other than Clause 57, the Title, or the Clause dealing with Premium Bonds, although to some hon. Members, that, too, would be controversial. I do not think that I could support my right hon. Friend's proposal in that respect.<br/>
We could, however, have a Select Committee on taxation after the Finance Bill had been passed and discuss Clauses which had been passed by the House and such provisions as those dealing with close companies affecting life insurance, certain personal allowances and so on. We could have a Select Committee on taxation. But I do not believe that splitting the Bill is an option, nor do I believe that we should attempt to do it. The tactics of the Opposition this year did not prove that we should not have the Bill upstairs. They simply proved, if proof were needed, that the price of an Opposition's using their democratic rights to the full is an inefficient Parliamentary system. It is a price that I think and hope we are all willing to pay, but it is a pity that the genuine interests of the taxpayers tend to get lost at the same time.<br/>
I hope that the Government will not give in to these tactics, and that my right


hon. Friend the Chancellor will reconsider what he said at the start of this debate. With a timetable from the start, whether voluntary or otherwise; with more time upstairs in Committee, by using the time allocated to the Recommittal stage, which this year was a waste of time; and with better co-operation; the debates could be much more useful. I should have thought that Opposition hon. Members would have learned from last night how impossible it was to have a serious debate on an important Clause when, for example, the hon. and gallant Member for Knutsford (Sir W. Bromley-Davenport) joined in what should have been a serious debate. But it was a politically controversial Clause, and it is very difficult to debate such a Clause seriously on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p>I would not want to debar the hon. Gentleman from anything. I was discussing whether the House should decide to hold its debates on the Finance Bill upstairs or downstairs. There are opportunities to debate it fully if we take it upstairs, and we can debate it there more seriously and properly. As I said in a letter to <i>The Times</i> in reply to the article by the right hon. Member for Enfield, West, when we returned to the Floor we saw a very much smaller number of hon. Members present to debate it. The reply of the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) on that point was not valid.<br/>
We are now on Third Reading of a Bill which takes an extra &#x00A3;923 million out of the economy, yet we already hear talk that that is not enough. There is already a July madness with us again. I understand that in the rainy months the worms come up. July seems to be the month for Jeremiahs, and they are in full spate again this year, talking us into a crisis if they possibly can. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will ignore the Jeremiahs. I agree with Peter Jay, who said in <i>The Times</i> this

morning that the success of devaluation cannot be judged
<q>&#x2026; less than eight months after the event from a motley collage of more or less outdated balance-of-payments statistics, notoriously inaccurate output data and speculation.</q>
<q>If devaluation and the associated flanking measures are going to succeed in producing the necessary continuing balance-of-payments surplus of &#x00A3;300&#x2013;500m. per year, it will do so over 18 months to two years. Nothing could be more hazardous for professional reputations or for the determined prosecution of the strategy than attempts to predict and monitor exact progress towards this goal month by month.</q>
The trouble is that there has been a great deal of confusion between economic and financial problems. It needs to be said that those who complain that the Finance Bill and the Budget strategy have still left the pound under such pressure as to need a second devaluation&#x2014;and there are people saying this&#x2014;are either ignorant or, much worse, evil-minded enough to be prepared to talk us into a crisis for political reasons. Fortunately, this tactic cannot work, for those who matter know that a second devaluation solves nothing and is simply not a proposition. The pressure on the pound has nothing to do with the Budget strategy and the Finance Bill, but with the sterling balances and the world monetary problems. There is nothing in the Finance Bill that deals with them, but if the result of the false crisis that we are in danger of talking ourselves into is that we talk ourselves and others into doing something about the sterling balances and the capital outflow, I for one shall be satisfied that we are getting something out of it.<br/>
I do not agree with the hon. Member for Worthing, who seemed to suggest that a Conservative Government would encourage capital outflow by reversing the method of dealing with it in the Corporation Tax. I cannot understand how he can suggest that we can do that this year or in the next year or two, even if in principle the idea is one which could be carried out.<br/>
The really serious figures recently&#x2014; and here I agree with the hon. Gentleman &#x2014;have been those for imports. It is true that so far the Budget strategy has had little effect on the level of imports, but the trend of retail sales at last appears to be encouraging. One should in this context recall that the National Institute


of Economic and Social Research, despite its pessimism about the import figures, predicted a &#x00A3;300 million to &#x00A3;400 million surplus in 1969. We should all like a &#x00A3;500 million surplus and more. But it is crazy to talk of a crisis through a shortfall in surplus of &#x00A3;100 million to &#x00A3;200 million when seen in the perspective of the forecast for 1968 of total exports and imports, including invisibles, of over &#x00A3;17,000 million. Yet, to deal with this, we are told in many quarters that we need another mini-Finance Bill or a July package of deflation. This is simply not proved to be necessary in the context of any of the figures that have been brought to our notice, whether by the National Institute or anybody else. It would be disastrous to bring forward deflationary measures of such a description when unemployment is already at a higher level than many of us would like to see.</p>

<p>I am not at all sure which windmills the hon. Gentleman is tilting at. Neither my right hon.

<p>Her Majesty's Government have said that the level of imports, although higher than originally forecast, will still leave us with a trend which they are satisfied will give us a substantial surplus in 1969, and it seems to me that all the figures should satisfy us that that is so. Right hon. and hon. Members opposite have implied that the position is rather more serious, and yet they have not suggested how they would deal with it. That is my only point. I am not suggesting that the right hon. Gentleman was the windmill at which I was tilting.

As he knows, there have been many articles by informed observers suggesting that such action might be needed.<br/>
If that is the price that my right hon. Friend is being asked to pay in order to do something about the sterling balances, I hope that he will be under no illusion not only that he should not accept it but that he cannot accept it, because I do not think that he could get it through the House. Fortunately, however, the central bankers see the problem somewhat differently from some in the House and some in the City. They know that in their interests as well as ours the Finance Bill and Budget strategy must be given time. I hope that we shall proceed in that direction now by giving the Bill a Third Reading.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett) will forgive me if I do not follow him into the realms of high finance. I want briefly to register the strongest possible protest against what I think is about the most extraordinary feature of the Bill-namely, its savage and apparently deliberate discrimination against the hoteliers of North Ayrshire, in my constituency, by inflicting on them a 50 per cent. increase in Selective Employment Tax while exempting their immediate neighbours and about all the other comparable hoteliers in Scotland from the tax.<br/>
Incidentally it is disgraceful that once again there should be no Scottish Minister on the Government Front Bench when this sort of thing is being done to Scotland. This is not the first time that this has happened. It happens again and again. I commented on it when I spoke on the same subject on Second Reading.<br/>
Having vigorously opposed this iniquitous tax ever since it was introduced and constantly drawn attention to its deplorable impact on Scotland as a whole and particularly on the Scottish tourist industry, it would not make any sense for me to object to such action as the Government have taken, under pressure from my right hon. and hon. Friends and myself, to mitigate its effects. But by making as many exemptions as they have done&#x2014;belatedly, but better late than never&#x2014;they have by contrast greatly


sharpened the effect and increased the unfairness; of the blow that they are dealing at the relatively few hoteliers outside the big cities and the industrial belt who are still to be penalised. These, for reasons which are totally incomprehensible to me, include those of all the famous Clyde tourist resorts of the North Ayrshire coast in my constituency. These are now to be penalised and hit harder than ever, while their neighbours, and, incidentally, their competitors, operating under identical circumstances hardly any distance away, are to be exempted altogether from S.E.T.<br/>
When I asked the Minister of State for Scotland to explain this yesterday all he could say in reply to my Question was that
<q>refunds are not being made in areas catering primarily for day trippers."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 3rd July, 1968; Vol. 767, c. 1493.]</q>
This is absolute nonsense, and he knows it, and the Secretary of State also knows it. The Minister of State has actually contested my constituency, and if he did his job as a candidate properly he ought to have found out something about the tourist industry there. Again the Secretary of State is a neighbour in Ayrshire, and he, too, ought to know something about the rest of Ayrshire.<br/>
Skelmorlie, Largs, Fairlie, West Kilbride, Seamill, Ardrossan, Saltcoats and Stevenson do not cater primarily for day trippers. Largs, to take just one example, has a number of well-equipped hotels that cater for visitors from all over the world, who for the most part stay for a week or two, and some much longer, to enjoy its salubrious air and other amenities. The same can be said of a number of the other resorts that I have mentioned. They do this in exactly the same way as do the other Clyde resorts which have been exempted. Indeed, many of the other Clyde resorts&#x2014;no names no pack drill&#x2014;could with far more justice be described as catering for day trippers than, for example, Largs, Skelmorlie or Ardrossan.<br/>
When I spoke on Second Reading I said that the hoteliers of North Ayrshire were seething with indignation at the treatment meted out to them. At that time, three months ago, they had a great many more companions in misfortune than they do now. Now they have been singled out from all the resort hoteliers

in Scotland for special punishment. Now that this has happened, to say that they are seething with indignation is no longer, I can assure the right hon. Gentleman, an adequate description of their frame of mind.<br/>
Three months ago, in April, the <i>Scotsman</i> headed its leading article on this subject: "Incompetent or mad?" This question has now been answered. We have long known that the present Government are incompetent, but I believe that to include such a provision as this in the Finance Bill they really must be stark, staring mad.</p>

<p>I am very pleased to hear that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer does not intend to give up the experiment of having the Committee stage of the Finance Bill upstairs. Although he pointed out one or two possible variations of this, perhaps those variations need some consideration.<br/>
In particular, I should have no objection to having the "Clause stand part" debate on some of the main issues taken on the Floor of the House where other hon. Members could take part. But all the Amendments, even to the big issues like Corporation Tax, Selective Employment Tax and Income Tax, should still go upstairs. This might be a way for hon. Members to take part in the Committee stage on the Floor of the House and for a better examination of the Bill upstairs.<br/>
I believe that we had very much better debates following the introduction of the Guillotine than any I can recall on previous Finance Bills. We had informed discussions mainly because the hon. Members who were there stayed there. Although one likes to give an opportunity to a number of hon. Members to take part in a debate, few can deny that when we have hon. Members just coming in, finding the place a little empty, speaking a little and then going out, it leads to a very confused debate, and it does not give the Clauses of the Bill the close examination that all of us want to see.<br/>
The problem that we had upstairs, as my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett) pointed out, was caused by the attitude of the right


hon. Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod). He opted out of control, and this was the reason why we had the protracted debates and why we did not discuss certain important Amendments which I was very sorry were not brought before the Committee despite the amount of time allowed for the Committee stage.<br/>
We know that there are the rights of the Opposition. A bargain is usually struck between the rights of the Opposition to control the length of their speeches in return for certain concessions given by the Treasury Bench. On this occasion, that kind of agreement was not made, and it is a pity that the Bill was not discussed as well as many of us would have liked. Perhaps next year or, more likely, the year after, we shall get the kind of informed discussion on the Bill that I should like to see.<br/>
In the meantime, I should like to add my voice to those that are growing in asking for some form of Select Committee to discuss certain matters which are not readily discussed by the making of speeches. The eliciting of information on certain technical matters is an extremely difficult thing to achieve by means of speeches and replies from the Treasury Bench. What we need is some session where questions can be put and answers can be obtained.<br/>
One of the main purposes of the Bill in connection with the raising of this large sum of money is to reduce consumption. We know that this is becoming harder to achieve each year as people become innured to appeals of this kind. In 1957, it was a relatively easy thing to achieve. In 1962, it was still fairly easy. But when we came to 1964 and up to 1968, it had become progressively hard as one preached difficult times ahead and people who had heard it so often before took less notice.<br/>
This is one of the great problems which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer had to face. He was very realistic, and he decided to make sure once and for all that he had to take a certain amount of money out of the economy, and that even if it were too large at least he would err on the right side. This was of as immense importance as an attempt to end the days of hard talk about the future not being seriously believed. The import figures

are still high and we may need to consider import quotas in due course, but this is a matter which I prefer to leave to the judgment of my right hon. Friend, although I hope that any action he may take will not be too late, as it has been so often in the past.<br/>
I wish to put two complaints to the Treasury Bench. The first concerns the lack of an explanatory memorandum. I put a Question to my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary on 25th June. I received a written reply pointing out that there were difficulties but that he was sympathetic to the general idea and that he would consider it carefully. I accept that he has a genuine desire to clarify and simplify taxation matters and even to reduce the burden of taxation; those who have been with him through the various stages of the Bill will accept that. But we know that such a memorandum exists. We cannot believe that those who go on to the Treasury Bench in a position of ignorance rapidly acquire a large amount of knowledge overnight. They are instructed in a very detailed way. If a memorandum, brief, or whatever it might be, were available to them, I should have thought that it was relatively easy to condense it and make it available to hon. Members. It should set out not the arguments so much as an explanation of how the Clauses are intended to work and what they mean.<br/>
I should have thought that this was well within the capability of the Treasury Bench. There is a precedent for it. There was a most valuable memorandum on the 1965 Finance Bill which was available not only to hon. Members but to the public. This was an excellent precedent and I am sorry that it was not followed in subsequent Finance Bills. We should ask the Treasury to make sure that when next year's Finance Bill is discussed we have an explanatory memorandum, which would be of value in our debates.<br/>
My second complaint, which is more serious, concerns the investigation by the Treasury of certain matters of fact and certain things which it can discover and which will be of great help to it in forming its tax proposals. This relates to the call which I made for research into some of the incentive and disincentive effects under which the Government operate. I do not believe that a call for research is any excuse for inaction. Decisions must


be based on evidence, and if there is no evidence available, although the Government might try to obtain it, they must operate within the limits of what is already known. This I accept and understand. But, given the possibility of obtaining further information on which they can base their decisions, there is no excuse for further inaction.<br/>
I feel that this matter is particularly important, because this Bill introduced a fundamental change in direction. In the Budget statement, my right hon. Friend said&#x2014;this has been quoted before but it is worth remembering&#x2014;
<q>No earned income, save for the effects of the recoveries of family allowances, the principle of which had already been announced, will therefore be subject to higher direct taxation. This I believe to be justified on the ground of incentive."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th March, 1968; Vol. 761, c. 296.]</q>
This was a fundamental change in the attitude of Chancellors of the Exchequer, at least from this Party. It was an accepance in principle of the disincentive argument of direct taxation. I should have thought that, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer accepting that &#x00A3;4,600 million was the limit that could be raised out of Income Tax and Surtax, some evidence of this attitude should be called for.<br/>
I do not blame the Chancellor of the Exchequer for coming to a situation in which the evidence was not available, but I believe that this omission should be put right. He decided that there was a level beyond which the disincentive effect of taxation would produce a rapid falling off of effort. I think that most of us know that such a situation exists, but we are all completely ignorant about just where it exists. In other fields, the Government are spending large sums of money&#x2014;&#x00A3;100 million a year on the Regional Employment Premium, &#x00A3;250 million on investment grants, and a large sum on the Selective Employment Tax refund. This money is being spent to persuade people to do things which they would not otherwise do. If we are to persuade them to do them by offering large sums of money, we should at least spend a little money to see whether they are doing what we are trying to induce them to do.<br/>
The Government are raising &#x00A3;12,000 million a year. We on this side of the House now openly accept that there is a disincentive effect in a large part of that,

and I should have thought that the least we could do was to spend a little money to discover something about the disincentive effect and how it might be reduced and what advantage, if any, might be taken of it or how the disadvantage could be diminished.<br/>
The Financial Secretary scorned such investigations as matters of opinion. But informed opinion is what we all want. In discussing the question of research or investigation, the Financial Secretary said on 19th June:
<q>We will merely get an expression of opinion rather than the ascertainment of fact, or we will get the kind of elaborate sociological investigation of the type that was conducted in the medical world into the effect of mother love on children. In that case, after several years of intensive research, those conducting it burst upon the world with the assertion that it is scientifically proved that children benefit from mother love.</q>
This kind of scorn and attitude is totally outdated. There are methods available and it is shameful that the Treasury Bench did not know about them or did not even understand them. My hon. Friend mentioned in passing that universities might undertake this sort of work if it were profitable, and he went on to say:
<q>However, it appears that these university and other institutions have not thought fit to pursue this line of inquiry."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th June, 1968; Vol. 766, c. 1160&#x2013;1.]</q>
I must disillusion the Treasury Bench. The National Institute is carrying out work of this kind, but obviously it is not nearly so well fitted to do it as the Treasury, which is directly involved. Perhaps not everybody unqualifiedly admires the Treasury today. It is able to ignore the revolution in the universities and say that it does not matter, to consider any new field of understanding and call it irrelevant. In these circumstances, one can be forgiven for assuming that its conceit and effortless superiority is a little less convincing now than it used to be.<br/>
Perhaps the matter can be summed up by the Balliol undergraduates, who have a certain sympathetic feeling with the Treasury. I should like to quote a verse which I am sure is well known to many hon. Members:
<q>First come I; my name is Jowett.</q>
<q>There's no knowledge but I know it.</q>
<q>I am Master of this college:</q>
<q>What I don't know isn't knowledge.</q>
In this respect, it sums up the attitude of the Treasury. The scornful remarks


made by the Treasury on what can be achieved in this area confirm my worst suspicions of closed minds and narrow attitudes which, perhaps, are responsible for so much that is wrong in our society today.</p>

<p>No. I must be forgiven if I am showing rather greater anger than is customary in these matters, but I feel strongly that in an area in which the ordinary private firm spends vast sums of money discussing attitudes on matters in which the control is not complete, it is reasonable to assume that the Treasury could spend a small amount in comparison with the very large amounts that it raises.<br/>
I fully understand the normally civilised behaviour of my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary. I hope that he will reflect on how easily he has accepted the Treasury line and I hope that he will consult his own inclinations which, I am sure, would be much more progressive than what he has stated up to now.<br/>
That was a particular "beef" which I had to get off my chest. Having suffered in Committee and having seen what I felt to be a sensible solution scorned in that way, I passed a note to the Financial Secretary, who, unfortunately, could not be here today. There is nothing personal in this. In fact, I did expect to have support from my hon. Friend, because I believe that on these matters he is prepared to be far more adventurous than most Financial Secretaries have been in the past. We have seen this in Committee and elsewhere.<br/>
One aspect of the Finance Bill to which I would like to refer is the change of tax philosophy. This covers the change of emphasis from direct taxation to indirect taxation. This was shown in both Purchase Tax and the Selective Employment Tax. There was, as we know, a large

increase in the revenue from these taxes. When we try to get large increases, we get a large number of anomalies. We get the great difficulty of judging what are luxuries and what are not. We get distortion of choice and, what is perhaps most invidious, we have the position that people have to judge what should be at the higher rate, what should be at the lower rate, what is right to carry a high taxation rate and what is wrong to carry a high taxation rate.<br/>
With the rates of Purchase Tax at a low level, the anomalies are relatively easy to bear. With high rates of the tax, we have instances like that of gramophone records, on which we had heated discussions, and the problems which come from categorisation and categorisation coupled with high rates of Purchase Tax.<br/>
One thing which I have learned as a result of the Bill is that this essentially is the dilemma of the Opposition. It is they who wish to increase indirect taxes. I find it very unconvincing when they assume that they will get all the benefits of broadening the tax base and all the benefits of a low rate at the same time. If they are to increase the revenue from indirect taxes, what is it to be? Is it all to be at the one rate? Will there not be any exemptions for food? Are the rates of tax for clothing and motor cars to be the same as for furs? That is the problem of the Opposition.<br/>
One of the difficulties is that we are essentially a very fair community. This is what raises the problem of Purchase Tax.</p>

<p>The hon. Member ought to know that it is the policy of his right hon. and hon. Friends to increase the amount of revenue obtained in this way.

<p>We are well used to the hon. Member's irrelevancies by now.<br/>
Our tradition of fairness is one of the great stumbling blocks to a simplified structure. We all feel it indefensible that food should be taxed. We are, therefore, unable to introduce some of the simplified schemes of other countries, because what happens in this House is that hon. Members confronted with an unfair situation try to correct it When we have these instances of unfairness, we are unwilling to ride roughshod over them. Consequently, we get more Amendments to an already complicated Bill and complication grows upon complication to introduce and develop the fairness which we feel to be inherently right. As a result, Finance Bills become too large. This, however, mitigates against the simplified solution.<br/>
It is the simplified solution that hon. Members opposite are trying to develop when they call for a broadly-based, simple structure of value-added tax. As soon as they get into the situation of trying to implement that tax, they will see that it is nothing of the sort. They will end up with far greater complexities than anything they have dreamed of and of having to collect more money from the little shop-keepers around the corner who are taking in a few &#x00A3;s a week.</p>

<p>One of the problems that we have had in the Purchase Tax discussions on the Finance Bill is that the tax base has not been wide enough. Therefore, we have had to have very high rates and we have had to have differential rates much greater than any of us would like to see. Because of this we have had

an increase in anomalies, which always arise when one tries to move from direct to indirect taxation and, at the same time, to take rather more in revenue from these forms of taxation.<br/>
When hon. Members Opposite criticise both the Selective Employment Tax and Purchase Tax, they should remember that what they are criticising is indirect taxation. The very criticism which they make will be needed to be directed even more to their own schemes than to the Government's. From the Measures that we have taken this year one lesson that Socialist governments will have to learn is that to remedy injustices requires large sums of money.</p>

<p>I do not know what precise proportion of my speech I have devoted towards demolishing the arguments of hon. Gentlemen opposite. Perhaps some of my anger about the ill-thought-out arguments of hon. Gentlemen opposite, both in Committee and in the House, has finally surfaced this evening.<br/>
The lesson that I see all Socialist governments will to face is that to remedy injustices costs a considerable amount of money. This is so, as we have seen this year. With the urge both to raise money and to redistribute it, we will find ourselves faced with incompatible ends, because redistribution, as we are finally coming to realise, is not enough. For this purpose there are not enough wealthy people whom one can tax to give to those who are more deserving. Therefore, what one does in effect, if one believes in a policy of redistribution, as I do, is to take from those whose incomes are above average to give to those who need it rather more. When one goes to those who are above average, we go not only to Labour supporters, but to the broad mass of the people, who, at a time when wealth is not increasing rapidly, object violently both at the ballot box and elsewhere. We need to increase wealth and so increase the proportion of that extra wealth for redistribution. The


first requisite of a Socialist Government, and the main task of my right hon. Friend, is to create wealth, not only for the good of the country, but also for the Socialist purposes in which we believe. I think that the action taken by my right hon. Friend will contribute to this end.</p>

<p>I warmly support the eloquent plea of the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) that the Government should reverse their hitherto narrow and, at times, flippant attitude towards the need for scientific examination of the effects of taxation.<br/>
I referred in Committee to a publication of Political and Economic Planning, which it was suggested might be of use to the late Conservative Administration if they had wished to use it, called "Tax Surveys&#x2014;Can they help?" The resounding conclusion of that work is that tax surveys have helped in many industrial countries and ought to be widely adopted here.<br/>
When one reflects on the vast amount of money which, for instance, is spent in the realm of psychological medicine trying to trace the response of a comparatively small number of people to certain stresses and strains, it is fantastic that, on a matter affecting the vast body of citizens, so little careful research is done.<br/>
The Liberals cannot possibly support a Bill, quite apart from its other demerits, of which so many controversial Clauses have not been debated at all and of which other Clauses have not been adequately debated on a proper representative basis. It is no concern of mine how blame should be apportioned between the Guillotine and the obedient silence of Government Members on the Standing Committee, on the one hand, and the extraordinary preoccupation of hon. Members on the Conservative side of the Committee with meal breaks and the exact degree of ventilation. Between the two they have ensured that large important sections of the Bill have not been debated.</p>

<p>Silence is not an effective way of securing adequate debate. That was the point, along with the use of the Guillotine, that I was making, I hoped, to the satisfaction of other hon. Members.<br/>
I was glad that the hon. Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett) and the hon. Member for Ashton-under-Lyne were quick to indicate their disapproval of the Chancellor's suggestion this afternoon that perhaps in future so-called technical matters could be sent upstairs. This is an impossible distinction to draw, particularly because a Finance Bill usually covers at least five&#x2014;sometimes more&#x2014;quite separate specialities.<br/>
This year, for instance, a technical committee would have needed specialists on alcohol, on gambling, on life assurance, on Income Tax, on probate and Estate Duty matters, and on special taxes on employment. The idea that any one group of technical specialists can cover all the expertise required for a Finance Bill within the numbers on a Standing Committee is, I think, a delusion. On the other hand, if we could have pre-legislation committees, as has long been the custom in the United States, we could get somewhere in our treatment of tax legislation.<br/>
I was surprised to hear the Chancellor explain that there had not yet been time for his Budget and this Bill to have any effect. He spoke of further time being needed for the effects of the Bill to work through. This seems to be almost an admission of incapacity, because for years it has been acknowledged that part of the main craft of constructing a Budget and a Finance Bill is to give immediate signals to which industry and indeed consumers will respond.<br/>
We are generations away from the time when people did not take note of taxation changes until they received a demand from the collector. There is no reason why a carefully constructed Budget should not have a drastic and immediate effect on the economy because of the signals it contains, and which most of the financial journals have antennae ready to detect.<br/>
The truth is that the signals were confused and misleading. In particular, there was inadequate incentive in the Budget and in the Bill to get import substitution under way quickly enough in the way that it could have been done, and in some other industrial countries has been done brilliantly.<br/>
Dealing with unemployment, during the Second Reading debate the Financial Secretary predicted:
<q>&#x2026; we shall see a declining level of unemployment over the months ahead."&#x2014; [OFFICIAL REPORT, 24th April, 1968; Vol. 763, c. 404.]</q>
We are still waiting for his prophecy even to begin to be fulfilled. A Finance Bill which sent out encouraging signals to the industrial community could have made his prophecy come true.<br/>
The fact is that the balance between the different kinds of taxation in the Bill has been proved wrong. When talking about balance, I do not make quite the same hard and fast distinctions as the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) seemed to do between direct and so-called indirect taxation. I hope that we are moving away from that rather Edwardian distinction, because when we talk, for instance, of a value-added tax, we are talking of a tax which falls partly on profits, and therefore in the old-fashioned language is direct, and partly on costs, and is therefore indirect. I believe that if the Chancellor, in the way he spelled out the family aggregation principle, had spelled out provisions, for value-added tax to be introduced in the future, even though there was not time for it to be introduced in the current fiscal year, this would have been a useful signal to the industrial community.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman said that the value-added tax was partly a tax on profits. Is it any more a tax on profits than is Purchase Tax?</p>

<p>Yes, because the payer of Purchase Tax may be making no profits. Someone who is running his business at a loss may be paying as much Purchase Tax as is paid by a profitable wholesaler.<br/>
The second feature in which there is a lack of balance in the Bill is the distribution of burden between different parts of our fiscal machinery. It is extraordinary that in this year, with all

the symptoms manifest in the spring of a gross overburdening of the Inland Revenue machinery, almost the whole weight of the Bill's innovations are falling upon the Inland Revenue and on those on the taxpayers' side who are opposite the Inland Revenue, whereas Customs and Excise, which has had a relatively easy time in recent years, has been given practically no innovations to introduce.<br/>
A value-added tax would have been a splendid and appropriate job for the Customs and Excise branch, which, we are assured, is in very much better trim to take on substantial innovations than is the Inland Revenue.</p>

The spread of S.E.T. concessions to the hotel industry is welcome to my hon. Friends not only for itself but in one case for the remarkable last-minute elasticity which it shows in the Government's administration of the tax. It is not so long ago that we were told that S.E.T. was inevitably tied to precise employment exchange areas, but in the case of part of West Aberdeenshire the House agreed to an Amendment this afternoon which was a notable step forward in more elastic administration. I mention this partly to encourage hon. Members to realise that a little pressure can introduce elasticity into administrative arrangements.</p>

<p>The hon. Member knows that in this respect the Liberal and Conservative Parties are at one. Whether we are at one in our alternative proposals is a matter into which I should


not be in order in entering now. On the point made by the hon. Member, however, I entirely agree.<br/>
At long last the Government have been able to detach themselves from the idea of employment exchange areas <i>in toto,</i> and in this case they are actually prepared to extend their concession to so much of an employment exchange area as, at the date of the passing of this Act, comprises the area of a district council or a small burgh. This is at least some advance compared with the previous restrictive attitude.<br/>
For the reasons which I have enumerated, I shall feel bound to ask my hon. and right hon. Friends to vote against the Bill tonight.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has had an extremely difficult job. I may be unpopular in saying this, but I want to put it on record that, in my view, his difficulties stem, in part, from the fact of devaluation itself. Most hon. Members &#x2014;in fact, most intelligent commentators and most of the people&#x2014;have embraced devaluation as a rather unpalatable solution to our problems. But in retrospect, we shall, I think, find that my right hon. Friend's difficulties stemmed from the fact that he or his predecessor created a situation in which the problem associated with the need to increase exports has thrown considerable tax burdens on the economy. Many of the so-called effects of devaluation in the field of surging exports arise not so much from the price elasticities introduced into the equation by devaluation but rather from the income effect of expanding world trade.<br/>
Our experience in 1968 is similar to that in 1950&#x2014;that expansion is the consequence not of the reductions in prices, but of this expansion of world trade, similar to that associated with the Korean War. Because of this, my right hon. Friend had a difficult Budget to draw up.<br/>
His difficulties have been increased because we are slowly but irrevocably coming to the conclusion that the whole problem of demand management in late 1960s is becoming exceedingly difficult. Much of the relevant literature, including

the interesting article in <i>Lloyd's Bank Review</i> and a much more learned one in the current <i>Review of Economic Statistics,</i> shows that Chancellors today, in using the Budget for the management of demand in the economy, face problems which make the use of this economic weapon almost outmoded. I must not go into this too deeply, but we should reflect on whether this is enough.<br/>
I will make a slight concession to hon. Members opposite by saying that, if we asked ourselves why demand managements by fiscal means is getting more and more ineffective, we would realise that we are not using these techniques in the context appropriate to their success. The whole problem of the growth of liquidity is becoming extremely serious. There is an enormous paradox in that, as world trade rises, the increase in the money needed to finance it rises much more slowly. Yet, domestically, the growth of money is disproportionately larger than the growth of the gross national product which it is financing. I ask my right hon. Friend to ponder that thought.<br/>
He had a difficult problem as a consequence of devaluation and the growing ineffectiveness of his contemporary economic tools, but I still feel that the Budget is the right one in global terms and in the balance of taxation which he has chosen. I have not changed my mind about the Budget. When I heard it and took part in the discussions, and listened to the euphoric reaction which was in evidence on this side of the House, I thought that the Budget was about right.<br/>
I agree entirely with my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett) that July is a peculiar month and that Peter Jay, the very eloquent and well-informed young economics correspondent of <i>The Times,</i> has done the country a great service. Earlier, in some of his articles relating to the gold rush and what might happen, he was on rather shaky ground, but this morning he did this country a service, and my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Royton was right to bring to the attention of the House some of the sentiments which he expressed.<br/>
If the Chancellor had difficulties in framing his Budget, he will certainly have difficulties in the months ahead. He will be squeezed between the upper


and nether millstones&#x2014;between those who, whatever was said by the right hon. Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod), will ask for more deflation as imports begin to grow, for that is a school of thought in this country, and those of my hon. Friends below the gangway who will plead with him, as unemployment rises, that he should reflate. He may have had problems when he formulated the Budget. He will have other problems in the future.<br/>
As a contribution, perhaps, to positive philosophy, I suggest to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor that he produced a good Budget. He will have difficulties as the economy unfolds. We cannot expect the fruits of devaluation in two years. It took the French five. My advice to my right hon. Friend is, "Sit tight".</p>

<p>I feel that in his absence I should apologise to the Financial Secretary to the Treasury because in an earlier exchange with the hon. Member for Aston-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) I referred to him as an intellectual, and that is an abusive term. I have such a respect for the entrepreneurial skill and success of the Financial Secretary to the Treasury that I should not like it to go on record unconnected that I deprecated him as an intellectual.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Hirst) who, a week ago, very pertinently asked the leader of the House whether we could have a debate on the deteriorating economic situation, was assured by the Leader of the House that the Finance Bill debates would dominate most of this week's proceedings. In fact, the Leader of the House said,
<q>The hon. Member will remember that next week we are debating the Finance Bill. No doubt he will make a contribution."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 27th June, 1968; Vol. 767, c. 819]</q>
We are very grateful indeed that in opening the Third Reading debate the Chancellor gave a fairly generalised account of the situation as he saw it and as he related it to his Budget. Perhaps it was rather a generous interpretation of Third Reading, although I must confess that the most generous interpretation of Third Reading was that of those hon. Members who discussed whether the Bill should be debated up-

stairs in Committee or on the Floor of the House. I will make one brief comment on that. Incarcerated upstairs was the hon. Member who is my regular "pair" and that had a most debilitating effect on my social life.<br/>
The massive sum being additionally raised by the Bill, and particularly by Clauses 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 and 13&#x2014;amounting in all to &#x00A3;923 million of additional taxation in a full year, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) referred&#x2014;has been the subject dominating our discussion tonight. It is being raised in the context of what the Government call their strategy to make devaluation work. This was, after all, the justification presented by the Chancellor when he sought to raise this sum. This strategy, and the unfolding of it in tactical terms, lies at the heart of the Bill.<br/>
That some of us may have doubts about both the strategy and the tactics hardly deserves the designation of Jeremiahs, the term used by the hon. Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett), for even his inseparable hon. Friend, the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne admitted that in the past there had been some doubt about the timing of the Government's economic measures. It is precisely the timing and the sequence of events since devaluation that lie at the heart of a great deal of the controversy surrounding the Bill and the sums sought to be raised by it.<br/>
The original decision to move from one fixed rate to another was extremely unwise. It was, I fear, a missed opportunity to move to a floating rate. This is an aside because I wish to discipline myself to speak about what is in the Bill; but I regret that no references are made to floating rates, to increasing the price of gold or, indeed, to other desirable changes.<br/>
The confidence factor was vital to the whole strategy of devaluation. Once we had moved to the new fixed exchange rate, then the whole argument was that we would have a recovery in the balance of trade of a sufficient magnitude to enable the consequential and sought-after improvement in the balance of payments to proceed, free from the raids of speculation. The Chancellor waxed eloquent on this point and I must quote some of his words. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I appreciate


that his words may distress hon. Gentlemen Opposite, some of whom find his strategy as unacceptable as I do.</p>

<p>That is why we are on different sides of the House and are long likely to remain so, except that the likelihood of political survival, in electoral terms, for right hon. and hon. Gentlemen opposite is in doubt. The Chancellor said:
<q>No Chancellor can begin to guarantee success. But I believe that I have done what is necessary here at home to give us a high chance of achieving it. There is now no rational cause for the British economy not going forward to strong success. Our exchange rate is one that makes us fully competitive.</q>
A little later he said:
<q>In a rational world this should give us the firm prospect of a secure balance of payments and steady growth at home. Even"&#x2014;</q>
and this shows the confidence he had in his measures:
<q>in an irrational one it gives us the great advantage of being able to speak with the knowledge that our own house is in order. And the voice in which we shall speak will be one of sanity &#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 19th March, 1968; Vol. 761, c. 301&#x2013;2.]</q>
The whole point about the confidence factor which is implicit in the devaluation decision is that it has not emerged. There are plenty of arguments for saying that there are good prospects for improvement in the trade balance. It is perfectly true, for example, that the latest report from the Ministry of Technology on the index of engineering export orders shows an increase of 15 per cent. in terms of volume for the past three months over the preceding three months. No one argues&#x2014;at least, I do not&#x2014;that there are not very real tangible prospects of improvements in the balance of trade, and that to some extent they are being contributed to by this Bill. But I say that the confidence factor which the Chancellor of the Exchequer also argued would be encouraged by this Bill have not emerged. This is immensely serious because it could completely undo the strategy of devaluation as events have undermined the strategies of so many other policies which were supposed to lie at the very heart of the Government's management of the economy.<br/>
In this context of the timing of devaluation and dribbling out of the accom-

panying deflationary measures I want to quote from a private paper circulated by a most eminent economist&#x2014;Professor Victor Morgan. I will quote from it only very briefly, but it deals with changes in stocks, a point of immense pertinence. After referring to changes in stocks during the first quarter of this year, Professor Morgan says:
<q>The composition of the over-all figure is even more interesting. Wholesale stocks went up by &#x00A3;15 million and retail stocks by &#x00A3;46 million (the biggest rise since 1960) while those of manufacturers fell by an unprecedented &#x00A3;115 million. The rise in wholesale and retail stocks is no doubt a reflection of the consumer boom and of the desire of distributors as well as consumers to 'beat the Budget'. The size of the fall in manufacturers' stocks is surprising in view of the attempt to explain the high level of imports by reference to a building up of stocks of imported goods. Unless de-stocking of domestic goods was fantastically large there cannot have been much stockbuilding of imports.</q>
In other words, we have seen a rise of imports largely reflected in consumer goods, and industrial re-stocking which has to come on a post-devaluation situation in post-devaluation payment terms. In this situation I do not foresee being borne out even the optimism that the Chancellor of the Exchequer today expressed about the balance of trade.<br/>
In precisely these circumstances we begin to understand that whatever confidence he may have had in the prospect of improvements in the balance of trade being able to see us through the next few months, people outside this country do not see them at all in that way. They do not see things moving in such a way as to lead to a restoration of confidence when there are so many factors at work in the world which would in any case undermine confidence&#x2014;and the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to one when he spoke of the French import restrictions.<br/>
There are implications immediately related to Clause 10, which deals with the the use of the regulator. I should not like it to be thought that there is not one voice in this Chamber which even now does not advocate an increase in indirect taxation. I argue that in the circumstances it is still necessary for the Chancellor to be ready to use his power&#x2014;and, in my view, there is ample evidence that he may have to use it shortly&#x2014;to increase indirect taxation given to him under Clause 10 of this


Bill. This is my analysis and my view. It flows from the quotations I have made from Professor Morgan's analysis. I do not expect hon. Members opposite to agree because I know that they want to talk about restricting portfolio investments and import controls. How they will relate that to what is in the Bill is always a challenge, but my deflationary argument is both consistent and related to the Bill.<br/>
Of course, I accept that this is a very imperfect situation because the real alternative is substantial significant reductions in public expenditure. In arguing for the use of Clause 10 I am arguing only that this is a vital factor if we wish to preserve foreign confidence in sterling and to avoid being driven into import controls or into portfolio regulations on overseas sterling, both of which have been explicitly rejected by the Chancellor within the last few days.</p>

<p>That also is not in the Bill.<br/>
I think everyone appreciates that it is courageous for any Chancellor to seek to raise the unprecedented sums of money which the right hon. Gentleman is raising in the Bill before us. The fact is, however, that the overall strategy was to provide confidence and would be the final act in the devaluation drama, that our balance of trade would show such tangible prospects of improvement that the other confidence factors would then disappear. This has not happened and the fact that the Chancellor in speaking this evening did not address himself to this aspect, this most real and frightening aspect of the situation, is immensely disturbing.<br/>
The Chancellor is a very experienced parliamentarian but I think that this evening there were all the signs that his customary urbanity had shaded into complacency. We have had this situation all too often in the past. It gives me no pleasure partly to endorse at least and call for increased indirect taxation, but anyone who believes that this Budget and what it contains, and this Bill and what it contains, are enough to see us through the next few months is, I think, taking a gamble. It is a gamble which is unjustified and is characteristic of this Government.</p>

<p>Before dealing with the Bill, I want to make a few remarks about the proceedings in Committee. I am one of those who believe that it was a wise decision to send the Bill to Standing Committee. I deplore the fact that the Opposition made such unintelligent use of the time available to them. It is the duty of the Opposition always to oppose, but it is a standing reproach to the Tory Opposition that we have not had time, either in Committee or on the Floor of the House, to debate the only radical provision in the Bill which affects the wealthy, namely, Part IV on the special charge.<br/>
One major reason for that is that we spent rather more than eight hours on Committee discussing a succession of footling, childish points of order concerned with whether Members should sit in shirt sleeves, whether there should be two or three fans on, whether the postal services were adequate, and so on. I hope that, in future years, when the Bill goes to Standing Committee, the facilities available to Members can be improved. However, hon. Members opposite make poor use of the time available if they concentrate for the first day or two in Committee on such trivial matters as those which I have enumerated.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) is one of the ablest and more ambitious politicians in the House and he opposed this procedural reform. He was peeved, because the Bill being taken in Standing Committee kept him from the Floor of the House and denied him the publicity which he would have received here. Further&#x2014;I say this to the right hon. Gentleman with great respect&#x2014;he has met his debating match in my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. This may explain some of the extremely uncharacteristic remarks which the right hon. Gentleman made, some of them very rude, some of them very arrogant, some of them very offensive, in attacking my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in Committee. I hope that, on reflection, the right hon. Gentleman will see fit to withdraw some of the remarks he made in Committee.<br/>
I do not agree with my right hon. Friend the Chancellor that we should debate simply the technical Clauses in Committee and debate the so-called wide-ranging, non-controversial Clauses on the Floor of the House. I want to see either one thing or the other&#x2014; either the Bill taken in a Standing Committee composed of people who are basically interested in this subject, or the Bill taken in Committee of the whole House.<br/>
Throughout this debate there has been considerable discussion about the proceedings in Committee. Hon. Members on both sides have taken the opportunity, under the generosity of either Mr. Speaker or Mr. Deputy Speaker, to discuss wide-ranging aspects of Budget

strategy and of the Budget. I intend to follow suit. Thus, I want to make some comments on indirect taxation and on the special charge.<br/>
I strongly take issue with the prevailing trend of opinion expressed in the debate that what the country needs above all else is a move from direct to indirect taxation. People who argue this case live in a world of cloud-cuckooland. At present, most people earning between &#x00A3;600 and &#x00A3;2,500 per annum&#x2014;many surveys bear this out&#x2014;devote about 28 per cent. of their income, at that level and at higher levels, to taxation in all forms. This means, in effect, that the progressiveness of Income Tax has now largely been overtaken by the regressive-ness of indirect taxation, and indirect taxation, especially the Purchase Tax and the increase in the Selective Employment Tax, bears most bears most heavily on those least able to pay.<br/>
It was for this reason, because two-thirds of the increased taxation provided under it is indirect and thus regressive that the T.U.C. condemned the Budget for placing additional burdens on working people. Moreover, the Government have increased the Purchase Tax, for example, on necessities to 12&#x00BD; per cent. We as a party&#x2014;I remind my right hon. Friend of this&#x2014;claimed at earlier general elections that we stood for the abolition of the Purchase Tax on essential items. I very much hope that we shall return to that position. I am not arguing a case against all forms of indirect taxation. One must be highly selective. One must clearly differentiate between taxation on luxury items and taxation on essentials.<br/>
I turn now to Part IV of the Bill and the special charge. In my view, the special charge is the best element in the whole Bill. At long last, it makes some attempt in this country to come to grips with taxation of capital. Just in case right hon. and hon. Members opposite have any doubt about the views of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, it may be instructive to remind them and the House of some of his earlier words in this connection. In earlier days, my right hon. Friend was accustomed to contribute to <i>Tribune.</i> In 1951, he penned not an article but a pamphlet for <i>Tribune</i> entitled "Fair Shares for the Rich". I


mentioned this the other day to my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot), and, with his characteristic chuckle, he said, "Yes, I remember it. I devised the title for it, and a jolly good pamphlet it was". The very first sentence of that pamphlet read:
<q>Perhaps the greatest evil of capitalism is the gross maldistribution of wealth, both capital and income, to which it has led.</q>
In 1953, the present Chancellor of the Exchequer, in a subsequent publication, his essay on wealth in the "New Fabian Essays" of that year, said:
<q>Capital taxation is an attack on the roots of inequality and not on its surface manifestations. It must play a large part in the fiscal policies of future Labour Governments.</q>
I hope that right hon. and hon. Members opposite will take cognisance that this year the special levy is, as it were, simply a preliminary reconnaissance in this field. There is ample need for it. In 1938, when Mr. Neville Chamberlain was Prime Minister, of all the tax revenue coming into the Exchequer about 6&#x00B7;4 per cent. came from taxation of capital through Estate Duty. In 1968, 30 years on and after three decades of war taxation and welfare economics, the proportion has fallen to just on 3 per cent.<br/>
When the right hon. Member for Enfield, West calls, as he did in Committee, for a broader base for taxation, I put to him, and to my right hon. Friends in the House, that the very first requirement is not to increase indirect taxation but to put much higher taxes on capital and on wealth, for that source is in this country grossly under-taxed at present. Not only is this true in comparison with the past in Britain. It is true also by comparison with virtually every other advanced industrial country of Western Europe.</p>

<p>I am grateful to you for reminding me, Mr. Speaker, and I pass to Part VI, dealing with National Savings.<br/>
The time has come for a complete review of the whole r&#x00F4;le and function of the National Savings movement. We should look toward a position in which it is raising savings at an appropriately higher rate of interest, much higher than the Post Office Savings Bank or other forms of national saving are at present allowed to pay. I am encouraged by my right hon. Friend's remarks yesterday that he is making a review of National Savings and the opportunities for newer forms of savings.<br/>
Earlier tonight my right hon. Friend referred to his overall Budget strategy. My views on it are well known. I am totally opposed to the Government's present Budget strategy and to most of the main elements of their economic policy. I say that because I believe that the advantages the country could obtain and can still obtain from devaluation, which was a right and necessary step to take last autumn, are being squandered by the Government's failure to take certain additional steps.<br/>
The Budget is part three of the steps that followed from devaluation. We had the immediate measures after devaluation, which took &#x00A3;750 million out of the economy; we had the January statement of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, which cut public expenditure this year by just over &#x00A3;325 million; and we had a Budget which takes &#x00A3;775 million out of the economy in this financial year and &#x00A3;923 million in a full year.<br/>
The time has come totally to reappraise the country's economic strategy and the strategy of my right hon. Friend's Budget. I do not say this because I believe that the strategy does not have a chance of success. I think that it has, but the odds are overwhelmingly against us. The international climate is such that the pound is totally over-exposed, as a reserve currency and a trading currency. It is subject to every conceivable strain at home and abroad. If the girls in the Folies Berg&#x00E8;res go on strike there is a run on the pound. We must get away from this situation. We must take steps without delay to stop this exposure of our currency, which other people are using to suit their trading convenience at great detriment to this country, by first reimposing the exchange controls that the party opposite&#x2014;</p>

<p>I much respect your Ruling, Mr. Speaker. I simply draw attention to the fact that earlier speakers had the opportunity that I now seek to discuss the wider Budget strategy. My righ hon. Friend did so in his introductory remarks, and other Members have done so. With your approval, I hope that I may conclude by making one or two brief references along those lines.<br/>
I want to see my right hon. Friend protect the currency along the lines that I have argued in earlier debates. I want to see him taking steps to mobilise our immense resources abroad by liquidating our portfolio investments in North America and using them to buy at the more volatile short-term investments. I want him to pay attention to the steep rise in imports in the first quarter of the

year. The rise in the volume of imported manufactured goods was 15 per cent. above that for the first quarter of 1957. We should attend to this.<br/>
I know that my right hon. Friend is giving these matters urgent and anxious attention, and I hope that he has found the constructive proposals put forward by a number of us on this side of the House, with the full support of the trade union movement and with the support of a wide and growing volume of opinion in the universities and the Press, ones to which he will turn his attention without delay.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett) said there seemed to be building up almost an annual July crisis. It is well known that the Government are currently involved in international negotiations to obtain a long-term loan to fund the short-term sterling balances. That to me is a very much fourth-class alternative to the ideas we have put forward. If there is any question of the Chancellor coming before the House with proposals that he has been induced to adopt as a consequence of obtaining this loan which will result in further deflationary measures, he will meet with the most vigorous opposition from these benches and, I think, the entire House. The time has come for the Government to stand resolute and oppose any suggestion that those proposals should be adopted.<br/>
I hope that the Budget this year will be regarded in a sense as the last of its kind in that it has far too many proposals which are characteristic of the Conservative Party. In another way I hope it may be regarded as the first of its kind because it genuinely tries to get to grips with some social inequalities through the special charge, and in that I wish my right hon. Friend all success in his future endeavours.</p>

<p>I am not sure whether to react to the speech of the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dickens) in anger or in sorrow. I was rather angry when he spent the greater proportion of his speech criticising our criticism of the Committee stage being held upstairs than we spent up there criticising it. The hon. Member


spoke of eight hours. I carefully timed the proportion of his admirably compact speech which he devoted to his criticisms of our conduct in Standing Committee, and it was an immeasureably greater proportion of his speech than our criticisms levelled in the Standing Committee represented.<br/>
I am pre-eminently sorry for the hon. Gentleman about two things which are important to him. One is direct taxation, which is progressive as opposed to indirect. His right hon. Friend has told him that we have reached the end of the road there, and so there is no golden prospect in that direction.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman's right hon. Friend has just given a most interesting interview on Grenada Television about the limit possibly having been reached&#x2014;he agreed with the commentator&#x2014;in direct taxation. As to the red meat of the special charge, I feel sorry for the hon. Gentleman about this. It is once-for-all charge. He will never get another chance. So the hon. Member has had it in every direction.<br/>
I want to chime in with my hon. Friend the Member for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen) in echoing the feeling that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has sounded a note of complacency. He has given the impression that the Bill is a fully rigged ship, carrying a good deal of canvas and ploughing steadily on, in spite of some very rough weather, and she is on course.<br/>
If we look at the situation in slightly greater detail, we find that there is a good deal less ground for complacency or encouragement. I thought that the most interesting, most tell-tale, give-away point of the Chancellor of the Exchequer was his indication that the level of consumer expenditure by the end of the first half of this year would be running at roughly the same level as it was at the end of the first half of 1967. This is a staggering indictment of the success or failure of the Government's policy.<br/>
Let us consider the steps which the Government have taken in their massive attempt to make room for the shift of resources to exports. Since the middle of 1967, we have been in a period of unprecedented emphasis on incomes policy. There were the hire-purchase

charges on car prices in November. We have had the biggest tax raising Budget in peace time&#x2014;we are discussing it now. There were the bank lending restrictions at the end of May, which were incidentally, substantially later than the introduction of the Budget. We have had devaluation, with all the implied effects on import prices and the checking of consumer expenditure. In spite of all that, the Chancellor says that we shall have just managed to reach the level of consumer expenditure which obtained in the middle of 1967. If this is an indication of a successful Budget strategy, then it will not get us very far. This gives the impression that we have simply had a string of unco-ordinated, <i>ad hoc</i> emergency measures unrelated to one another.<br/>
The Chancellor spoke, admittedly, about what he described as the time lag. But one of the curious features of the Bill is that there is in it and the proposals for tax changes an entirely irrational yet purpose-built time lag. If we consider the impact of the fiscal measures which the Chancellor has introduced, we find that they spring up at different times in the coming financial year, and usually in the wrong order from the strategic point of view. In the Inland Revenue category of the taxes he is raising, the immediate impact of the Inland Revenue measures is on the corporate sector. The first people who will be bitten are the companies upon which our future depends and which are immediately landed with the extra &#x00A3;100 million.<br/>
The reduction in the personal allowances, worth about &#x00A3;83 million to the Chancellor, is entirely offset by the increase in family allowances. The special charge has no effect on consumption. It is entirely a capital debt. It will be paid out of capital and will have no effect on consumption. On the Inland Revenue side, the first bite of the Bill is on the corporate sector. Is this the sector which we should clobber in the Budget? These are the people who will feel the cold wind of the Budget first.<br/>
The same thing applies in connection with Customs and Excise. Admittedly Purchase Tax bites early on the consumer, but hydrocarbon oil charges have at least an equal effect on commercial undertakings. With regard to the motor vehicle licence decision&#x2014;one of the major


items meant to hit the consumer&#x2014;my guess is that it will not start bringing in extra revenue until very late in the year because I imagine that as a result of the warning which we were given before the Budget a great many people bought and licensed new cars before 19th March. The increase in vehicle licence charges will probably take effect right at the end of the fiscal year. That will mean another big delay.<br/>
The same applies to the Selective Employment Tax. It will hit early and will not come into effect until September. Again, the consumer tends to be let off lightly. The more we look at it, the longer the time lag becomes. But it is in the wrong direction. The cold wind will blow on the consumer late and on the corporate sector much too early.<br/>
The Corporation Tax will hit the productive sector of the economy. The Selective Employment Tax, whether on the service industry or indirectly&#x2014;and there is a major indirect effect upon manufacturing industry&#x2014;comes in as another feature on the productive side of industry. The Customs and Excise taxation will have its effect on commercial undertakings, which will be affected also by vehicle licence taxation. The real burden will be borne by the corporate sector, which is the one sector that we should try to help.<br/>
I remind the House that the crucial thing for the prospects for exports is not the success or otherwise in keeping price levels steady for exporting firms, because I believe that there is a good deal of flexibility in what overseas buyers are prepared to pay or to buy. The real issue is the modern ideas, new techniques and the new investment which goes into manufacturing industry, producing new kinds of machine tools, new styles and designs of commercial vehicles, and so on. It is investment in manufacturing industry which will suffer from the heavy impost on the corporate sector of the economy.<br/>
I reiterate what my hon. Friend the Member for Oswestry (Mr. Biffen) said in quoting Professor Morgan. Exactly the same point is made in the June <i>Monthly Summary of Business Conditions</i> by "The III Banks", from which I quote:
<q>Industrial investment increased 2 per cent. in the first quarter, according to provisional

estimates, with increases in the distributive, service and shipping industries"&#x2014;</q>
a perverse outcome to the application to S.E.T. and to investment incentives for manufacturing industry, one might add in passing&#x2014;
<q>but a further decline in manufacturers' investment. Estimates for stockbuilding show an increase for wholesalers and retailers, more than offset by a further fall in the volume of manufacturers' stocks.</q>
We have, therefore, exactly the opposite effect of what the Government should be seeking to achieve&#x2014;a continuing decline in manufacturing estimate, a perverse rise in the investment in service and distribution industries and the consumer let off until relatively late in the fiscal year, by which time we may well have missed what might be called the spring tide for selling overseas.<br/>
We must not forget that even more important than devaluation and the effects in France following the difficulties in that country is the coming into effect on 1st July of the new common external tariff of the Common Market, which means that the Germans at least will be putting up their tariffs against us in some of our most important sectors.</p>

<p>I shall be brief but, having listened to most of the Third Reading debate, I wish to deal with a point concerning the Budget strategy, the strategy of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Bill itself. Before doing so, however, as most other hon. Members have appeared to refer in passing to the passage of the Bill in Committee upstairs, I think it is fair to say, as a member of the Standing Committee and as one who has advocated that the Finance Bill should go upstairs, that although during the first few sittings of the Committee I was sceptical about whether the arrangement would be a success, I have come firmly to the conclusion that the Finance Bill gets more detailed examination upstairs than it ever does on the Floor of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for the Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. John Smith) is the last person to question


me on this, because we could go into great depth about his contributions upstairs. I agree that many things want changing in the conduct of the sittings, but the right hon. Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) should not take it that he is playing in the second eleven because the Bill has been sent upstairs.<br/>
The attendance of hon. Members in Committee and the basic and fundamental issues that we discussed showed the division which existed between the parties, and the debates went into great detail. I feel that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, uncharacteristically for him, has already taken fright and announced basic alterations in his thinking about what might happen next year. With my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett) and many other hon. Members who served on the Committee upstairs, I hope that my right hon'. Friend will give another year to the Finance Bill experiment upstairs. In consequence, we feel that if we set out with a timetable we could properly discuss these matters.</p>

<p>I appreciate that, Mr. Speaker, but this was mentioned by the hon. Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins) and some of my hon. Friends. Therefore, I wanted to refer in passing to this year and perhaps draw some conclusions for the future.<br/>
The basic problem with which I want to deal, arising from the Budget strategy, is unemployment. Some of my hon. Friends have dealt with other aspects. I agree particularly with many of the suggestions and criticisms put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Dickens).<br/>
The Chancellor has taken &#x00A3;923 million purchasing power out of the economy. This is already beginning to take effect. I accept that S.E.T. has not yet started. Nevertheless, it is beginning to bite.<br/>
Exports are increasing at the present time, but, for some reason, unemployment is rising. I speak now from an industrial point of view. There is great concern in the country about the manner in which unemployment is not just sticking but is rising. I was alarmed the other

day to hear Mr. Aubrey Jones, at a Press Gallery lunch, talking about the Chancellor's strategy and Budget, refer to the fact that, for the first time in modern history, this country had a position where unemployment was rising but production was rising at the same time. He seemed to welcome this fact. In other words, he welcomed that we should have a higher level of unemplopment. This, to me and to many of my hon. Friends, is completely unacceptable. If we cannot envisage a strategy whereby we can move back to full employment, we must find other ways of running our modern industrial economy.<br/>
What does my right hon. Friend envisage as the prospect for unemployment during the coming autumn and winter months? When we have got rid of the seasonally adjusted figures, will unemployment rise beyond 600,000 or 700,000? I believe that this is of paramount importance to the economy. This is not a question of, as it were, crying scared before the event. It is looking at the event as it is happening reading the figures before us. As each month's figures for unemployment come out, one sees that they are rising. I am very concerned about this.<br/>
If, as has been stated, we are taking out over &#x00A3;200 million&#x2014;I think that was the figure quoted during the prices and incomes debate&#x2014;this will have a severe deflationary effect. What will then be the added effect of S.E.T. in the autumn?<br/>
I know that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor must be concerned about this. I know also that his right hon. Friend the Prime Minister today, in the House, said that we must get full employment through the export-led boom and it would be no boost to the consumer industry to achieve the reduction for which some were pressing in the House earlier. That might sound all right, but some industries are not affected by the export-led boom. There are areas in this country that are still basically finding that unemployment remains difficult to remove.<br/>
I am deeply concerned about this situation. I know that my friends in the trade union movement are unhappy that this is happening in the middle of the summer. I urge the Government to give the matter the most serious consideration and to take the necessary steps to deal with it before things get any


worse, because we foresee an extremely serious situation developing by the winter. If the strategy adopted by my right hon. Friend to bring about a reduction in purchasing power, which he hopes will in itself restrict the purchase of imports, does not work, he will have to take other measures which most of us have been advocating, instead of allowing unemployment to increase.</p>

<p>At an appropriate point in what will be a short speech I shall make some reference to the extremely interesting point which the hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) made about unemployment. He knows that I share his anxiety about this matter.<br/>
The Motion before the House is, "That the Bill be now read the Third time". One is tempted to ask, what Bill? We had to pass a special Motion this afternoon, contrary to our custom, to enable us to discuss a Bill which does not exist. The latest copy which I have has, for example, an interesting Clause 50 entitled, "Provision for a National Lottery", but the only Clause which was put to a free vote of the House was appropriately rejected and, presumably, will not appear in the final version of the Bill. We also this afternoon, at high speed, put in about 100 Government Amendments, and much of the Bill, including, in particular, one Schedule to which I shall refer, is not before the House. All this concentration is to meet the traditional deadline of 5th July, for today is, of course, the 4th. I have always thought that the Chancellor was wrong to attach any particular importance to this date, and I think it has now been shown that it is not a necessary part of our affairs.<br/>
I hold the view that the most boring of all debates are those in which Guillotine battles are fought all over again, and I propose to make very little reference to the question of who was to blame in this matter. The hon. Members for Heywood and Royton (Mr. Barnett) and Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon) have a simple answer. They say that it is my fault. I can never be sure whether the heavenly twins are really very simple people or whether they are very clever people who constantly affect simplicity. I

suspect that it is the second of the two, but, if they will allow me to make one observation, it is that both of them came into the House in, I think, 1964, they have therefore only had the experience of sitting on the Government benches during Finance Bills, and as in the nature of things unhappily they will not be with us in the next Parliament, their education will remain somewhat incomplete.<br/>
It is a matter which, as a former Leader of the House, I have always taken a great interest in, and I respond to some'thing the Chancellor said earlier. I invite the House simply to consider for a moment one Clause and one Schedule. I refer to Clause 16 and Schedule 9. The Chair upstairs selected no fewer than 36 Amendments on this entirely non-controversial Clause and this equally non-controversial Schedule. I was horrified, but the Chair and its advisers were right. There is no question about it, and it is very difficult to see how even into a Guillotine timetable one can fit sensible discussion of that length. The discussions took the whole of a day and the whole of a night and, as a result, the Schedule was entirely rewritten and over 50 Amendments to it were put before the House this afternoon.<br/>
It is clear that we ought at least to look at special methods of considering Clauses and Schedules of that nature. It does not matter what solution we come to, but that sort of procedure&#x2014;which was wholly right; the Chair both downstairs and upstairs was entirely right in what it did&#x2014; cannot be tortured into a normal Committee such as we have upstairs or downstairs. My view, as is known to the House, is that the right and best solution is that all stages should be held on the Floor of the House. Nevertheless, I would wish to study what the Chancellor said today, because on Clauses like that which I have indicated&#x2014;and there are some others&#x2014;I can see a genuine case for special treatment, which might take the form of a division of the Bill. I do not want to go beyond that now. I will study the Chancellor's exact words in HANSARD.<br/>
Many recent Finance Bills have become quite irrelevant by the time they reached the Third Reading debate or, at any rate, the Recess. That was true of


the 1966 Bill, which was completely overwhelmed by the measures of 20th July. It was true of the 1967 Bill, when "Steady as she goes" turned out to be a journey towards the rocks of devaluation. This Finance Bill, to which, if the House agrees, a Third Reading will be given tonight, has more relevance&#x2014;and that would not be difficult&#x2014;than any of the previous Bills that we have had to consider.<br/>
Yet my view of it and of the Chancellor's Budget statement remains basically the same as when I first spoke after him. I have consistently been less optimistic than he has, as he knows, and I would argue that all the developments&#x2014;the new forecasts of the National Institute and the Chancellor's hedging this evining&#x2014;make it clear that events have come closer to the view that I put before the House at the time of the Budget and the Second Reading debate than the view of the Chancellor.<br/>
The Chancellor misunderstands the point that we have made to him about forecasts. It is an excellent thing to make forecasts; it is absurd to be bound by them and to try to torture events to fit a forecast that has been made. If one makes a forecast in the great field of economic affairs with which the Chancellor deals and it comes out right, almost certainly it is an accident; almost certainly it is a combination of two or more errors cancelling themselves out. This is not an argument against making forecasts. In passing, I have always thought that the error of the National Plan was that it attempted to be precise about 1970 but was vague about the years until we got there, whereas any ordinary business forecast does exactly the reverse; it is precise about what is to happen in the next weeks or months and vague as the years go on.<br/>
The Chancellor seemed to think that there was something wrong in adjusting a forecast. On the contrary, I think that he should constantly adjust it, because if he does not he will torture events to make them fit the forecast.<br/>
I want to refer to two points, both of which the Chancellor mentioned and both of which I mention only in passing, because we may have an economic debate and it would be more appropriate

to develop these points then. The first is the question of unemployment, to which the hon. Member for Salford, West referred. After some pressing the Chancellor told me that he expected the trend of unemployment to improve.<br/>
In each of the four months since then, the situation has got worse. We are now, with the June figures, perhaps at the peak of employment. It rather depends upon when the Scottish school leavers come in as to whether July will go higher. August certainly will. So the gross figures will increase almost from now on, with the possible exception of July. But what is more significant still is not just that the June figure is the worst since 1940, but that, seasonally adjusted, the wholly unemployed figure now, in June, is slightly higher than even the peak at the winter time of the 1963 figures and is perhaps the highest figure, except for peaks like a fuel crisis, since the war. It is this that worries the hon. Member for Salford, West.<br/>
Of course there will be something of a lift in exports, and this will help the unemployment situation, but there are, in my judgment, three factors which must be considered on the other side. There is the question of pit closures, there is the effect of the Budget, which has not had its full effect yet, and of course, there is the effect of S.E.T. in the autumn, which, in certain fields, can have a dramatic effect, as we know so well, upon unemployment. I leave that with an expression of anxiety, and will develop it further if we have an economic debate.<br/>
The other matter to which the Chancellor referred is the export-import balance. He now thinks that he will probably get at least his main forecast and that he may get his higher forecast. I think that that is a fair way of putting what he feels about exports, although exactly what it will mean in terms of new foreign currency coming into this country is not completely clear. But I have little doubt&#x2014;again, I merely make the point and leave it for debate&#x2014;that the propensity to import was considerably higher than the Government ever thought, and perhaps higher even than anyone ever thought. To that extent, the balance which they have been seeking between exports and imports is unlikely to be achieved.<br/>
it is for this reason that the Chancellor's forecasts for the second half of the year and for 1969 have been increasingly suspect, particularly from this side of the House. My hon. Friend the Member for Oswestry, (Mr. Biffen) was exactly right in what he said about the question of a re-stocking boom, for various reasons. That may still come.<br/>
I turn from the right hon. Gentleman's general point just to pick out one other. I want to elaborate the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing (Mr. Higgins), who referred particularly to the Chief Secretary, who I thought, in these debates, was the star of the Treasury team. We disagreed a good deal with him, but we were grateful for the way that he answered the debates. His hon. Friend the Member for Chislehurst (Mr. Macdonald) said on Second Reading, I think, that he wished that the Chief Secretary would take time off from his ceaseless pursuit of matters of tax avoidance and evasion.<br/>
I want to put it to the right hon. Gentleman that this obsession of his&#x2014;I believe it to be an obsession&#x2014;is doing infinite harm. It is odd that such an admirable activity should do infinite harm, but I am certain that it does. Anyone who listened&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>]&#x2014;we will come to that in a minute. Anyone who listened to the debates, for instance, on close companies, and the Minister of State's replies, would gather that the Treasury Bench look on close companies as a sort of tax haven, whereas they are part of the true foundation of much of the nation's strength.<br/>
A number of references have been made to a brilliant speech recently delivered by Professor Wheatcroft and I will read just one extract from it, referring directly to the Chief Secretary. This is what Professor Wheatcroft said:
<q>I am fully persuaded that one of the main reasons why this country lacked growth in 1966 and 1967 was the pre-occupation of so many businessmen with tax. They had to come to lectures, read numerous papers and articles and consult professional advisers in order to understand how they sshould conduct their affairs in future, having regard to these new, complicated and obscure taxes. Instead of getting on with their normal task of producing goods or services at the lowest cost, they had to learn to re-adjust their activities in the light of the new taxes as otherwise they would quickly be out of business.</q>

I believe that to be exactly true, and I am sure that the Chief Secretary knows that Professor Wheatcroft's judgment will command respect.<br/>
The Chief Secretary knows very well that we have concentrated a great deal of our attack on the Bill on Clause 15 and Schedule 8. He knows very well that principally in that Clause we tried to secure compensation not just for the thalidomide cases, which we did, but for the breadwinner and those affected by broken marriages, for example. The answer which we were given, right up to last night, by the Chief Secretary, led one to the conclusion that he was thinking only in terms of tax evasion, as if people got themselves killed or divorced in order to avoid the payment of tax.<br/>
I quote from a letter which the Chief Secretary wrote to me on 25th June explaining why he could not meet a particular case, in relation to this issue, which I had put to him. He wrote:
<q>I recognise that this is not the answer for which you had hoped; but perhaps I could make two final points. Firstly, cases of this kind, on any basis, are likely to be pretty few. Secondly; what cases there are will consist mainly of older children.</q>
What an appalling argument to put forward to meet an admitted injustice! The Bill is full of injustices. It is full of petty meannesses. Throughout our opposition we have made that clear to the Treasury Bench, but they had not been ready to meet the cases which we put to them, particularly on Clause 15.<br/>
As I conclude, I give my warmest thanks to the team who worked with me in the various stages of the Bill. They are too many to single out, but it would be wrong of me not to mention my hon. Friends the Members for Worthing and Wanstead and Woodford (Mr. Patrick Jenkin), who have battled manfully and who have outgunned the Treasury team at all points.<br/>
We come to the last stage of the Bill. It was at one time unusual to vote against a Third Reading, but there have been a number of examples of such a vote in recent years and I have no hesitation at all in inviting my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against the Third Reading of this Bill, not just because in a full year it will take &#x00A3;923 million, by far the largest sum ever raised in increased taxation in a Budget, from the people of


this country, but more because it is a monument to the failure of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and of the Government, first, to control public expenditure in this country and, secondly, to encourage the flood of savings which we believe can be tapped for the benefit of the country. In our view the Bill is unfair. It enshrines policies to which we are bitterly opposed. I therefore invite my hon. and right hon. Friends to oppose it on Third Reading.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Enfield, West (Mr. Iain Macleod) referred at the outset of his speech to the difficulties experienced in discussing the Bill upstairs and to the problems arising out of our new procedure. I will devote the first few minutes of what I intend to be a short speech to that subject.<br/>
As the right hon. Gentleman said, this is not the appropriate occasion for a long economic; speech. One cannot deal with economic matters briefly. Moreover, my right hon. Friend said earlier what had to be said, and it would be impossible for me to reply in detail to all the points that have been raised. However, I assure hon. Members on both sides of the House that I have taken careful note of what they have said and that I hope to have an occasion to pursue these matters later.<br/>
In discussing the procedure which we adopted this year, I wish to mention some things in which I believe sincerely and profoundly. The success or otherwise of any experiment&#x2014;indeed, of our ordinary procedure, but in particular of any experiment&#x2014;depends on each one of us. It is our own self-discipline that makes this place work. You are in the Chair, Mr. Speaker, but you, too, would be incapable of maintaining order in the House if we had not all accepted and developed a proper sense of self-discipline in our affairs.<br/>
The experiment of taking a Bill upstairs also requires self-discipline. I regret that one cannot draw the conclusions that one might clearly have liked to have drawn from this experiment, since it was not given a fair chance. [HON. MEMBERS: "Rubbish."] The fact is that we have not had a full

and adequate discussion of all the important Clauses in the Bill.</p>

<p>At the same time, we have spent more time discussing the Bill than any other Bill, with one exception, since the war. We must, therefore, draw the conclusion that we must think a little more carefully about what our methods should be.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Enfield, West knows as well as I do that I hope that on future occasions, not only on the Finance Bill but on other Measures, we could move more readily towards what I believe to be the only solution for adequate, crisp debate; and that is agreed, voluntary time-tables&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>]&#x2014; agreed not necessarily in advance for the whole of a Bill but from time to time. The right hon. Gentleman's whole point in disliking this experiment is that he feels that he could manage affairs much better by discussions&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;on this sort of basis. I am saying that I very much hope that this&#x2014;which I think is the next major step in democracy and which it is up to all of us to understand and to take&#x2014;will be developed. It does not matter whether one is on the Government side of the House or in opposition. I have had many years of what I agree is the best schooling of all, and that is sitting on the benches opposite.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Sir D. Glover) is the last person to challenge me on this. He will recollect that many years ago I said to him that he should not feel so uncomfortable. I explained to him that, like marriage, the first seven years are the worst. Who knows whether or not that may be true.<br/>
The next short point I would make about our procedure is that many hon. Members have felt excluded from our debates and that it has not been satisfactory to provide the alternative of extended time on the Floor of the House. I admit that the idea of giving yet a third time


for matters which have already been discussed twice invites no appetite. This means that we must develop some other method of dealing with the problem.<br/>
I would only say in this connection that I understand that an interesting experiment is going on in another place, where, for the first time, a Standing Committee has been set up composed of Members of all sides of that place and where it is open to any Member of that place to attend, move Amendments and speak to Amendments. In a matter like this, one wants to have regard to experience which we learn as we go along, and it is not wrong to refer once more to it. I gave evidence to the Select Committee: some may have thought one way, and others another.<br/>
I turn next to the very interesting speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Mr. Sheldon), who always speaks forthrightly. If I may say so, I thought that tonight he spoke with unusual forthrightness. I was not quite sure, having regard to the hour of the debate, whether his irritation was caused by his having to wait over-long for his dinner or by the fact&#x2014;I could well understand it&#x2014;that day after day and night after night he had had to endure debates in Committee without feeling free to make his proper contribution to them. For that self-discipline I thank him and, indeed, everyone who contributed so constructively to the passage of the Bill.<br/>
While I understand that he might have been seeking an opportunity to express some of his irritation and his indignation, I thought that it hit the wrong target. I know that he does not regard my hon. Friend the Financial Secretary in any but a warm and affectionate way, but perhaps as the Financial Secretary is not here I may reply to some of the points made by my hon. Friend.<br/>
My hon. Friend should realise that we have now had at least four investigations into the effect of higher taxes on willingness to earn, willingness to exert additional effort&#x2014;their effect on over'time, and so on. A further investigation is now under way, the Reddaway Commission, commissioned by my right hon. Friend. It is not the case that we are not willing to examine these matters; we are most willing to do so. There may

be a useful field for further examination in due course. I have taken on board all that my hon. Friend said. I am sure that he did not wish to be unduly critical of the Financial Secretary.<br/>
I turn to what the right hon. Gentleman said about my attitude to tax and the Opposition's attitude to several of the major issues of the Bill. I am thinking of the aggregation of minors' income, of post-cessation receipts of certain professional men, mainly barristers, and of aggregation of policies which have previously escaped aggregation under the Married Women's Property Act. On all these matters I believe that the Opposition have not taken a reasonable point of opposition to excessive anti-tax aviodance activity on my part but have taken a line which is consistent only with maintaining tax privileges which are long overdue for reform. The aggregation of minors' income is long overdue. The post-cessation receipts of barristers&#x2014;or, rather, of professional men&#x2014;is a matter that everyone has been expecting to be dealt with year after year, and one, I should have thought, that most thinking members of that most respected profession would wish to have removed from their privileges.<br/>
It is extremely regrettable that the Opposition, in spite of the right hon. Gentleman's appreciation, which he expressed only a day or two ago, of the need of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to use every reasonable way to counter tax avoidance, should have fought, and fought so hard, and that, as he rightly said, what inevitably happens, happened. If individuals will not exert self-discipline, if Oppositions will not exert self-discipline, they can, of course, wreck the proceedings of this House. It is open to them to do so. All that the Government can then do is to respond in the way they have done. We have seen over the years that Opposition rights have been diminished by Government after Government because they have not been prepared themselves to restrict their own activities. I would be anxious to avoid any continuation of that. That is why I draw attention in particular to what the right hon. Gentleman said.<br/>
I sense that the House wishes to come to a conclusion on this matter. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] We have been discussing for a very long time and


I have been made very familiar indeed with these proposals. I do not share the view that the right hon. Gentleman expressed as to our future. I take the view that the Chancellor took. We are embarking on a difficult period. This Bill puts it in context. My right hon. Friend has said very plainly that we look to our people to do their best, notwithstanding that the level of consumption is not planned to be higher than it was</p>

<p>in the period of last autumn. That is a great challenge. My right hon. Friend did not promise anything easy. He referred to "two years of hard slog". We are starting those two years. I believe we shall pull though them satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The case of the suicide in prison of Richard Holmes has been the subject of correspondence and discussion between my noble Friend, Lord Stonham, and myself, and I am grateful to my noble Friend for the care and attention which he has paid to it. My hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Mr. Driberg), who knows the parents of Richard Holmes, has taken a great interest in the case as well and attended the inquest. He would have been here, but he happens to be abroad.<br/>
Richard Holmes was by all accounts a very attractive young man, known to many of my friends in my constituency, and at one time he was active in our Young Socialist movement. I have no doubt that he was also a very sick boy. He had treatment for mental illness in several hospitals over a number of years.<br/>
On his nature I can perhaps not do better than to quote a letter from a young man who was for a short time a fellow patient of his at Roffey Park mental hospital and is now in the United States. He wrote:
<q>Dick had the natural ability to bring out the best in everybody. All who knew him at Roffey were charmed by him, and many, in the short time he was with us, came to love him.</q>
But he added:
<q>When Dick walked into a room, for me, at least, a feeling of serene happiness entered with him. Yet there was no serenity within him. His whole life was a constant inner struggle: one of self-questioning and self-doubt. For heaven knows what reason he felt himself a failure.</q>
On 20th February, 1967, this very sick boy, in a fit of jealous despair, made a violent attack on his girl friend. He was taken to Brixton Prison and charged with attempted murder. On 22nd March he appeared at the Old Bailey and was put back on remand pending psychiatric reports. Here the first tragic error in his history occurred, because he was sent back to Brixton as a convicted per-

son and treated as such. Nevertheless, because he injured his hands while injuring his girl friend, he was all that time in the prison hospital. The senior medical officer examined him, and also wrote to the Prince of Wales Hospital and Roffey Park and North Middlesex Hospital, in all of which he had been treated.<br/>
There is some confusion about this correspondence. The senior medical officer said at the inquest that he had received no reply from the first two, but the consultant who attended the boy at the Prince of Wales Hospital says that there is no record of any letter from the senior medical officer at Brixton, while the hospital secretary of Roffey Park confirmed to the boys' parents in a letter on 29th January, 1968, a copy of the medical report sent to the medical officer of Brixton Prison on 28th February, 1967.<br/>
However, the medical officer received reports from the two consultants at the North Middlesex Hospital who treated or examined Holmes on separate occasions. The senior medical officer therefore prepared a report which referred to the views of these doctors, and I believe that he came to much the same view about the boy's condition, that is, that Richard Holmes was very sick and had a psycho-pathological personality and suicidal tendencies. In fact, by that time he had already made one or two suicide attempts.<br/>
The defence asked that the boy should see another consultant, and this took place on 6th May. The consultant, a psychiatric consultant, reported his findings in a letter to the defence solicitor, but not to the prison authorities. I have reason to believe that his findings were very similar to those of the doctors who had previously examined Holmes.<br/>
Further confirmation of the boy's condition is that on 28th March he told another prisoner on exercise in Brixton Prison that he would commit suicide. He was thereupon put in a special room in a special canvas suit, which, by some barbaric custom, is still used on these occasions. The next day, according to the medical officer he "promised to behave", and this apparently satisfied the medical officer. That is a most extraordinary judgment by somebody supposed to be judging the condition of a very sick boy.


There was no doubt by that time of his condition.<br/>
On 26th May Holmes appeared at the Old Bailey. The Brixton senior medical officer and the psychiatrist whom the defence had asked that the boy should see both gave evidence. The recorder sentenced Holmes to life imprisonment, but made it absolutely clear that he did so on the basis that Holmes should receive psychiatric treatment, and would be released when the medical authorities thought it safe to do so. Incidentally, the defence psychiatrist had warned of the possibility of attempted suicide if Holmes lingered in prison and stated that he thought that he should be transferred to Grendon psychiatric prison immediately. Holmes was sent to Wormwood Scrubs Prison.<br/>
It is not clear whether the prison staff at Wormwood Scrubs were immediately informed of the seriousness of Holmes' condition. The recorder had ordered that the doctors' reports should be sent with the papers, but there appears to have been some delay about this. However, the boy went straight into the prison hospital, I think because of the injuries to his hand, but he was not seen by a medical officer until ten o'clock in the evening. The medical officer slated at the inquest that he had carefully interviewed Holmes to ascertain the state of his mind. There is some doubt as to the length of this interview as the prison officer present at the interview changed his original report, in particular, in this respect before the inquest at the suggestion, apparently, of the medical officer.<br/>
The medical officer found Holmes' condition "apparently good&#x2014;not actively suicidal." He was therefore kept in a room on a medical observation landing, but no special precautions such as are normally taken in suicidal cases were taken in this case&#x2014;that is, a light was not kept on in his room, certain articles of clothing were not removed, there was no instruction for half-hourly observation. In the morning, Holmes was found hanging dead from his belt.<br/>
At the inquest, the medical officer at Wormwood Scrubs admitted that his diagnosis was tragically wrong. In view of the massive previous evidence, I do

not know how to take this statement. It certainly was tragically wrong. But I feel that it was a good deal more than that.<br/>
This is not the only suicide which occurred that year in that prison. There were four in the same year. The jury at the inquest recommended a review of the observation landing procedure, but I suggest that this is not enough. What is needed is a drastic overhaul of the methods of dealing with mentally sick prisoners. I am forced to the conclusion that some prison officers lack interest in these cases. I know nothing of their qualifications to deal with mental illness, although I know from my experience as a member of a hospital management board about the very great difficulty in obtaining doctors with adequate psychological training.<br/>
However, something is drastically wrong with a system that allows a desperately sick boy, sentenced by a judge for the express purpose of getting him cured, to be taken to prison and treated in such a way that on the night he killed himself he could write to his parents:
<q>Nobody here is at all interested in what the judge said or recommended or the reason he sentenced me to life. All they know here is I have a life sentence and will be treated the same as anybody else with a life sentence.</q>
In the utter despair of that belief, Richard Holmes killed himself.<br/>
What I want to hear from my hon. Friend is, not a defence of the indefensible, but what measures have been taken to carry out the promise which Lord Stonham gave me that steps would be taken to ensure that avoidable tragedies like this do not occur again.</p>

<p>I am sure that everyone who has been concerned with this tragic case will share the deep sense of loss in seeing a young man of undoubted intelligence and very considerable potential end his life in this way. Our deepest sympathy goes out to his parents and with our admiration of their courage and the way in which they have tried to ensure, through the efforts of my hon. Friends the Members for Edmonton (Mr. Albu) and Barking (Mr. Driberg), that their


tragedy might be the means of preventing similar tragedies in the future.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton has outlined the events which led up to the death of Richard Holmes, and I will not dwell on them. I would, however, say that on the day of his admission to prison Richard showed no signs of stress when examined by the medical officer at Wormwood Scrubs, and that doctor decided that, despite his history, there was no need for special precautions beyond keeping him on the mental observation landing at the prison hospital for further assessment. As we have heard, however, during the night Richard took his life by hanging.<br/>
At the inquest, to which allusion has been made by my hon. Friend, the jury added a rider to their verdict to the effect that while no one had failed in his duty under the existing system, there should be a review of the arrangements for observation on the mental observation landing during the time that the night patrol officer is in charge.<br/>
I am sure that my hon. Friend would wish me to concentrate, as he has said, on the measures which have been taken during the year since Richard Holmes's death to eliminate as far as is humanly possible the risk of suicide in prison generally and in prison hospitals in particular. I think it is generally agreed that the prevention of suicide has to be tackled on three levels.<br/>
In the first place, practical steps must be taken to ensure that the obvious and most frequently used means of suicide are kept out the reach of patients. Secondly, there must be provision for early recognition of the potential suicide and adequate and carefully-planned supervision of such patients. Thirdly, there is the need for research and long-term planning to throw more light on the phenomenon of suicide and to create the kind of atmosphere in which potential suicides will be able to come to terms with themselves and with society.<br/>
I should like to take first the strictly practical measures which have been taken to prevent suicides. By the end of last year, action had been taken to make available for all male prison hospital patients special clothing which

avoids the use of belts, braces and shoelaces and is worn without a tie. Belts have been found to be the most frequent means of suicide in prison service establishments.<br/>
It is important in dealing with the mentally disturbed or those with suicidal tendencies to avoid giving any impression that they are being singled out for special treatment. To circumvent this difficulty, the special clothing is now standard dress in prison hospitals and is issued to all patients whether or not they are suspected of having suicidal tendencies. It is not practicable to provide such clothing for the whole of the prison population, but it is open to the medical officer to order this special clothing for prison inmates with suicidal tendencies even when they are not in hospital. Another means of reducing suicide is the increased use of locking razors which prevent the removal of blades by the patients.<br/>
The design of cell doors and the planning of hospital accommodation are also important factors in this problem. Cell doors are being altered to provide much larger flaps, allowing better all-round observation of the interior of the cell and ward accommodation, as opposed to single cell accommodation, is being incorporated in planning development for prison hospitals.<br/>
The practical measures which I have described will, I am sure, go a considerable way towards lessening the risk of suicide, but to be really effective they must be accompanied by constant vigilance on the part of prison and medical staff to identify the potential suicide at an early stage and keep him under close supervision.<br/>
That brings me to the second part of action which has been taken. The standing orders for prison establishments relating to the suicide problem have now been redrafted so as to highlight the dangers, and the revised orders were issued in the form of a special circular instruction early this year. The circular provides for patients admitted to prison hospitals to be placed in one of the following three categories after examination by the medical officer. The first category is that in respect of which there must be a special watch and, indeed, continuous supervision. Patients in this category are kept


in staff wards or other suitable rooms and are under continuous supervision by staff at all times.<br/>
The second category is those in respect of which a special watch has to be kept. Patients in this class are kept under close supervision but they may be let out of sight for brief periods if circumstances make this necessary. If the patient is let out of sight, however, the officer responsible is required to take frequent looks at him and to ensure that close supervision is resumed as soon as possible. The third category is that in respect of which no special arrangements for supervision are required and, indeed, only general supervision is exercised.<br/>
The circular also provides that a patient exhibiting marked depression or emotion, with or without suicidal tendencies, should be located, if possible, in association in the hospital under special watch and continuous supervision by hospital officers, unless the medical officer considers that, because of a danger of violence to himself or to others, it is not safe to locate him in association and orders him to be located in a room under special watch.<br/>
Particular attention is drawn to the requirement that any officer, including the medical officer, chaplain and minister of any religious denomination, who has direct contact with a prisoner, should report in writing to the governor any statement by a prisoner which might imply that he would be likely to attempt to commit suicide.<br/>
Finally, the circular gives the following guidance to officers in recognising suicide risks. I quote here five points from that part of the circular. First, attention should be particularly paid to previous suicide attempts, gestures or threats, as a substantial proportion of those who commit suicide have such an earlier history. Secondly, a history of aggressive behaviour, recent withdrawal from drugs, impulsive or hysterical temperment and complaints of anxiety and despondency are all features of importance. Thirdly, in the older age group the often concealed and not readily detectable severe depressive illness may lead to suicide in the early morning. Fourthly, inmates under remand or awaiting trial are equally

liable to commit suicide as those who have been sentenced. Fifthly, inmates in prison for the first time are equally liable to commit suicide as those who have been in custody previously.<br/>
I should like to conclude with one or two general remarks about the suicide problem in prison establishments and to give some indication of the longer term measures which are being taken by the Home Department. The total number of suicides in England and Wales each year is of the order of 6,000 persons, and of these no more than 12 take place in prison establishments. I concede that this is 12 too many cases of the destruction of human life and personality. Each is an episode which challenges authority to tackle this problem which has been mentioned by my hon. Friend. I stress that these are averages that have occurred over the last ten years. The figure of 12 suicides a year in prison must be viewed against the background of a constantly shifting average prison population of some 33,000 persons. A very high percentage of these have a history of broken homes, social isolation, criminality, propensity to violence, alcoholism and drug addiction, and these are the same factors which are commonly found in the history of those who take their own lives.<br/>
The prevention of suicide in prison requires not only physical measures to deprive the potential suicide of the means of killing himself, but also the creation of a climate of hope and incentive and the early recognition and treatment of prisoners with depressive or other mental illness. With these aims in view the prison medical service is conducting a research project from central returns into the problem of suicide in prison establishments to try to evaluate the many factors involved and to discover any trends or patterns which might indicate the kind of preventive action which ought to be taken. It would be misleading, however, to suggest that there is ever likely to be a completely foolproof safeguard against the patient determined to take his own life.<br/>
I think it will be clear from the measures I have outlined that much has already been done to avoid a repetition of the tragic death which has led to this debate, but my right hon. Friend the


Home Secretary and those of us concerned with this problem are aware that it is a long way from being resolved and we shall keep the results of the measures I have announced under constant review and not hesitate to strengthen them at

any time if this should appear necessary in the light of experience.</p>
