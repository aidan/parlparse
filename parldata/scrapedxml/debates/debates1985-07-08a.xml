<p>My right hon. Friend and I are aware that a number of studies have considered whether there might be any relationship between unemployment and health.

<p>I repeat that there is no direct proven causal connection between unemployment and ill health. I remind the hon. Lady that when she last alleged that connection' in the Welsh Grand Committee in March, and I asked her for the material on which she based her view, she sent me an article from <i>The Lancet,</i> which simply reiterated what I have just said &#x2014; that it is extremely difficult to prove any causal connection.</p>

<p>Do not all the reports on the valley towns show the deepening crisis and the social consequences &#x2014; no doubt partly due to mass unemployment, but also to other factors?

<p>Of course there are reports from the valley towns, but, quite frankly, the reports to which the right hon.

<p>I shall answer the hon. Gentleman. There was a 15&#x00B7;6 per cent. increase in front-line staff in the NHS in Wales between 1979 and 1984.<br/>
On current pay awards, it is very much to be hoped that they can be contained within the increased allocations given to health authorities in Wales, with, perhaps, a certain amount more being saved by authorities.</p>

<p>The Minister would do well to read today's <i>Western Mail,</i> in which Mr. Rodger Dobson's compelling and disturbing article relates the link between unemployment and bad health.

<p>Comprehensive information is not available.


However, new manufacturing units known to have opened in Wales since the end of 1965 and still in production directly provide some 72,000 manufacturing jobs, some 35 per cent. of the total number of employees in employment in manufacturing as at December 1984.</p>

<p>Is it not clear that those figures do not give the whole picture? Should not the Government concentrate greater resources on promoting the growth of new jobs and new industries and not on attempting to arrest the necessary decline of some traditional industries?</p>

<p>Although I agree that we should not attempt to arrest necessary decline, the introduction of new technology and the modernisation of existing industry is an important contribution to economic recovery. Some 400 manufacturing plants have opened since May 1979 and they already provide about 18,000 jobs. Many have only just started to take on employees and will provide considerably more jobs in due course.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman might be unaware that I went at the invitation of a company which directly employs 250 people in north Wales and which will provide 800 or 900 jobs in the forestry industry in Wales. I also visited a company which is the 50 per cent. shareholder of British Tissues, which employs many hundreds of people in south Wales. As the hon. Gentleman says, helping the development of existing industry is important. I hope that he will not belittle our efforts to ensure that those industries are strengthened and enlarged.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Government have a creditable record in promoting new jobs since 1979, especially through overseas investment in Wales? Does he further agree that that record could be even better if it were not for the negative chorus from the Opposition, who revel in high unemployment and all things unattractive?</p>

<p>Inward investment from overseas is undoubtedly an important contributory factor to the modernisation of Welsh industry, but we should not exaggerate. Of the 1,000 or so manufacturing units which still exist and have come into being during the past 20 years, only about 65 represent direct inward investment, whereas nearly half represent small companies starting up new businesses. That type of indigenous development is important for the future.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman is far too complacent. He has not told us, for example, about Inmos today. Does he realise that under his regime 103,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared in Wales since he took office? Did not the Brecon electorate brutally dismiss his policies as wretched failures? Is it not the case that the policies must be changed or the endangered species behind him will lose their seats?</p>

<p>I do not believe that anything that I said to the House about the changes necessary in industry showed complacency. What is undoubtedly a matter of

congratulation is that we are attracting new jobs. Since last Question Time there has been the announcement from Control Data at Brynmawr of 100 new jobs, from Shopco (U.K.) Ltd of 100 new jobs and that NDN Aircraft is to manufacture new aircraft in Cardiff creating 100 new jobs. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will welcome the announcement by Seddons in the Delyn enterprise zone that it will take on about 250 people. I am not for one moment suggesting that we do not need a great deal more, but to suggest that that record of attracting new business and new industry smacks of complacency is absurd.</p>

Breeders also benefit from an annual premium on ewes and the breeding flock has been increasing by 2 to 3 per cent. a year. In the last full marketing year, 1983&#x2013;84, the regime resulted in payments of &#x00A3;56&#x00B7;8 million to Welsh sheep producers.</p>

<p>How can the Secretary of State be satisfied with the operation of a regime which is now being used to penalise sheepmeat producers in the United Kingdom, and in Wales in particular?

<p>We have fought resolutely for the sheepmeat regime, which this Government introduced, and which has led to the substantial increase in the flock in Wales. I believe that is has made an enormous contribution to the rural economy. As the hon. Gentleman knows, it was not possible to secure entirely satisfactory modifications to the clawback arrangements, to which I think he was referring. However, we shall continue to press for changes to alleviate the difficulties caused by clawback. The exemption from clawback for our exports outside the Community has been renewed to the end of 1987.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State realise that the 124 per cent. increase since 1979 about which he talks means, so far as Ogmore is concerned, that, with the closure of St. John's colliery, as a result of which 830 miners have lost their jobs, the percentage increase could rise to such an extent that 45 per cent. of male people in Maesteg will be seeking employment?

<p>My hon. Friend will know that about 600 jobs at Borg Warner have been under threat for a considerable time. It was with a good deal of pleasure that we heard that the company is proposing a new use for the factory and has applied for selective financial assistance, which is being considered by the Welsh Industrial Development Advisory Board. I am deeply concerned that the proposals that the Borg Warner management has put to the work force appear to have been rejected. I hope that the members of the work force will consider carefully the future of the plant. It would be tragic if the prospect of 600 secure jobs were put at risk by a careless and irresponsible approach to a serious proposition from the management.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that we in the north-west believe that the amount of centrally allocated money that will be made available should the metropolitan authorities be abolished is grossly inadequate? Does he also recognise that the Arts Council is not considered to be an unbiased allocator of funds, especially to areas such as the north-west? In those circumstances, will he use the same principles as were used in the Priestley report to guarantee that the funding announced by central Government will go to the northwest to ensure that the Royal Exchange, the Halle Orchestra and other such organisations of national importance receive the money that they need to allow them to continue?</p>

<p>I am slightly surprised to hear the hon.

<p>Is it not unfortunate that the Minister is deputy to a deputy?

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. We all recognise that this is not your direct responsibility, but you are the guardian of the interests of the House and especially of Back Benchers. For nearly two years we have suffered the disadvantage of having to deal with the deputy of a deputy. As the distinguished hon. Member for Cambridgeshire, North-East (Mr. Freud) put it, it is not even the organ grinder's monkey but the monkey's monkey. The deputy has been absent from the House in connection with a totally different matter. If we cannot have more than 10 minutes in three weeks, there should be some guarantee that the questions are answered by a Minister with some direct involvement in and responsibility for the arts. I accept the comment of the deputy's deputy that his answers were at least devoid of Latin tags, but the Latin tag was usually the best part of the answer. I hope that something can be said through you, Mr. Speaker, to the effect that safeguarding the interests of the house should have some precedence in the mind of the First Lord of the Treasury.</p>

<p>You and I share a common concern, Mr. Speaker, when Ministers make announcements to the press and not to Members of Parliament. This weekend the Minister for Social Security informed us through <i>The Observer</i> newspaper that Ernst and Whinney is to carry out an inquiry into provisions on residential care in relation to the new board and lodging regulations. I seek your advice on how best to go about getting the Minister into the Chamber to inform Members of Parliament of his intentions so that we can question him. More importantly, as the board and lodging regulations have been proved to be flawed, as shown by the fact that the Government have already had to change them, and as Ernst and Whinney was involved in determining the level of payment to youngsters, would not the Government do better to listen to what the Opposition have to say about the regulations so that we can help to get them correct? I seek your guidance, Mr. Speaker, on how to get the Minister into the Chamber.</p>

Until Thursday, hon. Members were unaware of its timetabling, which has clearly left hon.

The complication arises because, I assume, it was organised some time ago that the Scottish Grand Committee should meet this morning at the Crown Office buildings in Regent road, Edinburgh.

<p>No one can now claim that the Bill has not had adequate time for debate. Despite the guillotine in this House, the time spent was over 200 hours.

<p>So it was also in another place. There was a long day's debate on Second reading, with a formidable list of speakers. There were 10 days of Committee stage discussion stretching late into the night on virtually every occasion. There were then six days on Report and a full day's debate on Third Reading&#x2014;all in all, almost 120 hours of debate altogether in the other place.

<p>The principles of the Bill have been widely supported in both Houses of Parliament. The Bill received a Second Reading in this House by a majority of 135 and a Third Reading by a majority of 155. In another place the reasoned amendment moved on Second Reading was rejected by a majority of 126&#x2014;a majority of more than two to one in the Government's favour. On some issues, notably the so-called "Voice for London" issue, the votes in another place came a trifle closer &#x2014; that I shall concede&#x2014;but always the proposal was rejected. I might remind the House that when that issue was debated on Report in this House the proposal was rejected by 335 votes to 193&#x2014;a majority of 142.</p>

<p>The other place has returned the Bill to us with 98 amendments&#x2014;far fewer than the 280 Lords amendments on the London Government Bill. Of these 98, 76 are straightforward and the Government will invite the House to accept them as they stand or with minor drafting changes. Worthy of note are the amendments which provide for a committee of councillors from the London boroughs to consider planning issues in place of the London Planning Commission originally proposed in the Bill, the amendment calling for a report on countryside matters, the amendment deleting the order-making power to break up the Inner London Education Authority, and the amendments providing for the continuity of a number of specialist services.</p>

<p>There is plenty of time to debate those issues. Although I recognise that the Opposition and some of my hon.

<p>Yes. I defer, as always, to the chairman of the Greater London council, but I hope that he will not mind, if, this time, I speak before him, with, of course, his permission.<br/>
My good and hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) is unavoidably absent today. Nothing would have given him greater pleasure than to be here to lead the fight.<br/>
We oppose the motion because it is constitutionally unacceptable that seven major debates on issues central to the operation of the Bill should be crammed into no more than six hours of debate today. For the Government to suggest that we should not have taken the one hour to discuss general principles is verging on the hypocritical because, had they thought that the principles were important enough to be discussed, they could have allowed more time.<br/>
The Bill would implement the Conservative party's manifesto commitment of June 1983, which said:
<q>The Metropolitan Councils and the Greater London Council have been shown to be a wasteful and unnecessary tier of government. We shall abolish them and return most of their functions to the boroughs and the districts.</q>
The White Paper &#x2014; the so-called "Streamlining the Cities" White Paper &#x2014; tried to expand on those aims. We were told that the Bill would do three things: transfer most functions to the lower tier, remove an unnecessary tier of government and achieve major savings. The electorate was told before June 1983 that &#x00A3;120 million would be saved.<br/>
Another reason why we need much more time to debate the Bill is that, even if it is passed in its present form, it will be a failure when set against the aims which the Government have set for it. The Secretary of State said the Bill had not been emasculated. He has obviously not read or listened to what happened to the Bill in this House and in the other place. It does not transfer most functions to lower-tier authorities. Of 42 major functions currently operated by the GLC or the metropolitan counties, 32, that is 75 per cent., are to be transferred wholly or substantially to countywide bodies, including fire, police, almost certainly waste disposal, passenger transport, financial services and waste management. In case the Secretary of State has missed this, since the White Paper, thanks to the effectiveness of the opposition in this House and outside, 25 functions have been substantially altered to provide now for countywide control.<br/>
Secondly, this measure does not remove an unnecessary tier of government. Indeed, progress on the Bill has confirmed the unavoidable need for countywide services, but what the Bill has removed is democratically elected control of those countywide services. If anybody denies that, let the Secretary of State contradict the figures which show that in the Greater London area 60 per cent. of the spending will still be undertaken by countywide bodies. In the metropolitan areas, it will be 90 per cent. of spending.<br/>
Thirdly, this measure will not produce the savings which were so wildly claimed for it at the general election. That claim of &#x00A3;120 million is in today's prices worth &#x00A3;140 million. It was scaled down in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill when it was first published at the end of last November, and it is an issue on which Ministers are coy, to say the least. We have had a succession of Ministers from other Departments, such as the Minister of State, Department of Transport, saying, "Wherever that &#x00A3;100 million is coming from, it is not coming from passenger transport." The Minister of State, Home Office

is saying, "Wherever that &#x00A3;100 million is coming from., it is not coming from the fire service or the police or from civil defence."
In the Secretary of State's speech, not a word was said about the great claim that this measure would save &#x00A3;120 million. The Public Accounts Committee will find him out after others have seen to his demise from his present high office. However much creative accounting it goes in for, the Public Accounts Committee will find that this measure will not save money, but will increase costs. The Coopers and Lybrand studies, which the Minister has never sought to contradict, show that for marginal recurrent savings there had to be set against one-off savings of between &#x00A3;272 million and &#x00A3;407 million.<br/>
Another reason why we need more time to debate this measure is that it will in no way streamline the cities, because in the place of seven great authorities there will be 62 quangos, joint boards and joint committees and five Government Departments with enhanced powers. Did any Conservative Members in supporting the manifestos in 1979 and 1983, take account of the fact that it would be a matter of voting for more quangos, more joint boards and more centralised control? That will be the result of the Bill.<br/>
The Bill has never been anything more than an unprincipled, spiteful and vindictive attack on seven great local authorities for no reason other than that they are Labour. Many Ministers, including the Minister of State, have had to eat their hats, and to eat their former words in support of the GLC and the metropolitan counties.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State seek the Prime Minister's approval to release the letter which the Prime Minister sent after the Marshall inquiry to Mr. Cutler when he was leader of the Greater London council? We have not heard of that letter before, I understand on the very best of authority that after the Marshall inquiry Mr. Cutler wrote to the Prime Minister who was then Leader of the Opposition, asking her whether she wanted a further statutory inquiry. As I understand it, the right hon. Lady replied that she did not wish for a further statutory inquiry into the GLC, but wished to see the GLC preserved and said that the GLC was
<q>the jewel in the crown of Conservative local government.</q></p>

<p>We should bring back a strategic authority for London in a better form. I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has today released a letter which contains a categorical assurance that we shall reinstate democratic and directly elected control of countrywide services in every area to which the Bill applies.<br/>
We should be grateful for the fact that in piloting the measure through the House the Secretary of State has greatly contributed to the decline in the Government's popular support. There is no doubt that the Government forced this measure into their manifesto because they thought that it would increase their popularity, but, thanks to the opposition in the House and outside, it is one of the main reasons why the Government suffered a humiliating defeat last week and why they will suffer further such humiliating defeats next May in the local elections.<br/>
The Secretary of State claims to have won a series of votes. We are aware of the supine nature of the Government's supporters. We are aware that we may lose votes today, but we fight to win. Whatever votes we may lose, the Labour party has overwhelmingly won the arguments about this mean and nasty Bill, which will result in worse services, staff uncertainty, administrative chaos and increased costs for ratepayers and taxpayers. Above all, the Bill reduces the rights of 13 million electors to have a proper say about the services which directly affect them.<br/>
We shall fight the measure now. We shall continue to fight it in the future. At the next election, we shall be pledged to its repeal. Not least because of that pledge to repeal, when we are elected to power in 1987, we shall make the repeal of this measure one of the next Labour Government's first acts.</p>

<p>During the debates on the Bill I have often found myself in agreement with the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), but not today. I strongly support the timetable motion, in general, because I believe that Bills should be timetabled &#x2014; a good Bill should not need 170 hours of debate&#x2014;but in particular, because the sooner we get rid of this unfortunate Bill, this embarrassment for the Government, the sooner it is out of the way, the sooner will most people forget it and the better therefore will be the future chance of a Conservative Government.<br/>
I am one of that band, which has been small up to now, of Conservative Members who consistently over the past year or two have done their best to persuade the Government to desist from flinging down banana skins upon which they then slip. Unfortunately, the failure of my powers of persuasion were demonstrated with painful clarity by last Thursday's events. In future, I shall have to try harder and, I hope, with more support from my hon. Friends.<br/>
I should not be arguing for a quick end to the debate if there were a snowball's chance in hell of the Government listening to what was said, but with a severe attack of political deafness and a majority as large as it is, mere words are useless. I should argue differently if the majority were a more normal 40 or 50. If it had been, I doubt whether we would ever have had the Bill. Even if we had, such a majority would have ensured that we could have knocked more sense into the Bill.<br/>
I had high hopes of the other place. It has improved the Bill, and my hopes were raised when I saw it reported that my noble Friend Lord Whitelaw was against it. With his great political experience, that was not the least surprising. Sadly, however, even he and his colleagues were mostly, with honourable and noble exceptions, in the end whipped into line. The sooner we are done with this Bill the better. But though it may be forgotten by the majority, its ill effect will live with all those who live in London and the metropolitan counties. In the metropolitan areas a mass of districts, mostly controlled by the Left of the Labour party, will replace a mere six Labour metropolitan councils. That is hardly a good Conservative recipe for administration.<br/>
In London, the powers of the GLC will be administered partly by the London boroughs, mostly controlled by Labour, partly by an elected ILEA, but sure always to be

controlled by Labour, partly by a residuary body, which has the benefit of an excellent chairman, and partly, and increasingly in my judgment, by Whitehall, as will become steadily clearer. The change-over will be chaotic and the cost very high. That will hardly please the electorate, nor will it uphold the old classical Tory belief in the maximum distribution of power. I trust that a general election will come before the chaos becomes too obvious. All this is to satisfy a sudden and ill-thought-out whim. It is a strange world in which we live, but it is time that a little more common sense was introduced into it.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Devizes (Mr. Morrison) is clearly the voice of reason within the Conservative party. It is an echo that we have heard gathering strength throughout the passage of the Bill but it has still not convinced the Conservative Front Bench, particularly the person who inhabits No. 10 Downing Street. The hon. Gentleman has expressed fears that are clearly held by many reasonable Conservative Members.<br/>
The Government's guillotining of this latest stage of the Bill is entirely consistent with their tactics, which have been shoddy in the extreme throughout its passage through both Houses. We have been told that the Bill was conceived in haste and in malice by the Prime Minister. It has been nurtured on the lies propagated by the <i>Daily Mail, The Sun,</i> and the <i>Daily Express</i> and it has been dragooned through Parliament by a bunch of placemen prostituting what is left of their political principles. From that, I exonerate both the Secretary of State and the Minister for Local Government who clearly revealed that they had no political principles to start with.<br/>
We have been told by the Secretary of State that we have had many hours of debate on the Bill. Indeed, we have, but most of it has been sustained by the Opposition during the Committee stage. When we reach the later amendments we shall no doubt have a repeat of what we have seen before. The Conservative Benches will be completely denuded of Members, save the few miserable rejects on the Government Front Bench and some of their Parliamentary Private Secretaries who are forced to sit behind them and appear loyal. The rest will disappear because Tories are embarrassed by what their Government are doing.<br/>
The Government have used secrecy, deceit and plain dishonesty in their efforts to abolish the GLC and the metropolitan county councils.</p>

<p>I agree entirely with my hon. Friend, but I believe that the hon. Member for Devizes got it right. The Government are severely embarrassed by the Bill. They want to try to rush it out as fast as they can. The hon. Member for Devizes was quite wrong to expect that, merely because the Bill is likely to be passed, somehow the electorate will forget about it. I remind him that the GLC and the metropolitan county councils will still exist until 31 March and no one believes that the GLC, of all bodies, will allow the London electorate to forget about this particular legislation.<br/>
I was on the point of reminding the House that "Streamlining the Cities" received about 5,000 responses, the overwhelming majority of which were implacably opposed to the Government's proposals. The Government cannot and have never been able to cite one independent, authoritative academic or professional body in support of abolition of the GLC and the metropolitan county councils. The Prime Minister's determination, which in certain respects, from a political point of view, can be considered to be admirable, has turned into sheer boneheadedness. She has permitted her judgment to be dominated by her political vindictiveness towards the GLC, and not one of the bunch of gutless ministerial nonentities who surround her has the courage to tell her the truth. She is taking her party towards political annihilation in London, and local government towards chaos throughout the country. There is overwhelming opposition to the Bill among the electorate as council by-elections and opinion polls clearly show.<br/>
The Tory party in London is now too frightened to fight elections. Of the four GLC by-elections called since May this year, the Tories have decided to fight only one, at Romford. That shows that no political principle can be involved. That by-election will be contested on Thursday and the Tories will lose it because of the Bill.</p>

<p>I can see why the Government are worried about elections and why they want to abolish the ballot box. Despite what goes out in the media, the Tories lost two of the safest seats in Sheffield in last Thursday's by-election. Are the Government to start abolishing district council elections as well?</p>

<p>I do not know whether they are about to abolish district council elections, but given their authoritarian nature it would not surprise me. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Mr. Michie) is quite correct. The real impact of this Bill will be seen in the borough council elections in London and the district council elections in May 1986. From a Labour point of view, we expect to make a clean sweep throughout London. Westminster city council will go Labour in 1986 because of the Bill and the Government will be surrounded by their political enemies. Such thoughts comfort me at times like this.<br/>
Whatever happens to the Bill, there will be no comfort for the Government. They have never made anything other than the most generalised statements about their overall objectives. They have talked about massive savings as the reason for abolition, but those savings have never been

quantified in any detail. The Government claim that &#x00A3;50 million a year will be saved by the abolition of the GLC, offset by &#x00A3;20 million in the first year because of transitional costs. We have never been given a breakdown of these figures despite repeated requests, and one or two parliamentary questions by myself.<br/>
Coopers and Lybrand estimate that the transitional costs resulting from abolition will total between &#x00A3;122 million and &#x00A3;167 million. Early-day motion 795, tabled in the names of a number of Conservative Members, draws the Government's attention to the estimate. I should like to know whether Ministers have asked their civil servants to look at the figures produced by Coopers and Lybrand to see whether they can fill any gaps in their woeful lack of information. The Government's &#x00A3;50 million a year estimate is considered by Coopers and Lybrand to be a substantial over-estimate because it takes no account of the increased costs of debt financing. These figures cannot be verified.<br/>
Policy changes, as Alan Greengross, the leader of the Conservative party at County hall has pointed out, could produce for the Government far more savings than they could ever get through abolition, but policy changes would mean that the Tory party would have to go out and win an election at the ballot box. That they have refused to do, and they have abolished the county level ballot box in London.</p>

<p>Yes, and Londoners will take it, and they will sweep the Tories out of London. However, we are talking about county level elections, which have effectively been abolished in London, but which will be maintained in the shire elections. I cannot see what principle the hon. Gentleman as trying to prove.<br/>
The Government have claimed that the GLC services will be transferred to the boroughs and a so-called unnecessary tier of local government will be removed. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) has confirmed, it is not the GLC and the metropolitan council services that are to be abolished but rather democratic control over those who administer most of those services. He went on to show the number of functions that would be transferred wholly or substantially to countywide bodies.<br/>
Far from streamlining local government, Ministers are introducing proposals that will lead to about 195 successor bodies and authorities taking on GLC and metropolitan county council activities after abolition. If the Secretary of State believes that that is streamlining, it is clear that he would make an even worse job of design engineering than of local government.</p>

<p>I have sat through every debate on this Bill, here and in Committee. I have heard our Front Bench clearly make statements that the GLC will be restored and that the next Labour Government will have to look at the whole structure of local government in the metropolitan areas. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that we are going to respond in the same knee-jerk way as the Prime Minister reacted when she read some of the bad publicity that the GLC was getting and said, "We will abolish it, off with its head", he does not understand the way that the Labour party works. We shall make sure that local government is put on a firm and sound footing, and that will involve us approaching the matter properly and democratically and not in the haphazard and undemocratic way of the Conservative party.<br/>
The electorate knows that this Bill is nonsense. It started off as a botched-up exercise in political vindictiveness and has now become the most absurd legislative proposal since the window tax. Everybody knows that the Bill will not work. We all know that it is nonsense, and yet it still limps towards the statute book. It does so simply because it is now all about the Prime Minister's face &#x2014; the most expensive commodity in British politics today. That face sinks ships in the south Atlantic, wages war on trade unionists and the unemployed and undermines the economy. It is now set, against all reason, natural justice and the facts, to abolish the GLC and the MCCs.<br/>
The Bill is immoral and unworkable. It seeks to use parliamentary sovereignty to destroy an important part of local democracy and, by doing so, it brings both the law and the House into disrepute. In my first speech in this House I said that the abolition of the GLC would eventually destroy the Government. I see no reason to change that prediction. The coming Labour Government, as my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has made clear, will have to reorganise local government in London. At County hall, we are already working on a new, super and improved GLC, for the years to come. It will be larger and more powerful, and it will undoubtedly involve the abolition of the City of London. Perhaps, using some of the precedents established in the Bill, we shall abolish the City of London by Order in Council. We shall cite certain things that the Government have attempted to do with ILEA.<br/>
Politics is a funny business. It appears from the way that selections for parliamentary candidates in my party are going that half the current Labour group from County hall will be here to see the new, super, improved GLC being created, and I look forward to that.<br/>
In the meantime, abolition of the GLC will not end as an issue, even after the Royal Assent has been given. As chairman of the GLC, I give an unyielding promise to the Government that no political goodwill will be forthcoming from County hall between now and 31 March 1986. We shall do all that is necessary to protect jobs and services in London.<br/>
The Bill has become a spectacular embarrassment for the Government that even now most of them regret. It is no wonder that the Government wish to force the Bill

through tonight by using the guillotine. The destruction of this particularly loathsome Government is all the consolation that I need if the GLC is to be abolished. The Bill will achieve that destruction.</p>

<p>I can follow neither the extremism nor the bombast of the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Mr. Marlow). He is no doubt aggrieved that his rates in Lambeth are going down, and he will no doubt exercise his single ballot box vote there next year.<br/>
We have seven hours and twenty minutes in which to discuss the 98 amendments which were made by the other place. This is the exercise of the Government's use of the parliamentary chopper. Their first exercise of the chopper was to provide no debate within the Conservative party. They chopped any debate within the Cabinet. The Prime Minister decided to include this proposal in the general election manifesto. The second exercise of the electoral chopper was to chop any opportunity to hold a public inquiry and take expert evidence, as has always happened in the past when local government has been reformed. The Government have chopped any opportunity to listen to those who might know a little more about the working of local government than either the Secretary of State or his colleagues who have been given charge of the Bill.<br/>
The Government's third exercise of the parliamentary chopper was to chop the 1985 elections in London and in the six metropolitan counties of Britain. The Tories did not do all that well in the elections on their own ground, namely, the shire counties, let alone in the elections that might have taken place in the urban areas of Great Britain. Their fourth exercise of the parliamentary chopper was to chop the elected government of our capital city after a history that goes back 100 years. They have chopped regional government, municipal government and strategic government for the majority of citizens who live in the urban counties. Another exercise of the chopper is to guillotine this debate.<br/>
The history of the reaction to these proposals suggests that there is a bigger chop yet to come. The Government included this promise in their general election manifesto of 1983. Their vote went down. At the beginning of the general election campaign 44 per cent. of the population supported the Government, but three weeks later only 42 per cent. supported them. The shire county elections in England and Wales took place earlier this year. Throughout their history the Conservative party has been in control of the majority of the shire counties. It also controlled the Association of County Councils. The result of the Government's policies emanating from the Department of the Environment, their policies relating to local government and local government finance and their policy to make the people out there pay for what the Government are doing here means that they have lost control of the majority of shire counties in England. Their vote has gone down. For the first time ever they have lost control of the Association of County Councils.<br/>
What has happened when Members of Parliament have been elected? There have been a few by-elections since the Government first came to office. Only two seats have changed hands in by-elections. They were Tory seats. The Government had a majority of over 12,000 in Portsmouth, but they lost that by-election. That failure was also connected with their local government policies. In Brecon

and Radnor the Government had a majority of over 8,000, but they lost that by-election, too. It will not have escaped the attention of the House that the Government lost those by-elections, not to the Labour party, but to the alliance. The message from the electorate of Brecon and Radnor and everywhere else is that because the Government do not respect local government, or local services, or the views of local people, they will be up for the chop at the end of this Parliament. That will be the result of the folly of their policies.</p>

<p>The reason is that the Labour party is incompetent at organising itself and the Association of County Councils is unused to holding the balance of power.

<p>No, I shall not give way again. The hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to make his speech.<br/>
The result of this policy is that, contrary to all their protests and to what was said by the Secretary of State's predecessor, who is now the Secretary of State for Education and Science, the Government are giving more power to the Secretary of State and his successors, to quangos and to nominated or indirectly elected bodies. They are all equally inappropriate and inadequate substitutes for local government. We have watched the flight of confidence as people have been driven from their jobs, not only in county hall, but in the metropolitan county councils.<br/>
Crucial matters are to be debated today. However, they reflect only bits of policy, because the Government's policy was formed on the run and has not been thought out properly. All those who served on the Committee know that the Government had no answer to the question about who supported their proposals. They did not even have an answer, for half of the time, about their proposals. The bits of the Bill which were amended by the other place deal with strategic planning &#x2014; hardly something which the Government presume can be carried out by borough or district councils. Highways and traffic management do not stop at borough boundaries and suddenly become somebody else's responsibility at a handover point, as happens when one crosses the Channel. It is ludicrous that these matters are not to be dealt with by countywide authorities.<br/>
The Government had no policy on waste disposal when the Bill was previously considered in this House. Waste disposal may not be one of the most exciting parts of the Bill, but if waste disposal goes wrong it will be an important matter for those who are concerned about the environment and who will have to cope with waste and rubbish in their cities and urban areas.<br/>
As for the Government's education proposals, it has been said for decades that education in London is better looked after by a cross-borough authority. The


Government, it is said, ought therefore to have left it alone. Instead, they are not allowing county education structures to remain in place. The details and the principles need to be considered fully, not in a rushed debate. That is what the guillotine will imply.</p>

<p>I take on board entirely and agree with the point made by the hon. Gentleman. His argument about waste disposal applies precisely to Merseyside, as it does to many of these other services. However, can the hon. Gentleman say what advice he would give to the electors of Liverpool, Mossley Hill? I understand that his hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Mossley Hill (Mr. Alton) has consistently supported the abolition of the metropolitan counties, against the interests of the people of Merseyside. Is not the only way to deal with the matter in Mossley Hill at the next general election to vote for the Labour candidate?</p>

<p>I shall deal in a moment with that matter and all that goes with it, as well as with the statement this morning by the Leader of the Opposition. I repeat what the Government ought to bear in mind. At the beginning of the debate on the Bill the alliance made its view clear. &#x2014;<i>[Laughter.]</i> It is no use the Labour party laughing, because it still does not have a clear policy.<br/>
Our position has been made clear for decades. London should again have &#x2014; whatever the Government do&#x2014; a regional authority. The rest of England should have regional authorities. The Labour party is still &#x2014; it is entitled to take its time &#x2014; sorting out whether it will replace county authorities with metropolitan authorities, whether it will have only district authorities, or whether it will have a combination of the two. However, we repeat what we said at the beginning, that the only satisfactory answer is to give London and the other areas proper regional government. Under that form of government regional functions such as transport, planning and waste disposal, which should have been provided many years ago, will be carried out.</p>

<p>We have always believed that the metropolitan counties should be replaced by regional government. We opposed the setting up of the metropolitan counties, and we have never liked them. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It will be done by regional government, with many of the powers which Whitehall and this Secretary of State and his successors will inherit. Perhaps the Government should have paid more heed to that message at the beginning.<br/>
I end with these two notes of warning to the Labour party and its policy makers and to the Government. They should notice that since 1982 the alliance, and not the Labour party, has done best in local elections in London &#x2014; [HON. MEMBERS: "Not in London."] It is true. Labour Members may try to prove me wrong but they will not succeed. We have done better in London in local elections. We have been consistent in our policies and arguments on the issue. I hope that, one day, the Labour party will have a consistent approach and policy. Labour

Members will not be the victims of what is primarily a Government folly. The Government intend passing powers to a residuary body. As a body, the Government were withering when the Bill was introduced. They will be the residuary body at the end of this exercise, and they will have only themselves to blame.</p>

<p>I wonder whether any hon. Member or any person outside who hears this debate will be able to consider this as a serious debate. I suspect that this is the type of debate that brings the House into some disrepute. There is no doubt that the people know full well that the Government, who were elected with an overwhelming majority in 1983, had a policy to abolish the Greater London council and the metropolitan counties. In June 1983 a poll conducted by National Opinion Polls clearly showed that the public had little idea what the GLC did and saw no reason why it might not just as well be abolished. In the general election which followed soon after that poll the Conservatives won 56 of the 84 London seats that were up for election. If that did not represent an overwhelming majority vote for the Conservative party's policies, I should like to know what did.</p>

<p>No doubt the hon. Gentleman will have an opportunity to speak in the debate.<br/>
Various politicians in the metropolitan counties have told us of their wish to abolish the metropolitan councils because they see no purpose in them. They believe that it is far better for democratic practices to be returned to the district councils, which have many more elected members representing a much smaller proportion of the population. The same applies in Greater London. I am sure that, once the people realise that their interests are represented by many more councillors, it will be an irrelevance to have a Greater London council.<br/>
Since the general election, &#x00A3;12 million has been spent by the GLC in an attempted brainwashing exercise. Almost &#x00A3;1 million has been spent by the metropolitan counties in doing the same thing. The latest intervention is a letter from the Leader of the Opposition which, we have been told, took him six months to write &#x2014; no doubt, there was a lot of rewriting. We have been told that the Labour party is not committed to restoring the GLC and the metropolitan councils in their present form. This was confirmed by the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), speaking from the Front Bench, in reply to my intervention. The Opposition are committed to restoring what they call a strategic, democratically elected voice. That is a very different thing.</p>

I ask the hon. Member for Blackburn and his Front Bench colleagues whether they believe that the district councils and the London borough councils are democratically elected bodies.

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way to the right hon. chairman of the GLC. Will he reflect on this point?

<p>If a great mind like yours, Mr. Speaker, will not answer that intervention, I certainly will not try.<br/>
I remind the Opposition, who are spending so much time arguing against the Government delivering their manifesto commitments, of two statements. On 23 September 1983 the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker), writing in his local newspaper, the <i>Sutton Coldfield News,</i> stated:
<q>I do not intend to lift one legislative finger to stop the return of single tier government to Birmingham. That was the view of all the city councillors and it was clearly the view of all West Midlands MPs before the Election.</q>
He was referring, of course, to the 1983 general election.<br/>
Then very recently, in April 1985, Mr. Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London council, wrote to the chairmen of his committees:
<q>We have never defended the GLC status quo and have always argued for an extension and development of our powers.</q>
I realise that from the Labour party there is indeed a view that it wishes to go further and that it wants, of course, to abolish the shire county councils, but what we are asking for is that the Government's commitment in the manifesto should be delivered now without further ado to the population, and there should be no further talk about this matter. We should proceed to legislate.</p>

<p>I wish to make one brief point which I think goes to the kernel of the argument about the motion.<br/>
The kernel of the Bill is the removal from direct democracy of a whole range of powers which at present exist in the metropolitan counties and the Greater London council. If the House is to mean anything, it must be the watchdog of democracy against the dictatorship of the Executive. The Executive in the form of the Government are bringing forward the Bill to remove democracy from the hands of many of my constituents and many others throughout the country. It therefore behoves us&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman quoted figures of employees of the GLC and went on to say that there will be no democratic representation.

Therefore, the hon Gentleman is talking nonsense.</p>

<p>I concede that the right hon. Gentleman is correct in saying that those who work for the ILEA will be controlled by a directly elected body. Why does the same principle not apply to every other county function that is being preserved as a result of the amendments made largely in another place under pressure from the Opposition? What is good for the ILEA and for countrywide local government at the moment should obtain in the future. Government supporters have the chance to vote for Opposition amendments, which would enable that democratic structure to be preserved. Otherwise, we shall simply have a distortion of local democracy. The main burden of our amendments is to give a democratic accountability to those functions which will continue not on a district or a borough basis, but on a countywide basis.<br/>
The second main purpose of the amendments is to recognise the reality of planning our conurbations, and to give each metropolitan county a joint planning commission, which would be elected. One cannot plan a road system from one borough to another. One has to deal with land use on a conurbation basis. A magnificent change has taken place in the nature of south London as a result of the GLC financing over many years on a countywide basis, for example, with the creation of


Burgess park. Much of south London was too densely populated and people were living with no green around them at all.<br/>
It is impossible to have such a planning function simply on a borough basis. On such a basis, it is impossible to plan the skyline around our cities, planning that is very important both in London and parts of Yorkshire, where, without adequate planning, it is possible to destroy the skyline.<br/>
The argument for planning our conurbations on a conurbationwide basis is made out in the Government's proposals on inner cities. The Government do not treat inner city policy as a subject merely for one borough or another. They recently set up, with a flourish from the Prime Minister, an organisation called City Action Teams, or CATs for short. As the Association of Metropolitan Authorities observed, what the country needs is not cats, but mice&#x2014;more inner city expenditure.<br/>
At any rate, when looking at the problems of the inner city, the Government did not choose to do so from borough to borough or district to district. They took a strategic overall view, and said that Government Departments and local authorities must come together to take a strategic view of the inner city. The inner city should be planned in that way. As my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) said, we shall repeal the Bill at the earliest opportunity. The further the Bill gets in its passage, the nearer the opportunity will come for a Labour Government to undertake that task.<br/>
In the meantime, the amendments amount to no more than interim measures. They at least restore to planning some democratic accountability and sense. For that reason alone, I ask hon. Members on both sides of the House to support our amendments.</p>

<p>I wish to speak to amendment (b)
<q>to the words so restored to the Bill":&#x2014;</q>
Page 3, line 12, leave out from 'London' to end of line 15 and insert
<q>'Authority, and the functions of the London Authority in respect of planning matters'.</q>
The Government made some concessions in the other place to various aspects of the Bill, but from the point of view of those in all parties who have opposed the Bill all the way through, and regarded it as a sad piece of legislation, to say the least, that has not been sufficient to repair the damage that is contained in many parts of the Bill. In the other place the Government lost some crucial amendments on significant occasions, but it was not enough to persuade them to depart from the central and still extremely unwelcome aspects of the Bill's structure.<br/>
Amendment (b) deals only with aspects to do with London, but later amendments incorporate the metropolitan counties. At this late stage it is worth remembering that my hon. Friends and colleagues in all parts of the House still have an opportunity to do some useful repair work to the Bill's structure. The confusion and chaos in the original text has to some extent been made worse by the Government's concessions in an attempt to achieve a more rational structure. Despite their Lordships' interesting and heroic efforts&#x2014;I pay particular tribute to Lord Plummer for his amendments &#x2014; the position is more difficult than previously.<br/>
With this amendment my colleagues and I suggest a significant adjustment to help the Government produce a much better structure. We do not seek to push them too far, or oblige them to depart from their original manifesto commitment, which is adhered to in the Bill. In some respects our arguments, fortuitously and felicitously, coincide with those of the Opposition Front Bench, but they are significantly and interestingly different. The substantial effect of the amendment is to put London's strategic planning, highways and traffic control, waste disposal and the important but often forgotten citywide research services into one directly elected London authority.<br/>
Thus, we return to the theme of the body being directly elected. The body is not to be compared in any way with the existing Greater London council. It has no relationship to it and is wholly different. It would be a small body, which would meet the Government's objectives of saving costs, and would have the opposite effect to the present one. The Coopers and Lybrand report shows beyond all doubt that the whole exercise will cost a one-off &#x00A3;170 million. That may be the top end of its range of estimates of the extra cost.<br/>
The amendment would transform the residuary body &#x2014; which was supposed to be a marginal tidying-up body, but which has acquired more and more functions, which the Government's planners could not put elsewhere, as the text became more problematic&#x2014;into a London authority. The amendment would also provide, together with related later amendments, that the London authority should nominate members of the London residuary body, instead of the Secretary of State.<br/>
In the other place successful amendments transferred parts of highways and traffic to the London residuary body. As has already been said, the boroughs end up with only a small minority of the total activities and expenditure in gross terms, contrary to the original intentions of both the manifesto and the Secretary of State. Although my hon. Friends and I believe that the decentralisation proposed for the boroughs in the change for the residuary body is right, it is not appropriate to move the remaining overall Londonwide highways and traffic functions to a temporary nominated quango, such as the London residuary body or a joint board.<br/>
The amendment is valuable in that it deals with direct elections, and immediately and specifically makes possible the co-ordination of those four important citywide services&#x2014;planning, highways and traffic control, waste disposal and the research unit &#x2014; into one London authority. Obviously, we want the authority to be directly elected because its powers and expenditure will be substantial, and it should be accountable to the ratepayers who will have to pay for its functions. We in this House and the other place will anyway have to return to the question of direct elections in separate legislation in due course.<br/>
As the Secretary of State has often reminded us, the Conservative party election manifesto promised to abolish the GLC on the grounds that it was a wasteful body and an unnecessary tier of government. Those arguments have been rendered otiose by the passage of the Bill and the detailed examination of all the arguments for and against it. We shall be left with a yawning gap and major lacuna in London local government, unless this admittedly late-in-the-day adjustment is made.<br/>
At the end of the Bill's passage &#x2014; the Government will no doubt have a chance to refer to this later&#x2014;there is little talk in official circles about saving large sums through abolition. All the evidence suggests that Londoners will face heavy one-off bills, and annually recurring bills for these regrettable changes. I do not exaggerate when I say that this is a tragic piece of legislation in every respect.<br/>
5.15 pm<br/>
The Londonwide tier of government will remain in a structural sense because the GLC's services have been distributed among various quangos, joint boards and joint committees, most of which will be under close ministerial supervision. Instead of the long-standing and solemn tradition of democratic co-ordinated government for London under whatever political control &#x2014; elections come and go, to give all parties a chance&#x2014;we have a muddle and a plethora of different bodies, which confuse everyone, including the Department, and none of which is directly elected. The boroughs will get about one third of the GLC's services in terms of gross revenue expenditure, excluding debt charges, according to the latest calculations, as opposed to most of the expenditure and functions, which was promised as the central rationale of the legislation when it began its unhappy passage.<br/>
One of the worst features of the new scheme for London government is that the entire operation seems to be confused, botched-up and temporary. In a few years' time Parliament will have to return to the subject, and do a major repair job. All parliamentarians must find it tragic to think of all the hours that have been wasted on the legislation. I, therefore, ask the House, especially the Secretary of State, even at this late stage to rise to the occasion, to retrieve something secure from this confusion and chaos, to put the essential services together in one authority rather than into the proposed body, and to make it directly elected and wholly separate and different from the existing GLC, with none of the Left-wing hang ups that have rightly irritated Conservative Members. In that way, we would once again have sensible local government in London.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) will forgive me if I do not follow his comments in detail. He spoke largely about London, whereas my interest lies in south Yorkshire. So far London and the Greater London council have attracted most attention in this debate. The hon. Gentleman suggested that their Lordships have made some minor improvements, and that may be the case. Some noble Lords who may normally be solid supporters of the Conservative party put the country's interest before those of their party in a way which I should like hon. Members in this House to do. The hon. Gentleman may be rather relaxed about the matter because he foresees further legislation in a few years' time. Our worry is that hon. Members from south Yorkshire do not have the time or the opportunity for a leisurely view. The economy of south Yorkshire is appalling and is deteriorating day by day. We are losing more than 200 jobs a week. This is not the time for the Government to plunge the area into the costly chaos that is bound to develop.<br/>
Conservative Members know that south Yorkshire metropolitan county has a vigorous, thriving and growing public transport system based on low fares. What has escaped their attention is the fact that ridership has

increased. The Government dislike the system and, for no other reason, they have adopted an attitude of hatred towards the county council, and cheer its departure because they want to privatise bus services, which in our area are first class.<br/>
I am especially interested in participating in the debate because of the other aspects of the South Yorkshire county council that deserve consideration. It has a high reputation for its environmental work. It commands respect for as intelligent approach towards strategic planning responsibilities, which are now to be changed at a time when the economic condition is critical.<br/>
The Minister does not have responsibility for steel and coal, but if he had he would turn grey at what is happening to our special steels industry. The week before last, we heard of the decision to close the British Steel Corporation's relatively new works at Tinsley Park, which he may have visited when he was at the Department of Trade and Industry. Last week, the River Don works, Britain's only large heavy forging and casting capacity, lost 500 or 600 jobs. In the coal industry, 4,000 or 5,000 jobs have been lost within a matter of months. This has happened while the Government are destroying our strategic planning capacity. Within the planning operation and generally, the county council has developed a splendid, internationally commended reputation in environmental protection. That is well known. If the Secretary of State cares to check, he will see that I am making no false or extravagant claims. The county council has done enormous work in recognising and conserving the ecology of our county. It has achieved much in the reclamation of derelict land. The Minister may be aware, despite the contraction of our coal industry, that there is a continuing problem of colliery spoil. There is a continuing and growing need to maintain the current work of the county council in land reclamation. I fear that the measure and the Government's attitude to the modest amendments carried in the other place will be of enormous disadvantage to the county.<br/>
I hope that the Secretary of State will not feel that I am being unfair, but the other day I heard him telling a substantial and important gathering how deeply committed the Conservative party was to conservation. He claimed that it is the party concerned with conservation in Britain. I am well aware of what the Conservative party is disposed to conserve.</p>

<p>I am glad to have the confirmation of the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Dr. Hampson). The West Yorkshire and South Yorkshire metropolitan county councils are the two most important financial supporters of the trust. If they disappear, the income they provide for the trust, which performs an important function in the county, will be imperilled. It is all right for the Minister to say that the quangos or the borough councils that will inherit the responsibility will be able to offer the same


support, but hon. Members from Yorkshire, and perhaps other hon. Members, will be aware that, under the rate-capping arrangements and contracting central support for local government to which the Government continue to be committed, there is no possibility of maintaining the support currently given by the county councils. If the Minister pretends otherwise, he is doing his Department and the House a disservice. It worries me that at a time when we need to enhance our environment, to invest in the economy and the environmental infrastructure, to give our crushed and critical economy some chance, to give our young people some hope and to provide some decency for the leisure of those who have gone in huge numbers into the dole queues, one major area of leisure is put under a severe and unacceptable threat. I hope that even at this late stage the Minister will recognise that, whatever concessions he may be prepared to make for London, he is making far too few concessions for the metropolitan counties in the north. In my county, the economic position is grave. The environment will be seriously disadvantaged entirely as a result of this petty, politically motivated and grossly unattractive measure.</p>

<p>I am glad to have the opportunity to follow my colleague from Yorkshire, the hon. Member for Wentworth (Mr. Hardy). It is undoubtedly true that there is anxiety about several of the changes that will result from the Bill, largely from the cash point of view. However, I do not understand why the matters that the hon. Gentleman raised, especially those relating to the environment, cannot be dealt with under a different structure, provided that sufficient resources are available. Today, we are dealing with the structures through which such services are carried out.<br/>
Since the Government came to power in 1979, they have talked about the abolition or reform of the metropolitan county structure. The matter was discussed in the Department of the Environment early in the life of this Government. No report on local government recommended the present metropolitan county structure. It was a compromise. Some of us thought from the beginning that it was a botched compromise, because those authorities were large, had large bureaucracies and incurred vast expenditure on salaries, but had relatively restricted functions. There was no case for continuing them. It was not only Conservative Members or members of the Government in 1979 who believed that; most Labour city leaders believed that. Mr. Ken Livingstone in London and the leaders in Leeds, Birmingham and Merseyside believed that, because there was no balance of responsibilities at the county level as there was at the shire level. They were not responsible for education, but they were responsible for substantial transport systems, the police and the fire services.<br/>
I do not accept that this legislation is tragic. It is bringing us back to the position in which we should have been from the start. Those authorities should never have existed, and are unnecessary. The Liberal party and the SDP today agreed that they are unnecessary. However, what they want in their place is equally horrendous, because I believe that the British people want powers pushed back down to a lower level, not the accumulation powers at a regional level.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman must realise that the position is different in London. London has had directly elected, citywide government since the London county council was set up in 1889. Therefore, it is nothing new. If the metropolitan county councils are abolished, there will still be city government in Sheffield, Liverpool and Manchester, but there will be none in London.

<p>The point is that history moves on and structures do not remain absolute in value. In London the scale of responsibilities of the citywide authority has steadily diminished under all parties. Only about 10 per cent. of the resources spent on the individual citizen in London is channelled through the GLC. What is the value of the body? My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) always emphasises the need for "a voice" for London. I have never understood whom that voice is for, or to whom it is addressed. I can understand the ceremonial function and that people from around the world might want to be received, but the City of London could do that as well as the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks).</p>

<p>City government thoughout the world varies enormously. Municipal authorities elsewhere manage because such gifts are given to parts of cities or to institutions. There is nothing sacrosanct about a particular representative body for a city such as London. London happens to have evolved in a way which is different from other cities. Paris has evolved in yet another way. It has an elected mayor who has almost absolute power, whereas other elected representatives have little or no say. Power there is centralised. Nothing decrees that a particular body should speak for London and have particular powers.<br/>
If we had not transferred housing and other major responsibilities down the line the argument would be different. I should have thought that the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), since he represents the Liberal party, would argue in favour of passing responsibilities down the line. He seemed to say that powers should be passed up to a regional body, which is even more divorced from the citizen. Most of my constituents do not know who their county councillors are or what functions they have, so how on earth would they know who to turn to at regional level?</p>

<p>I am glad the hon. Gentleman has allowed me to return to my course. I want to deal with precisely those matters. People talk about the residuary body.&#x2014;[Hon Members: "What is it?"] It is as described by definitiion. It is not intended to exist in perpetuity. Most of us believe that it is important to put the reorganisation on the road, to find out the rough edges and to resolve the problems.<br/>
Some of the amendments are farcical. The residuary body is intended to find out how to deal with the functions and to farm them out to the appropriate quarter. Such a body should not be elected. We do not want the residuary body to be perpetuated by making it an elected body.<br/>
The House of Lords has the notion that elections should take place for people who are to deal with tiny functions. My hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East, for whom I have a great respect on a European level, wants a directly elected body to deal with waste&#x2014;an important function&#x2014;research agencies, libraries and museums. That is in the realms of farce. We do not have a tradition of direct elections to deal with specific functions.<br/>
In other countries such activities are handled on a broader basis on behalf of others by a single elected authority. Even in Britain we have a strong tradition of one authority acting on behalf of another. In education, for example, children can cross a boundary and be educated at a neighbouring school and one authority pays the recipient authority. We have a long tradition of agency agreements. Research facilities, safety inspectorates, quality controls and consumer standards can be operated by one authority on behalf of another through an agency agreement. That is a long-standing practice.

<p>I opposed that idea. I do not wish to be side tracked into that argument. At least I was, and am, consistent.<br/>
If we trust the authorities and place responsibilities firmly on them, rather than allowing them to hedge and pass the buck up the line to a nebulous body such as the county council, they will get together and reach agreement.<br/>
We tend to view government in the United States in terms of the Senate and Congress, but I have lectured on their history and politics and experienced local government there. Town planning is the responsibility of the town. Small communities and county-level government devise their own plans for their communities. Areas such as Texas deliberately might do little in the way of planning. Where they do, in the east coast states, for

example, boundaries adjoin and yet agreements are reached. When I was there last week I found local officials meeting over breakfast. Perhaps that is a good thing because there is less disagreement likely at that time.<br/>
The current proposition is not as absurd as some people think. We have accepted many tiers and people spend years making structural plans, decisions often overturned on appeal to the Secretary of State. In many ways the arbiters of planning proposals are the Secretary of State's regional officials. We do not need all the present tiers because people can get together at a planning level to resolve difficulties amicably.<br/>
These proposals are long overdue. The present county and London levels are unnecessary and the more quickly that we get rid of them the happier I and my constituents shall be.</p>

<p>The most revealing point made by the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Dr. Hampson) came at the end of his contribution when he claimed that the Government's proposals are not so absurd as many people think&#x2014;an admission that the Government's argument is not getting across so well as Ministers claim.<br/>
Hon. Members on both sides believe that this group of amendments provides the last chance of maintaining a minimal elected authority in each of the metropolitan areas and in Greater London. Unlike the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West, I believe that the powers proposed in these amendments are coherent and should be operated on a conurbationwide basis covering strategic planning, highways and traffic, waste disposal, central and support services and research and information. Those are all essential, practical services, not the high-visibility political issues which cause anxiety to so many people. The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West claimed that this was a minimal series of responsibilities for which to have people elected, but I believe that it entails a great deal more responsibility to exercise those powers across a metropolitan area or the Greater London area than is exercised by many elected district authorities.</p>

<p>Some of us have experience of trying to get this sort of agreement at local level when the interest of one borough or district is different from that of its neighbours. It is not easy to achieve. This is one area in which some hon. Members are sceptical about the Government's belief that co-operation and co-ordination will magically break out at district or borough level and that it will be all right on the night. This has not happened in practice because, for perfectly understandable and defensible reasons, local authorities fight their corner and for their people. They do not see the overall needs of the wider area, nor should they when they are elected to do a rather different job.<br/>
The Government accept that many of these conurbationwide powers cannot be exercised by individual authorities because the Government have created an extraordinary patchwork quilt of joint boards, quangos and other authorities. Much of the expert evidence heard


during the Committee stage gives the lie to the belief that there will be co-ordination and co-operation at borough and district level.<br/>
Their Lordships went some way to recognise that key services are best carried out at metropolitan level. I welcome the idea of a joint planning committee for Greater London which will give elected borough councillors a chance to discuss planning issues, to represent their views to the Secretary of State and to send representatives to the south-east planning body. Having provided that committee for London, why will the Government not provide the same machinery for the other metropolitan areas, where the problems are the same and sometimes even worse&#x2014;run-down inner city areas, declining industries, difficulty in attracting new developments and new jobs and problems with public and private transport? It is wildly illogical to provide that machinery for London and to deny it to the other metropolitan authorities.<br/>
I endorse what the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) said about the need to view inner city problems on a conurbationwide basis. Our experience of metropolitan government has made it clear that it is impossible to solve inner city problems on the basis of inner city areas alone. One must take a wider view. For example, the Thamesmead new town development in my constituency is a highly imaginative scheme originally launched by the Greater London council. No one could possibly suggest that such a gigantic project could have been undertaken by one or two borough or district authorities.<br/>

The philosophy of this legislation is in sharp contrast with commitments given by the Conservatives before they came to power in 1979. When the Labour Government were considering the question of organic change&#x2014;the idea of giving powers back to some of the biggest of the former county boroughs&#x2014;the present Secretary of State for Defence was reported in the Local Government Chronicle of 9 March 1979 to have told the Conservative party local government conference in March 1979 in his traditionally strong and robust manner that the Conservative party rejected the idea of a reform of local government structure. He said:
<q>I do not believe for one moment that the British people are looking for a major upheaval in local government.</q>
He went on to say:
<q>Change for change's sake or expensive experiments with the ratepayers' money must be ruled out and that must be the position of the Conservative party.</q>
The right hon. Gentleman announced that he had had discussions with the leaders of the Association of County Councils, the Association of District Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities. He went on to make a clear declaration:
<q>We are agreed that we do not seek another major reorganisation of local government because we are certain that change in this field is likely to be expensive and divisive.</q>
It has certainly been divisive, and from the Coopers and Lybrand studies it is clear that it will also be expensive. The GLC figure for the transitional costs is between &#x00A3;122 million and &#x00A3;167 million. Even on the most optimistic Coopers and Lybrand assessment it would take almost 12 years of annual savings to recoup that kind of expenditure.<br/>
The present Prime Minister, speaking at the same conference, promised a close relationship between a Conservative Government and Conservative local authorities. She declared:
<q>We've worked with you in Opposition. I want to say very strongly that we shall go on working with you in Government.</q>
Clearly, she felt that there was some scepticism on that point because she went on to say:
<q>In case that comes as a shock to those of you with long memories&#x2014;I repeat&#x2014;we shall go on working with you in Government. Good Government rests on a partnership between Whitehall and town hall.</q>
She concluded:
<q>We are going to give back to you more of the responsibility for running your own affairs.</q>
That will raise a very hollow laugh from many Conservative councillors up and down the country who are suffering even tighter control from the Department of the Environment. It would certainly get a short, sharp and rude response from those Conservative councillors whose councils will be abolished by the Bill. Conservative Members who believe in the traditional Conservative view of local government should support the amendments.</p>

<p>This short debate has allowed the House to rehearse various arguments which have been extensively debated on previous occasions in this House and in another place. In those circumstances, it would not be right for me to go on too long. I shall therefore set out briefly the Government view on the points made by the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) and others.<br/>
There seem to be three substantive issues. The first concerns planning in London. I was grateful for the welcome given by the hon. Member for Woolwich (Mr. Cartwright) to the amendment accepted in another place. Lords amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and the consequential Lords amendment No. 61 provide for a joint committee of borough council representatives instead of the appointed London planning commission originally envisaged in the Bill. The purpose of the joint committee would be to consider matters of common interest relating to the planning and development of Greater London and to inform the Secretary of State and neighbouring planning authorities of its views. It is important to note that the joint committee will not itself be a planning authority but an advisory committee, as the originally proposed London planning commission would have been.<br/>
The Lords amendments owe a good deal to the wisdom of my noble Friend Lord Sandford who has great experience in these matters. The London planning commission as an appointed expert body did not find much favour in another place. Instead, there was felt to be a need to co-ordinate the borough councils' approach to planning in and around London. The proposal for a joint committee has the support of the London Boroughs Association and of SERPLAN, the South East Regional Planning Conference. The Government are satisfied that that change made by the other place is an improvement, and I hope that the House will accept the relevant Lords amendments.<br/>
The Opposition amendments to Lords amendment No. 2 seek to do two things. First, they seek to extend the joint committee concept to the six metropolitan counties. Secondly&#x2014;the hon. Member for Norwood touched on this briefly &#x2014; they would empower the London joint committee, but, strangely, not the metropolitan joint committees, to issue guidance to which borough councils must have regard in preparing their unitary development plans.<br/>
I hope that the House will reject both Opposition amendments to Lords amendment No. 2. The Government remain unconvinced that there is any need for special planning machinery to cover the metropolitan county areas. In this context London is and always has been seen to be a special case. London has more than three times as many planning authorities as the largest metropolitan county and the impact of London's development on the surrounding area is far greater and more complex than that of any other conurbation in England. Our original proposal for a London planning commission recognised those facts and the decision to substitute a joint committee of the boroughs cannot alter the case against providing anything comparable for the metropolitan counties because there is simply no need for any such provision. Each of the metropolitan districts will be a powerful elected planning authority in its own right. To impose a joint planning committee would be an unnecessary bureaucratic top hamper and I advise the House to reject the amendments which call for it.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman may regard London's problems as quantitatively greater than those of areas such as Merseyside or Tyne and Wear, but under the Bill the powers granted to the joint planning commission for London will go to the Secretary of State in the case of the metropolitan counties. That is even more bureaucratic. Does the right hon. Gentleman envisage no possibility of conflict between district councils such as Liverpool and Sefton? Such conflict does not make for good local government planning. What advantage is there to the metropolitan counties in the system proposed in the Bill?</p>

<p>In the case of town and country planning powers in the metropolitan counties the proposal has always been that strategic guidance would be drawn up by the Department of the Environment in response to planning conferences held within the areas concerned. The broad, strategic guidance is and always has been a function of central Government Departments. To try to interpose an extra layer between the powerful district and borough planning authorities and the strategic guidance &#x2014; I emphasise the word "strategic"&#x2014;which must inevitably come from central Government will merely create confusion and difficulty, as has already occurred when large bodies of that kind interfere with the planning functions of a large number of districts and boroughs.<br/>
Thirdly, amendments to various parts of the Bill seek to provide for multi-purpose directly elected authorities either for London or for the six metropolitan counties or for all seven areas. A number of hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes), have spoken in favour of those amendments.<br/>
I note with some relief that this really is the last opportunity to debate this issue. No one has ever denied its importance. It has been the central issue in the Bill. It has been debated time and again at every stage of the Bill&#x2014;on clause 1 on the Floor of the House, on several occasions in the Standing Committee and again on Report. On that last occasion, on 27 March, the Voice for London amendment was defeated by 335 votes to 193. Now, undaunted &#x2014; perhaps refreshed after three months' freedom from the need to debate the matter &#x2014; hon. Members on both sides have returned to the charge yet again.</p>

<p>Although the amendments proposed today differ in some respects from those put forward on earlier occasions, neither they, nor, with great respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East, any of the speeches that we have heard today, begin to make out a case for successor authorities.<br/>
Those who advocate directly elected authorities for London and the metropolitan counties have consistently failed to answer the following point. They know that the present arrangements do not work. They know that the boroughs and districts are now the major providers of local government services in those areas. They also know that major strategic planning and strategic transport decisions inevitably fall to central Government rather than to local government. That has always been so and will continue to be so in the future. Any attempt to stake out an area between the strong boroughs and districts and the central Government functions to be covered by an intermediate tier responsible for planning, highways, waste disposal and so on is doomed to failure. It is a very small area and certainly not large enough to justify a separate directly elected authority.</p>

<p>The case for directly elected countrywide authorities for London or the metropolitan counties does not stand up. Between the functions of the boroughs and districts, which are the major providers of services, and the functions of central Government, which are and always have been wider than those of individual boroughs and districts, there is simply not room for an intermediate tier. Acting jointly, the boroughs and districts can, with central Government, provide all the co-ordination that is necessary.<br/>

<p>These amendments deal with the vexed subject of the trunking of the south circular road. As many Members will know, this road is a scar through the middle of an otherwise beautiful constituency. The level of traffic on it is totally unnecessary for the local area, and the road itself was not designed to take the level of traffic now on it. It is an unnecessary road, following the completion of the M25, and is totally inadequate.<br/>
There is no point in trying to upgrade the road, because, following what I hope will be improvements after a possible west London relief road has been constructed, this part of the south circular road will be rendered redundant. The main argument of my constituents is that under this Bill the trunking procedures required by the Highways Act 1980 are being abolished in the case of the south circular road. One can have public inquiries at any time up to the effective date of the Bill and at any time after the effective date of the Bill, but on the date the Bill is passed the rights of my constituents with regard to trunking will be removed.<br/>
6.15 pm<br/>
One of the other worries of my constituents is that the south circular road just shovels in the problem front somewhere else. The headaches and miseries my constituents suffer as a result of the traffic, especially lorries, are totally unacceptable and before the road is trunked they would like to express their total opposition to the whole subject of trunking. As a result of the effective abolition of the Highways Act by this Bill, the rights of my constituents will expunged.<br/>
I am grateful to the Government for building the M25, which will take a considerable amount of lorry and car traffic out of the south circular road areas. But the M25 will take only approximately 18 to 20 per cent. of that volume. In any event it is not yet finished, and we do not know what will be its exact effect. The democratic rights of my constituents ought to be enshrined in public inquiries before trunking takes place.<br/>
I cannot speak too highly of the Minister of State for the way she has tried through public meetings and through letters and interviews with local journals to put her side of the story. She has assured my constitutents that there will be public inquiries prior to any road widening schemes. She also says that no road widening schemes are planned at the moment, but, without prejudice to the assessment studies being carried out at the moment, if there is any widening later there will be public inquiries.<br/>
My constituents are somewhat jaundiced about Government assurances following the abolition of the 275,000 aircraft movement limit at Heathrow recently,


and therefore wish to have the opportunity of a public inquiry so that the inspector can properly hear the views of people in this area.<br/>
One of the things my hon. Friend the Minister does not fully appreciate, but I believe that her officals do, is that there is a basic difference between public inquiries into trunking proposals and public inquiries set up for road widening proposals following this legislation.<br/>
A trunk road inquiry differs substantially from an inquiry into a local authority road proposal, because whereas a local authority requires a compulsory purchase order and then a side road order, line orders are not made for local authority roads. Unlike a trunk road, planning permission is required for the construction of a new road by a local authority and where an inquiry is needed into the refusal of planning permission or a called-in application for a new road it will normally be held concurrently with the inquiries into the CPO and the SRO.<br/>
The promoting local authority at a public inquiry will be required to prove its case up to the hilt. Before objections are considered it will have to call evidence establishing the need for the road and justifying the scheme as being the best way of meeting that need. By contrast&#x2014;and this is where constitutionally the people of Richmond are getting a raw deal&#x2014;the purpose of a trunk road inquiry is not to enable the Secretary of State's case for building the road to be tested in public, but to inform the Secretary of State of the weight and nature of objections to the scheme. The key tasks of the inspector are to take account of objections from people affected by the proposals, to report on those objections and to make recommendations on the proposals. But perhaps the most controversial aspect of road trunk inquiries is that questions on Government policy are outside their scope. The procedural rules specifically require the inspector to disallow any questions which in his opinion are directed to the merits of Government policy. We believe that any inquiry before trunking would give full protection to my constituents. They demand that right.<br/>
I can do no better than quote some of the demands made by an organisation called Richmond Residents Against the A205 Trunking. That group has acted non-politically and in a completely non-partisan way. It has worked hard to try to bring to public attention the constitutional disaster that trunking under the Bill produces. I agree with every statement that the organisation makes. It stated:
<q>We want to cross the main road with no more difficulty than now. We do not want to have to use bridges and tunnels. We want to be able to take our children to school and to shop without being buffeted by vehicles of all sizes or weights. We do not want pavements narrowed in the shopping areas. We want to be able to shop freely on both sides of the road.</q>
Communities are otherwise destroyed.<br/>
<q>We do not want our main road run by a Whitehall department that sees it as a through route to somewhere else, attracting traffic through our constituency. We want the Government to accept any changes made by the House of Lords aimed at keeping London's roads under London control.</q>
The organisation wants a public inquiry.<br/>
My final worry is that, even if we had a public inquiry after the road had been trunked and were able to put forward the environmental matters that we believe should be considered with regard to any widening proposals of the south circular road, an inspector might have to resort to the Trunk Roads Act 1936, which describes trunk roads as:

<q>the principal roads in Great Britain which constitute the national system of routes for through traffic".</q>
In the face of that definition, an inspector would have to say, "I hear the environmental considerations put forward by the local community but, because it is a trunk road, in the national interest I shall order it to be widened." Our ability to complain has been eroded by the Bill.</p>

<p>I understand the worries of my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley), because he has expressed them time and again, as is his right. While I fully agree that conditions on the south circular road are completely unsatisfactory and have every sympathy with those who live, work and shop nearby, the road cannot be altered without a public inquiry. The distinctions that he drew between a local road inquiry and a trunk road inquiry are theoretical. Government policy will always be discussed at a trunk road inquiry. There has never been one where that has not occurred. In practice, therefore, the Secretary of State for Transport must justify his case fully. I cannot accept what my hon. Friend was saying about the difference between the two types of inquiry.<br/>
Amendments (b) and (c) which my hon. Friend has tabled have problems. First, amendment (b) is incompatible with the power contained in schedule 4 for the trunking of some metropolitan roads on abolition date. Amendment (c) would stop any trunking order anywhere in the country between now and April 1987 at the earliest, because, as my hon. Friend is aware, the power to trunk contained in schedule 4 has been debated and approved by both Houses.</p>

<p>I thought that I heard that mentioned before. I am asking the House to resist amendments (b) and (c), for the reasons that I have given. Amendment (c) would stop any trunking order anywhere in the country between now and April 1987 at the earliest. Given the correspondence which I frequently receive in which I am asked to trunk some roads, that would be in no one's interests.<br/>
We have debated the power to trunk contained in schedule 4, and it has been approved by both Houses of Parliament. Any proposals to trunk roads in London after abolition date would have to follow the procedures laid down in the Highways Act 1980. In other words, even if the residuary body conducted a review of metropolitan roads for 1987, any trunking proposals would still be subject to the provisions of the Highways Act 1980.<br/>
My hon. Friend is aware, and I repeat, that the ownership of GLC roads will be transferred to the appropriate successor authorities at abolition date. I resist amendment (b) because if we were to use the powers contained in the Highways Act 1980 there would be a long period of uncertainty, not just about the A205 in my hon. Friend's constituency, but about all the other parcels of land in the metropolis covered by that provision. It would


impose upon local ratepayers the cost of maintaining those major roads in the meantime. I do not believe that that is fair.<br/>
It is right for me and the Government to make clear what the transfer of ownership at abolition will mean. Similar transfers of ownership have been made through legislation before&#x2014;in 1936, 1946 and in 1963 when the GLC was established.<br/>
My hon. Friend asked about improvements. He said, "When?" I say, "if'. While we are seeking to improve the environment along the south circular road and in other places, there is no certainty that any of the matters which he and his constituents fear will occur. As he correctly said, we have no plans to improve the road. If there were any proposals to improve the road, they would all follow the normal procedure of public consultation and inquiry, and the full provisions of the Highways Act 1980 would bear upon the handling of the improvement proposals. The power contained in schedule 4 gives the Department no authority to carry out improvements. I hope that that is clear once and for all.<br/>
I repeat what we said in Committee, on Report and in the other place, that we shall not revive the ringway road and motorway box ideas. Those plans are long since dead and buried. Those who say that there will be concrete in various places across London which today are the city's lungs are merely scaremongering. They have been financed through the GLC to act in that way.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman knows that not every member of his party agrees council to council. I should have been surprised if after public inquiries those plans had then gone ahead. I am speaking for a large number of people, of whom I am one, living in the area. When the LCC proposed those plans, we knew what would happen if they were allowed to proceed. There are no proposals for a ringway road and a motorway box.<br/>
Amendment No. 4 seeks to transfer the GLC highway and financial responsibility to the London residuary body. I sympathise with some of the objectives of the clause, but it is unworkable and inconsistent. Perhaps I can tell the House why it is inconsistent with the general policy underlined in the Bill. The clause would retain a three-tier structure for highway responsibilities in London. It would introduce a new three-tier structure for traffic responsibilities, and it would run counter to overall policy on streamlining embodied in the Bill. It would greatly reduce &#x2014; perhaps even completely do away with &#x2014; those benefits which we expect from that streamlining. The residuary body is not a satisfactory body to run these responsibilities. The new clause envisages the GLC's

highway and traffic responsibility for metropolitan roads going to the residuary body, and that would be unsatisfactory, because it is only a temporary organisation for major functions such as highways and traffic, because they are permanent functions, and because the residuary body is only an appointed body.<br/>
6.30 pm<br/>
Both Houses have rejected amendments to establish directly or indirectly elected authorities for metropolitan roads, and therefore metropolitan roads would go to the boroughs, when the residuary body would be wound up. The boroughs are competent to take on the responsibilities for these roads and they are suitable authorities to do so. They are also directly elected. The new clauses are unworkable because they are completely inimical to sensible transport planning for London.<br/>
It is true that the residuary body is given certain responsibilities, but these are not set within the wider framework of traffic and highway or London-wide planning duties. Even with the amendments to the Bill which the House has passed tonight, that would not be so. The provisions envisage, in certain cases, dual responsibility for traffic management for the same roads between the residuary body and the boroughs, and I see that as a recipe for trouble indeed. They also create duplication of the reserve powers, with both the Secretary of State and the residuary body having some, but there is no clear division of responsibility for exercising them. They also envisage dual responsibility for prohibiting or restricting the use of lorries, but not for making it clear whether the borough or the residuary body has the final say. They also give the residuary body powers to make grants to any group, as its fancy takes it&#x2014;goodness knows what they might be&#x2014;but they do not establish the duties or the systems of accountability in relation to such grants.<br/>
The clause does not make proper financial provision for the exercise of highway and traffic functions proposed for the residuary bodies. These are major flaws and they are not the only ones. It is not a matter of tinkering to put these matters right. If the House were to agree with the amendment, substantial parts of the Bill would require major revision. This is not justified when the residuary body is only temporary and when appropriate and competent alternative authorities stand ready and are qualified to take on the responsibilities.<br/>
We recognise the need to maintain expert teams, specialist equipment and information gathering. We have always recognised that from the earliest planning days of the Bill. One of the most important things is to maintain the UTC system in London. That is exactly why there is reserve power in schedule 5. We recognise the importance of maintaining data collection and analysis, including accident statistics. We are already discussing with the boroughs how best to maintain the systems and we see the residuary body as providing a home for such systems and staff until permanent arrangements are settled with the boroughs. We do not need a separate strategic body, because our proposals make effective provision for handling the London-wide issues. I can go through those in detail, but the House knows full well what they are.</p>

constituents. Can she give any assurance that these matters, when they pass to the boroughs and also to her own Department, will be regularly debated by the House?</p>

<p>In so far as the boroughs have responsibility, these matters will be debated in the council chambers of those boroughs, but in so far as the Department has responsibility, just like any other responsibilities where the Department is answerable, we shall be answerable in the House. That is exactly the way it should be.<br/>
We are against the policy embodied in the new clause proposed by amendment No. 4 because the streamlining functions are there and we do not want duplication of administration and costs. The residuary body is not appropriate for these functions because it is only temporary and is only appointed. The detailed provisions are unworkable, wholly inadequate and, as I have said, would require major revision to remedy the defects. In any case, the highway and traffic responsibilities proposed to be transferred to the boroughs are primarily local in nature and are best handled at local borough level. The wider issues can be handled elsewhere where necessary. Those are the suitable arrangements about which I spoke.<br/>
The Government ask the House to disagree with the Lords amendment on the situation in the metropolitan county council areas because the clause also makes the arrangements proposed unworkable. It is particularly wrong to introduce into the metropolitan counties the three-tier structure of highway authorities which has already proved unsatisfactory in London. The strategic transportation authority was given a whole host of extra jobs to be done which should best be done at district level, such as traffic management guidance, taking over construction and maintenance of highway bridges, road safety and data collection&#x2014;all things which can be done adequately at district level.<br/>
The provisions of the clause are attractive only to those who believe that everything should be integrated. There is scope in the clause for regiments of staff to produce plans to co-ordinate public transport and traffic across the metropolitan counties, but the real needs of those districts are very different. Road systems in the metropolitan counties consist of interlinking networks of principal and other roads. Almost every journey involves travel on a principal and other road. It is wrong to have separate highways and traffic management responsibilities. Opponents of abolition have made much of the cross-boundary problems, but under the clause district councils would have to consult not only their neighbouring districts, which they should do anyway, but the joint authority, about almost every traffic problem, even down to double yellow lines.<br/>
There is no need for a further tier of highway and traffic authorities in the metropolitan areas, and the district councils will talk to each other, as they do already, about the small proportion of highways and traffic management work which requires their co-operation. I do not believe that the great city authorities, like Coventry or Leeds, cannot manage their roads and traffic in sensible co-operation with neighbouring districts.</p>

<p>My point about the roads in the metropolitan county council areas is this. We understand that some traffic problems and some road problems need to be considered over a wider district, and that is true of the boundaries of any local authority anywhere in the country. At professional level authorities have good working relationships and joint working arrangements are well precedented, so while I am confident that sensible co-operation will usually prevail, as I have said before, from time to time, just as between other unconnected authorities, problems will arise. For this reason the original provisions provide a framework within which those districts can operate to ensure that wider considerations are properly taken into account.</p>

<p>The Minister has just made the point that in most counties there is one authority. That is because in most counties the travel-to-work area is within one shire county boundary. Does she accept that some at least of the metropolitan areas, archetypically Merseyside, have at present a county area which encompasses one travel-to-work area? Therefore, for example, people do not suddenly cross the Wirral boundary, the Sefton boundary or the Knowsley boundary to Liverpool. They go in and out within that county, and for that county, if not for anybody else, to have no strategic authority higher than district level authority goes against all the logic and all travel patterns and movements.</p>

<p>I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is not quite right. The travel-to-work area in my region of Merseyside happens to be Wirral and Chester. Chester is in the Cheshire county council area and Wirral remains for a few months yet in Merseyside. Therefore, we continually cross between two county areas with no difficulty and good co-operation. However, that co-operation happens at local level. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that people observe where the boundary is most of the time, he is in difficulty, because, unlike the French, we do not have signs showing when one is going into or leaving an area.<br/>
Schedule 5 contains powers for the Secretary of State to issue guidance to local authorities on traffic management. If the guidance is disregarded, with the likelihood of adverse consequences for a wider area, then, but only in that case, would the Secretary of State intervene if he thought it necessary. Similarly, occasion other local authorities object to a traffic scheme affecting their areas, and if objections cannot be resolved the Secretary of State will, subject to consultation, be able to determine the issue.<br/>
One of the most important area-wide traffic management task is the operation of the urban traffic control systems. The Government are fully committed to ensuring continuity in London and the metropolitan counties, and the Bill provides reserve powers for that. If the districts are unable to reach a satisfactory agreement, the Secretary of State can take over such responsibilities. I do not believe that it will be necessary for the Secretary of State to do so, because I believe that in order to carry out their new functions districts will need specialist staff


and facilities from the metropolitan county council. A Government amendment from the other place, which we shall consider later, requires residuary bodies to consult successor bodies about likely needs. The residuary bodies can then take over special manpower facilities, and that will ensure a smooth transition on abolition day.<br/>
It is time for districts to get down to considering the ways in which they will meet their highway and traffic responsibilities. They are ready to do so. They do not need strategic authorities, which would simply perpetuate some of the worst features of the metropolitan county councils, and even add to them. That would not be a recipe for improved conditions. Therefore, I hope that the House will disagree with Lords amendment No. 5 as well.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend. I was just about to say that I do not think the Minister believed a word of her brief. She did not appear to convince too many of her hon. Friends, but then again she does not have to. As we saw in Committee, those Tory Members who bother to say anything about the legislation are few and far between, and those who do not bother to say anything vote for the Government anyway, so the Minister does not have too much to worry about.<br/>
It will be a sad day for the House when this undemocratic legislation goes through virtually on the nod, as it will by midnight tonight. It will destroy a tier of local government that, whatever its faults over the past 10 years, has proved, particularly in traffic functions, to have been exceedingly valuable and done much good work. The Minister's unconvincing explanation was an illustration of the fact that what the Government are doing tonight they are doing as a result of a Prime Ministerial afterthought in the drafting of the 1983 general election manifesto.<br/>
The Government are carrying through abolition without any consideration of the invevitable chaos that will follow when it will fall to those who are at present doing this work in local government to try to make some sort of order out of the chaos &#x2014; they will try, as they always do. I shall come to the point made by the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley) in a moment.<br/>
6.45 pm<br/>
Lords amendment No. 4 deals specifically with London. During the passage of the Bill through the other place, numerous amendments were tabled with the aim of transferring the strategic highway traffic problems to an appropriate single authority to replace the GLC. Directly and indirectly elected bodies were proposed, with obvious local democratic advantages, as well as the London residuary body. In the many hours of debate on this important issue, cogent arguments from both sides of the other place overwhelmingly supported the need for London-wide co-ordination and for integrated solutions to London's complex problems.<br/>
Integrated solutions are necessary even though, these days, the Minister sneers at such solutions. Not long ago

she was a fervent and passionate advocate of them. She now has to follow a doctrine, but most people, including a majority of the other place, feel that integration for traffic functions is necessary. The Minister may have picked up her boss's habit of sneering at the word "integration", but nevertheless a majority of her party in the other place felt that integration of these functions was called for, and voted for it.<br/>
The way that the Minister read out her brief shows that perhaps she should spend some time in private discussons &#x2014; we shall not embarrass her by urging her to make them public &#x2014; with some of her political colleagues at the end of the Corridor, because on this occasion they have proved to be more progressive than she is. She normally likes to be thought of as the progressive, warm and humane voice of the Department of Transport and it must be a real problem for her to have to come to the House to read a brief that was more suitable for the abrasive tone of her boss the Secretary of State for Transport.<br/>
The Minister has failed to produce any sound arguments to explain how two Departments &#x2014; <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Lady has a patronising air. I know that she loves to see herself as the Marjorie Proops of the Government Front Bench. She dispenses advice such as fasten seat belts, do not drink too much, do not be naughty. That is her general philosophy. Tonight she has a brief that does not enable her to do that. She has to read something saying that integration and all the things in which she used to believe, and which she used warmly to endorse and recommend to the nation, if they would take the trouble to listen, are all in the past. These days, to keep her job, she has to prove that she is just as nasty, hard-line and Right wing as the Secretary of State for Transport.<br/>
The hon. Lady dismissed all the arguments for integration and for a London-wide authority for highways. The fact that she has said that it will not work does not make it so. The majority of the other place, and therefore the majority of the Conservatives in the other place, has decided that it will. For once, we have to believe it.</p>

<p>We had exchanges on this point as recently as last Monday. Once again, when the Minister's inherent goodness was called in question by Labour Members, she stamped her foot and said that such criticism was terribly unfair. However, I do not wish to debate the M1 motorway now.<br/>
It is for the Minister of State to convince her hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes that she is not about to turn his constituency into a motorway. I do not know how convincing she was; no hon. Member will know until the hon. Gentleman comes to a decision at the end of the debate. However, I found the Minister of State's reply to her hon. Friend singularly unconvincing. It was as unconvincing as the rest of her speech.<br/>
The other place believes that there are considerable advantages in the amendment that the Government are seeking to remove. I am not allowed to refer directly to what was said in the other place, and I would not dream of doing so, but it is possible to paraphrase what was said by those Conservative Members of the other place who


participated in the debate. With one exception, the Government had no supporters. Some of the speeches should leave the Minister of State in no doubt about the lack of support that their proposals command and about the widespread concern that is felt in both Houses about their inherently undemocratic nature.<br/>
The Opposition believe that there are numerous advantages in amendment No. 4. The advantages that were incorporated by the other place mean that the substantial though negative powers of the Secretary of State have been removed. The old fashioned Conservative party would have supported their removal. It professed not to like over-centralisation. If Conservative Members believe that the Secretary of State is hardly the person to leave in charge of a whelk stall on a wet Whit Monday, never mind being in charge of London's strategic highways and planning functions, they ought so to indicate when they have the opportunity to vote.<br/>
Amendment No. 4 retains economies of scale arising from the handling of large-scale programmes. The Minister of State was singularly unconvincing about the fragmentation of these functions if the Lords amendment is rejected. The amendment retains a degree of centralised leadership regarding the assessment of priorities and there would be central funding of projects where that is most needed. Is there to be competition between the boroughs? That would mean that those who shouted the loudest, or put in their bids first, would get the financial wherewithal to carry out their role, instead of sensible, centralised planning for highways.<br/>
The amendment would provide the body concerned with sufficient breadth and a sufficiently large budget to sustain specialist teams with the computer back up and data collection systems that were referred to in Committee. Few hon. Members who heard the Committee debate would doubt the need for capital-wide planning for these functions.<br/>
As for amendment No. 5, the Government were found to have few friends in the other place for their metropolitan county council proposals. The other place made it clear, to say the least, that it was very unhappy about the Government's proposals, particularly about the proposal to devolve highway and traffic functions to district councils. Lord Molson referred to the unsatisfactory nature of the Government's proposals. Although the Minister of State is pulling a face at me for referring to Lord Molson, I think that it is in order for me to mention in passing what he said. Let me try the Earl of Cranbrook on the hon. Lady. He was the Chairman of the Select Committee which had some harsh words to say about the Government's proposals. It is no use for the Minister of State to hide her face and whisper. If she is cross with the more senior members of her party in the other place, that is a matter for her. The Earl of Cranbrook referred to bridge and highway design, major road schemes, urban traffic control, data gathering and travel demand forecasting and said that all such matters ought to be dealt with by a strategic transport authority.<br/>
It is significant that the Government's proposals for the metropolitan county councils have been found to be completely unsatisfactory. The Select Committee of another place has also published a report on the Government's proposals. I assume that a majority of

Conservative party members serve upon it. The noble Earl to whom I have referred is the Chairman of that Committee and at column 62 of the Select Committee's report he said:
<q>voluntary joint committees appear unlikely to be to resolve the inevitable policy conflicts, or lead authorities to resolve the conflict between their service role and their policy interests.</q>
The report then said that a more practical option would be a joint authority. It is remarkable when the, in our view, undemocratially appointed members of another place lecture an elected Conservative Government about local democracy. If somebody had said to me a decade or so ago that this would happen, I should have expressed great surprise. The Government have no friends for these proposals.<br/>
Amendment (b) was moved by the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes. It is a wondrous thing, having the smallest Conservative majority in England&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, I have not finished yet. The hon. Gentleman had a fairly good run. I think that I am on fairly safe ground if I say that he has the smallest Conservative majority in any London constituency. The hon. Gentleman appeared on television, which gave him the opportunity to explain the difficulties that his Richmond constituents will face if the Government's proposals are accepted. I ask again: Has the Minister of State fully satisfied her hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes? If so, he will let the House know, but I shall be surprised if he has been satisfied by the Minister of State's explanation. She said that if the powers contained in the Highways Act were used, her hon. Friend's constituents would face long periods of uncertainty. That was the Minister of State's phrase; I wrote it down.<br/>
I hope that the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes will agree with me that uncertainty is exactly what his constituents are facing now. One of the reasons why they have written to him is to demonstrate that they are already suffering because of the long period of uncertainty caused by the Government's proposals. If the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes is satisfied by the Minister of State's explanation, he will say so, but, if not, he will not complain if I exploit that fact. He has had a good run this evening, even though there was insufficient time to debate the matter in Committee because of the appalling, undemocratic guillotine procedure to which the Government have had to resort to get the legislation through this House.<br/>
If, like me, the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes is denounced for scaremongering &#x2014; that is what the Minister of State will say about him if he refuses to accept her explanation &#x2014; he will have to live with it. Some of us will make sure that the Minister's comments receive fairly wide circulation not only in the hon. Gentleman's constituency but in the other parts of London where people are worried about these proposals.<br/>

<p>Whilst I agree with the principle of abolition and the Bill's main provisions, I believe it right to consider whether there are better ways of preserving some local centres of great excellence. My constituency, which is on the boundary of west Yorkshire and north Yorkshire, falls within Leeds and the urban traffic control area of the west Yorkshire metropolitan county council. I accept the arguments that have been advanced by my hon. Friend the Minister of State that an area on the border of different traffic authorities &#x2014; the problem is exacerbated in my constituency as the Al goes through the middle of it &#x2014; emphasises the importance of consultation and of working together. Nevertheless, I am concerned that the centre of excellence represented by west Yorkshire's urban traffic control system should be effectively preserved.<br/>
The system in west Yorkshire is one of the most advanced in this country, if not in the world. It is highly integrated and inter-active between a complementary range of services. Many of its ideas for road construction and embankments are especially innovative. The system is a considerable source of pride to the people of west Yorkshire.<br/>
It is possible for my hon. Friend the Minister of State to say that, with such a centralised system, a lead authority such as Leeds where the central computer is situated could be an effective way of running the system. However, when dealing with urban traffic control a number of priorities have to be balanced and local jealousies between different

district authorities might preclude the effective working of the system, particularly if the lead authority is especially large.<br/>
How will the Government ensure that that system is not broken up if the district authorities are not able to agree?</p>

<p>The expertise of the west Yorkshire team is very impressive. I have seen the team in operation. It is right that we should safeguard that expertise. That is where the residuary body can supply the temporary home. The officers of the west Yorkshire county council have said that they believe that they have a role to play. They have formed a company and could use their expertise as a privately run centre of expertise on offer to all districts in the area. That is exactly what we would expect them to do. The co-ordinating committees would have the duty to consider joint arrangements.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that comment.<br/>
I am especially worried about the time scale on which change will occur. The people who work for the urban traffic control system in west Yorkshire have very marketable skills. Many of them have been approached by consultants and other companies outside the public sector seeking to snap up their services. These people are highly motivated. They want to work within west Yorkshire's integrated system. Obviously, if they see an uncertain future, they may be tempted by some of the offers. Indeed, I understand that some have already gone to work elsewhere.<br/>
I am seeking a clear commitment from the Government that, if the district authorities are unable to co-operate to preserve the urban traffic control system in west Yorkshire, they will step in and ensure that this centre of excellence, which is so highly prized by the people of the area, is retained. The Lords amendment provides one means of doing this. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State can give sufficiently firm assurances of another.</p>

<p>We are discussing one of the principal parts of the Bill. The other place took the view that transport planning should be "integrated" with the running of transport services. Two large amendments are being considered &#x2014; the first concerns London and the second concerns the metropolitan authorities. I do not think that the Minister of State admits to understanding why we are so keen to persuade her that it would be better to agree with the Lords, so I shall remind her.<br/>
No one would say from choice that a body called the "London residuary body", which is a collective of people appointed by the Secretary of State, is the best organisation to take on the co-ordinated planning functions of transport in London. There are not many options available if the Government get rid of a directly elected strategic authority&#x2014;the option of no co-ordinating body, or the option of something that is better than nothing.<br/>
The measure is strongly supported because many people, including most experts who have given evidence, would rather have a co-ordinating body that can consider the problems of London traffic and strategy as a whole. They do not want it to be a Minister.<br/>
To give a practical example, outside my street door there is a small road with a wall beyond it, and on the other side of the wall is a large open space that could well become a main road. I would far rather that the people


making decisions about what happens to that space, and whether it ever becomes a through road from the Bricklayers Arms down to Woolwich or anywhere else, were a group of non-elected people with special responsibility for all London. I would prefer that body &#x2014; which could eventually, because it might survive a bit longer than the Government, be converted back into a group of elected representatives &#x2014; to make the decision rather than that the Secretary of State did. I trust a group of people, and preferably a group of elected people, far more than I trust the Secretary of State to make a decision about the strategic planning of roads in London and what should travel on them.</p>

<p>The SDP and the Liberal party will tell the hon. Gentleman &#x2014; he now knows it because he has heard it often &#x2014; that we entered into the debate on the Bill knowing our policy for London and not having to announce it this morning, as did the Leader of the GLC on the radio and elsewhere. Our policy has always been that London needs a regional authority directly elected which should cover these powers and many others. The new super-expanded GLC, for which the present GLC chairman and others will be fighting, is a concept that they have adopted from us, and we have been arguing it for a long time. I am sorry they are so slow at reaching the right conclusion, but that is not unusual. [HON. MEMBERS: "What about quangos?"] We do not want a quango, but we do not want the Secretary of State deciding what should happen in London transport in strategic planning terms.<br/>
As regards outside London, according to the amendment, the strategic highway functions which are now governed by the county councils should go to the passenger transport authority which is being set up under the Bill. In the course of debates, it has become clear that some very popular services are being produced by local government in the metropolitan counties. The Tyne and Wear Metro service is one, the public transport service in south Yorkshire is another. They are popular because they are good services, well used, and cheap and because expertise is co-ordinated in running them and in planning for the future. They link the number of people who want to use transport with the transport provided, be it roads or rail lines.<br/>
I ask the Minister to say that it is appropriate, as we proposed in the other place, to accept that in the metropolitan areas we, too, co-ordinate to avoid this muddle. The Government are asking us to believe that, in a series of discussions, the districts can agree on some of the most controversial issues. Such issues cannot be reconciled if one district believes that there should be a road while the other does not, and the two districts are adjacent.<br/>
I wish to comment on the amendment of the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley). He has been under a lot of pressure from his constituents, quite rightly. We all know the effect of a power which allows the Secretary of State to make decisions about the trunking of roads in London and all the implications on the hon.<br/>
Gentleman's constituents and all the people who live along the south circular road, in the borough of Southwark and beyond of trunking in London. Given the Minister's intention that many roads like the south circular will be trunked, the result will be roads which have more traffic, more disruption and more environmental problems for the people who live and work alongside them.<br/>
The amendment is a modest one, and I am surprised that the Minister does not accept that the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes needs her support. However hard the hon. Gentleman will have tried, he will have had to tell his constituents that I and others have argued the case that there ought to be a public inquiry before roads in London are trunked, but it fell on deaf ears &#x2014; Tory deaf ears, Tory Government deaf ears and even the deaf ears of the Minister, who has her home not all that far from the south circular.<br/>
If the Government do not think again, the Lords may well stand by what they said last time and the Government may risk losing the Bill as a whole instead of enacting it with amendments that come from sane and sanguine proposals made by people who are trying to improve an appalling piece of legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) is not alone in being worried about the accumulation of power to the Secretary of State which is the basis of the matters that we are now discussing. Due to a quirk of our procedure, amendment (a) tabled by the hon. Member for Harrow, East (Mr. Dykes) cannot be discussed in this section because it has already been debated.<br/>
There are obviously grave shortcomings about the residuary body for London. I am concerned about Lords amendment No. 4 only, and not about the other metropolitan counties. I had hoped that the Government would say that, because the other place has looked at the matter carefully, considered the various implications of what is proposed and decided that there should be a Londonwide body to carry out these functions, they would pay respect to that and, if we do not like the residuary body, would find some other way of operating this overall power.<br/>
7.15 pm<br/>
As someone who has had a certain amount of experience of local government at county and district level, I cannot see how matters will work out in practice when we get down to the nitty-gritty of planning roads in London in future with the various traffic aspects involved, even if it is only a system of traffic lights. I cannot see how that will be worked voluntarily by the boroughs.<br/>
The power going to the Secretary of State will be considerable, and can be exercised only with an increased number of staff. I know this is rather like twice cooked meat &#x2014; we have been round this course so often in the past in relation to the Bill. It is a question of how one views local government and forms one's ideas on that basis. None the less, I think it is sad that the Government are to resist the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>The need for an integrated countywide authority is very great in an area like Merseyside. I am surprised that the Minister does not recognise the true needs of Merseyside and how these are likely to be jeopardised if the Bill&#x2014;and particularly this part of it &#x2014; is enacted.<br/>
On Merseyside, the principal road network takes up 10 per cent. of the total network in the area. Although the principal roads represent only 10 per cent., they carry 50 per cent. of the traffic. Most of the business traffic and heavy goods vehicles cross the boundaries between the various districts. Fifty per cent. of car drivers commute across district boundaries in Merseyside. I cannot accept the point that the Minister made in reply to the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes). The travel-to-work area for most of those people who live in the built-up parts of the Wirral, the old constituency of Wallasey and Birkenhead is undoubtedly across the river Mersey into the rest of the conurbation, and particularly into Liverpool.<br/>
If one looks beyond the highways, one finds that 80 per cent. of traffic signals on Merseyside are under central computerised control. Therefore, a countywide operation is essential, for which the districts are not automatically prepared. Urban traffic control cannot be managed in isolation from all the other traffic and highway functions such as the collection and analysis of data traffic management, road improvements and route signing, all of which are closely bound up with urban traffic control.<br/>
There are many specialist services which must be shared for economic reasons. It is clear that they are too costly to duplicate. I cannot conceive that Sefton, the Wirral, Liverpool, St. Helens and Knowsley will be able to provide services to provide urban traffic control, research and development, bridge inspection and maintenance, engineering laboratories, geo-techncial surveys and materials testing and development. All these services are highly costly.<br/>
It can be argued that it is possible for such services to be provided by someone else, and I think that the Government have someone else in mind. They are not concerned with replacing one democratic countywide authority with another such body, which might be elected indirectly by the people of Merseyside through their district councils. All the evidence would seem to point in the other direction. The authority that the Government have in mind is the Secretary of State for Transport. Heaven help us if he were to take control. One example of his control is the shambles of the Transport Bill that is before Parliament.<br/>
Districts do not necessarily have coincidental interests. There may be many conflicts between district councils over the need to provide, maintain or restore certain roadways. A district council could downgrade a vital strategic route either explicitly or by neglect at the expense of essential traffic that is generated elsewhere.<br/>
The real reason for the introduction of the Bill, and the reason why no adequate democratically elected control of authorities is envisaged within it, is that the Government dislike the present political control of the metropolitan counties. That is the sole reason for the Bill being before us. If Merseyside were run by the Conservative party, for example, the Bill would not be with us.<br/>
If the Minister of State is suggesting that the district councils will be able to afford to provide the services and functions that we are discussing, I believe that she is quite wrong. New clause 8 would forestall the real danger of continuing central Government encroachment on local responsibility for principal roads. That is why the House should approve it. It obviates the need for the reserve powers that the original Bill sought to give the Secretary of State.<br/>
There are those who say that the Secretaries of State for Transport and for the Environment genuinely envisage the district councils having more power over highways, that they are democratically elected and that there is nothing sinister about the Bill. A real sign of the Department of Transport's intentions on strategic highway issues is to be found in a guidance note that the Department issued recently to district councils to assist them in planning for their enhanced transport responsibilities. The existing strategic functions of the metropolitan county councils is scarcely mentioned and there is no reference to the relevant manuals and advice notes. Against that background, and with the reserve powers that are contained in the Bill being directed specifically at matters of more than local significance, it seems that the Department rather than the districts will be the de facto highway authority for principal roads under the Bill's original provisions.<br/>
A provision for a countywide highway authority would impede the covert increase in Government power and responsibility. That is why new clause 8 is essential even to support the Government's argument, which I do not think they believe in themselves, that there must be co-operation between the districts to obtain a countywide integrated highway system.<br/>
I invite the Government to issue a new guidance note. I suggest that they refer to the competent manuals on the subject. Let them ensure that there is democratic control and that the expertise of the teams of workers in areas such as Merseyside is maintained. The Minister of State has told us that she has been to west Yorkshire and has spoken to the experts in that area. She commends what they have done. I hope that she has visited Merseyside as well, whose experts are at risk of being thrown to the winds. They are people of substance and the enactment of the Bill could oblige them to seek employment in other areas. If we are to allow Liverpool, Sefton, the Wirral, St. Helens and Knowsley to have the same expertise as has been available in those areas and built up since 1974, the hon. Lady should examine closely the contents of new clause 8. I hope that the Government will adopt the clause, but I appreciate that I am entering into a dialogue with the deaf.<br/>
Unless there is a sign in the Government's response to these amendments that their intention is to keep local government local, it is inevitable that we shall be presented with a national network that will involve more bureaucracy from the centre.</p>

<p>It has always seemed to me that roads, especially local roads, involve issues that become personal. Roads and associated considerations arouse strong sentiments when they are discussed by those who live near them. The Government have recognised that by providing that in the main the highway authority should be the local council. I do not dispute the views that have been expressed by my hon. Friends the Members for Elmet (Mr. Batiste) and Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley). I do not dispute the views that we have heard from the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Mr. Wareing) because I do not know the facts.<br/>
However, I am only too well aware of the story of two roads. I live close by the south circular road, which is notorious in London. I have knowledge also of a road that is yet to be born, we hope, which is the Kingston relief


road, which is within the royal borough of Kingston upon Thames. This road will have a serious effect on my constituents who are business men in Kingston.<br/>
The south circular road has been under the strategic control&#x2014;I use the term loosely&#x2014;of the Greater London council. The road is well known as a collection of signposts. It weaves its way across south London. If I had a pound for every time someone has stopped me in one of our suburban highways off the so-called south circular road to ask me whether they were still on it, I should be a very wealthy man. The south circular road is a positive disgrace and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond and Barnes will confirm that. Over the years the GLC has failed completely to maintain a proper highway for those who want to cross south London. As a local resident, I would rather that the road fell under the control of the Department of Transport than under the GLC. I would prefer the local authority in my area, the excellent borough of Wandsworth, to deal with local matters.<br/>
7.30 pm<br/>
The Kingston relief road is a classic case of how this fag-end Greater London council is behaving in a particularly partisan way. The GLC secured money from the taxpayer for some of the strategic road schemes in London by using various cases. One of the cases involved the Kingston relief road which, as is well known, is required in Kingston upon Thames. The GLC has that money from the taxpayer in its coffers, yet it refuses to hand it over to the council of the royal borough which is to take on the construction management of that road. It has instead, quite deliberately in my opinion, handed over the money to local authorities controlled by the Labour party in various parts of the GLC area.<br/>
That is the way that the strategic authority, the GLC, manages affairs, as far as I can see. I think that it will be better for the people of London, for whom I speak in part, if the responsibility rests with their local authority and, thereafter, with the Department of Transport. I support the Government recommendation that we should disagree with the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>When the Minister was telling us why the Lords amendment should be opposed, she said that the reason was that it was not consistent with streamlining. I did not feel that she could say that without cracking into a large smile and then a big belly laugh because she cannot believe that the Bill streamlines anything in terms of either transportation or other services.<br/>
I ask the Minister to look carefully at the Bill to see how many successor bodies will inherit the powers of the GLC and the metropolitan county councils. I do not have the time to read through them, but they include joint boards, residuary bodies, co-ordinating joint committees and quangos &#x2014; a total of 62 bodies. Then there are the Government Departments &#x2014; the Department of the Environment, the Department of Transport, the Office of Arts and Libraries, the Department of Education and Science and the Home Office. That is another five. Then there are approximately 127 other local authorities. The grand total is 195. Has the Minister ever studied how many bodies will inherit from the GLC and the metropolitan county councils?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, the chairman of the GLC, for giving way. He is speaking specifically about London so I shall confine my remarks to that. Has he considered how many times the requests of a London borough have to be rubber-stamped or gone through again by the GLC? Why does a borough that needs double yellow lines to make a turn-out from a service road safe have to go to the GLC transportation committee? That is the duplication that we are getting rid of. That is the streamlining that we are doing.</p>

<p>That is an interesting point. Has the Minister read the Lords amendment? The hon. Lady will see that the amendment that the Government now seek to overturn was careful to devolve traffic responsibilities on borough roads to the individual boroughs. They would become responsible for traffic signing, signals, parking, pedestrian crossings and speed regulation on the roads. That would considerably reduce duplication.<br/>
Whatever the Minister thinks about the GLC, she should not be opposing the Lords amendment. It gives her precisely what she just argued for at the Dispatch Box. She has not read the Lords amendment, and does not understand the consequences of the Bill with regard to streamlining. It is nonsense, and the hon. Lady knows it.</p>

<p>I am surprised that the Opposition should be so vehemently opposed to greater powers being transferred to the boroughs. After all, they have been trying to criticise the Government in our long debates on the Bill, saying that not enough power is being given to the boroughs, that we are not devolving enough power, and that what Conservative Members have been arguing, which is that the whole purpose of the Bill is to give local people a say in local matters, is rubbish. Once they have an opportunity to see real powers being given to the boroughs, the Opposition oppose that.<br/>
From my point of view in the London borough of Enfield, it makes sense that the borough should be the responsible authority. It is already responsible for all but very few roads in the borough. The Bill will increase efficiency and reduce costs if the borough is responsible for the few remaining roads in the borough&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall not give way because I think that some of the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friends still wish to speak.<br/>
The GLC's behaviour on road matters has been extraordinary. It uses partisan tactics to stop boroughs that want to go ahead with road schemes in the interests of the local citizens from doing so. There is an example in the borough of Enfield, where the Barnet and Enfield lorry ban has been held up by the GLC, so that the local citizens will not benefit from relief from heavy traffic in the area. We have seen the same example in south London where the GLC, despite the advice of its friends in Southwark and Lewisham, has tried to stop the relief road from the Old Kent road being developed.<br/>
The local boroughs need to have those powers so that we can develop roads and road policy in London that are to the advantage of local citizens.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) hit the nail on the head. It is patently obvious that the Minister of State either has not read the Bill or has not read the Lords amendment.


She said that there was duplication, but the contrary is the case.

<p>I think that the hon. Lady has to come into the real world. She will realise that after I have finished.<br/>
There was a Bill on local government in 1972. Being adaptable, local government conformed to the Bill. One of its requirements was that local government should integrate. Was it surprising that it did just that? That was the wish of the Government of the day. The unreasonable argument, "It was like that in the past, and the old county boroughs had those functions," is so naive that Opposition Front Bench spokesmen should not have to expose it. It assumes that nothing happened until the county boroughs became county boroughs. However, the contrary is the case. Because the metropolitan county councils and metropolitan districts were set up under the remit of a Conservative Government in the 1972 Act, services were centralised and systems integrated, such as the Tyne and Wear Metro, many bus services, the central control of traffic movements, and specialised teams to co-ordinate their areas of responsibility. It is no surprise that that happened, but it is surprising that the Minister does not believe that it happened.<br/>
If the Lords amendment No. 4 is not accepted, local authorities will be required quickly to dismantle everything that was set up under that Conservative Government. Many Conservative Members seem to favour the Bill so long as it does not affect their constituencies, and where it does affect their areas they have asked the appropriate Minister to make concessions and deviate from the Bill. They must also come into the real world, because that cannot be done.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and I shall return to that relevant point.<br/>
I was talking about specialised teams. They are already starting to break up and, not unnaturally, to look elsewhere. The Minister is on record as saying that the Government recognise the specialised teams and would like to keep them, but they leave it to God and good neighbour and do nothing themselves to ensure that those teams continue to exist.<br/>
I now come to the point of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Mr. Corbyn). Apart from integration, the Government believe that there is a strategic role, and that there should be overall planning and control in large areas. The basic difference between us is that the Opposition believe that there should be local democratic control. The Government have set themselves up in London as a de facto strategic body and, therefore, they obviously believe in overall planning and control. They believe that they should be in control and that the local voice should not be heard.<br/>
The strategic body in London for transport will be the Department of Transport, and it will have powers, to which it can add ad nauseam at any time. Even the Government's friends in the other place see through that kind of argument. On the Select Committee&#x2014;I shall not quote from its report because I have no time &#x2014; the Government do not even have a friend of their own persuasion. Time and time again professional people, hon. Members and their Lordships have rubbished the Government's arguments.<br/>
The Government have tried to hide the arguments by bringing the Bill back to the Floor of the House, and pushing it through at the speed of light. There is no substance behind anything that the Minister has said because integrated systems already exist. If we do not pass the Lords amendment, we shall leave overall control to voluntary co-ordination. I have news for the Minister &#x2014; there is no such animal.<br/>
The Government want to ensure that the specialised teams continue to exist, but that will not happen. In the past where joint organisations have been set up and failed to agree, it has been to the detriment of those whom they serve.<br/>
I remind the Minister of the content of her speech. She spent 14 minutes on the amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Richmond and Barnes (Mr. Hanley), seven minutes on amendment No. 4, which dealt with London, and the glorious sum of five minutes on a major alteration&#x2014;</p>

<p>When the Bill left this House it provided for the responsibility of the GLC and the MCC for waste disposal and regulation to be devolved to borough and district councils. It also provided a reserve power so that if my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment was not satisfied that the boroughs and districts had agreed on adequate voluntary joint arrangements for the discharge of those functions he could impose statutory authorities for some or all of those functions in all or part of any metropolitan area. As amended in the other place, the Bill now provides for waste regulation and disposal functions to be transferred to a single joint authority in each area, without any opportunity for the boroughs and districts to put forward proposals themselves to assume those functions on abolition.<br/>
The other place was concerned in particular that there should be certainty about future arrangements for waste disposal, and especially for the disposal of hazardous waste. These concerns are shared by hon. Members in all parts of this House. The Government have always recognised the need for adequate arrangements for waste disposal after abolition. With regard to hazardous waste, the guidance note issued to authorities by the Department on 28 March made it clear that we wished to see the creation of a separate unit in each metropolitan area to coordinate these and other non-operational functions. These units could house the specialist staff and facilities which are necessary for these functions and about which there was particular concern in another place.<br/>
We do not accept that joint authorities need to be the only or necessarily the best means of achieving adequate arrangements and it is right that the Government should take account of the strong concerns expressed both in this House and in another place.<br/>
I believe that the boroughs and districts are in the first instance best placed to judge the most appropriate arrangements for their areas. The Conservative boroughs to which I have spoken take that view. I have also spoken in an unofficial capacity to several of the Labour-controlled districts outside London and they tell me that they take the same view. I appreciate that the Labour-controlled districts have some difficulty in expressing their full opinions on this issue. We propose, therefore, that waste regulation and disposal functions should be devolved to the boroughs and districts. If, however, my right hon. Friend is satisfied that joint arrangements could, with advantage, be made for the discharge of some or all of those functions in the whole or part of any metropolitan area, and adequate joint arrangements have not been made by 15 November 1985, he will have a duty &#x2014; I stress that it will be a duty &#x2014; by order to establish a statutory authority to discharge those functions.</p>

<p>Why have the Government retreated from the September deadline in the earlier draft stressed in another place as being the time limit for the Secretary of State to be satisfied?</p>

<p>In the continuing discussions there is considerable co-operation between many of the Conservative boroughs and the Liberal boroughs in London and in Conservative boroughs in the districts, but


the Labour boroughs in London have not joined in any discussions, and in the metropolitan counties the Labour districts have not formally engaged in discussions. We have every reason to believe that they have well developed plans, particularly in the constituency of the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw). In many areas outside London it is clear that some subterranean planning has been carried out. I understand that the Labour leaders of the district councils have been unable to come out officially because it is still their policy not to co-operate before Royal Assent. The Government therefore thought it appropriate to extend the deadline to 15 November as the latest date by which the Secretary of State will have to exercise his duty.</p>

<p>As the right hon. Gentleman formerly represented a constituency next to mine, he knows the problems of north-west London. How does he envisage the 32 London boroughs being able in any way to come to separate arrangements without massive joint arrangements, especially north and south of the Thames? There will have to be at least two, or even four, separate organisations. If it is intended to wait for some agreement between the different political complexions, how can the practical problems be solved by November?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman represents an area which is part of the "West Waste" group of boroughs, and plans for dealing with the disposal of waste in that area are far advanced. He will appreciate that the powers that my right hon. Friend will have under the Bill as amended will allow the imposition in parts of London of a joint arrangement if such an arrangement is not arrived at voluntarily. I suspect that in that area an arrangement will be arrived at voluntarily.<br/>
8.15 pm<br/>
The five southern boroughs &#x2014; Bromley, Croydon, Sutton, Merton and Kingston upon Thames &#x2014; have had extensive discussions among themselves as to how they will co-operate, and I believe that they will be able to come to a voluntary a rrangement. A great deal of disposal is carried out on a geographical basis. The refuse that arises from the western parts of London will be disposed of out towards the west, that from the south to the south, and so on around London. The hon. Gentleman should not underestimate the interests of the boroughs themselves to co-operate voluntarily to provide this service.</p>

<p>Taking London as an example, my right hon. Friend said that he could envisage circumstances in which if there was not co-operation in certain boroughs a joint authority would be set up under the instruction of the Secretary of State to look after the remainder of the boroughs which have not co-operated. Can my right hon. Friend hazard a guess whether if arrangements made by some boroughs collectively, including the letting of contracts, and so on, do not appear "satisfactory", the Secretary of State will have powers to overrule those contracts?</p>

<p>The Secretary of State will have powers which he has a duty to exercise by 15 November and which will allow him to set up a joint authority for the whole of a particular conurbation or for parts of it. In the southern part, the northern part, or wherever it may be, the various

district councils may have come together to work in a positive way. One of the factors which my right hon. Friend will have to consider is the way in which existing contracts are honoured. The contracts may be with the private sector or with the surrounding county councils.<br/>
In making his decision the Secretary of State will be required to have particular regard to satisfactory arrangements for hazardous waste. The Secretary of State will also retain the discretionary power to establish a statutory authority if initially satisfactory voluntary joint arrangements subsequently break down. To ensure, however, that there remains a real prospect of the devolution of functions even if statutory authorities are established under these arrangements, the authorities would be required within a reasonable time, probably 12 months, of their establishment to submit proposals to my right hon. Friend for their functions to be devolved to their constituent councils.<br/>
It may help the House if I explain in some detail the types of voluntary arrangements which my right hon. Friend would be prepared to consider and the steps which would precede his decision on whether to establish a statutory authority in any metropolitan area. The guidance note issued in March set out the types of arrangement which it seems to us would be sensible in each metropolitan area. As I have already made clear, we envisage special arrangements for hazardous waste. Those arrangements will generally need to be countywide, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that they would be satisfactory on some other basis. With regard to operational functions, some districts can probably operate in isolation, and they may well be Labour districts, but in other areas it will make sense for the districts to group together. It may even make sense in at least one county for all the districts to come together in an operational group. Where boroughs and districts produce proposals for groupings they can be either non-statutory or be enshrined in an order made under the reserve power. I emphasise again that we want to see arrangements made which are appropriate to each area, but we have to be assured that they are satisfactory arrangements.<br/>
We shall invite those boroughs and districts which have not already done so to submit to us, by 30 September, their detailed proposals for voluntary joint arrangements, in particular for hazardous waste. As soon as possible, and ideally within 10 days of that deadline, we shall &#x2014; following discussion with those authorities as necessary &#x2014; let them have our reactions to their proposals. We shall then invite them, as soon as possible, to work up those proposals, modified as necessary in the light of our comments, into the draft terms of a mutually binding agreement between them. If the terms of those draft agreements seem to us satisfactory, we shall then ask the boroughs and districts to submit signed agreements by early November. My right hon. Friend will then be able, in the light of those signed agreements, to reach his final decision by the statutory deadline of 15 November on whether the arrangements embodied in those agreements are, in his judgment, satisfactory. If he judges them to be satisfactory, he need do nothing.</p>

<p>I do not want to intrude into the niceties of what is happening in the Labour party. I was lucky to serve under the right hon. Gentleman, when he was a Whip, on my first Committee in 1968 on the Finance Bill. There was a historic moment when he was half inside and half outside the door for a Division, and I understand that it is so recorded in <i>Hansard.</i>
I return now to the question of waste disposal. The functions will be devolved to the borough and district councils to be performed in accordance with those agreements on abolition day. If, on the other hand, my right hon. Friend judges those arrangements not to be satisfactory, he will be under a duty to establish statutory authorities to discharge those functions. We shall issue detailed advice to the boroughs and districts on the steps in that process, and on the criteria against which my right hon. Friend would judge the adequacy of their proposals for joint arrangements, immediately after Royal Assent.<br/>
I believe that the amendments we have now tabled represent a considerable strengthening of the reserve power. I am confident that, by placing my right hon. Friend under a duty to establish statutory authorities if he is not satisfied by 15 November 1985 that the voluntary arrangements are adequate, they provide the guarantee of satisfactory arrangements on abolition which, legitimately, both Houses have sought. At the same time, we have retained the flexibility to enable us to take account of the wishes of the boroughs and districts. The requirement for my right hon. Friend to have particular regard to the need for satisfactory arrangements for hazardous waste will secure the future of those vital functions. I believe that the provisions will ensure that satisfactory arrangements for waste disposal are in being on the appointed day.<br/>
The House of Lords, quite rightly, debated hazardous waste at some length. We are at one with Lord Cranbrook on the importance of maintaining existing centres of expertise and scientific advice, especially for hazardous waste. We are most grateful to him and to a Select Committee of another place, which he chaired, for their valuable advice on these aspects. We also recognise and appreciate the contribution of Lord Gregson both in the 1981 report with which he was associated and his subsequent actions. However, we consider that their concerns are fully met by our proposals.<br/>
I wish to deal with two points of some concern. The first is the concern of the home counties about the waste arrangements for London. I am, of course, well aware of

the views of the home counties, and in particular their common concern to see close co-ordination of the boroughs' arrangements for the disposal of London's waste. I have met representatives of the home counties on two occasions during the past eight months, and the proposals which we are now making in respect of waste regulation and disposal are intended to try to meet those concerns. Clause 9, as now proposed, would provide the certainty of stable voluntary arrangements, underpinned by binding contractual commitments, which were sought by the home counties. I have offered to meet the home counties' representatives again later in the summer when a more detailed picture of the arrangements proposed by the boroughs will be available.<br/>
I wish now to deal with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Horrichurch (Mr. Squire) about guarantees for the private sector companies which have waste disposal contracts with the GLC and the metropolitan county councils. It will, of course, be important to ensure that the major contractors which actually dispose of most of the waste in London and the metropolitian counties do riot suffer as a result of abolition.<br/>
I am conscious of the importance of the role played by those contractors, and the heavy investment involved. We have made it clear to successor authorities that any large-scale abandonment of existing contracts would be unacceptable, and I am glad to have the opportunity this evening to reassure the House that this remains the Government's position.<br/>
In asking the House to disagree with the Lords in the said amendment, and to agree with the amendment that we are proposing, I believe that that will provide adequate and appropriate arrangements for waste disposal in both London and the metropolitan counties. I ask the House to remember that we have had representations, both officially and unofficially, from many of the London boroughs and district councils saying that they can co-operate voluntarily, one with the other, or in groups of three or four. The functions of disposal of waste can be properly devolved and delegated.<br/>
I wish to emphasise again that it is important that hazardous waste is dealt with on a wide basis.</p>

<p>I shall be as brief as possible as we now have only 18 minutes before the guillotine falls.<br/>
The Minister is a master in the art of soft soap. His praise for the noble Lord Cranbrook would be rather more credible had he accepted &#x2014; and accepted in full &#x2014; the advice of the Select Committee that the noble Lord chairs. Speaking on behalf of the Select Committee, the noble Lord pointed out that it was evident, and had always been evident, from the Government's reserve proposals that they lacked confidence in the system of devolution. They believed that it would take two months to take a step that we believe should have been taken now. The nettle should have been grasped and it should have been acknowledged that waste disposal, as opposed to waste collection, could not possibly be handled on a borough-by-borough basis.<br/>
The Minister accepted that in his speech today. He said that he thought that in one county &#x2014; he did not say which, but he may intervene to tell us &#x2014; all the districts could make up one group. That is a countywide function He suggested that in other counties and the GLC there might be a number of groups. It is extremely unlikely,


even with his political desire to devolve waste disposal, that there will be more than a handful of boroughs that will handle disposal themselves. The Government should have recognised that the counties and the GLC have a great success story. No one has criticised them in their efforts to improve and co-ordinate waste disposal since they were established 10 years ago.<br/>
It is quite unacceptable political vandalism to embark on proposals such as these and then bit by bit, and extremely reluctantly, to back off. The Government only back off when they have lost the vote, not the arguments. If my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) had intervened, he would have pointed out that we put forward amendments in terms similar to those put forward in the other place in respect of hazardous waste. They were brushed aside in Committee and in this place because of the Government's majority.<br/>
The Minister presents his change as a concession to the Lords amendments. I am unconvinced. It is true that, in place of a general reserve power, the Secretary of State now has to be satisfied about the district-wide arrangements or to trigger the countywide proposals. That is on the plus side. But, on the minus side, he has moved the deadline by some six weeks. If Labour-controlled authorities were co-operating as the Minister suggests &#x2014; I do not claim much for myself but I do claim to be more in touch with Labour leaders than he is &#x2014; that would be an argument for advancing the deadline from September, not for extending the deadline to November.<br/>
By November, four months after Royal Assent, if Royal Assent is received this side of summer, what will happen to the staff who run those county authorities? Faced with such uncertainty, many of the best staff in those units will seek other employment. That is the nature of the world. If the Minister leaves it until 15 November to attempt to establish joint arrangements or to satisfy himself that the district-wide arrangements are satisfactory he will find that the good staff are not available. I very much doubt that the Minister has taken account of that.<br/>
Waste disposal has always been the subject of music hall jokes, but the truth is that it is an efficient and effective system of collection and disposal and is one of the buttresses to civilisation. Without effective waste collection and disposal we would have no public health, and no decent cities and towns in which to live.<br/>
We believe that these arrangements are ill thought out. They will cause administrative chaos and may well cause disruption in the disposal of waste. The other place had it right when it proposed that there should be countywide arrangements, and we shall support those arrangements tonight.</p>

<p>This is another area in which all the expert opinion is against what the Government are proposing. The hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) quoted the report of the Select Committee of the other place. In June of this year the Department of the Environment's hazardous waste inspectorate reported on the matter of hazardous waste in the United Kingdom. The report concluded that only the GLC and the West Midlands county council were dealing successfully with the problem, largely because of their size and their expertise. These officials, the Government's own officials, said:
<q>The HWI would view with alarm any prospects of these experienced hazardous waste management teams being

disbanded upon abolition of the GLC &#x2026; The HWI attaches great importance to the retention of these experienced waste management teams and considers that any other action would result in chaos in hazardous waste management.</q>
That is the expert view of the people who were doing the job.<br/>
The Government's amendment does not inspire a great deal of confidence. It gives the Secretary of State authority to require the winding up of any of the new bodies which may be created. That hardly gives us great faith that they will last long. It certainly leads to the view that the Government are hankering after giving these powers to borough and district councils.<br/>
The date of 15 November 1985 is only the most recent of a long line of final dates from the Government on this issue. We were originally told that everything would be ready by July 1984. It was then December 1984. In Committee, the Minister told us that he was prepared to stay his hand until the end of February 1985. On Report, he told us that everything would have to be settled by September 1985. That date was given again in another place. We now have a further slippage to 15 November 1985.</p>

<p>The Minister is a past master when it comes to command of English prose but, on Report, he said that he would have to have settled on a future set of arrangements by the beginning of September 1985. That does not seem to be the receipt of proposals, but something much firmer than the Minister is now suggesting.<br/>
There must be some doubt whether 15 November 1985 allows enough time for a statutory joint authority to be created. As the hon. Member for Blackburn said, it will have to consider key staff, sort out budgets and prepare for the imposition of a precept. Are we to believe that all that can be done in four months? Those of us who have some experience of these problems have reason to doubt it.<br/>
We are being offered a choice not between a voluntary and a statutory system, but between a single strategic authority with the benefits of technical expertise, economies of scale and efficiency that that offers and a hotch-potch of groups of boroughs with some voluntary and some imposed functions. Faced with such a choice, the only intelligent and reasonable thing to do is to support the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>Thanks very much. I am anxious to cover matters that will not be debated again &#x2014; flooding and drainage. Wakefield is flooded almost yearly. I have pleaded with the Lords and at least 12 Ministers and asked many questions about flooding but I am not getting much nearer a solution, as the matter is dealt with voluntarily. Even the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food's Green Paper said that the Government are considering two possible options. What will happen when the Government get rid of the metropolitan councils? A previous Tory Administration delegated authority but forgot to include provision for land drainage. In the 1974 local government reorganisation, the Tories denuded my county, metropolitan district councils and my local water authority of power. They are having to go around with a begging bowl. The begging bowl gets 33 per cent. for a feasibility study from the Wakefield metropolitan area; 25 per cent. from the county; 10 per cent. from the quango Yorkshire water authority; and 32 per cent, from MAFF. If it had been two years later there would have been no percentage agreement, because in 12 months MAFF has dropped from 45 to 32 per cent. Which designated authority will deal with land drainage and flooding problems that will exist in my constituency if something is not done?<br/>
There may be people listening to me with whom I have pleaded in another place. They will not give me a copy of the feasibility study report which I could give to Wakefield metropolitan council. I have been refused a copy and I would be helped in my endeavours to try to solve the problems of flooding in Wakefield if I had a copy. Will the Minister look into this matter so that on this occasion the Government do not compound the mistake they made in 1974 on the reorganisation of local government?</p>

<p>I have had a strong feeling from the beginning of discussion on this Bill that Opposition Members do not have their hearts in this amendment. That has been confirmed by what my right hon. Friend told the House, that behind the scenes, as so often happens, Labour authorities are keen and willing to take on these arrangements because they can see very distinct benefits. In the view of the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), my right hon. Friend is a master of soft soap. Of course, the hon. Member for Blackburn is well known as a dramatic and very often melodramatic speaker. I do not object to that, it is often very entertaining, but it does not necessarily add up to much.<br/>
We had a further example of that tonight when he sought, and he has just sought again through a sedentary intervention, to say that Labour authorities are very happy with the amendments they are putting forward and they are not at all happy with the Government's proposals. That remains to be seen, but so far I have not been able to put my finger on much evidence from the Opposition Benches that they are serious about the amendments. The hon. Member for Woolwich (Mr. Cartwright) gave us a detective story of dates in seeking to prove that the

Government were up to foul deeds behind the scenes on exactly when these arrangements were to be made. The point seems very clear. The people of this country, of London and the metropolitan counties, are concerned that their dustbins are emptied efficiently and that the waste is carted off to whatever multiple resource is there to burn it, dump it or bury it. The arrangements for London, for which I speak with a certain amount of authority I hope, amount to the Greater London council entering into contracts with certain large enterprises to dispose of the waste well outside the boundaries of the capital. It seems ridiculous that we should need a joint board simply to finalise a contract to do such a thing.</p>

<p>I am very short of time so perhaps the hon. Gentleman will allow me to continue. The local authorities could just as well finalise that contract on their own joint arrangement as can this joint board. There is great scope for the local authorities to be able to finalise contracts for greater cost-effectiveness, just as happened with Southend's local council and in various boroughs in London, including the notable example of Wandsworth, so often a forerunner in these matters.

<p>Amendment No. 13 deletes from clause 20 the power for my right hon. Friend to direct the new ILEA to provide specified information to the inner London boroughs or the City for the purposes of the consultation required by this clause between the new authority and those councils. As my noble Friend, Lord Gowrie, made clear in introducing this amendment in another place, the power for my right hon. Friend to direct the new ILEA to provide specified information is of a different kind from his other powers under the clause. If the new ILEA does not comply with a reasonable request for information, the councils will be able to seek effective remedy through the court. The involvement of my right hon. Friend is therefore on reflection unnecessary.<br/>
The amendments to clause 21 delete the requirement for my right hon. Friend to undertake an initial review of the new ILEA by 31 March 1991 and his discretionary power to undertake subsequent reviews. They also delete the provision for any reallocation of the new ILEA's functions to be achieved by order. The amendments substitute a discretionary power to undertake a review by 31 March 1991 but make no provision for the implementation of any changes in the light of that review. Such changes would therefore require fresh primary legislation.<br/>
The strongest objection to clause 21, both in this House and in another place, has been to the proposal that there should be a power for my right hon. Friend to reallocate the new ILEA's functions by order. We have listened carefully to the arguments, put very strongly in another place, that, if the new administrative structure which we are establishing for education in inner London needs adjustment in the light of experience, then that adjustment should be made by primary legislation. We have been convinced by those arguments.<br/>
I am not, therefore, asking the House to disagree with the amendments made in another place. On two points, however, further amendments are necessary to give them full effect. First, amendment No. 16 retains a reference in the clause to "such report". There is now only provision for one report. We propose that the clause should refer to "the report" and this is achieved by our substitute amendment. Secondly, although amendment No. 18 deletes my right hon. Friend's order-making power, reference to that power remains in clause 100. Our consequential amendments delete those references.<br/>
I must make clear that our acceptance of these amendments does not mean that we are any less concerned by the policies of ILEA which result in its spending between 29 per cent. and 59 per cent. more per school pupil than the inner city partnership authorities outside London, which have similar problems, spend without achieving results that are proportionately better. We remain no less determined to improve ILEA's cost effectiveness. We are confident that the new elected ILEA offers the best prospect for improving standards and cost effectiveness and we shall look to the members elected

next May to vindicate our expectation. But, if experience shows that further structural change is required, the need to secure primary legislation will not deter us from taking the necessary steps.</p>

<p>We on the Opposition Benches welcome the Minister's conversion, although I am not absolutely certain whether it is genuine. He spoiled his speech by his attack on ILEA. He would have shown more grace had he accepted all the arguments for ILEA. As the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, I welcome the Government's backing off from the idea that something as important and as substantial as ILEA can be abolished as the result of a statutory instrument after 90 minutes' debate.<br/>
The cynic in me wonders why the Government left such a provision in the Bill in the first place, and comes to the conclusion that they did so that it could be left out at this point as a token concession to the other place. It is noticeable that this is one of the few concessions that the Government have made, and it does not have much substance.<br/>
The real concession was made at the start when the Government agreed to abandon their idea to abolish ILEA. From that point, the Government wanted a face-saving device, having led some of the London boroughs to believe that they might take on education powers. The Government wanted to put something in the Bill instead, so that the idea of a review and a possible later devolving of powers remained. I hope that the Government will make clear that they have abandoned any idea of carrying out a review, because the new body should be allowed to get on with its job without the continued threat of blackmail from the Government that if it does not do just what the Government want it will be abolished.<br/>
The Government are retaining massive draconian powers over ILEA. Not only are there the rate-capping provisions of other legislation but there are staff control and review provisions. It is sad that the Minister returned again to cost effectiveness. No one has managed to show that ILEA does not do a better job than some of the other authorities that spend less money. He trotted out the exam results but he and the Secretary of State would agree that exam results are not the only criteria by which to measure success. If one uses exam results, one has to look at other factors such as the social background of the children.<br/>
It would have been far better if the Minister had reduced some of the controls over ILEA, recognised the first-class job that it is doing and also acknowledged that it should be responsive to local democracy. The people of London are justly proud of the services that ILEA provides. I am sure that in the first election to the new body there will be a resounding vote of confidence in Labour representatives who want to go on providing a first-class education service. Sadly, they will get a mandate from the electorate but the Government will have the veto over sufficient resources to carry out the policies.<br/>
The Government should stop continually sniping at ILEA, and proudly tell the country what a first-class job ILEA does. The Minister said that other inner-city authorities were more cost effective than is ILEA. He should remember that the HMI report said that only 11 local education authorities were providing a satisfactory


standard of education and that ILEA was one. It seems that the Government are determined to remove ILEA from that group by restricting its resources.<br/>
Although I welcome the Government's removal of the obnoxious bits of this Bill, there will be a continuing campaign from Labour Benches to ensure that ILEA has the resources to continue to do a first-class job.</p>

<p>I join with my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) in welcoming the death-bed conversion of the Government to the arguments put repeatedly by the Labour party over the past five years. I am not sure that they were as convinced by the arguments mounted in the other place as by the outcome of the Division, in particular on the amendment moved by the Lord Bishop of London, somebody who does not normally command much support from the Labour party.<br/>
We welcome the removal of one of the innumerable threats and worries that the Government have posed to ILEA over the past few years. As the parent of three children who attend ILEA schools, I am as conscious as anyone of the genuine shortcomings of that authority. Those who run the authority, both the elected members and the people who work for it, are also aware of the shortcomings.<br/>
One of our major criticisms of the Government is that at all times from 1979 until now the effort of all those in inner London who want to improve the standard of education has had to be diverted time and time again from the schools to protecting the existence of the authority and fighting for sufficient resources with which to carry out a difficult job. When he was the hon. Member for the City of Westminster, St. Marylebone, the right hon. Member for Mole Valley (Mr. Baker) played a prominent part in seeking to undermine ILEA. His fatuous Baker report called for the break-up of ILEA and for its duties and powers to be devolved to the constituent boroughs. He will not receive a prize for consistency by urging the House to support the Lords amendment. The right hon. Member for Mole Valley no longer represents the City of Westminster, St. Marylebone. He had to do a bunk to Mole Valley, presumably because he was frightened of the parents of children attending ILEA schools in his Marylebone constituency.<br/>
All hon. Members who represent inner London constituencies want ILEA to be provided with a period of stability and certainty so that the teachers, the other staff of the authority, the children and the parents can concentrate upon improving the standard of education. They want the Government to provide sufficient resources to enable them to carry out that job. ILEA is being denied those resources. Rate capping will damage the standards of education in inner London. The constant sniping, bickering and mean-minded malignancy of the Secretary of State and his hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Mr. Dunn) have severely damaged the morale of all concerned.<br/>
If the Government do not resign shortly, the best thing that they could do would be to turn their attention to that London organisation which, compared with other organisations, is by far and away the most expensive and the least competent, the Metropolitan police. The only problem is that if they turned their attention to that expensive and incompetent body, they would find that the Home Secretary is the responsible authority. It would be better if the Government did something about the

Metropolitan police for which they are directly responsible and allowed ILEA to get on with its difficult and important task.</p>

<p>I, too, welcome the Government's admission of the strength of the arguments that have been advanced both in this House and in another place. Their recognition of the truth of the arguments comes, I suspect, not just from the force with which they were put but from their recognition of the enormous strength of feeling among parents right across inner London about the value of the education that their children receive from the Inner London education authority. That is true of my constituents, many of whore have written and spoken to me about the subject since the Bill was introduced.<br/>
The Opposition wish that in taking this first step in the learning process the Government had taken some further steps. ILEA will still be affected by the vicious rate-capping proposals that have been imposed upon it this year by the Government. If further designations are to be announced in the next few weeks, ILEA might be rate capped next year.<br/>
The Secretary of State has also taken powers to interfere in the sensible running of ILEA. He has not taken similar powers to interfere in the running of other education authorities. When Her Majesty's Inspectorate says that of all the education authorities in Britain only six &#x2014;one of which is ILEA &#x2014;are providing, anything like an adequate standard of education it ill behoves the Government to start interfering with and intervening in that authority and not look at the standard of education that is provided elsewhere. The Government should direct their attention to that aspect, not to the excellent work that is done by teachers, staff and everyone who works in and for ILEA. That work is deeply valued by parents and other people in my constituency and throughout inner London. I welcome the Government's conversion. I hope that it will be the first of several in the right direction.</p>

<p>The provisions in the Bill dealing with support to voluntary bodies have developed and have improved during the Bill's passage. I am grateful to those voluntary organisations that have come to discuss with Ministers in my Department the provisions of the Bill. We are indebted to them for many of the improvements that we have now introduced.<br/>
In this House we revised clause 47 extensively to meet the points that had been put to us. In the other place the additional change provided for by amendment No. 43 was a response to further suggestions that were put to us by the voluntary sector. There has been concern that, in the absence of the GLC and, to a lesser extent, the metropolitan counties, grant-giving by the local authorities would operate in what would be seen to be a policy vacuum. The Government did not wholly share that fear. It seemed to us that it would be no more than normal local authority practice to operate arrangements for grant-giving under arrangements that would take account of the priorities and needs of the areas concerned. We had to recognise, however, that the concern of the voluntary sector was acute on this point and thus, when an amendment was put forward on Report in another place seeking to have annual reviews made of the needs of the whole area involved in schemes under clause 47, my noble Friend undertook to consider that point. This he did, and amendment No. 43 was put forward by the Government and agreed to on Third Reading in the other place.<br/>
I believe that this change to clause 47 has been warmly welcomed by the voluntary sector because it provides two useful additions to the operations of clause 47. First, it

ensures that in all aspects of operating the scheme all the constituent councils have to have regard to the needs of the whole area. That is a strong reinforcement of what we had always intended should happen. Secondly, it requiresd each scheme to contain provisions for those needs to be kept under review. This is not a mechanical annual review, as some have sought, but a continuing obligation to respond to changes and developments. I hope that the House will welcome the amendment in the same way that it was welcomed in another place.<br/>
Lords amendment No. 57 meets a concern expressed by the voluntary sector in the metropolitan counties. The London boroughs have been very quick off the mark to start making arrangements for funding the Londonwide organisaions. Richmond council has taken the task of acting as lead borough, and has already been in touch with over 800 such organisations. In the metropolitan counties, the districts have, unfortunately, not been quite so quick to get going.<br/>
Specifically at the request of the Manchester council for voluntary organisations we have included a provison that will require the joint organising committees to consider the desirability of setting up collective arrangements. This will give the districts a prompt, if they need one. Assuming that they agree that the scheme is a good idea, they will then be required to promote its setting up. I hope that the House will join me in supporting what is another useful addition to the provisions for the voluntary organisations.</p>

<p>I am very grateful to Mr. Henry West, who has visited Ministers in my Department on several occasions to relay exactly the concerns outlined by the right hon. Gentleman. I hope that the district councils will avail themselves of the transitional funds that the Government have made available to help local organisations, which at present receive funding from the Greater Manchester council. It is precisely to meet their needs that we have increased to &#x00A3;20 million the amount of transitional funding. I hope that the district councils in the Greater Manchester area will get together soon to decide their priorities for next year. If they want to bid for the &#x00A3;20 million, they should not lose too much time in so doing. The Government are aware of those concerns. They have been forcefully put to us by Mr. Henry West and others, and the Government have increased the transitional arrangements to safeguard the well-being of the worthwhile organisations in Manchester.<br/>
Lords amendment No. 44 is the other provision relating to grants for voluntary bodies. The Opposition have tabled an amendment, but first I wish to explain the intention of their Lordships. The amendment introduces a new clause designed to enable funds to be provided for endowing a new trust for London, but the provision is not limited to London alone; it would allow similar arrangements to be


made in the other metropolitan areas if there were sufficient surplus assets arising in those areas. The unallocated assets of the GLC will pass to the London residuary body on 1 April next year. From the proceeds of disposing of those assets the endowments will be made. The Secretary of State will make orders providing for the making of payments by the residuary body to charitable trusts whose purpose is to benefit the area concerned. This endowment for the new trust for London will be new money for the voluntary sector in London. Initially, we estimate that &#x00A3;10 million could be transferred from the GLC's surplus assets, and we intend that this should be added to by corporate and other private contributions.<br/>
However, the funds made available to the new trust will build up over time. Depending on the rate and scale at which the London residuary body is able to realise the surplus assets, the clause will enable the Secretary of State to provide by order for payments to be made to the trust. Needless to say, the proposal was welcomed by everybody who has an interest in the future of London's voluntary bodies.<br/>
The Opposition have tabled a number of amendments to these proposals, but I must say that I cannot advise the House to accept them, first because they would require the Secretary of State to provide for as much grant-giving as the GLC and the metropolitan counties are providing in 1985&#x2013;86. That would be on top of the arrangements for collective grant-giving by the boroughs already provided for in the Bill; it would be on top of the Government's special programme of &#x00A3;20 million of grant aid for local groups and it would be on top of whatever else the boroughs individually decided to spend. That is an unrealistic proposal.<br/>
Other parts of the Opposition's amendments would require the Secretary of State to order money to be transferred to voluntary organisations. We have already made it clear that we shall do this in London. The metropolitan counties will have to await a proper assessment of the size of surplus of ex-MCC assets. The surplus may be small and it would be wrong to promise what could not be delivered. The authorities have been in existence for only a comparatively short time, but we do not rule out altogether the possibility of a surplus. The clause has been drafted to allow provision to be made in the met areas if it emerges that there is a basis for so doing.<br/>
The Opposition seek to change the definition of the groups that are eligible to receive the proceeds of ex-GLC or ex-MCC assets from the residuary bodies. That amendment would make almost any non-profit-making body eligible. It is our intention that large capital sums &#x2014; I have mentioned &#x00A3;10 million &#x2014; that have been accumulated at the expense of ratepayers in London or elsewhere should be paid over only to properly established trusts that have been set up to meet the needs of the area concerned. I am sure that we should retain the requirement that their Lordships have proposed.<br/>
The trust, when it is set up, will be able to fund voluntary organisations as more broadly defined by the amendment, but in the first instance we think it right that the funds should transfer to a body as we have defined it in the amendment. We shall listen, of course, to what Opposition Members have to say about their ideas but it seems that they want to turn the residuary body into a substitute general purpose grant-giving body under the direction of the Secretary of State. That would be inappropriate.<br/>
I think that it is generally acknowledged that when we introduced the Bill many voluntary bodies were disturbed. They saw the councils that funded them being demolished and they were uncertain about who would fund them after 1986. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and other Ministers in the Department are aware of the voluntary organisations' fears and uncertainties because we have indulged in lengthy consultations with the NCVO, the LVSC and other voluntary bodies. We have met them on many occasions and from our discussions with them, and our understanding of their fears and anxieties, we have been able substantially to reassure them. We have taken on board many of their suggestions for improving the Bill. We have provided for encouragement and assistance, such as the large increase in transitional support from the &#x00A3;5 million we proposed originally to the &#x00A3;20 million that is now on offer.<br/>
Equally importantly, the voluntary sector has been able to learn more about what we, the Government, propose. We have been able to explain to voluntary organisations what we are doing to see through our commitment that good voluntary projects should not lose out as a result of abolition. Two significant proposals will ensure that successor authorities can take over the funding of the voluntary bodies. There will be collective funding by districts and boroughs for county and Londonwide groups with &#x00A3;20 million more of local projects to receive aid via the districts. Over and above that, the trust for London will be endowed with at least &#x00A3;10 million. There are possibilities of others in the mets being so endowed if resources allow.</p>

Our exchanges with the voluntary bodies have been fruitful and it is my distinct impression that the voluntary organisations in London and in the mets are now much more confident about the future. Such uncertainty as still remains stems almost entirely from the attitude that has been taken by the Labour party, which has refused so far to take part in the preparations for the London collective scheme. It is still striving to ensure that information that is needed desperately to allow grants to be made to voluntary organisations next year is not available. Only last month, when asked by Wirral and Sefton to release such information for Merseyside, councillor Keva Coombes got solid Labour support for continued refusal to discuss that issue.<br/>
The true friends of the voluntary sector are on the Conservative Benches, and voluntary bodies will not be deceived by the superficial show of concern on the Opposition Benches. I hope that the House will support the Lords amendments and resist the Opposition amendments.</p>

<p>I should like to discuss our amendment (a) to Lords amendment No. 44, and I hope that we shall be able to vote on it at the end of the debate.<br/>
If the Minister believes that the voluntary sector has welcomed what the Government did in the other place, and honestly believes that the voluntary sector has been substantially reassured, I can assure him that he is talking to a different voluntary sector from the one that has talked to me and my right hon. and hon. Friends. People in the voluntary sector are still disturbed and concerned. Indeed, many are till angry about the Government's proposals, despite the amendments in the other place. If the Government claim that there is adequate money in the arrangements that have been made to replace the grant-giving powers of the GLC and metropolitan counties, they are not deceiving Opposition Members, they are not deceiving the general public and they are certainly not deceiving the voluntary sector.<br/>
Let us look at exactly what happened in the other place and at what the amendments do. First, there is the trust that the Government are establishing. It will receive money from the residuary bodies, which have been set up to sell off the assets of the metropolitan counties and the GLC. That is the vindictive part of the Lords amendments. The Government are obsessed with getting rid of County hall, and selling off the assets that belong to the GLC and the metropolitan counties. They especially want to get rid of County hall as the London symbol of democracy throughout the capital, a symbol that has existed for many years.<br/>
In trying to pretend to the voluntary organisations that the sale of assets will produce a large amount of money that can be handed over to the trust to be used for the voluntary sector, the Government do not say where the 32 of the 42 functions, which will be run on a countywide basis under the legislation, will be run and administered from. If County hall is sold&#x2014;which I doubt will happen &#x2014; where will ILEA go? ILEA has done its sums, and has estimated that it would cost at least &#x00A3;100 million for it to move out and find other premises. There will not be the bonanza from asset selling by the residuary bodies because all the joint bodies and other quangos that the Government are establishing will need to be housed in not less but more office space than is used at present by the metropolitan counties and the GLC.<br/>
The Government envisage that &#x00A3;10 million will be given to the trust at first. That will be invested, and 10 per cent. interest a year will give &#x00A3;1 million. That is mere chicken feed compared with what the GLC and the metropolitan counties now give to voluntary organisations. It does not allay any of the fears that have been expressed.<br/>
Let us look at what the trust is. It will not be democratically accountable. It may not have representatives of the voluntary movement on it. Who will the Minister appoint to the trust? There are rumours that existing foundations such as the City. Parochial Foundation might be given the job; that would reassure the voluntary sector to some extent. Will the trust be established by the Government, and appointed by a body of do-gooders to ensure that no controversial grants are given? That is where the prejudice comes in. I was in the Committee on the Bill, and the only argument from Conservative

Members in favour of abolition&#x2014;because they could not prove their case on the basis of cost&#x2014;was prejudice, particularly against the controversial grants given by the GLC and the metropolitan counties. Will the trust be an anodyne group of Conservative do-gooders, specially appointed to do the Government's bidding?<br/>
In our amendment we substitute the phrase "eligible charities" for "voluntary organisations". The fears of many voluntary organisations, which receive grants from the GLC and metropolitan counties but which are not charitable bodies, have not been allayed by the Government's proposal. The GLC and metropolitan counties do a great deal of work in unemployment centres, but those centres do not qualify under the Lords amendment because they are not charitable bodies. Many co-operatives and women's organisations will not qualify. The Minister referred to the Richmond scheme. Its proposals have already been published in draft form and exclude grants to women's groups. That sort of thing is already beginning to happen.<br/>
With the amendment the Government vindictively seek to force the sale of assets. It is clever conservatism to be vindictive towards metropolitan authorities, and to take their assets and show care by giving those assets to the voluntary sector. In that way the Government are trying to get the voluntary sector to go along with them, and to see some advantage in being vindictive towards the metropolitan authorities. However, people in the voluntary sector know that those authorities are their genuine friends because those authorities have given them cash, money and support, and the Government have given them nothing but false promises.</p>

<p>I should be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would tell me what he considers a voluntary body to be.

They are voluntary groups, but not necessarily of charitable status, just as some voluntary housing associations are of charitable status and some are not.</p>

<p>The Government are providing chicken feed compared with the GLC, and the same story is true throughout the metropolitan counties.<br/>
The Minister made great play of the increase in the transitional money, as though the Government were providing a great deal of money for that four-year period. When the Bill was first published the Government were to provide &#x00A3;10 million or, to be exact, &#x00A3;7&#x00B7;5 million, and the remainder was to come from local authorities. Then,


because of the pressure of the voluntary sector, the figure was increased to &#x00A3;20 million. We can draw a picture of the municipal bill run up by the Conservatives&#x2014; from &#x00A3;10 million, to &#x00A3;20 million, and closing at &#x00A3;40 million. That is their last offer. What does that mean? In the first year the Government will provide &#x00A3;15 million for the GLC and the metropolitan counties, and the local authorities must find &#x00A3;5 million. In the second and third years both the Government and local authorities must provide &#x00A3;10 million. In the fourth year both the Government and the local authorities must provide &#x00A3;5 million. That is not exactly a windfall for local authorities, nor is it a great deal of money for the many voluntary organisations operating in those areas.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend put an important point in making it clear that our concern is not only with voluntary organisations&#x2014;properly so-called. The Royal Exchange theatre company in Manchester has made clear to hon.

What kind of guarantee can we give the company about its future?</p>

<p>Of course, the Government cannot provide guarantees. They have studiously avoided providing guarantees while mouthing platitudes about how they are trying to assist voluntary organisations.<br/>
The district councils and London boroughs are already rate capped, and will have to take over many functions after abolition, for which the Government will not provide extra rate support grants, yet they must find part of the transitional &#x00A3;40 million. They will be unable to meet all the needs, and will certainly be unable to meet the many requirements of the voluntary sector unless the Government undertake to provide the necessary money.<br/>
Another minor amendment tabled by the Government &#x2014;many of them were probably drafted by the Minister &#x2014;related to the concession that, in the first year of the collective scheme&#x2014;the Minister praised the Richmond initiative&#x2014;if two-thirds of the boroughs agreed to grant money to a countywide voluntary organisation, all the boroughs must contribute to it. However, the Government placed a ceiling on the amount that could be given, although for the first year they said that they would not use their powers to impose such a ceiling. That is not reassuring, because the Government are retaining their draconian, ministerial powers, as they have done throughout the Bill, to set ceilings and to control the amount of money that even the so-called democratically liberated London boroughs and metropolitan county councils will be able to give to voluntary organisations.<br/>
The Minister made much of Lords amendment No. 43, but it is extremely vague. It asks the boroughs to set up a review of social needs with due regard for the entire metropolitan county and GLC areas. What will be the result of such a review? The Minister rightly referred to the criticism from voluntary organisations they they will be unable to operate within comprehensive political or strategic frameworks. At present, the GLC and the metropolitan counties meet representatives of the voluntary movement and thrash out a set of policies, in relation to funding the voluntary sector, which operate within the terms of reference of each local authority's strategy. The trust cannot do that, because it has no other

functions or powers. Many local authorities will come together to review social needs, but they all have differing views. I assure the House that Sefton council has a different view of the social needs of Merseyside from the views of Liverpool city council and Knowsley council. The trust will be no substitute for the present system.<br/>
We said in Committee that their Lordships said that the Government have failed to prove that administrative savings can be made in services by getting id of bureaucracy. We were told that many services, including waste disposal, firemen and file police, would cost more. However, we now know that the cuts will be made in the voluntary sector. The Government were motivated to attack the GLC and the metropolitan counties because they wanted to cut the amount of money given to voluntary organisations. They did not like the way in which local government was setting new trends in encouraging community activity, bringing people closer together, working closely' with the Labour local authorities to improve conditions in their communities and pioneering in the traditional local government way. They knew that the spin-off would be support for the Labour party, and that is why they are so vindictive against the GLC and the metropolitan counties. That is why they are attacking the voluntary sector.<br/>
These Lords amendments are prejudiced and spiteful. The Government's abolition proposals are based on prejudice and spite, and this attack on the voluntary sector is a prime example of it. Although Ministers try to put on a pleasant face, Conservative Back-Bench Members show their prejudice every time we mention the GLC, the metropolitan counties, or the giving of grants to the voluntary sector. I urge the House to reject the Lords amendments, which will not provide adequate support for the voluntary sector, and to accept the Opposition amendments.</p>

<p>We debate the amendment against the background of an extraordinary expansion in Exchequer and other public support for the voluntary sector. Gradually the partnership between the voluntary sector and the Government is becoming a genuine third force. Many of us who have worked in the voluntary sector have hoped for that for many years.<br/>
Such a partnership involves enormous difficulties. The whole point of the voluntary sector&#x2014;whether charitable or non-charitable &#x2014; is that it should be free to move where it will and to do those things which it sees are needed, particularly if the statutory sector does not recognise a paramount need. Too much of the voluntary sector is being sucked into the statutory sector simply because the money is made available to it and it therefore follows the money.<br/>
That is not necessarily bad, but I hope the Minister can reassure us that, after the long, constructive and hard-working sessions with the voluntary sector, he will ensure that we have a much clearer idea of those activities which the Government of the day believe appropriate to be done by the voluntary sector. Let us make no mistake. The voluntary and charitable sectors can take on able staff to operate under a Government grant which is often taken away after only a short time because of changes in political control or in the ability of the statutory sector to meet the


need. I hope that as a result of the current painful discussions a more coherent strategy for the future will emerge.</p>

<p>An enormous amount of public money is spent in that direction through tax concessions and other means. Increasingly, money is provided through a wide range of other sources, including the private sector, which in many ways is a healthier source of support than the state. What is more, the changes in the law governing covenants by the present Government have resulted in an increase in the amount of individual contributions, which I welcome.<br/>
The Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Bootle (Mr. Roberts), gave the show away because, although much of the money spent by the metropolitan authorities and the GLC has been spent in a pioneering way, too often it has been spent in such a way that pioneering has taken precedence over responsibility. Some pioneering groups have been incompetently managed and have been unable to perform the tasks which they were paid to perform.</p>

<p>Local authorities have always spent money on publicising their policies and ideas.

<p>That is not why I object. I do not object to some of the experiments that have been carried out, but I do object to frantically increasing expenditure for no purpose other than to bind groups of diverse kinds and activities to the Labour party. That is the nub of the question. Many of the groups that have been funded had worthy aspirations and may derive from areas in which, because there are difficulties, they may have been able to appeal to sympathy or shame to get funding. When they have failed to deliver the goods, the result has too often been a desire to give them more money because the poor things failed to deliver the goods last time as they did not have sufficient money. In the budget for 1984&#x2013;85 the GLC in particular delivered a cynical exercise in trying to bind to the Labour party the support of a wide variety of groups, some of which were undoubtedly worthy of support but many of which were not.<br/>
I support the Government amendments, but I urge the Government to take pains to build on the hard work that they have done so far to ensure a much more predictable pattern of partnership between the Government and the voluntary sector.</p>

<p>Because time is short I shall concentrate on the amendments proposed to Lords amendment No. 44. In the prevailing atmosphere of impending doom, I welcome the Richmond initiative to get the two thirds rule. My experience of district co-ordination in the voluntary sector is not encouraging. The two thirds rule will not breed harmony and light among the districts because those who are not

party to the two thirds but are part of the one third or some smaller proportion, will not contribute willingly or with a warm heart.<br/>
The crux of the matter is the definition. If one restricts the definition to charitable organisations, one excludes a whole area of the voluntary sector which in some respects has been the most innovative, experimental and beneficial in recent years. To restrict matters entirely to those who fulfil the definition of "charitable" will exclude new groups which cannot, at the beginning of their lives, achieve charitable status. It will not be easy for the Government to discover a means of determining whether a group is charitable or not, in law short of registration with the Charity Commissioners. Those who have been involved in this area for many years will know that it is a legal minefield. It is not easy to determine whether a group is charitable or not, and the Charity Commissioners have great difficulty in doing so. There are many organisations which I believe are charitable but which do not have charitable definition and registration with the Charity Commissioners. In the past I have managed to get tax relief for many bodies which are not registered with the Charity Commissioners but which the Inland Revenue regards as charitable.<br/>
Another area which will be deprived is that of co-ordination of voluntary work. The councils of voluntary service which facilitate collaboration between voluntary and statutory bodies often find it difficult to achieve charitable status because the Charity Commissioners are loth to give that status to bodies that simply co-ordinate the activities of other voluntary organisations. A whole area with which many Conservative-controlled authorities are happy to work will be cut out from this definition and they will find their work extremely constricted.<br/>
Any attempt at such restriction runs counter not only to local government tradition and to the work that the local authorities have done for many years in endeavouring to pump-prime and to assist experimentation and innovation by not confining themselves to the use of charitable bodies. It also runs counter to central Government intentions and central Government tradition. An examination of grant-giving patterns under clause 64 from the DHSS or from the voluntary service unit of the Home Office and the urban programme and the partnership authorities, shows that most of those grants which are beneficial and accepted as such by Conservative Members do not go to those bodies which are deemed in law to be charitable. I cannot understand why the Government wish to cut off from grant aid under this heading those bodies to which they had willingly and voluntarily given support for many years.<br/>
The sums of money involved that have been quoted sound large but, for many reasons, the sums of money going through this third arm is extremely large. The sums being quoted are nowhere near enough to accommodate what is happening. For example, there is a housing project in Bradford with which I was associated when I was involved in the voluntary sector there which is costing &#x00A3;2 million. The turnover of some large city bodies is beyond the sums being quoted.<br/>
My experience suggests that the Government's policy will seriously harm the voluntary sector. Innovations and experiments will inevitably be deprived. It is not so much whether Conservative or Labour Members are the friends of the voluntary sector&#x2014;from what I have heard today, the Government want to constrict local authorities and


Labour wants to control them. Neither is the right approach. The proposals of the Government and the other place are defective and I urge the House to accept the amendments to the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>Through rate-capping and penalties, the Government have hit local authorities hard, and feeding cash into voluntary organisations will be ever more difficult. Local people are proud of Tyne and Wear metropolitan county council because it has helped and funded voluntary organisations. However, it now seems that there will be a distinction between Conservative-controlled shire counties and Labour-controlled metropolitan authorities.<br/>
Under section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972, district and county councils can each raise 2p with which to fund organisations and projects. Metropolitan counties are also able to raise a 2p rate for the dame purpose, so in an area covered by a metropolitan county council 4p is raised under section 137. If Tyne and Wear county council is abolished, however, only 2p will be raised for that purpose. Because the shire counties, which are predominantly Conservative controlled, will continue to exist, areas covered by them will continue to exist, areas covered by them will continue to levy 4p under section 137. In other words, Conservative-controlled areas will have much more money with which to fund voluntary organisations. If that is not political vindictiveness, I do not know what is. The Minister and the Secretary of State should reconsider and let boroughs in metropolitan county areas raise a 4p rate under section 137.</p>

<p>I beg to move, amendment (a) to the Lords amendment, in line 4, leave out ', after consultation with that committee.'.<br/>
I understand that we are to discuss also amendment (b) to the Lords amendment.<br/>
By amendment No. 48, which I understand was moved in the other place by the Government, it is proposed that the residuary body for London and those for the other areas should have added to their membership one of the members of the joint committee established under clause 93. By our amendments we propose that the Secretary of State should be required to appoint to the total number of members of the residuary body such members as are nominated to it by the joint committees of the local authorities. It is delightful to have the rapt attention of the House at 10.15 pm on such a scintillating topic. I repeat that it is possible, judging by the form of the earlier votes, that we will lose this vote.<br/>
So scintillating are my words that Mr. Speaker has moved out of the Chair. It is delightful to see Mr. Deputy Speaker back in the Chair. I thank Mr. Speaker for his rapt attention on this issue. Although I hope that it is not, this issue may be the last occasion on which we have a substantive debate. I hope that their Lordships will do their duty.<br/>
I should like to place on record, on behalf of my hon. Friends and myself, my thanks to the people who have briefed us over the last 18 months on the many issues of the Bill. Even the Minister will accept that not only have we won the arguments on the Bill and on the Local Government (Interim Provisions) Act but, unquestionably, as many Conservative Members have said, that we have been better briefed. The main reason for that is that there have been excellent briefing arrangements with both the GLC and the metropolitan counties parliamentary unit. We could not have advanced the arguments and turned what was seen by the Government as an electoral advantage into an electoral disadvantage had it not been for the work of people such as Damien Welfare and Richard Percival of the Greater London council and David Burton and Rodney Jones of the metropolitan counties parliamentary unit and their supporting staffs, and the leaders of the counties and the GLC, to whom we are all grateful.<br/>
10.15 pm<br/>
When the Bill was originally published, the residuary bodies were seen as bodies which would have merely wrap-up and technical functions. The Government suddenly realised that, although their intent was to snap out the light of the GLC and the metropolitan counties

immediately on vesting day, on 1 April 1986, that would not be possible, and therefore there would have to be life after death for the councils, but the Government would try to limit that as far as they could. It was initially envisaged that the residuary body would have a role for superannuation, debt, central facilities and support.<br/>
As the Bill has progressed, the Government have had to face the fact that there will continue to be a countywide operation of many services and that in preparing the Bill in such haste and with such venom, and refusing to look at the good work of the GLC and the metropolitan counties, a great many specialist services provided by the councils, often unnoticed and unsung, were overlooked. Those services may be unnoticed at the moment, but were they to be abolished their absence would soon be noticed.<br/>
Such services had to be given a parent body and the Government realised that it would not be possible to provide for their control by districts, because they could not operate at district level, and the Government found it inappropriate to set up joint boards. Following the excellent report of the Select Committee on Science and Technology of the other place, the Government have widened the role of residuary bodies and these are now to provide professional and technical services to the successor authorities.<br/>
We welcome the wider role given to the residuary bodies, as far as it goes, and the fact that the services which faced a break-up and annihiliation are to continue. It is worth quoting, as I think I am allowed to do, the view of the Select Committee on Science and Technology of the other place. It said:
<q>the Committee repeat their conviction that the administration of local goverment in Greater London and the metropolitan counties depends for its effectiveness on preserving the integrity of many of the specialist services built up by the GLC and the county councils. These authorities have demonstrated their ability to respond positively to the challenge of scientific and technical development. Further challenges lie ahead. The great conurbations require specialist staff and facilities to meet them. Economic, efficient and forward-looking services demand excellence, integration and continuity. The existing services should be improved not by being dismembered, but by being encouraged to progress. Centres of excellence are slow to develop but easy to destroy.</q>
They would have been destroyed had the Government's initial proposals remained in force. However, the residuary bodies will not be just clearing-up organisations. They will supervise the services that are to continue in existence for the local authorities within their area.<br/>
We have always objected to the fact that the residuary bodies were to be appointed by the Secretary of State. However, although we disagreed with that idea, we could see some logic in it, given that they had a residuary role to perform. Now that they are to have a continuing role to perform it is unacceptable that all their members should be appointed by the Secretary of State. He will undertake to run the local authority services in the areas of the Greater London council and the metropolitan counties. That is wrong. The Government tell us that their aim is to devolve powers to the local authorities. If so, they ought to accept this modest amendment, which would make the members of the residuary bodies the nominees of the new joint committees which they have established.</p>

<speech hansard_id="347694" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1985-07-08a.838.0" hansard_membership_id="6020" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2861" speakername="Mr. Simon Hughes" colnum="838" time="21:45:00">
<p>This is an important issue. Our position has been made clear in the debate: that directly elected authorities will


become indirectly elected authorities by means of this strange beast, a creature of the Government, the residuary body.<br/>
I wish to draw attention to two specific aspects of the problem, to which I hope the Minister will pay careful attention. It was said during the Report stage in the other place by the Minister of State's colleague, Lord Gowrie, that many of the people who are now employed by the Greater London council and the metropolitan county councils will be employed by the residuary bodies. In planning the handover&#x2014; the amendments refer to the method of the handover&#x2014;it is vital that as many jobs as possible should be preserved. Those with technical expertise are irreplaceable for servicing whatever services remain to be run on a metropolitan countywide or Greater London councilwide basis.<br/>
As the transition to the residuary bodies and the joint committees, as envisaged in amendment No. 48, is planned and as we consider the membership of the joint committees and their method of working, they should be given the task of reflecting upon the way in which they can most effectively implement the ring fencing of many of the posts by ensuring that they are offered to those who would like to continue to use their expertise in local government.<br/>
Disagreement has been expressed by some employees of the seven local authorities. As was mentioned by the hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), although many hon. Members have been well briefed by officers of the metropolitan counties and the GLC, sufficiently interested efforts have not been made by the unions representing those who are employed by the Greater London council and the metropolitan counties.<br/>
There have been notable exceptions. The Minister may remember that in Committee I moved amendments which, as he will know, emanated from NALGO in Greater London, and amendments were tabled in another place emanating from NALGO in the west midlands which were of interest and relevance to every person employed as a local government officer &#x2014; people who were not supported by the NALGO national leadership. I say for the record, and without wishing to re-open old wounds, that many of the people in NALGO representing staff of the local authorities were disappointed that they were not better supported by their natural supporters, as they presume them, the Labour party, in this House and in the other place.<br/>
As I should like everybody to seek to remedy the position, I shall quote from <i>Abolition News 6,</i> a NALGO news bulletin produced by the west Midlands county branch abolition staff protection sub-committee dated only a couple of months ago. Indeed, there are later editions up to the most recent, <i>Abolition News 8. Abolition News 6</i> says:
<q>We were desperately disappointed with the Labour Party's showing. We had all hoped for some action on the staffing issues, yet it's become plain both in the Lords and in the earlier debate in the Commons that they are not interested in talking about staff. This is at odds with the Party locally, who are very understanding and, we believe, genuinely anxious to help as indeed are a number of our own Councillors. We are sure they feel rather let down as well.</q>
It goes on to say, having condemned NALGO nationally, and commended my alliance partners and my party:
<q>The Government, of course, are laughing. Not only have they avoided an embarrassment in the Lords, they have scored a number of points off the Opposition in doing so, and have managed to show the Labour peers' `concern' for staff.</q>

It goes on to leave the members to judge for themselves the party's performance and the arguments about staffing.<br/>
The tragedy was that in the other place staffing came up on the day of the Ascot gold cup or some such important national event. Therefore, the Tory party decided to spin out the staffing debate, which is always less controversial, and got everybody back after Ascot for the crucial votes on the subsequent amendments concerning the residuary body. As, a result, there was no informed or expert debate there either.<br/>
The hon. Member for Coventry, South-East (Mr. Nellist)&#x2014;I warned him that I would mention him, and I hope that it does him no harm &#x2014; has regularly and consistently argued the case for people employed in local government in the seven authorities in question. He has done so justifiably because the Government's figures at the beginning were clearly wrong, and they had not thought through the implications for staffing. We have been watching the draining away of experienced officers. I was talking the other day to a senior legal officer of the GLC who was watching his colleagues disappear, leaving for jobs which are certain as opposed to staying in jobs which are uncertain and without any definite future, and leaving behind the others to try to hold together the muddle that is of the Government's creation.<br/>
While it is clearly not in question that local government is about services, and the jobs are there to provide those services, the Government have not understood the need for those people who will be necessary in these after lives that the Government will have US create by the amendment. The joint committee and the subsequent residuary bodies are being prepared for that, and people are not being given the opportunity to apply.<br/>
My main criticism goes to the Government, but it also goes to NALGO nationally which voted, by way of resolution at the annual conference, that its staff and members should boycott subsequent bodies. With no vested interest, I beseech NALGO to change its mind. This is not in the interests of local government officers who have given months, years or decades of service to local government in some authorities which, whatever their history, are among the most competent and experienced authorities in Britain with the greatest expertise. It is not in the interest of the members of staff for the union to tell them that they must have nothing to do with the successor authority.</p>

<p>Why does the hon. Gentleman think that the national conference of NALGO is any less concerned about its membership than he? Does the hon. Gentleman accept that the union has decided that it has found the best way of protecting its members' jobs?</p>

<p>I accept that the national conference of NALGO should be as concerned as I am. It should be more concerned, because it has a specific responsibility. However, if the Bill is enacted, the national conference will call for all-out industrial action. If it believes that that will advance the cause of its members, it is mistaken. I am not saying that the national conference is not interested. I am merely saying that its tactics are wrong and that I hope that it will think again. In the interests of the continuance of service in whatever form the Government have contrived to give us local government &#x2014; a form for which no Opposition Member has argued&#x2014;we want the best people doing the jobs that remain.<br/>
I plead with the Government to let the joint committee and the residuary body pass on early information on the jobs that will be left. Secondly, let those who represent the work force ensure that they allow its members to service theo successor bodies for the short interim period that will ensue. If the Bill is enacted without the Lords standing up to the Government again, we shall not have regional government in London. In the interim at least we shall have local government officers carrying on the services which were administered in readiness to re-enter a greater and better regional body which parties other than the Conservative party will bring about sooner than the Government would like.</p>

<p>I shall begin by referring to ring fencing and stating that for several years I was one of NALGO's two parliamentary advisers. Those were in the days when NALGO was composed far more of officers who served their councils rather than their political masters. The real danger is that NALGO is beginning to drift into political subservience. I am not so worried by the remarks of the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) about some local government officer leaving the service. Some of the creatures appointed by Mr. Livingstone as assistant directors have been placed for their political knowledge. The sooner they go the better. In that way no one will have to pay compensation to them, unlike some of the creatures who were appointed to London Transport by Mr. Livingstone, to whom we had actually to pay money.<br/>
Having had experience of the previous reorganisation of local government, I appeal to NALGO and the staff union at county hall, which still exists despite the efforts of Livingstone and Co. to denigrate it, to remember that their first duty is to the public that they serve and the public that pay their salaries.</p>

<p>I shall not give way again. The hon. Gentleman can speak later if he wishes. Until county hall responds to the questions which the boroughs have been asking for months, no one can give the detailed answers which the hon. Gentleman and many others would like. It is certain&#x2014;this is on the record&#x2014;that we shall not make the mistake that we made last time in the re-organisation of London local government, when everyone's job was automatically guaranteed and when my borough of Camden finished up with three directors of finance and with one town clerk and three associate town clerks. That will not happen again.<br/>
The hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) raised the issue of ring fencing. At the moment, he is with his natural allies &#x2014;the alliance&#x2014;and I hope that he joins them soon. We need to ensure that the information comes forward. If NALGO is prepared to do the job that it once did, I believe that its members will co-operate.<br/>
The hon. Member for Blackburn quoted selectively, at great length, from the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology. The report, which has been quoted three times already tonight, speaks in terms of deciding
<q>to concentrate on a selection of case studies".</q>
Who made the selection? The report states that it does not
<q>touch in depth on the general subject of waste disposal".</q>
It is an interim report. The inquiry is "incomplete". Most of the evidence is "as yet unpublished". The Committee did not wish to pre-empt its "final report". The document is valuable as a guide, but not as anything authoritative. The House would be well advised to do no more than look at it as a guide, and not as a bible.<br/>
The hon. Member for Blackburn referred to the residuary bodies. I am glad that they are to be self-destructive&#x2014;the sooner the better. I am equally happy with the appointment of Sir Godfrey Taylor as the provisional chairman of the London residuary body. Two things will happen. First, the intention of the House that borough government shall predominate in London as quickly as possible will come about. Secondly, I believe that that particular residuary body&#x2014;</p>

<p>As the record of any Government will show, if one is appointing a body to carry out one's policy, one appoints the best qualified people. I remind the hon.

Gentleman. Again, that is proof that the blurring of the lines between politics and civil servants and local government officers has gone too far.<br/>
I hope that the residuary bodies will do their work more swiftly than the Government envisage. I believe that in London at any rate we can look forward to a three-year rather than a five-year life. In the end what matters is the information coming out to the boroughs from county hall and the districts in the other metropolitan counties.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to residuary bodies as they apply to west Yorkshire. It is understandable why much of the debate has properly concentrated on London, as it seems to have done during all the discussions in the past year, but there are places away from London. West Yorkshire is one of them.<br/>
I should like to refer to some of the remarks made by the hon. Members for Hampstead and Highgate (Sir G. Finsberg) and for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes). The hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate referred to NALGO. I was surprised at what he said. All that I know as a politician&#x2014;and that is the reason why I am here &#x2014; is that NALGO voted nine to one against affiliating to the Labour party. The hon. Gentleman also referred to his experience in the local government reforms of the past 20 years. I know that he has great experience. The first reform was in 1963, which set up the Greater London council. They got it wrong. I have always been sorry that Middlesex was abolished, for example. Whatever doorstep I go on in my county of west Yorkshire, in the old borough of Morley, which is now part of Leeds, nearly everybody tells me about their view of the mistake that was made in 1974. It looms much larger in those people's mind and experience than many of the issues that we raise on the Floor of the House. There is local feeling about local government reform.<br/>
In the House, we have a happy knack of getting it wrong. We get it wrong when we put the experts in, because the experts often know nothing about local

government, but think that they are translating the views of some large company, with marginal analysis on how to get things efficient and so on. But the people who know about the services that they get know that the House has made a mistake. We are now doing it in a completely different way, but we are making the same mistake, and equally getting it wrong. Nothing that I have heard in the past year will convince me otherwise.</p>

He was right about it. It could have been changed in more appropriate ways than were used at the time. That is why I am glad to hear from my hon. Friends, especially our Front Bench, that we are not merely talking of recreating the GLC in future, but of creating a strategic body that will be studied afresh. The GLC was not right, and the way in which the Government are abolishing it is wrong.<br/>
I live in Bermondsey when I am in London, and I was surprised at the story of Tories going to Ascot. I am a devotee of the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Critchley), and thought that all that had changed. I thought that those Tories were now sergeant-majors, suburbans, and the children of the people for whom the Lord Chancellor rang his handbell at conference years ago. I can only assume that some of the old gentlemen Tories are still present in the other place. They are the sort of chaps who do not make snide remarks at by-elections about the marital status of candidates. In other words they are gentlemen, whatever else they may be.<br/>

When I first went to Yorkshire 25 years ago I was surprised to find a spirit afoot there that was akin to that in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The only bit of Yorkshire left now is north Yorkshire. In one of the Government's good centralising activities, Yorkshire was finished.</p>

<p>That is another matter and, in the hon. Gentleman's view, it probably proves that local government reform was a mistake.<br/>
It is extremely sad that only north Yorkshire is left. Last night I went to Huddersfield to hear the Huddersfield choral society, and all Yorkshire was present. When the choir sang the Hallelujah chorus, I thought, "I wonder what smart remarks that lot down in London would make about this." It was Yorkshire, but because of the Tory Government there is nothing but north Yorkshire left. That illustrates the mistake being made in this reform.<br/>
How will the residuary body work regarding the reorganisation of the police? Last night at the concert I asked many people what would happen about the west Yorkshire police, whether its headquarters would remain in Wakefield, and how the five district councils would deal with policing. Nobody seemed to know. I am convinced


that the reorganisation of the police in west Yorkshire cannot be left to appointees of either the Secretary of State for the Environment or the Home Secretary.<br/>
The question does not merely relate to policing and the number of policemen under each district council, but to the financing of the force. Under the existing west Yorkshire police, policing is provided for all parts of west Yorkshire, but not according to rateable value. Anyone who expects Leeds to pay more towards the precept that will go to the policing authority to provide more policing in Kirklees under the new arrangement, will find a different attitude and separate financing.<br/>
Who will advise on the policing aspect? Will it be Her Majesty's inspector for that part or the inspectorate in London? It cannot merely be the chief constable. In west Yorkshire we are extremely fortunate with our chief constable. The force did extraordinarily well during the miners' strike, calling in outside policemen perhaps only once. The policing was carried out with great sympathy and understanding, and I am extremely proud of the West Yorkshire police. I used to be responsible for practical policing, and I am extremely concerned about the West Yorkshire police because, apart from reading little bits in the newspapers, I do not know what is going on.<br/>
It is important not to put too much power in the hands of the Home Office. We should not allow abolition to become a ratchet step towards a national police force. What matters are local police forces and local committees. The only reason I have spoken tonight is that we have heard so little about the effect of the changes. It would be much better to allow elected representatives from the district councils to take part in police planning, because they will know far more about local needs than will any appointed person. We should remember the mistakes that the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate agrees were made in the past. It is one thing to get the drainage system wrong; it will be bad for west Yorkshire if police operations are arranged badly as a result of this aspect of local government reform. I agree with my hon. Friend for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) that elected local representatives should sit on the residuary bodies.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I shall comment on the interesting points made by the right hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Rees). I assure him that the residuary bodies will have no relationship with the police. The police will be governed by the joint boards that are established by the Bill. It might help the right hon. Gentleman to know that, in relation to west Yorkshire, to which he and I are completely devoted, the arrangements of the joint board will allow representation from each of the district councils in the area. There will be five representatives from Bradford, two from Calderdale, two from Kirklees, eight from Leeds and three from Wakefield, in addition to which there will be 11 magistrates.<br/>
I should also inform the right hon. Gentleman that the arrangements for the provision of the police will not alter geographically, and that the arrangements for the tripartite system will remain intact &#x2014; the 50 per cent. funding from the local authorities, which will be precepted by the joint board on to the individual districts, and the 50 per cent. central Government funding.<br/>
Although the police authority will be a different body, it will still be formed largely of district council representatives and magistrates under the general Home Office arrangement that pertains now. The arrangement in west Yorkshire will run as well as it does today.</p>

I wish that more members of the public knew how much support Labour Back-Bench Members are giving to their Front-Bench spokesmen tonight.<br/>

<p>Longer than the hon. Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Snape). In my days the chair of the GLC was made of bog oak. I wonder what present members feel when they address that bog oak chair and call it "chair."<br/>
When I heard the right hon. Member for Morley and Leeds, South (Mr. Rees) I thought, "These councils come and these councils go &#x2014; but fortunately the services continue." I pay tribute to the high quality of GLC staff. At the officer level it was as good as we could yet anywhere in the country. It was of very high standard. I am confident that those with whom I worked will continue to serve the GLC to the end in the spirit and tradition of the service.<br/>
Mistakes have been made. Mistakes were made in 1964 and 1974. They were intended to put right local government and they are accepted as being mistakes. When the Greater London council was created in 1964 it had many responsibilities such as for ambulance services. Within a few years it had shed that service and by 1978&#x2013;79 it was beginning to shed other services.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman should not use the word "shed" in relation to services by county hall. To my certain knowledge the GLC, of which I have been a member for many years, has never willingly given up its services. In most cases the services have been taken from county hall by Governments of both colours.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is wrong. The services were given up willingly. I willingly negotiated with others the giving up to the boroughs of the GLC's


housing stock. That was willingly done. One of the greatest housing empires&#x2014;260,000 houses&#x2014;was handed over to the boroughs. That move was resisted, but sense prevailed and only the other day Tower Hamlets finally took the last of the housing stock into its department. In the end this was done willingly because there was a housing department for the boroughs and a housing authority for the GLC. There is no reason for such duplication.<br/>
We are talking about the 1964 Act. In that year a fundamental mistake was made. We created large boroughs and the Greater London council because it was thought that one body should represent London. That was a mistake. Having created this great council, similar to county councils, we were left with the GLC which is an anomaly.<br/>
The GLC was given wholly unnecessary duplicated powers, and after 20 years we have now reached the sorry stage of needing to abolish it.<br/>
The hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) said that he would like regional councils instead, but what would they do beyond what the boroughs already do? The same duplication would be bound to occur.</p>

<p>Regional government, as most other countries of western Europe know and enjoy it, would have no duplicated powers with the boroughs. Powers would be devolved to it which are now exercised from Whitehall but which are better exercised at a regional level, leaving to the boroughs the services which are best run at a level closer to the people who use them.</p>

<p>With the greatest respect, the hon. Gentleman knows that that is nonsense. In other European countries the boroughs do not have the powers that ours have. Our boroughs have education responsibilities but in almost every other European country those responsibilities are carried by the state. I cannot see what additional powers a regional authority would have apart from one or two wider planning functions which could be dealt with just as effectively by regional conferences as and when required rather than by setting up a regional authority with a vast bureaucracy to support it.</p>

<p>I am trying to follow the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully because I know him to have been a reasonable person as a GLC member, although something seems to have happened to him since then.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman spoke of services being willingly given up the GLC. He knows that the GLC never willingly gave up its responsibilities for water and sewerage services, ambulance services or transport. As for duplication, why was transport taken from the GLC? Where was the duplication there?</p>

<p>I thought that it was a little later. At any rate, London Transport was run with great difficulty by the GLC and the end of the GLC's responsibility for transport came when we saw people being appointed to the board on a purely political basis, people with no ability to run anything, and the whole thing became a farce. The Government then rightly took back what had been given because London Transport was not being run properly for

the benefit of the people of London. Like most Conservative Members, I use public transport in London. As chairman of the GLC the hon. Gentleman uses his limousine most of the time, but some of us have to use public transport and it is being run as well now as it ever was under the Conservative administration at county hall. I cannot see that anything has altered.</p>

<p>How many of the items covered by the residuary bodies have ever appeared on a GLC agenda or even on a GLC committee agenda in their own right?

Why do we have to turn discussion of these residuary matters into a great big talking shop? The Labour party has endeavoured feverishly to put across the Government's actions as anti-democratic.</p>

<p>The alternative to the GLC would be abolition of the boroughs. That would be the only way in which to have unwasteful government. One can imagine the hue and cry from Opposition Members if we tried to do that and equate London with electricity councils.<br/>
If Londoners could remember some of the Labour actions, they would appreciate the need to abolish the GLC. I remember a marvellous occasion&#x2014;Her Majesty the Queen's silver jubilee. It was a time of great rejoicing in the capital and many people were out in the streets enjoying themselves. In the same year, the Conservatives gained control of County hall. Before that, however, the Labour GLC was asked if it would like to present a loyal address to Her Majesty. It told Buckingham palace that, if she wanted a loyal address, she should drive up to County Hall and get it for herself. That was a disgraceful action and when we came to power, we apologised to Buckingham palace and went to present a humble address. We have witnessed such political action time and again. The Labour party wants people who acted in that way to run residuary services, not to ensure that they are wound up but to see that they are built up.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Leicestershire, North-West (Mr. Ashby) spoke of political actions. The possibility of people being disrespectful to the monarchy seemed rationale enough to him to stop them, being put on residuary bodies. When the Government introduced these measures 18 months ago, we were assured that it had nowt to do with the political colour of people on elected authorities who might be members of successor bodies. It was all to do with economics. It was all about unnecessary tiers of government. Now we hear the malicious voice of this Tory Government. It is about the fear of changing political attitudes in this country and what can happen to bodies in the future.<br/>
The hon. Member for Leicestershire, North-West categorised the bodies under discussion in this set of amendments as inconsequential. He spoke about matters as not coming up once in five years in normal council or county council agendas. Once the Bill is passed, the matters under discussion will be compensation, hard debts inherited from the metropolitan county and the former GLC and staffing transfers. They will talk about things like property. The hon. Member may not be aware, but when the West Midlands county council was set up some 11


years ago, it took 10 years to sort out the amalgamation of the property rights of the seven district councils which were the constituent bodies of the now West Midlands county council. We are not talking about a seven-way amalgamation but about a 195 way split, and these bodies are going to have full agendas in the future trying to sort out who owns the different houses and the different bits of property presently under the ownership of the metropolitan counties and the GLC.</p>

<p>The point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) about the 20-years litigation which is still to be resolved, shows the seriousness of the discussion we are having and it ought to be treated seriously by Tory Members. I want to deal with the staffing implications of this clause and its implications in general.<br/>
I declare an interest, though it should not be necessary to do so, given the length of time this Bill was in Committee, in that I am a member of the West Midlands county council. I come from a region with well over one-third of a million people unemployed, where one in three families are on supplementary benefit. I come from a city where the unemployment level is 25 per cent. I have one ward in my constituency where the unemployment rate is over 50 per cent.<br/>
Here we are in the last 49 minutes of a discussion, and in my area 6,800 people presently working for the West Midlands county council, and tens of thousands who work for the GLC and the county councils in the other five metropolitan areas, still do not know what will happen to their jobs. The 6,800 people working for the West Midlands county council have, in the last two years, seen their lives being shattered by this Bill. Eighteen months ago they listened to the Secretary of State, who has not graced us much with his presence in this debate, though his Minister is still on the Bench, talking about saving &#x00A3;120 million. Now it is down to &#x00A3;100 million. He talked about cutting 9,000 jobs, but the latest figure is 7,100 and still we have not heard from any spokesman, official or unofficial of this Tory Government, on how they arrived at those figures. What is the breakdown county by county or service by service? We had to drag it out of certain Ministers in Committee. The fire service and the police service were not supposed to be having any staffing cuts, but still we have not heard whether that is true for clerical workers as well as for operational staff.<br/>
We have heard that cuts are not anticipated in waste disposal and archives, but our consumer services and coroners may cost more. Towards the end of the Committee stage it became clear that highways, planning and administration were the only services the Tories would target. We ought to be aware, as are working people outside this Chamber, that in some of the metropolitan county areas those three Services, if the Government are to meet the 7,100 target nationally for job cuts in this Bill will be making a 35 or 40 per cent. cut in staffing. Is that the real figure? The Minister of State has the opportunity to come to the Dispatch Box now and put at rest the minds of those workers up and down the country who are affected by this clause and the other clauses on staffing. I will give

him a chance. What services and which areas of the county are going to be affected by this Bill? The Minister does not know.</p>

<p>As my hon. Friend reminds me, those figures were made up. Between the Royal Assent and March or April next year people will be asked to do three jobs as a result of the amendment that we are discussing. They will be asked to continue to provide the services that they were contracted to provide. They may be asked to work for a quango, a residuary body or a district council, and they will be asked to provide information to other quangos and Ministers. Those people are working under stress. About 400 workers have left the West Midlands county council during the past 10 months. We are seeing the beginning of the disintegration of some specialist teams. I shall not go into this in detail now and I did not have time to do so a couple of hours ago, but the specialist teams under threat are those engaged in toxic and hazardous waste disposal, the chemists, the biologists, and the hydrogeologists. They are the people who have the skills to deal with matters on a countywide basis. It is the rearrangement of services that the amendment deals with that worries me.</p>

<p>I shall not give way, because I have nearly finished. The hon. Gentleman can follow me. This provision is not designed solely to meet the political targets that were dreamed up by Tory Ministers two or three years ago, it is a preparation for privatisation. It is no accident that during the past 18 months that we have debated this matter, we have seen, although not necessarily heard from, those Tory Members whose directorships and consultancies are with the firms that would like to take the pickings from the dismemberment of the metropolitan county councils and the GLC, in the form of such services as those dealing with private waste disposal and highway construction and some aspects of transport. Those Tory Members also disagree with the political policies of the elected leadership of the metropolitan county councils.<br/>
We have been told that no breakdown is available of the figures to show how the jobs will go if the Bill completes its passage through the House tonight. Abolition will cost millions of pounds more. Some people say that in the metropolitan county council area it will cost up to &#x00A3;69 million a year more to provide the level of services that is being provided now. All those services will deteriorate and people will lose their jobs.<br/>
The Labour party warns the House that that will all be changed when the Goverment are changed within the next


year or two. The Bill is not about abolishing the functions of the metropolitan county councils and the GLC but about abolishing councillors and their elected leadership. It is about abolishing the rights of 18 million people to elect the leadership of the metropolitan county councils and the GLC. The lessons learnt over the past 18 months during the passage of the Bill have been absorbed by working people, by those who work for the county councils and the trade unions who represent them. Those lessons will rebound on this Tory Government when we have a change of Government in the next year or so.</p>

<p>When discussing the composition of the residuary bodies the Government are under an obligation to answer the many unanswered questions that have been asked in the House and the other place. We have not discussed economic development at great length when we have talked about the allocation of services among the districts, the joint boards and the residuary bodies.<br/>
Labour-controlled county councils have endeavoured to deal with the major social problem of mass unemployment. Since 1979, 700,000 redundancies have been created in the metropolitan area and the number of jobless has doubled to over 869,000. Seventeen per cent. of the work force in the metropolitan areas is unemployed. Many of these areas have an aging infrastructure and aging industries. Youth unemployment amounts to over 344,000 and the figure for the long-term jobless is well over 25,000. In those areas the economic development committees of local authorities have either saved or created 45,000 jobs and at an average of &#x00A3;600 per job this is far more cost effective than any of the regional programmes undertaken by either the Conservative Government or the previous Labour Government.<br/>
In areas such as Merseyside people have a right to know whether the residuary body will take over some responsibility for economic development companies, subsidiary companies like enterprise boards, and the Merseyside innovation centre, for example, which attempts to apply new technology to industry. We have the right to know whether or not the residuary body will have some scope in that particular area, because people's jobs depend on it. Small businesses depend upon the assistance of various economic development committees in the metropolitan areas.<br/>
I am the last person to promote the idea of a residuary body, but if there is to be a residuary body we should be talking about democratic county authorities. Even though I am not normally in accord with some of the economic ideas of the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermonsey (Mr. Hughes), we should be discussing the take-over by democratic authorities of regional facilities, such as water, area health authorities and gas and electricity distributive services. We should be talking about the spread of democracy, but in this last period of debate we have only the left-overs.<br/>
If a joint committee for Merseyside were established, and assuming that the district councils had a say in the appointment of its members, it would ask the Government why they are fragmenting the arts and culture services of Merseyside. As hon. Members know, like the GLC area, Merseyside has been allocated a trust which will take over certain museums and art galleries. Earlier this year Lord Gowrie reported in another place that the Croxteth country park and Croxteth hall, which are in the centre of my constituency, and Speke hall, which is in the constituency

of my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Mr. Loyden), would be transferred not to the trust but to the Liverpool city council. It has been said these are not museums of national significance, but what would be the cost to Liverpool?<br/>
The crisis which is facing the city of Liverpool has been brought about by the Government's financial constraints. There may be legal difficulties in transferring Speke hall to the Liverpool city council, as it is presently owned by the National Trust, although maintained by Merseyside county council, but Croxteth country park has undoubtedly been developed by Merseyside county council since 1974 in a way that would have been impossible for the Liverpool city council. The Earls of Sefton left the Croxteth estate to the Liverpool city council in the 1960s, and because of the expense involved they found great difficulty in renovating the hall and the area.<br/>
The county council has established a visitors' centre, and opened to the public the principal rooms in the hall, opened a rare breeds farm and a riding centre and developed the gardens surrounding this delightful spot, right in the centre of both Merseyside and my constituency. It has been listed by the English tourist board as among the top 20 fast-growing attractions in the country. The country park has recently received the Sandford award for heritage education for its highly successful educational programme. Many schemes have been presented, and much advice has been given by the Countryside Commission.<br/>
Some &#x00A3;1 million has been spent on a restoration programme at Speke hall, and the number of visitors to both these halls was above average in a time of recession. I appeal to the Government that, regardless of the difference between us in our reaction to local government reorganisation, they should be looking yet again at Croxteth country park and Speke hall. I hope that the Government will look on the amendment with some sympathy, and that the advice that Liverpool city council is unable to maintain and restore both Croxteth and Speke hall will be accepted.<br/>
The danger on Merseyside is that a real asset and part of Merseyside's heritage will simply disappear from the enjoyment not only of Merseysiders, but of people from all over the world, as was shown during the international garden festival. I ask the Minister to think again before he allows to go to seed the good work that has been done over the past 10 years by the Merseyside county council with these assets that are so vital to the people of the region.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Sir G. Finsberg) has returned, because I shall direct a few remarks to him. He could not have been more wrong when he suggested that I did not have the same sort of respect for the office of chairman of the GLC as either past holders of that office or past leaders of the GLC. He mentioned Sir Isaac Hayward. He will have known that person for more years than I did, but I had the pleasure of meeting him and talking to him on a number of occasions. I like to think that many of the finer points of local government that are enshrined within the GLC are attributable to the standards that Ike Hayward laid down. Although the policies are different, the same standards are being pursued by the present leadership of the GLC. If the hon. Gentleman gets a hint of resentment in my comments, he will, in this case, be correct.<br/>
There is little chance that the London residuary body or the successor bodies will be able to complete abolition and take-over by 1 April 1986. The reasons are clear. Nobody knew what the shape of the Bill would be. During its passage throught Parliament it has been dramatically and fundamentally altered. Staggering changes have been made since "Streamlining the Cities" was published. How could anybody work out what would have happened? We cannot be completely sure, even at this stage. Many hon. Members believe that this is the end of the matter, but the amendments that we have made will go the House of Lords where I feel there will be a backlash. The Bill will then be returned to this House, so we are reaching only the end of another stage in its passage. The Bill contains provisions relating to the implementation of all sorts of orders, so the ramifications of the abolition of the Greater London council and the metropolitan county councils will continue to occupy the attention of the House until 31 March 1986.<br/>
11.30 pm<br/>
We heard earlier about the position of staff in the GLC and the metropolitan county councils. The staff of the GLC are in an extremely peculiar position. Between August and 1 April 1986 the staff of the GLC will be trying to perform three jobs. First, they will continue to carry out the services and functions of the GLC. Secondly, they will be working directly for a single borough council or a quango. Thirdly, they will have to answer requests for information from the 31 other boroughs, quangos or Ministers who will still be showering county hall with requests. Large numbers of staff will be transferred to the successor bodies, or they will be sacked. My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South-East (Mr. Nellist) tried to get the Minister to say how many members of staff will be made redundant, but he was given no answer. The staff commission has been remarkably quiet. Perhaps we could be told what is happening. It has not been involved in implementing the transfer of staff and shows little sign of having made any plans. Local government will be thrown into complete confusion. The position is bad enough now, but it will get even worse between August and 31 March.<br/>
It is not surprising, given the uncertainties, that the GLC is losing a number of its key staff. Not unnaturally, they are thinking about their future careers, their family commitments and their mortgages. That is a normal human response to the problem that the Government have inflicted upon them, and it makes it even more difficult for the GLC and the metropolitan county councils to maintain the services that they are statutorily obliged to maintain until 31 March 1986.<br/>
Moreover, the future financial structure of London's government is still uncertain and will remain uncertain until, at the very earliest, December 1985. The boroughs will be unable to decide upon the level of funding of their services until they know their expenditure targets and grant related expenditure assessments, the level of rate capping, where that is appropriate, and the details of the London equalisation scheme. London boroughs will have just three months in which to plan their policies, appoint their staffs and get organised. It is a hopelessly unrealistic timetable. It would assist the boroughs and the residuary bodies if the Department of the Environment could give advice, but the civil servants are clearly driving by the seats of their

trousers because they do not know what the future holds and are making it up as they go along, just as the Government have made it up during the passage of this shameful Bill. The quangos, preparatory committees and joint authorities will not even meet until September, so they will have a maximum of seven months to try to implement the change-over.<br/>
I suppose that new office accommodation will be found for the London residuary body. In answering one of the few questions that I tabled, the Minister said that County hall might be used as accommodation for the London residuary body. That answer conflicts with another statement that County hall will be sold. Perhaps it will be sold to fund one of the charitable off-shore institutions that Ministers are hoping to set up.<br/>
We need answers to these questions. Although we have asked them many times, we have not yet been given satisfactory answers. The files, computer programs, information sytems and legal records that are with the GLC will have to be routed to scores of different destinations and made compatible with the information of the receiving bodies.<br/>
Proper joint working arrangements will have to be established, involving the creation of a consensus among the 32 London boroughs of differing political complexions on the polices to be pursued and the level of services to be given. The electorate has given no mandate or guidance on these matters. The Secretary of State will have to give guidance and make decisions on hundreds of local government issues when his civil servants have no direct experience or qualifications to enable them to do so. We have seen how true that is by noting the way in which the bill has been changed during its passage. It bears little relationship to the original legislation. The House is being asked to agree a dog's breakfast of a Bill.<br/>
Sorting out all the legal tangles that are involved in local government will cause many problems. We cannot dispose of major institutions and expect no legal problems. The successor body arrangements are not straightforward. We should remember what happened when the GLC was established. We cannot expect major disputes in the courts to drag on for ages.<br/>
We have heard a great deal about the co-operation between boroughs that will be forthcoming. My deputy chairman at county hall, the estimable Sandy Sandford, is a good Tory who is wholly opposed&#x2014;</p>

<p>There is. I know at least two good Tories. I admit that one of them is now dead, Sandy Sandford says that there will not be voluntary co-operation, even between Tory boroughs. He speaks as a former chairman of planning at Westminster. He says that the worst problem that he ever had was not with Labour boroughs but in trying to achieve voluntary co-operation with the true blue Tory borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The Minister deceives himself and the House if he thinks that there will be much voluntary co-operation among the boroughs in London or among the districts in the metropolitan counties. It is interesting to note that litigation is still outstanding on the LCC-GLC re-organisation in 1965.<br/>
I cite one final statistic in a debate that has roamed wider than I expected. I am grateful for that. The GLC owns 12,234 properties and pieces of land. The legal documents relating to that ownership occupy four miles of


shelving. We do not have the time between now and 31 March even to dust all the files in four miles of shelving, never mind come back with an easy transition to the 175 successor bodies that the Minister claims will streamline the structure of local government in London and the metropolitan counties.<br/>
The Bill is now more of a mess than when it started its passage through Parliament. The fault for that lies entirely with the Government Front Bench and the people who have supported them because little or no thought went into the proposal. Therefore, the confusion that will undoubtedly come from the enactment of the Bill will be entirely of the Government's making, and they will live to rue the day.</p>

<p>Chair, I am sorry. The hon. Member has been a consistent opponent of the measure. In one little aside a moment ago, he referred to one of the few questions which he has put to my Department on the measure. One of the few questions? He asked well over 1,000 questions on the measure, costing the Government tens of thousands of pounds&#x2014;he is the last of the big Oscars. He has certainly applied himself with energy to defending the GLC, and I will recognise that fact.<br/>
We are now in almost the 340th hour of debate on the measure, including the time spent in the other House. It has been very lengthily debated at all stages &#x2014; one of the longest Bills for debate that we have had for many years.<br/>
The hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), in moving the amendments, thanked all those people who had been briefing him over the last year or 18 months. It was a good briefing. We occasionally saw bits of it. It was certainly intense and voluminous. There was a team of 27 from the GLC working on it, I understand. I thought that the work provided by the metropolitan counties was of a better quality, and, for my money, better work. None the less, it was impressive, and, as he rightly said, it is rather unusual with any Bill going through the House for the Opposition to be as well briefed as Ministers.<br/>
There was great talk about the destruction of things &#x2014;the destruction of services and of activities. The one thing that gave me some little pleasure as the Bill was going through and as I looked upon the serried ranks of the PR people in the galleries was that we were destroying the client base of many PR firms by abolishing the metropolitan counties, for they have benefited enormously from this exercise. Indeed, one of the features of this operation is the vast amount of money which has been spent on advertising, some &#x00A3;10 million, and in the course of the last few days, another &#x00A3;95,000 on four-page advertisements in the press.</p>

<p>My strictures are the same, whether I afflict my friends or my enemies, when I come to the enormous amounts of money which I think has been wasted in the PR campaign of the metropolitan counties.<br/>
If I may remind the House of the purpose of the amendments the Lords amendment allowed the co-ordinating committees to appoint one member, who would obviously be a councillor, to serve on the residuary body. The hon. Member for Blackburn, in moving the amendment some two hours ago, sought to say that all 10 members of the residuary body should be elected councillors. I would resist that. He is aware, but other hon. Members may not be, of the role of the residuary bodies. It is to operate exactly as the residuary legatee of the six metropolitan counties and of the GLC. It is there to wind up the functions such as management of the debt, management of the mortgage book and management of superannuation schemes and pension schemes, continuing functions which, in some cases, as regards the metropolitan counties, could well be taken over by lead boroughs. There is talk of co-operation or lack of it, but outside London I am well aware of various fairly secret discussions which have been taking place among Labour districts where they will volunteer&#x2014;</p>

<p>They do not like to be named for the simple reason that it is still the official policy of the Labour party not to co-operate. It is the official policy of the national executive not to co-operate. It is the official policy of the TUC not to co-operate. We know that many plans are being laid and that some of the functions which may go to the residuary body in London will be done by lead boroughs in the other metropolitan areas.<br/>
I support what the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) said about the need for co-operation. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) said towards the end of his speech, the Government and the Staff Commission will not be to blame if there is no co-operation. Hostility has been engendered by certain unions but not by all. Some branches of some unions have been hostile, but not all, and have refused to co-operate with the commission or ourselves. The commission has opened discussions with many unions. It has already issued six circulars defining ring fencing. I have heard today that certain Labour-controlled London borough councils will refuse to comply with ring fencing unless directed by the Secretary of State. I understand that one of the west midlands district councils has decided not to co-operate, under pressure from the unions.<br/>
It is not in the interests of council staffs or union members to take that attitude. When the Bill receives the Royal Assent &#x2014; I hope that that will take place next week &#x2014; I hope that attitudes will change and that there will be co-operation on the part of boroughs, district councils and unions. Some branches of unions have seen me. The west midlands NALGO branch has talked and there has been a series of fruitful meetings and discussions with it. I have talked also to some of the staff associations. That is the way forward.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has written to Mr. Jarvis, the chairman of the trades union local government committee. He wrote:
<q>We remain willing to open negotiations with your member local government unions. There are matters on which we are prepared to be flexible in the expectation that your member unions will come to the negotiating table in a constructive and realistic way.</q>
I hope that, now the Bill is almost on the statute book, there will be a change of heart among the unions which are


still sticking out to oppose it. Members on both sides of the House are concerned about the interests and well-being of the staff. We have already made arrangements through some of the amendments in another place to arrange early retirement schemes for the successor authorities so that they can take on more of the staff of the authorities that are to be abolished.<br/>
In the way forward, as we move towards the date&#x2014;</p>

<p>The subject of this Adjournment debate is the future of Westland, but first the House may want to know of another future, which was established not many hours ago. I am told that at 10.20 this evening the wife of my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) gave birth to a daughter, Helen Grace. I am sure that the House will wish to assure the hon. Member, his wife and Helen Grace of its best wishes.<br/>
I am grateful for the opportunity of this debate. I am also grateful to the Minister for Information Technology for his attendance, particularly in view of his past contact with Westland as Minister for Defence Procurement, and to other hon. Members who have agreed to take part in the debate and join me in supporting Westland. The hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) may seek to catch your eye later on, Mr. Deputy Speaker, from the Government Benches, as may the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) from the Labour Front Bench and my hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross).<br/>
It must be very nearly unprecedented to have so many hon. Members take part in an Adjournment debate. I hope that the Minister will recognise the cross-party support for Westland that this indicates. What is also, I suspect, practically unprecedented is to have such a degree of outside interest taken in such a debate at such a late hour. Nearly 40 of the Westland work force travelled up especially from Yeovil and elsewhere after work today to attend this half hour debate and to show their support for their company and their belief and pride in the work that they do.</p>

<speech hansard_id="347796" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1985-07-08a.872.4" hansard_membership_id="423" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2344" speakername="Mr. Ashdown" colnum="872" time="00:39:00">
<p>I apologise, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for referring to anybody who may or may not be in the Strangers Gallery. I merely wanted to show that there is support for Westland outside the House. I am sure the Minister recognises that their effort demonstrates the kind of commitment that is one of the greatest strengths of Westland.<br/>
This is at once the most difficult speech that I have made in the House and perhaps the most important. Westland is not only the pride of my community, and of others in the west of England; it is also the source of much of our prosperity. But more than that, Westland has served Her Majesty's forces as one of the nation's principal defence industries, with exceptional distinction, most recently in the Falklands, where our helicopters were recognised by all, from the Secretary of State for Defence to the ordinary Royal Marine in the field, to have been one of the principal causes of our victory.<br/>
Westland is our only national helicopter manufacturer and our only hope for major participation in the European collaborative helicopter projects of the 1990s. Westland is one of the key components of Britain's aerospace industry. It is one of our nation's first centres of the new technology. Its work force, from specialised design teams to those


using the newest technologies on the production line, is loyal, skilled, committed, proud of its work and confident that, as a team, it can keep Britain at the forward edge of world skills in the future.<br/>
In short, Westland is not just vital to Yeovil. It is vital to Britain. The first thing, the chief thing, that I want the Minister to do tonight is to say just that: to say to those listening outside that the Government believe that Westland is an important national asset and that they are committed to playing their role in maintaining the overall integrity of the company.<br/>
I know, as the Minister knows, that the Government have a confidential report confirming the importance of Westland. I know also that the Minister's Department has shown its confidence in the company by investing in the development of the W30. I know that, whatever the Ministry of Defence does, his Department will want to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that that investment is not lost.<br/>
Why is it, then, that throughout the recent crisis we heard not one word from the Government to strengthen the company's position? Why is it that the Government stayed silent and allowed those in City boardrooms a free hand to play fast and loose with a great company's reputation and the livelihood of thousands of workers? Let the Minister tonight make good that deficiency. He knows the company's underlying strength. He knows that its long-term prospects are excellent. He knows that we have a new chairman in Sir John Cuckney. He knows that there is now, throughout Westland, a grim determination to do all that is necessary to ensure the company's future. Let the Government make their contribution tonight by committing themselves, in terms that cannot be misunderstood, to playing their part with the work force and the management to ensure that future.<br/>
Let the Minister recognise that one of the chief ways in which the Government can show that commitment is to make a decision soon about the AST404. Is it not the case that Westland has put in the most effective bid for this order? Did not its submission for an uprated W30 meet that specification in detail and in full? Is it not the case that Westland was the only British participant in the competition, and that in purchase price and running costs it was cheaper than the others by up to 30 per cent.? Is not the W30 300 series the best aircraft of its sort in the world, with considerable foreign sales potential? Is it not the case, for example, that Spain, Scandinavia and Australia are almost certainly ready to buy the Westland aircraft as soon as the British Government make up their mind?<br/>
The Minister knows that these facts are true. Why, then, just at the moment when Westland was about to put the ball in the net, have the Government allowed the Army and the Ministry of Defence to move the goal posts? Is that an appropriate way to treat a great company which has served Britain so well? I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that he will use his best endeavours to ensure that the AST404 decision is taken soon and in favour of Westland. He should realise that his answer can make a great contribution to a great company, can help sustain prosperity and jobs in the west of England, can support one of our nation's key sectors and can strengthen Britain's defence.<br/>
Westland is not seeking charity, nor special treatment &#x2014; it needs neither. We are asking for a fair chance to

do what we do best&#x2014;make the best helicopters in the world for Britain's defence. All the ingredients are there to ensure the company's future: the product is excellent; the work force is dedicated; the management has a new look; and the determination is evident. All that is missing is a clear commitment from the Government to join us to secure that future. I ask the Minister to provide that tonight.</p>

<speech hansard_id="347798" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1985-07-08a.874.0" hansard_membership_id="8328" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28724" speakername="Mr. Jerry Wiggin" colnum="874" time="00:46:00">
<p>I thank the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) and my hon. Friend the Minister for allowing me to intervene briefly. I initially questioned the desirability of debating this subject tonight, but I am sure that, given the all-party agreement about which the hon. Gentleman spoke &#x2014; I agreed with almost everything that he said &#x2014; we can produce a positive message.<br/>
My hon. Friends the Members for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory) and for Dorset, West (Mr. Spicer) have been assiduous in supporting the view that I shall put across. I think that there is all-party agreement on the fundamental necessity for impressing upon the world Britain's confidence in its single helicopter manufacturer.<br/>
Let us be frank &#x2014; Boeing, Bell, Sikorsky, Aerospatiale, Agusta and MBB have had great difficulty in selling new helicopters. Westland is no exception in supplying a product to an overcrowded market. There has been a baring of the cupboard, and that is all. There has been a revelation as a result of a well-intentioned bid, adding substantial sums of private money to the company's resources. As is the wont of the financial journalists in the City, there has been a slight fluttering in the dove cotes. That is all.<br/>
Westland is paying its bill and wages and producing the goods today as it was eight or 10 weeks ago before this incident. The company has grasped this nettle and is having a financial spring clean. There is nothing wrong with that. Westland will not be the first company to examine itself. At the moment, its bankers are standing by it, and that is good and proper.<br/>
There is no better person than my hon. Friend the Minister, with his previous experience, to know the ins and outs of the matter and the problems and benefits of Westland helicopters. They are a fine product, and the company has a fine record and fine work force. It will continue to have those advantages. I believe, from my experience, that the services do not understand the helicopter's merits. In previous speeches I have pointed out the relative views taken by other countries of this weapon.<br/>
It is all very well for Ministers to say that the services know best. I remind the Minister that the tank was devised by the First Lord of the Admiralty, who was a politician. The British Army went to war on horses in 1939, and 16 of our ships were hit by second world war aeroplanes during the Falklands war. There are moments when politicians sometimes have to know best. I could say that AST404, which was well understood for many years in the Ministry of Defence, is really a bad story of changed minds by senior people at the last minute, which leaves British industry wringing its hands. Furthermore, I pull the leg of my hon. Friend and ask: if the W30 is unsuitable for the British Army, why not offer it to South Africa? I feel that might cause troubles, and then the argument might get turned on its head.<br/>
I hope that the Indian order still comes through. It is not impossible. There are uses for this helicopter; it could be bought. There is just one small problem.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend will spell out a message of confidence in this great company tonight. That is all that it asks. It asks its principal customer, the Government, and its principal investor, the Government, to have confidence in Westland.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) for giving us all the opportunity to take part in the debate, and the Minister for Information Technology for conceding some of his time for it.<br/>
I join the hon. Member for Yeovil in congratulating his hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Wallace) on the birth of a daughter. I assure his hon. Friend that, although she might be a delight now, as girls grow older they become more troublesome, until they get married, and I am told that after that they are always a delight.<br/>
Westland is a company of which this country should be proud. It is at the forefront of aerospace technology and is the country's only helicopter and hovercraft manufacturer. Nearly all the helicopters which saw service in the South Atlantic campaign were provided by Westland. Without its products there would not have been a victory, and this country owes a great debt of gratitude not only to the people who flew and fought with the helicopters, but to the work force which backed them up.<br/>
Since 1982, about 600 or more jobs have been lost, 500 in the last year, and 300 at Yeovil. About one quarter of Yeovil's work force &#x2014; members of the Transport and General Workers union, the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs and, the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workers, the Transport Aircraft Servicing Specialist and other unions &#x2014; have been employed on the W30 on the strength of anticipated orders from the Ministry of Defence. But now the goalposts have been moved, and we have not really been told why, although some vague, strange reasons about the changes in the Army's demands have come forward.<br/>
I put it to the House that the real problem is Trident. The demands made by the Trident programme are affecting every purchase and procurement by the Government. The Royal Air Force is seeking to shed some of its responsibilities because of its &#x00A3;400 million overspend. I notice that it has already passed its responsibility for the Super Harrier to the Navy, and it is doing the same with the tactical transport helicopter to the Army.<br/>
We have to ask, as did the hon. Member for Yeovil and the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) why the Government have taken no interest whatsoever in the bidding that has taken place for the future of the company. At &#x00A3;50 million it is a snip for whoever wants it, as <i>Flight International</i> said, yet no major British company has come forward to seek to buy it. Is it because the Government are not prepared to confirm orders to give the company a chance to meet the technological needs of the Army and of the industry and to maintain our own independent service? Is it that they are just not bothered, or is it, because of the pressures on the Ministry of Defence, that they are prepared to buy things off the shelf from the Americans or from other suppliers rather than go

forward and maintain what is important for our own strategic employment industries&#x2014;our own separate and independent helicopter industry? We are talking not just about the future of a number of planes, important though they are, but about the maintenance of an important strategic industry in the country.<br/>
We have been told that pressure is being brought to bear to use the Chinook instead of a smaller lighter helicopter, but this does not appear to make any military sense in terms of strategic interest, particularly on the central front. I grant that Chinook is important for its lift capacity, but its primary purpose is as a heavy logistic transporter. It is the battlefield bus, as opposed to the battlefield taxi. It is what the Army is, and was, looking for until the pressure came to bear on the Ministry of Defence.<br/>
Heavier helicopters are much more vulnerable to ground fire, which was responsible for the loss of so many helicopters by the Russians in Afghanistan. We have to expect our new helicopters to meet the challenge of the light, quick tactical helicopters on the central front which the Russians are developing. We must be in a position to meet that challenge. It does not make sense to develop a heavy helicopter capable of carrying 44 men when one wants to deliver a platoon of about a dozen or so to important tactical positions on the western front or to confront a terrorist attack.<br/>
To deny the Army a tactical transport helicopter is to deny our Army the flexibility and manoeuvrability needed to counter changes in Soviet strategy. That is the important point which we must bear in mind. It is the nature of the helicopter about which we are concerned, its importance to the Army and its role therein, rather than looking for a heavy large helicopter which is vulnerable to ground fire and attack. We should address ourselves to proper military needs instead of acceding to the Ministry of Defence's desire to buy off the shelf in dribs and drabs as it thinks money is available. In so doing it is not recognising the importance of maintaining our helicopter industry.<br/>
The Government should say that there is a need to maintain our interest and control over Westland so that we can maintain the industry for the country's defence and maintain the work force at the frontiers of high technology, in which helicopter design and manufacture have a prominent place. Whatever happens, the Government must maintain our control of Westland m Britain. It must not be allowed to pass out of existence or into foreign control.</p>

<p>The Minister for Information Technology has had a long day, because he has already had his ear bent by two senior executives of British Hovercraft Corporation during his visit to my constituency about 12 hours ago. I wish to support everything that has been said so ably so far in the debate. I remind the Minister that Westland is the largest industrial employer on the Isle of Wight, with a work force of about 1,500. Anything up to 200 subcontractors of various sorts on the island look to the company for much of their bread and butter. I remind the hon. Gentleman also that in February the average unemployment rate on the island was 17&#x00B7;3 per cent.<br/>
The skills of the work force at Westland are undoubted. There is &#x00A3;60 million worth of orders on the Isle of Wight from BHC, Shorts, Boeing and De Havilland among others. That bears witness to the ability and the skills of


the work force. The work is mostly in the composite sector and it is carried out in works which were only recently modernised at a cost to Westland of about &#x00A3;5 million. It is referred to as a centre of excellence and I believe that to be right.<br/>
Hovercraft orders are few and far between but that is hardly the fault of Westland, which has tried everthing that it knows to persuade the Royal Navy of their importance in mine counter-measures work. The principal message that both management and men at East Cowes wish me to convey to the House is the need to keep the firm together. Please do not hive off parts of what is, by common consent, a highly successful company, because of a hiccup over a particular helicopter order. The flexibility within the firm is its strength from the point of view of BHC.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Ashdown) has initiated an important debate that is reflected by the extremely high attendance in the Chamber. The House will be grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Wiggin) and the hon. Members for Kingston upon Hull, North (Mr. McNamara) and for Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross) for their contributions. I know that Westland receives tremendous support from many hon. Members, especially from my hon. Friends the Members for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), for Dorset, West (Mr. Spicer), and for Wiltshire, North (Mr. Needham), who are all present in the Chamber. The same can be said of my hon. Friend the Member for Somerset and Frome (Mr. Boscawen), whose position as a Government Whip does not allow him to participate in our debates. My hon. Friend is in his place and he gives considerable support to the company.<br/>
The concern for Westland that has been expressed by all those who have participated in the debate is one that is shared by the Government both from the point of view of my own Department and from the somewhat different standpoint of the Ministry of Defence. I wish to clarify the role of my Department in relation to the company and to correct any misapprehensions that there might be on that score.<br/>
My Department has a general sponsorship role towards the company, as it has towards other private sector firms. I have much in mind the importance of Westland as an employer, especially in the south-west of England, and as a company upon which many equipment firms depend for their business.<br/>
Britain has historically been a leader in aerospace technology. It has a well-established capability in airframes, engines and equipment for both fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. Westland has a distinguished place in this history. The maintenance of this position depends, as Westland recognises, on being competitive in world markets. It is worth recalling that Westland has made considerable achievements in the export market, often assisted by Government support in the difficult negotiations which such deals inevitably involve. I and my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Defence Procurement have taken part at various times in those export negotiations in various parts of the world, in support of Westland.<br/>
Since 1960, Westland expertise in naval helicopters has secured 60 per cent. of the light helicopter market outside the United States, with sales of Lynx, and previously Wasps. It has also secured some 30 per cent. of the medium helicopter market with sales of Sea King. In total, some 250 Westland helicopters are in service in some 17 countries around the world, a record that speaks for itself.<br/>
We in the Department of Trade and Industry are investing large amounts of money by way of launch aid for Westland's civil helicopter projects. The agreement in relation to the W30 provides for launch aid of &#x00A3;41 million, of which nearly &#x00A3;35 million has already been paid. The civil version of the EH101 helicopter, which Westland is developing in collaboration with the Italian company Augusta, will receive launch aid of up to &#x00A3;60 million, of which &#x00A3;4 million has so far been paid.<br/>
That investment surely demonstrates that the Government are giving the company tangible support in its efforts to break into the civil helicopter market. I remind the House that the EH101 agreement with Italy is supported by an intergovernmental memorandum of understanding.<br/>
Without doubting the sincerity of what the hon. Member for Yeovil says or his right to raise the matter, I should like to say that he shares with all of us a responsibility not to say anything either here or outside the House that might have a damaging effect on the company, which we all value. Two points that he made rather surprised me. First, he said that the Government had stayed silent during the period when a bid was taking place for the company, as indeed we did. I ask him and the House rhetorically, in the interests of time, to surmise what else would have been proper for us to do. When a private company is the subject of a bid there is no way that the Government can take a view one way or the other.<br/>
Secondly, on the AST404, which is within the prerogative of my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Defence Procurement, whom I am glad to have with me on the Front Bench tonight, I do not have anything formally to add to what he said in answer to questions in the House on 2 July. However, I should like to tell the hon. Gentleman that the letters AST&#x2014;I am not trying to be offensive when I spell this out, because it might be helpful to the House &#x2014; stand for air staff target, and target in defence procurement terms means just that. It is an original concept that is being devised by the services, with a possibility of it being met.<br/>
According to the processes in the Ministry of Defence, when further refinement of the staff target takes place, it becomes known as a staff requirement&#x2014;an ASR, GSR or NSR. At that point, and at that point only, can a document be put out for a competition to be held. The hon. Gentleman might say that there has been a bid, it was 30 per cent. cheaper, or it was the best bid, but that is not so. There has not yet been any question of a competition. If there was an ASR in existence, we would be a stage closer to having a competition, but that stage has not been reached.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman must be careful in what he says, at about fanning up the anxieties of the work force of Westland's and his constituents, and suggesting that the company has made a bid when it has not, and that it has entered a competition when there has not been one. That needs to be fairly and clearly stated. As for suggesting that the goal posts have been moved, the Ministry of Defence


and the Army Department are refining the staff targets, which is precisely why there is a target, as the hon. Gentleman would know from his military experience.</p>

<p>The matter must be cleared up. I hope that the Minister will recognise that equivalent anxieties about the way in which the company has been treated in this matter have come both from me and Conservative Members. Does he recognise that the Westland derivative of the W30 fulfilled the AST404 requirement, as it was laid down in detail?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="347806" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1985-07-08a.879.1" hansard_membership_id="12546" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19353" speakername="Mr. Pattie" colnum="879" time="00:57:00">
<p>The fact that the hon. Gentleman's anxieties may be echoed by my hon. Friends may mean that several people are under a genuine misapprehension. I am not suggesting that the hon. Gentleman is culpable in this matter, but I am pointing out that two stages must be completed before there is a competition. In suggesting that we should all ensure that we speak with considerable care and responsibility in this matter, I thought that it was correct to get the facts straight.<br/>
I am sure that the House would wish me to pay tribute to the contribution of Sir Basil Blackwell to the company in the past, and to offer best wishes for the future to the new chairman, Sir John Cuckney, and the acting chief executive, Hugh Stewart. Sir John has an outstanding reputation in the City and in industry. His arrival has brought stability, following the turmoil caused by the recent takeover bid and its last-minute withdrawal. It is a tribute to the inherent strength of the company that customers have remained loyal, and that there is no suggestion of any loss of confidence by creditors. Sir John will review the company's position in the light of the report that the board has commissioned from Price Waterhouse. At present, we can look forward to a period of stability and consolidation, during which Westland can redouble its efforts to promote its helicopters, especially in overseas markets. That is exactly as my hon. Friend the Member for Weston-super-Mare suggested. At present, we want a period of calm.<br/>
Westland is at present actively pursuing numerous sales opportunities for helicopters abroad. The company believes that there may be potential for sales of up to 140 Lynx aircraft in Europe, the middle east, Asia, Africa and south America, for up to 10 Sea Kings in Asia and the middle east, and for W30s in the United States of America, Europe, the Gulf, Asia, Africa and Australasia.<br/>
The House will know of the efforts that Westland has made to secure contracts to supply 21 W30 helicopters to the Indian Oil and Natural Gas Corporation for offshore work, and six aircraft to the Indian Government. The British Government have taken a considerable interest in this business and have, at the request of the Indian Government, agreed that the purchase might be funded out of the aid programme. That offer still stands. The ultimate decision about what aircraft they need must of course rest with the Indian authorities.<br/>
The Ministry has outstanding orders for 18 Sea King and six Lynx helicopters, worth about &#x00A3;70 million. There is, of course, a continuing need for spares and support services for the helicopters currently in service, and which will remain in service for many years to come. The Ministry is currently spending some &#x00A3;60 million a year on such spares and support. The Ministry of Defence is also funding development of the naval version of the EF101, which is a key element in the company's future strategy.<br/>
I hope that what I have said this evening will demonstrate that the Government are not a disinterested observer in the future of the helicopter industry, but we must not forget that Westland is a private sector company. There is no Government shareholding, and it is not for the Government to intervene in the management of the company or to seek to influence the form its future should take. I believe, however, that with good management and a determination to compete effectively in world markets in collaboration with others on major projects, Westland has a good future to look forward to.</p>
