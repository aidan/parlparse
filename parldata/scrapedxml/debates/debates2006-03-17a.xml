<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-17a.1706.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" speakername="Eric Forth" colnum="1706"  time="009:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060317/debtext/60317-01.htm#60317-01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1706.0/1">&mdash;to acknowledge the potential role of the regions. <i>[Laughter.]</i></p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-10">10 March</phrase>, the Minister said</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Regions will be able to set their own targets for microgeneration within any national target that we may set, and it would be more appropriate for them to do so, rather than central Government setting them. On those grounds, I oppose amendments Nos. 8, 9, 10, 16, 18 and 20.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/4">That raises a number of important questions. I should like to hear from the Minister at some stage whether he intends to table amendments&mdash;probably not at this stage, but when the Bill goes to another place&mdash;to give effect to what I have just read out. We shall come to that shortly in another context.</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/5">The Minister may think that his words are sufficient, but not all of us are that trusting. We would feel more secure if such important matters were spelt out in the Bill. That, then, is the first question: should this not be subject to an amendment, probably tabled in the House of Lords?</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/6">There are a number of other questions to be discussed. By what mechanism would the regional targets match the national targets? If we are to have a bottom-up approach rather than just a national target, I am intrigued by the question that then arises. Has the Minister thought out the way in which regions will be able to set their own targets within any national target?</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/7">That gives rise to several further questions. The obvious one is whether the process is to be voluntary. Can some regions set targets while others cannot? If all regions set targets, what will happen if the sum of the regional targets does not match the national target? There are a number of potential difficulties. How far has the Minister&mdash;or, more accurately, his officials&mdash;thought this through, and how do they think it will work? We cannot have Ministers throwing statements into a debate without our having any idea what they mean and how they would be given effect. I am sorry that the Minister was not able to accept my amendments, and I hope that we shall hear some further explanation from him.</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/8">That brings me to amendment No. 12. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-10">10 March</phrase>, the Minister said</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/9" class="indent">&quot;The word 'appropriate' is deliberately broad, whereas amendment No. 12, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" name="Eric Forth">the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase>, might be too prescriptive, as we may wish to consider other things when making such a decision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/10">That is followed by the key words&mdash;at least in this regard the Minister is entirely consistent:</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/11" class="indent">&quot;However, I assure him that when considering whether to use the powers in clause 6, we will, as always, ensure that we do so in a way that is effective and cost-effective, as well as environmentally beneficial.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-10">10 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 443, c. 1114&ndash;5.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/12">That is fine as far as it goes. It is a very reassuring statement of the Minister's good intentions. As we know, however, Ministers come and Ministers go. I am not sure that any succeeding Minister would necessarily be bound by what this Minister has to say. That is why I was disappointed that the Minister felt unable to accept my amendment, which I thought would add clarity and improve the Bill. I wanted to insert the words</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/13" class="indent">&quot;efficacious, cost-effective and environmentally beneficial&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1706.0/14">because&mdash;we shall be able to discuss this in more detail when we deal with later amendments&mdash;wind power is sporadic and unreliable, as is solar power, while water power is unfortunately relatively rare and inaccessible in this country. I think that we should make very clear what contribution such techniques can make, and that was my intention.</p>

	<p pid="a.1708.1/1">Indeed, and I am eager to get on to the very important debates that are coming up. I just wanted to warm myself and the House up and get people's minds thinking along the right lines. I wanted also to see if I could persuade the Minister to clarify his position on the regional-national balance, but he does not look as if he wishes to try to do so. That matter will remain unresolved and their lordships may have to look at it again, along with other aspects of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1708.1/2">I am disappointed by the Minister's response. It is not always good enough for a Minister, even one as good and decent as this one, to say, &quot;Trust me. I have said the words so that is what will happen.&quot; I hope that he will forgive me if I would prefer to see the words on the face of the Bill. I do not seem to have persuaded him on this occasion, and therefore we can move on. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1710.1/1">I am glad my hon. Friend picked that point up, because I was going to mention it later on. It is significant that if we had rushed through the Bill last week, we would not have had the benefit of the Government amendment that has since been tabled. The Bill might therefore have been defective in some way. The world should be grateful for the fact that the House lingered over the Bill last week to enable the Government to come forward with their later thoughts in the form of amendment No. 80, to which I will come shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1710.1/2">The Minister seemed to want to nod through amendments Nos. 33 and 34 as though they were of little or no consequence, but I believe that we should ask at least some questions about them. I shall read amendment No. 33 out so that we know where we are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1710.1/3" class="indent">&quot;An order under this section shall not include provision made by virtue of subsection (2)(b) which would be within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament if it were contained in an Act of that Parliament&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1710.1/4">Here we are touching, importantly and properly, on the relationship between what happens here at Westminster and the devolved powers of the Scottish Parliament. I always thought that environmental matters were without boundaries. I have been told over and again by Euro enthusiasts that one of the great strengths of the European Union is that it deals with cross-boundary&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">the hon.

	<p pid="a.1710.3/1">I am glad the hon. Gentleman is enjoying the debate. I hope he will stay for the whole five hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.1710.3/2">One of the alleged benefits of our membership of the European Union, or, indeed, of the Union itself is that it deals with cross-border environmental matters. Yet, here we are, as I read this amendment, seemingly acknowledging that the approaches taken to these important environmental matters could be different, even within this tiny country of the United Kingdom or within the British Isles, and that the Scottish Parliament might well take a different view. That surely cuts right across all the arguments that I have ever heard about how it is vital that environmental matters are dealt with at not just a national but a trans-national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.1710.3/3">It would appear that we might have a problem here. If we take the amendment literally&mdash;and we can do only that because the Minister did not bother to explain it&mdash;we envisage that the Scottish Parliament could digress from this Parliament in its approach to climate change and microgeneration. That is doubly unfortunate, since I would have thought that one of the environmental benefits of having Scotland as part of the United Kingdom is that it is almost certainly much richer in the renewable resources to which we all aspire. Therefore, the idea that the Scots might head off in a different direction, courtesy of devolution and the Scottish Parliament, seems unfortunate. For that reason alone, I would have thought that it might be better not to have this amendment in order that we could maintain integrity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1711.3/1">I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman. I shall accept his explanation and move on as a small reward for his participating in the debate. I hope that we will hear a lot more from him as time goes on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.3/2">That brings us on to the string of amendments that the Minister sought to dismiss as somehow trivial or technical&mdash;Nos. 40, 42, 43, 44, 45 and 46&mdash;in which we are beginning to tackle, really for the first time, the definition of microgeneration and the relationship between the Energy Act 2004 and the Bill. This was touched on at col. 1088 of the <i>Official Report</i> for <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-10">10 March 2006</phrase>, when there was an interesting exchange between <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> and the Minister. We&mdash;that is the House, because I do not think we were being properly guided on that occasion&mdash;got a little confused about whether we were talking about microgeneration being solely concerned with renewables or whether it went beyond that. That subject will come up in a moment when we look at the relationship between the Energy Act and the Bill, but at that stage we were talking about targets and the Minister was helping to clarify matters. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.3/3" class="indent">&quot;The target of 10 per cent. is for renewables . . . . It is not a target for microgeneration&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-10">10 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 443, c. 1088.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.3/4">That set the scene for what I want to explore in some of these amendments, which is how far microgeneration, as we now want to define it, is involved with renewables only or whether it can involve any other source of energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.3/5">The Energy Act, to which the clause refers, comprehensively sets out an approach to microgeneration. That is one of the reasons why I have hesitated so far to give my wholehearted support to the Bill. Section 82 of the Act, to which the amendments refer, places a duty on the Secretary of State</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.3/6" class="indent">&quot;to prepare a strategy for the promotion of microgeneration in Great Britain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.3/7">It goes on to state that he</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.3/8" class="indent">&quot;must publish the strategy within 18 months after the commencement&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1711.3/9">We should have had sight of that strategy by now. Perhaps when the Minister responds on this group, which he airily dismissed as being merely technical, he will tell us where we stand on that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1716.5/1">Yes of course, Madam Deputy Speaker, but it is useful to make the point as often as possible because some people do not yet seem to have grasped it. However, I will leave that just for the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1716.5/2">We now come to this neat little amendment, No. 80, which has been slipped into our proceedings. As has been said, is it not lucky that we are still considering the Bill today? Would it not have been terrible if we had wrapped up the proceedings prematurely on the previous sitting day and the Government had not had the chance to table that amendment, which popped up only on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">Wednesday 15 March</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="a.1716.5/3">I freely concede that amendment No. 80 is not a significant or major amendment, but presumably, if this opportunity to amend the Bill had not arisen, the Bill, if the House agreed to it, would have gone to another place defective, and might have had to be amended by the House of Lords. As we all know, as time marches on in the private Member's Bill process, Bills have to go to the House of Lords, so it does become somewhat hazardous. Therefore, it is just as well, is it not, that we are able today to deal with this amendment&mdash;which I am sure is worthy, although the Minister has not bothered to explain it either&mdash;and therefore make some proper progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1716.5/4">All in all, subject to what the Minister may choose to say if he seeks to catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker, as far as I am concerned at this stage, this group of amendments may well be satisfactory, but I await further words from the Minister and further debate on these important amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1721.1/1">I absolutely agree, Madam Deputy Speaker, but you will have noticed that subsection (3) of Government amendment No. 52 says that maximum capacity in relation to the generation of electricity is 50kW; in other words, the equivalent of a windmill 50 times the size of the one that the Minister is going to have on his house or of 50 windmills of that size in the Minister's garden. The Minister laughs, but in doing so he is probably trying to ridicule the notion that that amount of generating power in a domestic garden could be regarded as microgeneration, and that, of course, is exactly my point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1721.1/2">Why are we allowing the definition of microgeneration to include units that generate up to 50kW of electricity&mdash;more than 50 times what is needed for the Minister's house and more than 100 times, indeed 125 times, what is needed for the house of my right hon. Friend? When we start talking about microgeneration of up to 50kW, we are talking about very big developments&mdash;enormous windmills or whole series of windmills. Why should microgeneration be deemed to include electricity generation 50 times or more what an individual household needs? I cannot understand that. I support the principle of microgeneration and the idea of reducing the need for the national grid to operate and allowing more energy production to be, I think the expression is, decentralised. I cannot for the life of me see that if a household chooses to put up to 50kW of electricity-generating capacity in the garden or on the house that should be described as microgeneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1721.1/3">I am disappointed that the Minister, when he came to look at the contents of the Energy Act 2004 and redrafted its provisions in the amendments that we now see before us, stuck to the figure of 50kW. I hope that he will explain how 50kW can genuinely be called, in popular parlance, microgeneration. I hope that my Front-Bench colleagues will think about this subject because if we are to get public support for decentralised power production, surely we need to gain the confidence of the general public. If somebody living, for example, in a seafront bungalow in Bexhill in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1407" name="Gregory Barker">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase>, could put up 50 windmills in their garden on the basis that it would be microgeneration and then sell almost all that surplus electricity into the national grid, and their neighbours could do the same thing, my hon. Friend would find that Bexhill, far from being a very attractive retirement area with south-facing views over the channel, would basically become an industrial landscape.</p>

	<p pid="a.1723.2/1">My hon. Friend has stumbled across an important part of the Bill. If for simplicity we say that one house uses 1kW, amendment No. 39, in effect, provides that a group of 50 houses could be covered by a scheme; but clause 16 allows up to 20MW, or 20,000kW per scheme, which would supply 20,000 houses. Surely the point of the debate is to seek justification of the 50kW limit, when it would seem sensible to reduce the limit to 1kW or perhaps 5kW and thus seriously define the micro in microgeneration.</p>

Friend is right, one would have to buy 10 of those compact fuel cells to supply one household's fuel needs. I hope that we can get to the bottom of the matter because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering suggested, if we want to educate and encourage people to use microgeneration&mdash;my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition has given a strong lead on that&mdash;we must ensure that the natives do not get restless.</p>
	<p pid="a.1726.0/4">We do not want people to think that they can engage in an industrial process in their back garden that would enable them to sell 95 per cent. of their output. Jam makers are subject to regulations that prevent them from selling surplus jam at Women's Institute markets. Why, then, should individuals be allowed to generate 49kW of energy and sell it to the national grid while they keep 1kW for themselves?</p>

	<p pid="a.1726.2/1">I certainly would not want to rehearse any arguments again, Madam Deputy Speaker. I hope that, having listened to our debate, the Minister will explain the difference between the provisions of what he described as technical amendments and the much higher limits in clause 16. I hope that he will engage in constructive debate on the importance of not alarming the citizens of this country with the prospect of much larger generating units being sited in back gardens or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.1726.2/2">This has been a useful debate. I am glad that last week the Minister accepted that there was a defect in the Bill, which led to the introduction of Government amendment No. 80.When the Minister responds, I hope he will address my concern that the definition of greenhouse gas emissions in the context of dynamic demand technologies in clause 15, which is the subject of amendment No. 80, is consequential on Government amendment No. 50, which we debated last week. That introduced a definition of greenhouse gas in clause 23 covering any of the six gases specified in the Kyoto protocol. Surely technology that increases one greenhouse gas but reduces another is not necessarily good technology. Do we not want the impact of technology on each greenhouse gas to be measured? My fear&mdash;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;is that amendment No. 80 would allow the Government to look at the overall impact on all six gases, rather than measuring the impact on each of the greenhouse gases separately. You will be pleased to know, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I do not propose to engage again in the debate about whether water vapour is a greenhouse gas.</p>

	<p pid="a.1734.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We normally find in terms of legislation that prevention is better than cure. It is no good coming back later to try to amend it, because it will be too late. Some of us have been receiving representations from constituents who are concerned about the contents of some recent legislation, and we are having to say to them that it is too late to do anything about it because it has already gone through. We should anticipate the concerns that will arise. I like to think that all Members, particularly those of us who attend on Fridays, are closely in touch with their constituents' concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.1734.1/2">People are worried about how big these structures would be. According to the article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-13">13 March</phrase>, the wind turbine that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition is seeking to fit to his house has translucent rotor blades that are 1.1m in diameter, and it will generate just 400W of electricity. The same newspaper report referred to the Minister's house in Croydon being fitted out with a 1 kW turbine&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1736.10/2">Clause 9 currently discriminates against installations within the curtilage of a dwelling house, but not buildings that contain one or more flats. I hope that the Minister will deal with that point. If one's neighbour lived in a flat, one would have no worries, but if one's neighbour lived in a bungalow or a detached, semi-detached or terraced house, there are potential problems. My home in London where I stay during the week is a terraced house and the impact on my quality of life if my neighbours began installing such equipment in their gardens could be significant.</p>

	<p pid="a.1737.5/1">I certainly agree, but I have another reservation about amendment No. 13. By specifying some factors, it could be taken that others are excluded&mdash;for example, the need to safeguard the green belt, to preserve the setting of listed buildings and to protect wildlife, the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley. By not including those provisions, it might be thought that they are excluded. Perhaps that is a slightly technical, whinging point that it ill behoves me to make, especially in respect of an amendment so ably drafted by my right hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.5/2">What I like about amendment No. 13 are the specific references to visual amenity, noise and health and safety. We discussed visual amenity quite a lot in this short debate, but noise is a big unknown factor. Nothing in the Bill would limit the use of equipment at night. We know how sensitive our constituents are to night-time noise. I have personal experience of that. We once had a family house quite close to a farm that operated equipment late at night to dry bulbs produced in west Cornwall for the early English spring market. The noise was highly intrusive, but the equipment could run at night under permitted development powers because its use was related to agriculture. There was nothing that a concerned neighbour could do, except to plead with the farmer's common sense and to ask him to limit the use of the machines to daytime or to put in proper noise insulating material.</p>
	<p pid="a.1737.5/3">The other good thing about amendment No. 13 is the reference to health and safety. We are talking about big pieces of generating equipment, which may have quite high voltage, especially if they transfer energy to the national grid. All the electricity poles in my constituency have had little red signs put on them with a yellow marking that says, &quot;This is dangerous&quot;, and barbed wire has been put around them to protect them against intruders. Do we expect the equipment to be put on land adjacent to the public highway? How will we ensure that children, vandals and so on do not trespass and endanger their health and safety?</p>

	<p pid="a.1745.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The same applies when we consider the safety of such devices. The hon. Member for Christchurch painted a picture of almost Frankenstein proportions of large swathes of white electricity fizzing across the landscape as people put power into the national grid. The truth is that if one had a solar panel on one's roof that produced electricity when it was not being used in the house, a two-way meter could place current completely safely&mdash;without danger to small children, pets, or anyone else&mdash;into the national grid. The same would be true for other forms of microgeneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1745.1/2">I regret that several wild misapprehensions have been raised today, perhaps because of a lack of clarity or understanding about the proposals in clause 9. However, with the benefit of any reasonable consideration of how permitted development orders work, how a review might be undertaken and the extent of what is proposed, no reasonable. Member in the Chamber could oppose clause 9.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-17a.1748.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" speakername="Eric Forth" colnum="1748"  time="012:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060317/debtext/60317-15.htm#60317-15_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.1748.7/1">In that case, we need not have the clause at all. The Minister could give us an undertaking and we could all go home quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1748.7/2">Another of the criticisms that have been levelled at the Bill from the start is that it is in that dangerous area of gesture legislation or motherhood legislation. It is about making people feel good, especially some of the single-interest groups, which seem to influence so many Members of Parliament these days. Legislation should not be for such purposes: it should be for specific and clearly beneficial purposes. It should not be about making a gesture or making people happy, or pleasing this or that group. I am now being told that all the clause does is say to the Minister, &quot;Do a review, old boy,&quot; but if the Minister were to say simply, &quot;I'll do a review, don't worry,&quot; we could dispose of the matter very quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1748.7/3">The Minister said, &quot;Don't worry, folks, wind turbines in domestic circumstances will be for a kilowatt or two.&quot; If I thought that the Minister would table an amendment&mdash;say, when the Bill goes to the Lords, as I am sure it will&mdash;that would be enormously helpful, but at present we are stuck with only one figure to work with&mdash;the famous 50kW in amendment No. 52. Apart from what the Minister said, that is the only guidance that we have had so far.</p>
	<p pid="a.1748.7/4">The Minister went on to talk about &quot;sensible-scale microgeneration&quot;, but what is sensible is very much in the eye of the beholder. It is like our good old friend &quot;reasonable&quot;. It sounds reassuring, but in the terms of what I believe we are discussing today&mdash;potential intrusion into people's lives, albeit for the best of motives&mdash;sensible is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.1748.7/5">The dilemma that we face goes to the heart of the Bill. That is why I am so grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> for setting it out, and to the hon. Member for Southampton, Test for taking the trouble and deploying his expertise to spell out how he envisages the mechanisms working. However, as my hon. Friends indicated in their interventions, we are entitled to exhibit at least some unease about the process that the Bill invites to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1748.7/6">I hope that when we come to Third Reading, we shall have an opportunity to range much more widely over the concept of climate change, the United Kingdom's role in that, and the role of microgeneration within that, so that we can set the Bill in context. That is certainly for Third Reading, not for Report. In that part of the Bill, there is a tension or perhaps a conflict between, on the one hand, the environmentalists' desire to reap the alleged benefits of microgeneration and, on the other, constraints on planning, capacity and so on. If we do not get it right there is danger that there will be a backlash such as the one against telecommunications masts which, although in a very different way, it was thought would improve modern communications and the quality of life in general.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-17a.1751.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" speakername="Eric Forth" colnum="1751"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060317/debtext/60317-15.htm#60317-15_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.1751.0/1">Indeed. My hon. Friend makes an important point. Necessarily, this is all rather speculative. We have not had a chance, although we may get one on the next group of amendments or the one after that, or perhaps on Third Reading, to explore the intriguing idea of surplus energy generated for domestic requirements being sold back to the grid. If that could be made to work properly, if we could get the pricing relationships right and so on, there could be a temptation for people to put in much more capacity than they needed for their own family and domestic purposes to make some money.</p>
	<p pid="a.1751.0/2">I am all in favour of making money. I am still a capitalist. I know that that is out of fashion in this modern age, but I still believe passionately in profit, capitalism and even tax cutting. I am not criticising any possibility the Bill might give to the capitalist instinct in all of us, but the worry is that that incentive might induce people to install more potentially intrusive equipment and capacity than they might otherwise do. We have not considered that aspect and none of us is certain what the effect might be. That should give us some pause for thought.</p>
	<p pid="a.1751.0/3">I move on to my amendment No. 70. Here again, there is the conflict that has arisen a couple of times and always will when we are considering such Bills. The Minister tends to say, &quot;Don't worry. Of course we'll consult all the right people. Of course we'll pay due regard to their views.&quot; To avoid all doubt and misgiving, it would be better to have in the Bill an obligation on the Secretary of State, in the context of the mechanisms in the clause and the aim of this part of the Bill, to consult any</p>
	<p pid="a.1751.0/4" class="indent">&quot;body or bodies as appear to him to be representative of local authorities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1751.0/5">Local authorities play a key part in the Bill since in our sitting last Friday we agreed to insert the Minister's new clause bringing them very much into play. Having brought local authorities in, it would be a good idea if they were consulted on the important provisions in clause 9. The list that I propose is not intended to be limiting or exclusive. I put into the list the bodies that I thought were relevant to the sort of considerations that I hoped would be in play in the review and the process of looking at the relationship between microgeneration and planning. Obviously, the Royal Institute of British Architects sprang to mind as a group of people to whom it would be very useful to speak, to find out how they saw the relationship between the built environment, as I think we are now supposed to call it, and all this exciting new technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.1751.0/6">I think <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase> was gently pulling my leg, for which I forgive him completely, when he spoke about windmills on roofs in Bromley. I can tell him that the roofs of Bromley are sturdy indeed. Whether my constituents want turbines on their roofs is a matter for them. Of course, there is also a serious point about the relationship between whatever form of microgeneration we happen to be talking about&mdash;it may be photovoltaics, solar panels, which do not have to be on roofs, as they can be mounted away from a building, wind turbines or some of the more exotic technologies&mdash;and building design and construction, on which they all have a bearing. That is why I thought it would be proper and indeed essential for architects to be brought into the matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-17a.1753.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" speakername="Christopher Chope" colnum="1753"  time="012:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060317/debtext/60317-16.htm#60317-16_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.1753.1/1">We have had an excellent debate in which almost a record number of right hon. and hon. Members have taken part. I am sorry, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you were not in the Chair to hear the beginning of the debate, because you may find it more difficult to follow the stage that we have reached. We have made a lot of progress since the outset. The Minister started off with the view that there was no need to worry about something that was just a lot of hot air being blown from this side of the Chamber, but he, as well as the promoter of the Bill, the hon. Members for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead) and for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne) and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1407" name="Gregory Barker">my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase> have all joined in and said, in effect, that it is a genuine issue and therefore an important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1753.1/2">An interesting backdrop to the debate is that if we had had before us the report that the Minister was going to produce before the end of this month giving his strategy for the promotion of microgeneration, we would have been able to see to what extent the difficulty of getting planning permission, or the need to get it, is a constraint upon the development of microgeneration and one that he would wish to overcome. It is disappointing that we have been unable to see that, because we do not know what the Minister's strategy is or what he has in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1753.1/3">We do know, however, that under existing planning law the Minister could bring forward proposals to change the general development order and increase the categories of permitted development without the need for this clause. Indeed, he could have taken that course any time in the past 18 months or two years. Why has not he done so? If, as has been suggested, it is such a burning issue, why have the Government not presented proposals to change the existing general development order and what is permitted under it?</p>
	<p pid="a.1753.1/4">The Minister has not allayed my concern that the clause is highly prescriptive. If he is happy to provide for consultation, he does not need the clause. When my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle is the Minister responsible&mdash;I hope that that will happen sooner rather than later&mdash;I am sure he will not be so slow in making the relevant amendments to the general development order. He will not need the Bill to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1753.1/5">There is agreement between Front-Bench Members of all three parties that microgeneration is a good thing and that it should be facilitated. If that can be done through relaxing the provisions of the general development order and allowing permitted development, there is nothing to prevent it from happening now. Indeed, the Minister could get on with it this weekend. He could put a note in his Red Box for Monday morning&mdash;so that his private secretary would see it&mdash;saying, &quot;Get on with this.&quot; Perhaps he would have to consult the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs or even the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. However, I am sure that he could present such proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1753.1/6">The mandatory nature of the current formulation and the way in which the clause appears to exclude proper debate and consultation worry me. I shall not repeat my detailed argument that the way in which the subsections are linked results in an unnecessarily oppressive measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1753.1/7">We have heard much about the amount of electricity generation that could be facilitated without the need for planning permission under the permitted development order. The Minister has assured us that he does not intend to go beyond what he and other contributors to the debate call &quot;small-scale microgeneration&quot;. That is a good expression but it does not appear in the Bill. If it had been incorporated, I am sure the measure would have received less detailed scrutiny because there would not have been so much concern about its intentions. People are worried about what the Bill describes as microgeneration but is, in common parlance, large-scale microgeneration, and its being carried out without planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1753.1/8">I have considered whether we should accept the Minister's good intentions and not press the matter to a vote. I have also taken into account <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the assurances of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> that he has only television aerials and satellite dishes in mind. If that is all he has in mind, it can be done at the moment, pretty uncontroversially, through the Minister's current powers. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">The hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> made the point that the Minister already has the power and that the clause simply makes it use mandatory. Why do we need to make it mandatory when the Minister is such an enthusiast? What is holding him back? Surely he is being encouraged. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Unfortunately, I cannot respond to hand gestures. If anyone wishes to intervene, they are free to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1753.1/9">On a serious note, if we are just talking about television aerials or satellite dishes then fine, but we need to be alert to the possibility that someone might want the equivalent of 50 satellite dishes or TV aerials because they want to have 50 1kW generators.</p>

	<p pid="a.1758.4/1">In that case, I unreservedly apologise to the Minister. I misconstrued my hon. Friend. I unreservedly withdraw any accusation I have made about the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.1758.4/2">We can be optimistic that the 12 months mentioned in clause 15 will be met by the Minister, or, if he has been promoted by then, his successor. There will be an appraisal of the contribution that this exciting new technology may be able to make to the whole area of microgeneration and its relationship&mdash;real or imagined&mdash;to climate change. I thought that my amendments might stiffen the measure a bit. Subsection (3) states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1758.4/3" class="indent">&quot;In forming the view mentioned . . . the Secretary of State must have regard, in particular, to any matters which would prohibit or inhibit the use . . . of dynamic demand technology in any circumstance in which its use could be expected to make a contribution to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases in Great Britain.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.1758.4/6">Throughout our considerations, we have rather glossed over, first, the possible costs of installing the various technologies to which we have referred and, secondly, who would be expected to bear them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1758.4/7">This may be our opportunity to clarify the assumption&mdash;at least in my mind&mdash;that it will be the user, the consumer, who will install the equipment that is referred to in the clause and throughout the Bill.

	<p pid="a.1763.2/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" name="Eric Forth">My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase> has done the House a service in using the device of tabling an amendment to ensure that we have a debate. This provision was not in the Bill when it was considered on Second Reading; it was, as new clause 21, an amendment to the Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1763.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">The hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase> was too modest to repeat in the full Chamber the joke that he made on that occasion, but like him I am a supporter of Southampton football club and I think that it is worth repeating it. He said that dynamic demand</p>
	<p pid="a.1763.2/3" class="indent">&quot;is not what despairing Southampton football club fans are demanding of their team&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1763.2/4">It is important to put that on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.1763.2/5">The other thing that needs to be put on the record is that during that short Standing Committee debate the Minister said, very frankly, that although the Government are committed to these climate change reduction technologies, they</p>
	<p pid="a.1763.2/6" class="indent">&quot;have done very little proactive work in this area to date&mdash;I do not understand why&mdash;although we have kept up to date with developments. It is clear that these technologies deserve closer investigation, to establish whether they could make a significant contribution to reducing our carbon emissions.&quot; &mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee C,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February 2006</phrase>; c. 97&ndash;100.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1763.2/7">I hope that, following those remarks, the Minister immediately went back to his Department and said, &quot;Let's get on with this job and write the report. Don't let us wait for the Bill to get on to the statute book before we start because there is considerable potential here.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1763.2/8">That potential is recognised in all parts of the House, and the more information we can bring to bear, the better informed the debate will be. It is agreed that any meaningful report will have to have regard to the costs and the necessary equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1763.2/9">I take <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1407" name="Gregory Barker">the same line as my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase>, namely, that the amendments tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst would add unnecessarily to the Bill. I only wish that my hon. Friend's desire for the light-touch approach had been evident during the debate on the previous groups of amendments, when we had the chance to remove clause 9 and make the Bill no worse by so doing. However, it is good that we should agree as much as possible, and when we do agree we should be proud to say so. I therefore say that I agree with my hon. Friend on the amendments being unnecessary. However, I say also that had my right hon. Friend not tabled them, we would not have been able to have this short but important debate on a potentially impressive area of new technology.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-17a.1768.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" speakername="Eric Forth" colnum="1768"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060317/debtext/60317-21.htm#60317-21_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.1768.1/1">Of course, but the worry is that Government amendment No. 49 seeks to leave out subsections (3) and (4), although we will not know the reasons why until the Minister gets to his feet.</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/2">I think that what is proposed is a worrying development that exemplifies a degree of over-enthusiasm by people who are keen on the Bill. Courtesy of a Government new clause that we debated last Friday, we have already amended the Bill to bring local authorities generally into the process. Although some of us were not desperately happy with that, we envisaged that county and perhaps district councils could have a role to play; mysteriously, the Greater London assembly did not appear anywhere, and we are still wondering about that lacuna. Reaching out to parish councils as the clause seeks to do is a step too far. I am not sure what added value parish councils, excellent though they are, could bring to the complexities of the subject that we have dealt with today and last Friday.</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/3">I want to elicit more information about how a parish council can come anywhere near to doing the sort of things that are spelled out in clause 17, which refers to the encouragement and promotion of microgeneration of items such as efficiency in fuel use and reduction in energy use, as well as</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/4" class="indent">&quot;production in their area . . . of biomass, or . . . any fuel derived from biomass&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/5">I must admit that that is not quite what I thought parish councils were supposed to be all about. I would be very surprised if they were prepared to give priority to the activities set out in clause 17 over and above what we would normally expect them to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/6">Matters become even more mysterious when we look at the amendments standing in the Minister's name. I struggled to understand his desire to insert the words</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/7" class="indent">&quot;whether offered or provided by public authorities or by any other persons&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/8">That is an intriguing phrase. I do not know what he envisages in referring to &quot;any other persons&quot;, but perhaps he will tell us in due course. Furthermore, Government amendment No. 48 states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Assistance provided under subsection (1) may, if the council giving the assistance think appropriate . . . be made subject to conditions, or . . . otherwise be provided on such terms as the council think appropriate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/10">Again, I am not sure what is envisaged, as the amendment could mean a lot or not very much at all. I look forward to hearing the Minister explain just what his amendments would mean on the ground, day to day, to a typical parish council, with the limited resources that parish councils necessarily have.</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/11">The most intriguing of the Minister's amendments is the one that I mentioned in reply to the intervention made by the hon. Gentleman&mdash;Government amendment No. 49, which seeks to remove the one reassurance that features in the whole clause. What are we to think of that? Subsection (3) states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Nothing in this section authorises a parish council or community council to provide any financial assistance by&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/13" class="indent">(a) making a grant or loan,</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/14" class="indent">(b) giving a guarantee or indemnity, or</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/15" class="indent">(c) investing by acquiring share or loan capital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1768.1/16">Initially, I thought, &quot;Thank goodness for all that; it seems to make sense,&quot; as did the further provision in subsection (4), but now the Minister seeks to remove all that provision. The implications are intriguing. I assume that he is now content with the thought that a parish council could set out to make grants or loans, give guarantees or indemnities or invest by acquiring share or loan capital. That moves us into really bizarre territory.</p>

	<p pid="a.1770.0/1">The final group contains an interesting range of amendments. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" name="Eric Forth">My right hon. Friend the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase> made sensible points, as usual. I share his concerns about the need for community consultation and participation in local decision making. He is right that the Secretary of State should pay due regard to those issues in drawing up his report. However, I take great comfort from and, indeed, endorse the Minister's comments and do not believe that my right hon. Friend's amendments need to be incorporated into the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1770.0/2">I thank the Minister for tabling Government amendments Nos. 47 to 49. As he rightly said, an issue was raised not only by me but other members of the Committee. If my right hon. Friend had read the reports of our Committee proceedings, he would have known about the extensive and useful discussion of the subject that we held Upstairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1770.0/3">Much has been said about microgeneration but the measure is about a great deal more than domestic appliances. It is about decentralisation of energy. Although it constitutes only a modest step, I hope that it is the first step in a significant direction for the country's energy policy, which will encourage much greater decentralised energy. If we are to move towards a decentralised model, that will require more community schemes. In many, although not all cases, especially in rural areas, the most effective, efficient and cost-effective way of embracing the new model will not be individual householders adopting their own kit but an efficient, small community form of domestic heat and power generation. I do not mean windmills or even solar or photovoltaic technology but gas-fired, combined heat and power or biomass fuel technology. Those work best, economically and efficiently, if they are adopted by several householders coming together on a relatively small scale. They are especially applicable to rural areas. Surely it is best for those schemes to be brought together in a democratic forum, where everyone in a village could have a voice, feel that their concerns were incorporated and the result was a genuine community plan. It is important to have a facility&mdash;it is only a facility&mdash;so that, in some circumstances, there is an opportunity to give some sort of financial encouragement when there is community consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1770.0/4">I am mindful of the time and I do not want to hold matters up. I thank the Government for their amendments and support them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1773.0/1">I accept that the clause would not affect the planning controls. What worries me is that it is entitled &quot;Promotion of community energy schemes&quot;, and the scheme that I have described is precisely the kind that the Government would have a duty to promote if the Secretary of State thought fit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1773.0/2">It is absurd to suggest that wind turbines would have to be 20 times as large in order to generate 20 times as much as 1.4MW. I am envisaging, say, 20 1.4MW turbines, which would constitute a gross intrusion on any community. The Minister mentioned biomass. We do not need those excessive limits even for biomass. According to a helpful written answer published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-10">10 February 2005</phrase>, the total output from the 11 biomass power plants operating in this country amounted to only just over 100MW. There is no need for such high limits to accommodate one biomass plant. I fear that we are talking not about community schemes, but about enormous schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1774.3/1">As always, my right hon. Friend makes a fair point. We do not have parish councils in the metropolitan areas, so this is very much an issue for rural communities. Sometimes parish councils get together to develop policies on a co-ordinated basis across a county&mdash;there is an effective organisation called the Dorset Association of Parish and Town Councils which might be able to produce a collective response to the demands set out in clause 17.</p>
	<p pid="a.1774.3/2">I do not think that I can take the matter any further at the moment, without risking the possibility that we might not be able to complete the Report stage today. I have always made it clear to people who have discussed the issue with me that my concern is to ensure that the Bill is properly scrutinised, rather than that it should be wrecked. That is why I want to put on my record my concern that e-mails have been flying around suggesting that by speaking and participating in this debate one of my hon. Friends is guilty of something greater than denying the holocaust. One might describe that as a slight exaggeration. I am sure people will realise that there are people who could be described as eco-fascists, and we must not allow them to browbeat us into doing anything other than scrutinising this important legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1775.0/1">I assure my hon. Friend that I will not be browbeaten by eco-nuts, eco-fascists or any other odd people. I am always prepared to engage in serious debate and scrutiny of Bills, be they well-intentioned or otherwise. I congratulate the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith on steering his Bill to this stage in its development. With a bit of luck, we might just be able to get started on Third Reading today, which would be a giant step forward and would reward the patience that the hon. Gentleman has shown, as well as his politeness and his courtesy&mdash;qualities not shown by some extraordinary, unpleasant people outside the House who, being either ill-informed or malicious, think that bombarding Members of Parliament with vaguely threatening material can somehow change the way we work. I hope this debate has demonstrated that that is not, and will not be, the case, no matter how strongly they may feel about this or that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/2">We have had a useful debate on this group of amendments. I am not sure that we have quite got to the bottom of the meaning and importance of community energy schemes and projects, or that we are completely satisfied that there will be sufficient protection against the development of what could be substantial generating plants. We have been given reassurances, and I hope that they are carried through in whatever way may be appropriate&mdash;in guidance and so on. I hope that one of the things that has emerged strongly from this debate is that we must get the balance right between the desire for good things such as microgeneration, sustainable energy and renewables on the one hand and people's quality of life on the other. It is one thing to attempt to look decades ahead and save the planet in the next century, but it is quite another to take care of the quality of people's everyday lives today, and that should concern us as much, if not more.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/3">We will probably have to agree to disagree on parish councils. Few parish councils will have the resources available or will be prepared to give sufficient priority to this kind of work, over and above what they do day by day in their communities. There has obviously been some interesting to-ing and fro-ing between <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1407" name="Gregory Barker">my hon. Friend the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase> and the Minister about how to get the pitch about parish councils right. My view, which I expressed in my amendment, is that it would probably be better to leave them out of it altogether. However, at this stage of the Bill, I will be content to let matters rest there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/4">We have had helpful explanations. The Minister has been helpful throughout. He has given us his explanations in his usual courteous way, and the promoter of the Bill has been much more helpful today than he was last Friday. He has been rewarded by some good progress on the Bill. I am very grateful that he brought along his hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test, who has put us right in his knowledgeable way. I am sure that the Bill will be that much the better for it. So, for all these reasons, I am not going to press my amendment to the vote. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/5" class="italic">Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p pid="a.1778.1/1">This is the bit we have all been looking forward to, because I hope that with your permission, Mr. Deputy Speaker, we shall be able to range much more widely than when we were constrained by amendments and new clauses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.1/2">My remarks, sadly, probably will not be able to be concluded by 2.30, but I am sure that we can look forward to another full day of debate on Third Reading, to do the Bill proper justice. I should like to open with a quote from the Prime Minister's very good evidence to the Liaison Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-07">7 February</phrase>. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.1/3" class="indent">&quot;whether the climate changes or not is not going to depend on the UK&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.1/4">That sets a useful frame for Third Reading. By the way, the Prime Minister went on to say that climate change</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.1/5" class="indent">&quot;is dependent on those huge economic motors and in particular China and India&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.1/6">That is one aspect that I hope we shall be able to explore on Third Reading, given the title of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.1/7">The long title of the Bill gives us some good guidance for framing our debate. It talks variously about</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.1/8" class="indent">&quot;the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.1/9">which we have to a large extent touched on today, in respect of the contribution that might be made by microgeneration and so on; &quot;the promotion of microgeneration&quot;, on which we rightly spent a long time; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.1/10" class="indent">&quot;the use of heat produced from renewable sources&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.1/11">There is a cornucopia of important issues that we can and should explore on Third Reading.</p>

	<p pid="a.1779.0/1">My right hon. Friend referred to the international context for the Bill. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-12">12 January</phrase>, I received a response to my parliamentary question about carbon dioxide emissions, which stated that the UK would reach a total of 525 million tonnes by 2020 compared to 556 million tonnes at present, so there is likely to be a decrease. However, in the United States the amount is set to rise from just over 5,000 million tonnes to 6,763 million tonnes by 2020.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-17a.1783.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="1783"  time="014:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060317/debtext/60317-26.htm#60317-26_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.1783.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on the commitment that he has shown on this issue over many years. He has an interest not only in Western Sahara but, for the purposes of this debate, in any potential impact of the EU-Morocco fisheries agreement on that part of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1783.0/2">May I start by apologising to my hon. Friend for the fact that, as he acknowledged, many of the points that he raised are the responsibility of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office? I know that he held discussions with the Minister for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" name="Kim Howells">the Middle East, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells)</phrase>, back in the autumn, and he may want to renew that contact now. I shall certainly make sure that the concerns that he has raised today that are relevant to the Foreign Office are communicated to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.1783.0/3">The proposed new fisheries partnership agreement between the EU and Morocco is due to come into force in May 2006 for a period of four years. It is made under the provisions of the European common fisheries policy and, as my hon. Friend said, the Commission has competence to negotiate such agreements on behalf of the EU. The agreement has yet to come before the Agriculture and Fisheries Council for adoption, and we are still waiting for an opinion from the European Parliament. If they have not already done so, I urge <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">my hon. Friends the Members for Islington, North and for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, who has a deep interest, to raise their concerns with Members of the European Parliament, who have a role to play in these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1783.0/4">From a purely fisheries perspective, the agreement reflects the new fisheries partnership approach based on the Fisheries Council's reforms of 2004 in respect of such agreements. For example, article 6 of the protocol to the agreement provides for more than a third of the EU's financial contribution to be used for the implementation of a national fisheries policy based on responsible fishing and on the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources. That reflects the improvements to such third-party agreements in terms of their transparency and sustainability that were championed by the United Kingdom in particular. The agreement is based on the scientific assessment of stocks in Moroccan waters and consequently excludes fishing possibilities for cephalopods and shellfish, which have been over-exploited.</p>
	<p pid="a.1783.0/5">In addition to the fisheries aspects of the agreement, my hon. Friend has raised its potential effect on the disputed status of Western Sahara. I give my hon. Friend and the House the following assurance. The UK Government would not support an agreement if we felt that it would prejudice the question of the status of Western Sahara. The delimitation of the agreement is identical to that of the previous EU-Morocco fisheries agreement, which expired in 1999. The UK Government's position remains the same: the status of Western Sahara should be dealt with under the United Nations process. We regard the sovereignty of Western Sahara as undetermined, pending UN efforts to find a solution and we fully support that UN process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1783.0/6">As my hon. Friend also said, the European Commission has recently produced legal advice that suggests that there is nothing in the draft fisheries agreement that is inconsistent with international law governing the status of Western Sahara. The Fisheries Council will clearly want to explore that advice further when discussing the draft agreement. The UK Government are considering the Commission's advice in discussion with other member states who, like us, have been seeking reassurance on the matter, and we have placed a reserve on our position.</p>
	<p pid="a.1783.0/7">I am aware of concerns expressed by War on Want and others that few Sahrawis will benefit from the agreement because of the structure of the fishing industry in the areas concerned. The Commission has expressed the view that the Western Sahara people will benefit from the agreement, but I have asked the Commission to study and respond to War on Want's evidence as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1783.0/8">Morocco is obliged under international law to ensure that in non-self-governing territories such as Western Sahara economic activity does not adversely affect the people. It is clear in paragraph 24 of the letter of <phrase class="date" code="2002-01-29">29 January 2002</phrase> from the UN's legal advisers to the Security Council that the exploitation of the resources of such territories must be conducted for the benefit of the peoples of those territories on their behalf or in consultation with their representatives.</p>
