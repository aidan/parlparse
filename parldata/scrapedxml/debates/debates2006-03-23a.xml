	<p pid="a.391.5/1">The OFT has responsibilities for enforcing UK competition and consumer protection regimes, which include supermarkets. The OFT has announced its decision to consult on a proposed referral of the grocery market to the Competition Commission for a market investigation. The statutory consultation, as required be section 169 of the Enterprise Act 2002, will close on <phrase class="date" code="">6 April</phrase>, and I trust that hon. Members will take part. The OFT is also responsible for monitoring compliance by certain supermarkets with the supermarket code of practice, which was put in place after an earlier investigation by the Competition Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.401.1/1">The climate change levy was supposed to be revenue neutral on the grounds that it also reduced employers' national insurance contributions. Since its introduction, both NICs and the levy have gone up. If the levy is genuinely to be a tax on climate change, not just a tax on energy use, surely all logic should compel the Government to design a system that constrains emissions, rather than just clobbers manufacturing. In what possible sense does the climate change levy distinguish between those who use energy that does produce emissions and those who use energy that does not?</p>

	<p pid="a.403.5/1">At the meetings in London between 10 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-12">12 March</phrase>, negotiators from the EU, US, India, Brazil, Australia and Japan engaged positively on the substance of the Doha development agenda, but failed to make a breakthrough in the talks.

	<p pid="a.411.3/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for giving us the business for the coming weeks, which, as he announced, includes debates on the Budget. I understand that nothing will be said about the health service during those debates because there will be no speech from the Health Secretary. Last week alone, 2,000 NHS jobs were cut, including doctors and nurses, but the Chancellor had nothing to say about the health service. When I have raised these NHS cuts in the past, the right hon. Gentleman's response has been, &quot;Don't you think financial management is important?&quot; Of course it is, but we need a debate on what has caused the cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/2">Yesterday, the Royal Free hospital in Hampstead announced 480 job cuts and Geoff Martin, head of campaigns at London Health Emergency, said that that explained why the Chancellor had</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/3" class="indent">&quot;body-swerved the NHS question . . . Sacking nurses never looks good for the Government.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/4">I am interested in his comments, because I remember him when he was a Labour councillor in the London borough of Merton. Government targets and bureaucracy lie behind those cuts. That is why they are genuinely Brown's NHS cuts. Let us fill in the gap that the Chancellor left in the Budget and have a debate on the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/5">Some cuts are also being made in mental health services. In the Adjournment debate on Monday, the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">the hon. Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase> stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Surveys show that only 11 of a total of 84 trusts have considered making small cuts in mental health services.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 132.]</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/7">Today there is a written ministerial statement on mental health legislation, but according to the radio this morning, the Government will scrap the Mental Health Bill, little more than a month after our debate on mental health, when no mention was made of scrapping the Bill. Again, we learn more about the Government's actions from the media than on the Floor of the House. The Secretary of State for Health should make an oral statement on mental health services next week, so that she can be questioned by hon. Members and held to account for her actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/8">Today, the Prime Minister is making a written statement on an independent adviser on Ministers' interests. I welcome what appears to be his change of heart. However, we have called for an independent review of the ministerial code for four years. Indeed, I repeated that call yesterday in Westminster Hall. Will the Prime Minister make an oral statement on that and confirm that the Chancellor played an active part in Cabinet debates on the matter? It is another subject on which the Chancellor has been strangely silent.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/9">Today the chairman of Capita, Rod Aldridge, who lent money to the Labour party, resigned. Last year the Chancellor appointed him to chair his commission on youth volunteering. Will the Chancellor make a statement on Capita's links with the Government?</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/10">The Chancellor mentioned equal pay yesterday. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/11" class="indent">&quot;I can today announce new help for working women who want a wider range of career choices offering higher earnings and to close the pay gap with men.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 293.]</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/12">To follow up the questions that have just been asked to the Minister for Women and Equality, does that mean that the Chancellor will close the 49 per cent. pay gap that exists for that Minister? After all, there is still no Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, and the Department for Transport is one Minister down, so the money is available. May we have a debate on levels of pay? During it, we could perhaps discuss the pay offer in a Labour party advert last week, offering &pound;28,000 to &pound;32,000 for</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/13" class="indent">&quot;an experienced, successful, highly motivated and dynamic fundraiser to secure significant funds for the Labour Party.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/14">That individual will be</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/15" class="indent">&quot;involved in all aspects of our key donor fundraising work where you will be expected both to initiate ideas and fulfil expectations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.411.3/16">We all know what those are. It is time that that the Prime Minister came to the House and explained himself.</p>

	<p pid="a.412.0/1">First, the right hon. Lady referred to the Budget debate. There will be a debate today, which will continue on Monday and Tuesday. There will therefore be every opportunity for hon. Members to raise any issue that they wish, not least the excellent funding that the NHS receives. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made clear, an extra &pound;6 billion will be put into the NHS next year and a further &pound;6 billion the year after.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/2">If Conservative Members genuinely believe that that extra money should not be spent on the health service, they need to make it clear&mdash;rather clearer than the shadow Chief Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1500" name="Theresa Villiers">the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)</phrase>, speaking on Sky News yesterday. When she was asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/3" class="indent">&quot;So therefore compared to what he&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/4">the Chancellor&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/5" class="indent">&quot;is planning on spending you would be spending less?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/6">the hon. Lady replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Um . . . It's . . . It would certainly . . . Yeah, yeah, undoubtedly that could be a possibility&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/8">What a lamentable performance from someone who apparently aspires to run the British economy. Perhaps that explains why she has been pulled from the Budget debate and is not replying to it, as traditionally happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/9">Indeed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1868" name="George Osborne">the shadow Chancellor, the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne)</phrase>, is not opening the debate either, as would normally be the case. Instead, we have <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase>&mdash;I am delighted to see him on the Front Bench&mdash;who will no doubt be declaring his considerable interests when he gets up to open the debate, having refused to abandon his connection with the City when he moved jobs. It would seem that he is now back in the same job, without having given up his interests in the City, so we are not going to take any lectures from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> about interests. She referred to the chairman of Capita, and we know that he made a loan to the Labour party&mdash;because the Labour party published that information. If the Conservatives are so keen on transparency, perhaps they should publish their list of donors. So far, however, we have not heard from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/10">The right hon. Lady asked for a debate on mental health. The Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" name="Rosie Winterton">my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase> has issued a written ministerial statement on that subject, as has my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on the subject of independent advisers. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer made clear yesterday the Government's commitment to reducing the gap in women's pay, which we have consistently been committed to doing.</p>

	<p pid="a.419.0/1">I was very sorry that the shadow Leader of the House could not bring herself to give a sincere welcome to the initiatives that the Chancellor took yesterday to provide better training in skills for women. They have been welcomed universally by all except Opposition Members. The situation contrasts very favourably with the total lack of initiatives for women and work when the Conservatives were in government, while from time to time the pay gap worsened. None the less, acknowledging that there is a pay gap, and acknowledging that the report from the Women and Work commission contains some very good recommendations, may we have a full debate on those recommendations to establish whether we can make progress, and possibly even galvanise Opposition Members into taking a bit of interest in the issue?</p>

	<p pid="a.420.1/1">Last night, I was rung by a journalist who told me that the mental health Bill will be dropped. We heard details about that this morning on the radio, and at 10.15 the press were summoned to the Department of Health to be formally informed. Sometime afterwards, a statement appeared in the Library. The Secretary of State for Health really must make a statement to the House explaining where this legislation now stands. We have had a Green Paper, a White Paper, two draft mental health Bills and a pre-legislative Scrutiny Committee. How much money has been spent on this entire exercise, which has now come to nothing? What will the timetable now be for amending the Mental Health Act 1983, and how does the Secretary of State for Health propose urgently to deal with such legislation's conflict with the European convention on human rights? Simply issuing a statement and talking to the press really will not do. The Department must be accountable to the House for this very important legislation, for which we have been waiting for seven years.</p>

	<p pid="a.428.0/1">First, I thank the Minister for providing me with an advance copy of the statement. I join him in congratulating our armed forces on the magnificent job that it appears they have yet again carried out in Iraq, in the release of Mr. Norman Kember, which will be welcomed not only on both sides of the House but throughout the land and, I hope, throughout the whole free world. It follows the magnificent operation undertaken in September 2005 when British forces were instrumental in releasing two of our armed forces who were being held by the Iraqi police in Basra. As the Minister said, such operations illustrate the extraordinary professionalism of Her Majesty's armed forces, in which the whole House can take enormous pride.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/2">I associate the Opposition with the tributes paid to the Territorial Army by the Minister. Members of the TA do an outstanding job and it is genuinely debatable whether the Government would have been able to carry out their operations in Iraq without the support given by members of the TA&mdash;not only in the specialist skills which they bring, but in their making up the shortfall in the Regular Army caused by the reduction in numbers under the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/3">As the Minister said, since we became involved in Iraq about 12,580 TA soldiers have been mobilised to plug the gaps. That number includes two extremely distinguished members of the reserve forces, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">my hon. and gallant Friends the Members for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> and for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne), who have certainly played their part in the support of their country.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/4">I also think that we should pay tribute to the employers, without whose support and co-operation in releasing their employees for deployment the TA could not operate. In particular, we should acknowledge the special contribution of small businesses, which often have to make great sacrifices when members of their staff are deployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/5">In a written answer of the <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-22">22 February</phrase>, the Minister stated that, at <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase>, the total strength of the TA was 37,430, against an establishment of 41,610. Yet that figure was misleading, as it included 5,750 members of the Officer Training Corps. The truth is that the actual number of TA personnel stands at around 31,680, making the actual shortfall in the establishment, leaving out the OTC, about 6,500. Furthermore, according to a recent report in <i>The Herald&mdash;</i>a newspaper with which the Minister will be more than familiar&mdash;it is alleged that only a third of the TA is ready for operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/6">More than 13,500 men and women have left the TA since the invasion of Iraq in 2003&mdash;over 6,000 have left in the past year alone. That translates to a rate of about 600 people a month leaving the TA. Previously, about 150 people a month left. The TA's manning levels are now at some of the lowest figures since it was formed in 1906, yet the rate of deployments is higher than at any time in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/7">Across our armed forces, both regular and reserve personnel are being asked to do more with less. The Minister has presented the restructuring today as a means of increasing the TA's deployability and, of course, we welcome any increase in the utility of those forces. We particularly welcome the return to affiliating TA units to their regular counterparts&mdash;something that is more than symbolic, as it will have practical operational consequences. We also welcome the creation of an Army Air Corps reserve regiment to support the Apache attack helicopter. The Army has been particularly adept in using air reserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/8">Although we also welcome some of the additional units proposed by the Government, we cannot understand the proposal to reduce some of the specialist units, such as medical staff. In the annual report for last year, the Ministry of Defence stated that there were areas of &quot;critical shortage&quot;, and the latest available figures indicate that, against an establishment of 6,880, there were only 4,080 medics. Furthermore, we fail to understand why the infantry is to lose 900 TA personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/9">May I pose a few specific questions to the Minister? First, there is no mention in the statement of the civil contingency reserves. What has the Minister to say about the TA's role in countering terrorism at home and being available to deal with other civil emergencies?</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/10">Secondly, what significance should we attach to the mobilisation of a new combat legal force, something that sounds distinctly menacing, the form of a military provost staff company? Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether part of its role will be to root out the likes of Mr. Phil Shiner and others who seek to undermine the work that is carried out by armed forces. If so, we would welcome that new legal battalion to act in support of our regular and TA forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/11">Thirdly, what can the Minister tell us about the haemorrhaging of TA members that I describe and the need to recruit, particularly given the strain that that places on employers? He mentions the objective that TA personnel should not be called up for further duty within five years. Can he tell us whether he expects to able to live within that or whether he will rely on the three-year legal requirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/12">Fourthly, can he tell us what proposals he has to maintain a TA presence in the Orkney and Shetland islands? People there are keen for that presence to be maintained, so I hope that he can give us something positive on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.0/13">Although some welcome changes have been announced today, we should be under no illusion that the Government are relying too heavily on the TA as a substitute for an adequate standing army. Today's announcement illustrates that fundamental. Rather than a rebalancing, this looks like a further web of cuts.</p>

	<p pid="a.430.2/1">Given the end of the cold war, we considered what the post-cold war structure should be, as part of the strategic defence review. Of course, this further rebalancing will take account of the new Army structures and infantry structures. We are mirroring the restructuring, which involves recognising where the pinch points and the critical shortfalls occur. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, we are re-roling about 3,000 Regular Army posts to try to make good that problem, and the same applies across the TA. That is why the rebalancing is taking place. It will give those forces greater usability and greater impact, and therefore greater influence over what we seek to do in defence of the national interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.2/2">The civil contingency reaction force was not mentioned because it will remain unchanged. That role continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.2/3">The hon. Gentleman asked about harmony, and I said that it was an aim, but a legal requirement is involved. I do not know how that will play out, because it depends on tempo and usage. We will seek, as best we can, to achieve the higher harmony guidelines, because we value our people, but my experience of the TA is that a lot of them want to serve anyway, and they want to do so frequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.2/4">The hon. Gentleman asked about Orkney and Shetland. No change is planned on Orkney, but we are considering the possibility of closing the very small unit on Shetland. We are talking, from memory, about only 19 TA members, with three support staff. Although it does not quite fit the neat rebalancing, I decided that is appropriate to keep the Shetland unit. Over time, it will be re-roled to match the engineer unit on Orkney. We will deal sensitively with those who are currently in the TA. We have decided to retain the unit. I am conscious of the fact that we recently decided to close Saxa Vord on Shetland. If the unit had closed, it would have meant that there was a bit of the United Kingdom where the military was not flying the Union flag. I did not think that such a decision would be appropriate, given the remoteness of the island.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.2/5">The hon. Gentleman asked about retention and recruitment. Of course, retention is clearly an issue. Some of the figures could be occasioned by the fact that, once people have completed their deployments and had their moment of contribution and excitement, some of them will probably leave, perhaps because they are under employment pressure. We need to get a better handle on all that&mdash;a better understanding of it&mdash;but against a very significant decline in recruitment in the early post-SDR period, it is now increasing. That is encouraging, and we must seek to maintain all that.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.2/6">As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January 2006</phrase>, there were 297 more recruits than in January 2005&mdash;a 1 per cent. increase. As at <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>, there were 323 more recruits than at <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February 2005</phrase>&mdash;again, a 1 per cent. increase. That looks like an upward trend, but we must maintain that. Again, I make the point that we have consulted extensively on that among the TA, and the rebalancing will give greater focus and an even higher level of commitment, if that is possible, in the way in which the TA conducts itself, because it will have all the new arrangements, with a more coherent structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.2/7">On medical staff, there is no question that we have issues in relation to them. That is one of the critical points, and the NHS also suffers from it in trying to recruit. Our judgment is to get the numbers to a realistic size, but I mention history again: medical support to the Army was effectively undermined under the last Tory Administration.</p>

	<p pid="a.441.0/1">I do not expect that the hon. Gentleman would pay much attention to the facts of an election campaign, as opposed to the rhetoric of his own party. I understand that that is often difficult for people to do. Had he read the plans that we put forward before the last election, he would have discovered that our plans exactly matched those of the Chancellor for the national health service. There was not a jot of difference. There were the same numbers in the same years. The hon. Gentleman's proposition, therefore, is entirely false.</p>

	<p pid="a.443.1/1">No, I shall make further progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/2">The Secretary of State for Transport is probably also a temporary occupant of that office. I note that the Chancellor thinks highly of him, and no doubt he will in due course offer us his own Budget, but for the time being he is constrained to dealing with transport, an important role which he fulfils with distinction. He is aware that the Government promised to reduce road congestion below 2000 levels by 2010. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The Chancellor mutters. He is astonished that I should ever attribute to an opponent any nobility or propriety, but I do not believe that politics has to consist of being nasty about people. I tried to be nice about the Chancellor for some years, without the slightest effect on his consciousness. It works rather better with some of his colleagues, who are more inclined to an emollient view of life. The nation will see that in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/3">The Department for Transport made an admirable plan to reduce congestion below 2000 levels by 2010. It then concluded that that &quot;is not achievable&quot;. The CBI estimates that congestion costs are running at about &pound;20 billion a year for the British economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.1/4">I shall give just one further example, although I have more, if tempted. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister was right in 1999 when he said that everyone should have the chance to see an NHS dentist&mdash;another splendid aspiration that everybody on both sides of the House could share. It is unfortunate that six or more years later, 48 per cent. of the population are not registered with an NHS dentist. Every one of my hon. Friends and, if they are honest, Labour Members have had letters from constituents in the past few weeks to ask what will happen to dentistry on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March</phrase>. The fact is that there is a crisis in dentistry.</p>

	<p pid="a.443.5/1">Nothing that I have said relates in the remotest degree to Rothschild's, and this brief and pleasant foray into the questions of this nation's finances is perfectly compatible with my declaration in the register.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.5/2">We have come to an interesting question, which I imagine that Ministers must puzzle over in their quieter moments&mdash;even given their busy ministerial schedules, they must have quieter moments. They must ask themselves, &quot;What is going on? What is getting in the way?&quot; There is a vast wall of money and the cheques are being signed, but why is it not having the anticipated and genuinely desired effects? The nation and the House have not yet considered that question sufficiently. That process is beginning today, and I hope that we will have ample time over the next three or four years to examine that question in detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.5/3">Let me advance a proposition to explain that bizarre phenomenon. This Government genuinely desire good results, and they want them quickly, which is why they are inclined to do something to achieve them quickly. However, they do not have any deep understanding of the reaction that is likely to set in on the part of society from the action of government. Action meets reaction, and reaction causes the action to be invalid and useless. It is above all the Chancellor who is the architect of that view of life, and he has a basically static view of society. He desires a good result and thinks that society will more or less stay in the same position, except that anything that he does will bring about a determinate effect. Unfortunately, society does not work like that, and I shall give some examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.5/4">I have already referred to means-testing, and the fact is that the Chancellor is the architect of the vast increase in means-testing. He has increased means-testing because he genuinely wants to reduce poverty&mdash;he has a moral passion in that respect, and I pay tribute to it. On both sides of the House, there is a shared desire to see poverty reduced in this country, but the problem is that there has been a reaction. The extension of means-testing has resulted in a disincentive to save, which has been a principal cause, along with the Chancellor's raid on pension funds and many other things, of the destruction of savings in this country. The result of the lack of saving has, alas, been poverty beckoning for many people who should have been rescued from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.5/5">If that were one isolated example, it would be important and interesting, but it would not be a pattern, but it is not one example, and it is part of a pattern. Let us consider the Secretary of State who rejoices in the title, Deputy Prime Minister. He, too, has an admirable ambition, which is again due to the Chancellor and which is again right, that there should be more homes in this country. We all share the view that we should have more homes in this country, because we need more homes in this country&mdash;many of my constituents cannot afford to buy a home. Unfortunately, however, because the desired result had to be achieved immediately without careful thought about reactions, the contractors who built those houses did not use low-carbon building techniques, because there was no incentive to do so. The result is rising carbon emissions, which directly contradicts the efforts that the Chancellor mentioned in his Budget and that the Government say that they are making to reduce carbon emissions.</p>

	<p pid="a.444.0/1">Dorset PCTs are being made to hand back &pound;11.5 million to the central pot in the Department of Health. That is having an adverse effect on PCTs in Bournemouth and Dorset, which are some of the best run and some of the worst funded in the country, and it is simply because this Government want to address the bigger problem of the national deficit in the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.446.3/1">No. I said that hon. Members would welcome the fact that I was about to sum up, and so I shall do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.446.3/2">There is only one way out of this conundrum, and that is to have a Government who understand that one has to trust people more and share responsibility with them. We must have a Government who recognise that the people who are working their socks off in our health service, our schools and our police services will not be able to do their job properly if they are constantly controlled by an overwhelming state with its targets, agencies and bureaucracy. The Chancellor can throw money at them left right and centre, over and again, in Budgets where he does mention the NHS and Budgets where he does not. He can go on trying to pretend that he is going to solve the pensions crisis in Budgets where he mentions Lord Turner and Budgets where he avoids mentioning him&mdash;this Budget was one of those&mdash;but he will never succeed in achieving the admirable goals that we share across this House if he continues to try to run the country from a desk in Whitehall. It cannot be done and it will not be done. It will produce adverse reactions, as it is today, and the money will be wasted.</p>

	<p pid="a.447.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman's description of Conservative party policy is a total travesty. What we heard in the excellent exposition by my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset is that the Conservative party is now the party of our national health service. <i>[Laughter.]</i> Labour Members may laugh, but during the 1990s, under the Conservatives, productivity in the health service increased year after year. Since Labour came to power, where has the money gone? Where has it been wasted by this Chancellor? It has gone in falling productivity, as shown on page 22 of the booklet &quot;Productivity in the UK 6&quot;, which was produced yesterday.</p>

	<p pid="a.460.1/1">That is an interesting idea, and surely not beyond the wit of man. A pensioner is a pensioner, whether he is in Scotland, England, Wales or Northern Ireland. I hope that some of the disputes about crossing boundaries, which we have seen between different local authorities with the concessionary scheme being rolled out in England, will not appear at a macro-level. That would be a missed opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/2">While we will consider carefully the funding of the scheme to be rolled out by 2008, we must have more immediate regard to the situation facing local authorities that are trying to implement the scheme announced last year. That is forcing many local authorities into crisis as the <phrase class="date" code="">31 March</phrase> deadline approaches. In Watford, for example, the Government provided funding of &pound;300,000, but the eventual cost was no less than &pound;830,000. In Bath and north-east Somerset, the shortfall is in the region of &pound;200,000. Community transport schemes are suffering. Again, many people in remote and rural areas, where there is not an &quot;ordinary&quot; bus service, depend on such crucial schemes. They are not getting that sort of provision as part of the scheme, and I have heard of places where those schemes are being cut to allow councils to meet their commitments to the concessionary scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/3">York has struggled because it received some &pound;855,000 from the Government rather than the &pound;1,086,000 that the implementation of the scheme will cost. That pattern seems to be repeated throughout the country. In many local authority areas, councillors have taken the initiative and have been able to make significant progress in providing good, often multi-modal, schemes, which are popular and workable on a local basis. Surely it is not right that those schemes should be sacrificed on the altar of the one that they are being forced to introduce.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.1/4">An awful lot of opportunities have been missed. The Budget could have delivered a great deal more for transport. The bottom line is that as an instrument of economic generation, environmental change and social inclusion, transport could deliver an awful lot more for the Government, if only they would take it seriously.</p>

	<p pid="a.462.2/1">Merely saying persistently that the economy was inherited does not justify the hon. Gentleman's proposition. I know that I will be 50 this year, but my memory is not failing me. I know what a crisis is, and that is what we had. I also know what stability is: the lowest level of inflation, the lowest interest rates, the lowest unemployment and the longest sustained period of growth in our country. I think that that is a huge credit to the Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.2/2">Of course, Oppositions have a duty to oppose what Governments do; that is the nature of opposition. I was an Opposition Member, along with my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Transport and the Paymaster General, for 10 years before our party became the Government, and of course one of our duties was to scrutinise. However, when the economy is going well and sustaining and benefiting our constituents, political parties have a duty to say so and to congratulate those who have made it a success. Indeed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase>, who intervened just a moment ago, has benefited from the economy's strength. I am certain that if the economy were not a success, the Opposition would have offered today a much more severe critique of this Government's efforts, instead of the platitudes and nonsense that we heard from the right hon. Member for West Dorset. Therefore, I welcome this Budget and the success that we have enjoyed in the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.2/3">I come now to three developments that we heard about for the first time yesterday, the first of which is the additional resources that will be given to education. The overall education budget has increased in the past 10 years, which is only right. It is important that we have given so much money to education and that the economy is strong, so that we can generate the resources to enable our schools to provide our children with the best education that they have ever had. Of particular importance was the decision to give the extra &pound;440 million directly to head teachers. Members can doubtless cite past examples of secondary and primary heads raising with them their concerns about a particular expenditure item, or a staff issue that needed to be resolved. Under this Chancellor, instead of having to ask the local authority for money, heads have been able to use the special budget given to them to deal with urgent and emergency issues. The direct payment to secondary and primary heads gives them their own budget to spend on such matters, which is most welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.2/4">Like other Members, I write constantly to local education authorities asking for support for our schools. In the city of Leicester, we have a Liberal Democrat-Conservative coalition and, strangely, although they are unable to get along in Westminster, they get along extremely well in Leicester. Whenever I wanted to deal with a particular issue raised by a school in my constituency, I used to have to write directly to that coalition, and thus the paper chase began. Now, there is a budget that allows head teachers to interface directly with their stakeholders and to spend money on their schools. That is of enormous benefit to schools, head teachers and children.</p>

	<p pid="a.463.1/1">The hon. Gentleman tempts me to discuss a Bill that is not the subject of this debate&mdash;and I know, Madam Deputy Speaker, that you would admonish me if I went down that path. I voted for that Bill because it is in the best interests of our pupils and of education, but passing legislation is not enough; we must also give schools the money to implement these policies, which is exactly what the Chancellor has done.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/2">The second specific expenditure item in the Budget&mdash;which I fully support&mdash;on which I want to touch is the money being given to prepare our children and young people for the 2012 Olympics. If we are to host the Olympics, it is absolutely vital that we have world-class athletes and that our young people are able to win medals. We cannot start indulging in these activities one or two years before the event. I know that we had a Labour Government for only three years before the millennium; nevertheless, we started our preparations for it far too late. We have six years in which to prepare our young people for the Olympic games, and we should all welcome the &pound;600 million that has been allocated to allow us to train world-class athletes. There is a feeling in the east midlands, and Leicester in particular, that it is very much a London affair. By having the mini Olympics all over the country&mdash;we certainly wish to ensure that we have them in Leicester&mdash;we will be able to train our young people early to compete with the best in the world. Starting six years ahead of time is right, so I welcome what the Government propose for the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.1/3">I also welcome the small but significant amount of money that will be provided to enable a memorial to be set up to those who died in the London bombings on <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> last year. It is easy to forget and move on, but it is important that we understand the kind of society and country in which we live. Allocating funds for a memorial is not a mainstream issue for the Treasury&mdash;although of course money is&mdash;but it sends a powerful message that we stand united in the face of terrorism and that we will remember the innocent people who died, of all faiths and no faith, on that day. It is essential that we as a country recognise that and I hope that the money will be well spent. I hope that we will make a better job of it than we did the Diana memorial, which keeps flooding and which nobody can visit because people keep falling over. What a terrible memorial to a great public figure. I hope that the new memorial will be properly designed and executed so that we can remember those people properly.</p>

	<p pid="a.465.1/1">No, because my right hon. Friend has done a huge amount for our health service, which we welcome, so the issue that the hon. Gentleman raises is not for my right hon. Friend. The money has been allocated and it now has to be spent. I am happy about the amount we received in Leicester, but I want the three hospitals to be modernised. That is the promise that was made and we shall hold everyone to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/2">In his intervention from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" name="Simon Burns">the Back Benches, the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)</phrase>, who has now resumed his Front-Bench duties, said that I supported everything in the Budget. I do, but two important elements were missing and I hope that my right hon. Friend the Paymaster General will deal with them in her response.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/3">The first missing element was specific support for the textile industry. Thirty years ago, 140,000 people worked in the textile industry in Leicester; today, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the number is 28,000. The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase>, whose constituency is in the Northampton area, knows that textiles also affect his constituency. I am worried about the industry&mdash;about the high level of imports to the European Union and the EU's failure to act properly to stop the dumping of goods. I want specific measures and help for the textile and footwear industries in Leicester, which are important not just for Leicester but for the whole country. If we invest in them, it benefits our whole economy. Before the war, one in every five white shirts in Europe was manufactured in Leicester. We had a huge textile and footwear industry, but it is disappearing. I ask the Treasury to look at that industry before the next Budget, to make sure that specific help can be given.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/4">The second omission from the Budget speech would have taken up only an extra minute&mdash;unlike the health service. It is the Treasury's current assessment of our readiness to join the euro. In his Budget last year, the Chancellor said that he was not authorising a new assessment, but it is important that the Treasury keeps the five economic tests under review. I am fully signed up to the need for us to pass specific tests to join the euro. I understand why the Chancellor has said that it must be done, but I am concerned that we are not keeping the tests under review. In previous Budgets, my right hon. Friend has talked about the need for an assessment, so I hope that in the winding-up speech we will find out what has happened to the current assessment. We may not have met the five economic tests, but we need to be kept informed.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/5">My final point is about the Lisbon agenda, whose sixth anniversary we celebrate this year, and our role as a competitive economy in ensuring that the rest of Europe reacts to the Kok report, commissioned by the European Commission last year, and to the decisions being made this very day in the spring European Council. My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General is a frequent visitor to ECOFIN, so she knows what it is like to deal with our European colleagues and how difficult it is to move countries along. The Lisbon score card is extremely important, because Lisbon was the first European summit to benchmark European economic success. We asked why, over the past decade, America was able to create 10 million jobs, while in Europe we could create only 1 million. It was due to the nature of our economies.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/6">As my right hon. Friend knows, two reports have been issued this week. One was from the BRUEGEL group&mdash;the Brussels European and Global Economic Laboratory&mdash;and said that we were doing extremely badly and were way down the list in respect of the Lisbon score card. The second assessment, by the Centre for European Reform, was that we were at the top of the Lisbon score card, one of only three European Union countries to have met all three of Lisbon's employment targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/7">It is all very well having the best economy in Europe, but we also need&mdash;I say this in all friendliness to my right hon. Friends&mdash;to ensure that we export some of that economic success to the rest of the European Union. That needs leadership from the United Kingdom on such issues and an acceptance that we must strive to achieve the benchmarks. We are leaders in Europe in economic reform and in the competitiveness of our economy. All that I ask is that we give emphasis and focus to those successes in the year that comes.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.1/8">I have only praise for the Budget. I send a big &quot;thank you&quot; from my constituents to the Chancellor and his Treasury team for giving us the cultural stability that has been lacking in Britain for so many years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-23a.466.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" speakername="Nicholas Soames" colnum="466"  time="014:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/debtext/60323-23.htm#60323-23_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.466.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> is a fluent and capable speaker, but the collective memory of the House knows that that there is something wrong with his memory. To describe the period that Nigel Lawson was Chancellor as being a background of solid crisis is to show that the hon. Gentleman wasted the first few years that he was a Member. I remember very well the time that he was talking about. Indeed, the time of the Lawson reforms was the beginning of the settling of the economy's strength, which has given the extraordinary inheritance that the Chancellor benefited from when the Labour Government came to power. I imagine that, otherwise, his constituents will be much gratified by his speech and look forward to him exerting his authority to bring the mini-Olympics to Leicester, in which we look forward to seeing him perform in white shorts.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/2">Hearing the Secretary of State for Transport speak is, on many occasions, like a near-death experience, and today was no exception. Even by his undemanding standards, it was an absolute corker of a speech. Given the huge transport issues that effect this country&mdash;many hon. Members face serious infrastructure problems in our constituencies&mdash;it was a very mere and disappointing speech indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/3">I congratulate the Chancellor on his 10th Budget&mdash;a record achieved only by one other Chancellor, Sir Nicholas Vansittart. I do not know what the Chancellor has got to swank about&mdash;this is the 21st Budget that I have sat through in the House&mdash;but achieving his 10th Budget is a notable milestone. I am prepared to congratulate him, as long as he is prepared to remember that in his time&mdash;it has not been a wholly unsuccessful time&mdash;he has been able to build on the golden inheritance that he in<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1794" name="Kenneth Clarke">herited from my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/4">I congratulate the Chancellor, as I have done every year since he has been Chancellor, on his decision to grant independence to the Bank of England. This time, I applaud very much the steps that the Government have taken, although belatedly, to assign more independence to the Office for National Statistics. I hope that that will enable us to bring greater integrity and accuracy to our statistics, which are so important for the assessment and forming of Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/5">The Budget settles for the record the fact that the Chancellor is indeed a leading exponent of the old-fashioned tax-and-spend school. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, in his admirable and energetic response yesterday, was certainly right: the Chancellor has indeed raised billions, he has spent billions and he has very little idea of where the money has gone or how effectively hard-working people's tax funds have been spent and to what ends.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/6">Listening to the Chancellor, he rather reminded me of Christopher Columbus in that when he set off he did not know where he was going, when he got there he did not know where he was, when he came back he did not know where he had been, and he did it all on borrowed money. Listening to his rather manic presentation, one was very conscious of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the fact that, as my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase> pointed out, it is not necessarily how much money is spent, but the way in which it is spent that counts. Any number of taskforces and goodness knows what else will not be able to close that gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/7">Whether it can be considered a triumph to achieve what the Chancellor calls sound public finances when taxation is nearing 39 per cent. of gross domestic product is in itself a question. What we do know is that his key policy mistake has been a massive transfer of resources into a largely unreformed public sector. His announcement of even larger spending increases on education and child care will, in my view, only make the situation worse. The long-term effect of the Budget will be a significantly higher tax burden, lower productivity and thus depressed growth, living standards and competitiveness, to our domestic and our international disadvantage. It is a huge disappointment that the Chancellor simply does not understand that while, of course, increased resources matter, so does a disciplined programme of expenditure matched with real reform and thus with better results. All the lessons of the past show that to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/8">Let us take education. The decision to increase spending by &pound;19 billion a year in real terms from taxpayer funds is extraordinary, given the record of recent years. The Government have already increased schools spending by 66 per cent. in real terms since 1999 with no discernable change whatever in the trend in examination results and the quality of the finished article leaving schools. Extra spending might be justifiable if it were preceded by a major programme of reform, but reform&mdash;that is to say, management autonomy and parental choice&mdash;has proceeded most slowly in education out of all the public services. The truth is that the source of the problem is the failure to deliver, even now, with all this money, a good education. That is what parents want to see and it is what the country wants to see. That needs to be tackled with real and energetic reform and not just large amounts of low-flying cash.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/9">I was truly shocked that, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" name="Simon Burns">my hon. Friend the Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)</phrase> pointed out, in the whole of the Chancellor's one hour and one minute speech, conducted at a decent gallop, he never even mentioned the national health service&mdash;almost the most important of all the Government programmes in terms of expenditure. I suppose that that is not really surprising given that he knows what he spends, but because the Government have totally failed to grip reform in the national health service, they have no idea what it really costs. The health service in my constituency and all over Sussex and elsewhere is struggling to cope with unfunded cost pressures, inherited debts and not enough time or support to help it through. With the greatest anxiety, I await the inevitable outcome of the cuts in services that must follow on from the situation of those health authorities. The excellent think-tank Reform estimates that, at the present rate of growth in the NHS, there will be a resource gap of &pound;7 billion in 2010. That is an enormous sum of money and I would be grateful if the Paymaster General would tell me how she thinks that the Government intend to deal with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/10">After the expenditure of all this money, hard-pressed taxpayers are entitled to ask, &quot;Where are these world-beating public services?&quot; The Chancellor has indeed taxed too much and borrowed too much. Old Labour has got its way under this Chancellor, which is, of course, why the Labour party cannot wait, by and large, to get rid of the Prime Minister and to put in his place a more user-friendly animal. Let us face it: under the Chancellor, the pips really are squeaking. He has saddled the taxpayer with the highest tax burden in history. Families are literally groaning under the impact of the amount of money that the state takes from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/11">The Chancellor has imposed on commerce records levels of bureaucracy and red tape and he has blocked vital reforms in the public service. Even with some of the reforms that he has brought in, the valuable concept of a low-regulation, low-tax and competitive economy, which came to fruition in the later years of Baroness Thatcher and under John Major, is being rapidly eroded as business men and women sink every day into a bog of regulation and higher taxes. Had the Chancellor himself had the guts, will and determination truly to set about reforming the public sector by dealing with the vast array of old Spanish practices and the like that still remain, by increasing investment and by substantially extending choice in real terms, high-quality public services would today be available to everyone.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/12">Where exactly is this modern and efficient transport system or even its beginnings? Where is the infrastructure expenditure that is glibly promised every year? I urge the Chancellor to consider carefully a message that came from a seminar that I held in my constituency last weekend ahead of the wholly unsustainable programme of house building that is wished on Mid-Sussex and the surrounding area by the Deputy Prime Minister: there should be a far more even distribution of infrastructure expenditure across the growth areas. Let me give the Paymaster General an example. The Government are spending enormous sums of infrastructure money around Ashford and in Milton Keynes. Mid-Sussex, and north-west Sussex generally, are going to have willed on them by the Deputy Prime Minister an enormous number of houses&mdash;not significantly fewer than Ashford&mdash;yet there is no commensurate Government spending on public infrastructure. The Government need to acknowledge the firm feeling that they should honour their obligations for infrastructure expenditure, rather than simply passing them incontinently across to the developers who rightly already make a major contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/13">I want to consider three areas on which the Chancellor and his people have done badly. I preface that by saying that I do not pretend that everything is bad. Many of the things that have been done are good. There are bits of our economy that are doing well, although, as I said, they should be doing well because of the Chancellor's remarkable inheritance.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/14">I will quote from a speech made in the House by the Chancellor in 1989, when he was shadow Trade and Industry Secretary, on a pensions scandal when, again, the ombudsman blamed the Government of the day for bust pension schemes. The then shadow Trade and Industry Secretary railed against the</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/15" class="indent">&quot;fecklessness, gullibility and incompetence of the Government who, for months and years, ignored all the warnings&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="1989-12-19">19 December 1989</phrase>; Vol. 164, c. 204&ndash;05.]</p>
	<p pid="a.466.0/16">Today, the Chancellor who said that presents himself as the future leader of our country, but, frankly, he and the then Work and Pensions Secretary, who is now the Transport Secretary&mdash;I am sorry that he is not in the Chamber&mdash;debauched the public pensions system in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.471.0/1">Tackling climate change and protecting the environment was one of the central themes of yesterday's Budget. When I saw that the Conservatives had put up <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase> to open the debate, I thought that that would be a major theme of the Conservative contribution today. The right hon. Gentleman was evidently allocated to perform another role in the debate, but at least he did not perform it in the same foaming-at-the-mouth, carpet-chewing style of his leader yesterday, for which we must be grateful.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.0/2">Although the right hon. Member for West Dorset did not take up the issue of climate change and the environment, I should like to record my welcome for the fact that the Chancellor chose to put it at the heart of the Budget, thereby reflecting the increasing concerns of our constituents. Some environmental organisation have, naturally, criticised the Budget for not delivering all that they would want, but that is in the nature of campaigning organisations. That said, some elements of the Budget have received a positive response from those organisations.</p>

	<p pid="a.473.1/1">The two elements go together. On their present trends, the climate change levy and the climate change agreements will have a roughly similar effect in terms of a reduction of carbon emissions. They both have their role to play. Clearly, any tax can be refined and improved, but the key point is that the levy has had a significant impact on reducing emissions in the UK. Independent&mdash;not Government&mdash;research has shown that it has had a significant impact on the behaviour of businesses. Adding that fairly small, but visible, element to their costs encourages them not only to reduce their energy costs but to look at other ways of operating and improving energy overall, which has a positive effect on our carbon emission reduction targets. We must also bear in mind that taken together, the overall effect of the reductions in energy demand and in national insurance contributions has been a reduction in costs for business as a whole. That has to be seen in the round. Elements can always be adjusted and improved, but the general direction is one that we should support.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/2">I am genuinely puzzled by the Conservatives' refusal at least to give some qualified backing to the climate change levy. They are entitled to say that they want to see change but this is not the right one and they would do something else in future. We get one or two hints of what that might be from vague references to a carbon tax, but merely saying that that might be the answer does not take us much further, because it could be applied in many ways. We have not seen anything representing a worked-out proposal from the Conservatives&mdash;perhaps we will hear about it later in the debate&mdash;so we have no idea of what alternative they would put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/3">No doubt their conversion to the green agenda is genuine, although there may be some exceptions. However, they cannot tell us time and again that we will have to wait until the machinery&mdash;no doubt wind-powered&mdash;of Conservative think-tanks grinds out some kind of policy recommendation before they come off the fence on the climate change levy. Surely the right position, if they were really concerned about the issue, would be for them to say, &quot;We don't think it's the best policy and it's not our preferred policy, but it's making a difference and having an impact. We will support it now and in the Lobby at the end of these debates on Tuesday, and in due course we will come forward with an alternative.&quot; Surely the Conservative party should not undermine a policy that has had a significant effect on reducing carbon emissions. Everyone who has an interest in the subject and knows about it realises that.</p>

Gentleman should accept that, if we are to hit our targets&mdash;we have all said that we will do that&mdash;the climate change levy has an important role to play. I am therefore disappointed and genuinely puzzled by the way in which the Conservative party will not move on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.5/2">The Opposition's approach is unfortunate if we are trying to hold a serious debate on how to make progress on policy. I do not want to spend all my time on the climate change levy, but its beneficial impact on carbon emissions is acknowledged. If we cannot get even qualified Conservative support for it, we encourage disillusionment and cynicism outside the House, and the idea that all we do in here is talk about tackling climate change without effecting specific policies. I therefore hope that the Conservative party may yet reconsider its position.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-23a.476.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="476"  time="015:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/debtext/60323-26.htm#60323-26_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.476.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a reasonable point.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/2">We will have to revisit the level of tax on fuel for motor vehicles. However, the Chancellor said yesterday that he would delay the decision on an increase in fuel duty until later this year, by continuing the freeze until <phrase class="date" code="">1 September</phrase>, and there are good reasons for doing so. The present high level of world oil prices will clearly have had a bearing on that decision, which is understandable. However, I would not be surprised if there was a concern somewhere in the Chancellor's mind about the possible political consequences were we to return to a regular uprating of vehicle fuel duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/3">If we seriously look at the issue, we will all know that, in spite of recent increases, the cost of motoring in real terms has gone down over the longer term and that the increase in greenhouse gas emissions as a result of increases in road traffic has been an important contributor to the UK's overall greenhouse gas position. One of the most powerful factors influencing the extent of use of motor vehicles is the cost of motoring. We cannot get away from that. We all know that it is true.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/4">If we are really serious, we have to do something about the problem. Yet again, we have not heard any serious suggestions from those on the Opposition Front Benches about what we might do to recognise that reality. We certainly did not get them from those on the Conservative Front Bench. When <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> was not in the Chamber, I quoted from the comments made by the Liberal Democrat leader in the Budget debate yesterday. He criticised the new vehicle excise duty on 4x4s as being a very limited measure. I made the point that the impression that we gained from the comment made by the leader of the Liberal Democrats and repeated elsewhere during the day was that he was against the measure because it did not go far enough. He was in favour&mdash;so it would appear&mdash;of a higher increase in vehicle excise duty. That is certainly in line with what the hon. Member for Rochdale has just said. He nods so he seems to agree that he would like to see higher vehicle excise duty on the top-range vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.1/5">When I pressed this point with the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland earlier in the debate, he seemed to say that he was not in favour of an increase in tax on the high fuel-consuming vehicles in certain circumstances. He seemed to say that he would be against such a measure in remote and rural areas. One suspects that there is a close correlation between remote and rural areas and Liberal Democrat constituencies. Once again, we see the Liberal Democrat tendency to talk green at one level, but to explain to their constituents that it will not really affect them. Someone else will be green, but not them.</p>

	<p pid="a.482.4/1">I entirely and happily agree that the independence of the Bank of England was a good thing. However, the hon. Gentleman has failed to recognise the transformation that I have described. He is more knowledgeable on matters economic than most of us, but he is still too grudging to acknowledge that. I have noticed that almost every one of his contributions in the House seems to be a partisan attack on an Opposition party.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.4/2">The House would benefit from the hon. Gentleman's intellect and&mdash;as I know privately&mdash;charm, if he used them constructively to deal with the world as it is and not as a partisan punch ball. Any fair-minded or neutral person would recognise my description of the background when the Government came to power.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.4/3">In my constituency, the number of people employed in manufacturing in the last three years of the last Conservative Government increased by 3,000; since the Labour Government came to power, those jobs have reduced by 1,600. That is a lot of families whose jobs have been destroyed. By undermining manufacturing, the Government have helped to undermine the future prosperity of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.4/4">Earlier I mentioned some figures that showed the contrast between 1997 and the present, but they are worth repeating. In 1997, when the Chancellor came to power, inflation was lower than it is at present&mdash;contrary to the impression one might receive when listening to Labour Members. The rate of inflation in 1997 was 1.8 per cent., compared to 2.1 per cent. in 2005. Real GDP growth in 1997 was 3.2 per cent., compared to 1.8 per cent. at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.484.2/1">I am afraid that no light was thrown by that intervention on the fact that productivity has not been growing under this Government. Interestingly, that brings me to my next point, which relates to the figures produced by the Chancellor. I welcome something else in yesterday's Budget: the fact that the gathering of national statistics will be put on a truly independent basis. Opposition Members have been saying for many years since the Chancellor came to power that, unfortunately, the public no longer trusted the figures that he provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/2">Yesterday's debate on the Budget threw up, in a powerful speech by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1884" name="Greg Clark">my hon. Friend the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase>&mdash;the main points of which are well worth repeating, given that the Chancellor's key aide is here&mdash;the fact that John Oughton, the head of the Office of Government Commerce, which is the main watchdog to ensure that procurement is carried out properly in government, was asked at a sitting of the Public Accounts Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/3" class="indent">&quot;As I understand it, the process of collating this information involved the Treasury ringing round departments asking what savings they could offer up in time to be mentioned in the Budget with no checks at all.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/4">That was in the context of coming up with the &pound;2 billion in Gershon savings that the Chancellor mentioned last year. When that question was put to the head of the OGC, he replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/5" class="indent">&quot;That is an accurate statement of the gains as they were reported in the spring of 2005.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/6">That is a damning condemnation of the way that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is prepared to manipulate figures to come up with whatever is required to provide him with a political platform. This year Sir John Bourn, the Comptroller and Auditor General and head of the National Audit Office, offered to check the figures, and my hon. Friend told us yesterday:</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/7" class="indent">&quot;Once again, the numbers that the Chancellor presented as definitive Gershon savings have not been signed off by the National Audit Office.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-22">22 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 444, c. 371.]</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/8">In that context I, along with other Opposition Members, welcome the prospect of a proper, independent national statistics service in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/9">Yesterday's Budget speech was over an hour long, but the Chancellor did not mention the NHS even once. Could that be because when there is a problem the Chancellor distances himself as fast as he can? Is there is problem in the NHS today? Absolutely. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has been the road block to reform&mdash;the man who said before they came to power that a Labour Government would be wise spenders, not big spenders&mdash;has splurged spending on the NHS without proper reform. That is why people ask, &quot;How has all this money been spent with so little to show for it?&quot; The number of NHS administrators has increased by 66 per cent., whereas the number of doctors and nurses has increased at a fraction of that percentage. The Prime Minister's own policy unit said in 2004 that health service productivity had fallen by 20 per cent. since the Labour Government came to power.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/10">At the heart of what is wrong with the Government is the fact that all we ever hear from them, in the context of the Budget or anything else, is a reiteration of their spending levels. No one is in doubt about the level of spending; what is in doubt is whether that spending has been wise. It has been big, but it has not been wise.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/11">I looked at the chapter on improving productivity in the Red Book. One acronym did not appear at all in that chapter, or in the Chancellor's speech: NHS. The Red Book had nothing to say about improving productivity in the NHS. However, there is a chapter called &quot;Understanding Productivity&quot;&mdash;a useful section for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after so many years of failing to promote it in the private or the public sector&mdash;in &quot;Productivity in the UK 6&quot;. We find that, despite its being said that productivity is the main determinate, the truth is that while spending has doubled, productivity on the standard measures in the NHS has fallen. Page 22 of &quot;Productivity in the UK 6&quot;&mdash;this is where we have to look to find the truth of what has gone on in our NHS&mdash;states:</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/12" class="indent">&quot;Estimates using National Accounts measures showed an average fall of between 0.6 per cent. and 1.3 per cent. a year over the period 1995&ndash;2004.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/13">Spending on the NHS has doubled. The number of bureaucrats and administrators has been increased by 66 per cent., yet productivity in the NHS&mdash;the supposed show piece of this Labour Government&mdash;has fallen. That is why, across the country, thousands of health workers have already received notice that they will lose their jobs and thousands more are waiting to be told that. A financial deficit afflicts the national health service because of Labour's mismanagement and failure of understanding. I hope that the Minister who responds later will deal head on with the issue of productivity in the NHS and what can be done to turn round the lamentable record so far, so that the record sums that have gone into the NHS can show through in an improvement in treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/14">I already feel as though I have tried your patience, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but I would like to finish on the subject of the environment. The Chancellor's raids on pensions and the undermining of the security of hard-working people in old age has been disgraceful, and the failure to produce honest statistics has been equally shabby, but the Chancellor has been a complete and utter disgrace on the environment. There has been a failure to deliver on the promises that were made before the Government came to power and, at every step&mdash;every Budget&mdash;it has been the Chancellor who has failed to deliver the mechanisms by which the country could change from a policy of growing emissions to one of cutting them.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/15">The global leadership that the leader of the Labour party is so keen to spout worldwide is not matched by any kind of improvement at home. The masking effort carried out by Labour Members in using the climate change levy as the sole test of any politician's environmental credentials is false. We have the climate change levy and we have a Labour Government&mdash;and under that Government emissions have risen. To be posing as in any way environmentally friendly while emissions have risen is nothing short of disgraceful.</p>
	<p pid="a.484.2/16">Be it on pensions, productivity, or honesty and statistics, the Government have failed. On the environment, and on the long-term future of the country and of the world, perhaps they will be seen by many to have failed most of all.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-23a.493.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1931" speakername="Stephen Hesford" colnum="493"  time="016:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/debtext/60323-31.htm#60323-31_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.493.1/1">When the Liberal Democrats come to wind up, I would certainly welcome an assurance that they would not abolish the child trust fund, although I suspect that I would be disappointed in that hope.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.1/2">I have already mentioned the sporting successes in my constituency, in regard to the open golf championship. I have looked fondly at our success at the winter Olympic games and, in particular, at the Commonwealth games, on the back of the investment from UK Sport and the Government. I therefore welcome the &pound;600 million for world-class British athletes that, I hope, will build on that success in the years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.1/3">I wait with interest to see whether the decision to increase investment in education that my right hon. Friend announced yesterday will be supported by the Opposition. That was a key political statement. Such decisions are not taken easily, but they are taken for the principled reason that we should invest in the future of ordinary, hard-working families and their children so that they can make the best of their natural abilities and compete on a level playing field in the best possible circumstances with the 6 to 7 per cent. who benefit from private education. Although I do not begrudge people their private education, I want the vast majority of children to have access to the best. My right hon. Friend was brave and correct to come to such a decision and that will not be lost on the mums, dads and grandparents in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.1/4">One might say that making such decisions is what a Labour Government should be doing, and it the sort of the thing that this Government are doing. I ask all parties in the House to support this decision and to do so not just in principle by saying that they think it is a nice idea, but to do so by agreeing to guarantee the money not just for one year but for each and every year until 2011 when the rise in spending will take effect. I also welcome the additional &pound;585 million that will be distributed directly to schools throughout the financial year 2006&ndash;07.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.1/5">Community support officers are making such a difference in my constituency. Their introduction was opposed by Conservative Members even though I believe that Members on both sides now support the work that those officers do. I am therefore delighted that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor is building on their success by doubling their number to 16,000 at a cost of another &pound;100 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.1/6">I am also delighted that my right hon. Friend has seen fit to copy the very good free transport system that we have had for a long time in Merseyside and extend free pensioner travel across the country. That will be very much welcomed on both sides of the House. It will certainly be welcomed by pensioners in my constituency who were able to travel throughout Merseyside for free, but became frustrated when they reached the border and had to start to pay for their travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.1/7">It has been argued that the NHS was not mentioned in the Budget speech. Since I first spoke in the House in 1997, I have watched the economy and my local health service. I have regularly visited my local NHS trust and all the other health services in my area in my nearly nine years in Parliament. I do not deny that there are difficulties in certain trusts&mdash;others can address that issue&mdash;but the NHS in my area certainly speaks for itself. I am very pleased that it does.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.1/8">I welcome the Budget and I am delighted to have been able to take part in the debate. Perhaps I should have started with this, but I apologise to the House for not being present for the beginning of the debate. However, I am grateful to have had the chance to speak.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-23a.496.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="496"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/debtext/60323-32.htm#60323-32_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.496.3/1">Yes, there is a &quot;but&quot;. When labour is hoarded&mdash;if that is the correct phrase&mdash;and growth does not follow, there is more vulnerability to an increase in unemployment. If the downturn lasts longer than expected, there will be higher unemployment. That is a potential difficulty. In 2006 we are witnessing some increase in unemployment, perhaps suggesting that the labour-hoarding is unwinding to some extent. We shall see.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/2">There are, however, more substantial reasons why productivity has been so poor. One is the increase in regulation. According to the &quot;Burdens Barometer&quot; published by the British Chambers of Commerce, the cost of regulation has risen by &pound;14 billion since 1998. The World Economic Forum says that since 1997 the United Kingdom has fallen from 13th in its league table to 30th in terms of Government regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/3">The Chancellor focused a great deal on the City of London in his Budget and the papers that have been produced. The City faces great challenges and regulation, which in general are not domestically driven. They come not from the United Kingdom but from the European Union: the Markets in Financial Instruments directive, for instance, is causing concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/4">Taxation is another problem. Business taxes have risen substantially. The Ernst and Young analysis shows that if North sea oil revenue is excluded, taxes are the highest that they have ever been. The level of taxation is not the only difficulty, however. We should observe what is being done by our competitors. We are to be taxed more heavily than Germany, and it is no surprise that Germany's growth is likely to exceed ours in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/5">We should consider not just our own taxation level, in absolute terms and relative to those of our competitors, but the complexity of taxation. Let me give an example. I know that vehicle excise duty is not a business tax, and I am not particularly critical of the policy per se, but it is rather characteristic of this Chancellor that we are to have seven different rates whereas once we had only one. That illustrates this Government's tendency to complicate matters. According to a World Economic Forum assessment, in terms of tax simplicity the UK is ranked 67th in the world, tied with Benin.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/6">A further element threatening productivity is the decline in business investment. The Chancellor said in his 2001 Budget that</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/7" class="indent">&quot;To achieve our first ambition&mdash;to secure the fastest productivity growth of our competitors over the next decade&mdash;business investment must rise&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2001-03-07">7 March 2001</phrase>; Vol. 364, c. 298.]</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/8">That is not happening. Business investment is falling, in part because of the taxation and regulation that I mentioned earlier. It is now at a record low: about 9 per cent. of gross domestic product, which is the lowest level since records began in 1965.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/9">The British Chambers of Commerce and the CBI have offered substantial criticism of our skills levels. I know that more is being spent on education and I am not critical of that, but we must get the value for money that the Government have not achieved in the past. Until we get the full reforms that we need, I will not be all that optimistic. To be fair, the Government are moving in the right direction through their Education and Inspections Bill, but there is still a long way to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.3/10">This country has enormous advantages, such as the English language and strong cultural links with many other parts of the world. In an increasingly globalised world, we should be able to succeed, grow and prosper. There is cross-party consensus on the need to embrace globalisation, and we at least all talk about a belief in and desire for free trade, even if we do not always implement it. But our economy is becoming increasingly clogged up and it is less competitive and productive than it was. There are some fundamental economic issues that we need to face, and I fear that this Budget has completely failed to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.500.3/1">Perhaps I should move away from education, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as it was causing a bit of concern, but I shall finish the point I was making, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" name="Edward Balls">the hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)</phrase> wanted a reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.3/2">I do not believe a word that the Government say about education. I do not believe that any extra money will go into education in Wellingborough. The Government's history over the past nine years is that in Wellingborough educational provision has gone down. It may be great in the hon. Gentleman's constituency but it is not in mine, and the Government should take that into account. Wellingborough should receive its fair share of education spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.3/3">The most important issue in Wellingborough is the health service. As many Members have said, the Chancellor did not mention the health service at all. I am not really surprised. Dentistry in Wellingborough has been privatised, and I saw no commitment in the Labour party manifesto to do that. There were far more NHS dentists in Wellingborough in 1997 than there are today. If people can find an NHS dentist who will take them on, it is almost a miracle. On GP appointments, we have one of the lowest ratios of doctors to patients in the United Kingdom, and it was much better in 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.3/4">The most important problem in the area relates to Kettering general hospital. There is no hospital in Wellingborough, and we should have a community hospital there. We hear that the Government are in favour of community hospitals, but there is no money for one in Wellingborough. However, the Government have a very useful formula for funding the NHS to make it fair across the country. That is a very good idea. The only problem is that when they announced that funding, they provided my area with only 85 per cent. of what the funding formula says the sum should be. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Labour Members may argue about that, but I am told that the reason why that happens is that other areas get more money.</p>
	<p pid="a.500.3/5">I am pleased that other areas get more than their formula share, but that is not good enough for the people of Wellingborough. All the talk of the formula and funding may not really mean anything to the people of Wellingborough, but when the local hospital must cancel 3,000 out-patients appointments and 600 operations, close a ward and an operating theatre, and transfer nurses from one area to another, that is when it comes home to roost.</p>

	<p pid="a.501.0/1">May I gently suggest to the hon. Gentleman that he check his figures on the formula funding in Wellingborough? I think that he will find that from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>, no primary care trust in England will be below 95 per cent. of formula. I very much doubt whether his PCT is currently 15 per cent. off formula, because I think that I am right in saying that no PCT in England is anywhere near 10 per cent. off formula. So I urge him in his litany of doom and gloom for Wellingborough&mdash;it does sound dismal&mdash;to check his figures on the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.502.0/1">I am pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">my hon. Friend the Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase>, who spoke with such passion about how the Budget will affect his constituency. He started by talking about the hype that surrounded the Budget. I agree with him&mdash;for many of us who, for the first time, were able to sit in the Chamber and listen to the Budget, there was an awful lot of hype surrounding the event. In fact, one could describe it as a non-event. We had a 61 minute speech and lots of documents&mdash;1,000 pages in all, I think&mdash;but there was very little to tackle some of the challenges that we face today. There was nothing to assist productivity growth, pensioners or the NHS. When we remove the North sea oil revenues, we find that we are being taxed more now than ever before.</p>

	<p pid="a.503.1/1">The hon. Gentleman falls foul of exactly the same thing that I accused him of earlier. He is trying to talk about Tory policy when we should be debating the Government's policy. There will be ample opportunity to discuss Conservative policy in due course, but today's debate is about the Government, not the Conservative party. Yes, we heard a 61 minute speech from the Chancellor, but there was not one mention of any of the initiatives that I have cited in the statement or in the 1,000 pages that were produced. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I will make some progress because I appreciate that we want to hear from the Front-Bench spokesmen.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/2">At the start of the debate, we digressed by talking about the NHS. The NHS is in crisis, but there was nothing in the Budget to alleviate it. We acknowledge that an extra &pound;1 billion has been put into the NHS, but today we became diverted on to a debate about whether simply to throw money at something. That debate was entirely misleading. Conservative Members do not question the fact that extra spending must be put in, but it is the way in which the money is spent that is important. Reform must accompany spending, which shows the whole point of us scrutinising the money that is spent.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/3">Although Dorset has one of the worst-funded health authorities in the country, we are just able to make ends meet. However, as authorities in other parts of the country cannot do their sums and run their services correctly, &pound;11 million is being removed from our health authority so that it can be given to other authorities. Dorset, which is doing well, is being made to suffer and yet another health authority will go into the red. That cannot be sensible, and it shows exactly why we need the reform about which I spoke earlier&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I get the message and will draw my remarks to a conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/4">I was pleased, on a personal level, by the announcement of the introduction of a charitable fund to help British victims of terrorist attacks abroad. Such a fund was absent until now, although Spain, France, the United States and other countries had introduced one. Adequate compensation was provided after people were sadly killed or affected by the <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> bombings because of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. However, those affected by an attack on Britons abroad did not get a penny because the compensation scheme is limited to British shores and travel insurance does not cover terrorism. I am pleased that the fund has been introduced and I ask the Paymaster General to give us details on when we will have a full announcement on how the process will work.</p>
	<p pid="a.503.1/5">The Budget was left wanting. An awful lot could be done and we need answers soon. We cannot wait until the comprehensive spending review to tackle problems with the NHS, the climate, the economy and, certainly, our support for pensioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.506.2/1">No, I must make progress and let the Paymaster General in.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.2/2">In 2050, China's share of world trade is estimated to rise to 24 per cent. North America's is estimated to fall by 2 per cent. to 23 per cent. The EU's share is set to fall by almost half to a mere 12 per cent., so the choice is clear. Even to maintain our position&mdash;to keep up with North American rather than European Union growth rates&mdash;we must compete to prosper. If we are to meet the challenge of the 21st century, the economy must travel in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.2/3">We all know, or should know, what that means&mdash;high growth rates, improved competitiveness, better productivity, internationally competitive tax rates, light touch regulation, strong savings and investment with reform. Last year our growth was 1.8 per cent. It was not growth at North American levels. It was not even growth at EU levels. A 1.8 per cent. growth rate was below the EU average&mdash;indeed, I can tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" name="Edward Balls">the hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)</phrase> that we were 19th out of 25&mdash;below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average and below the world average, but the Budget will do little to take our growth, compared with that of our competitors, in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.2/4">We need improved competitiveness. According to the World Economic Forum, as we heard, since 1997 we have dropped from fourth place in the competitiveness league table to 13th. In 1997 our share of world trade was 5.7 per cent.; last year it had fallen to 3.8 per cent. The Budget will do little to take our competitiveness in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.2/5">We need improved productivity, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness said. He pointed out that year on year growth in productivity is at its lowest since 1990, at 0.4 per cent. From 1992 to 1997, as he said, the improvement was 2.6 per cent. Under the Labour Government it fell to 1.3 per cent. The Budget contains little to take our productivity in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.2/6">We need tax rates that are internationally competitive, but far from going in the right direction, our tax burden is going in the wrong direction. In 1997, our tax as a share of gross domestic product was just under 35 per cent. The falling line of tax as a percentage of GDP in Germany is about to cross the rising line of tax as a percentage of GDP in the UK. Page 266 of the Red Book confirms that tax as a percentage of GDP next year is expected to rise to 38 per cent., the highest rate for about 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.2/7">The USA, Canada, Australia and Ireland, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1401" name="Nigel Dodds">the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds)</phrase> pointed out, are following the same competitive path. In 2000 our business taxes were 10th from the OECD lowest; now, they are 10th from the OECD highest. The Budget will do nothing to make our tax rates more competitive or to make our tax burden go down rather than up. The Chancellor could not bring himself to admit yesterday that the Budget adds another &pound;5.5 billion over three years to the nation's tax bill, already the highest since records began.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.2/8">We need strong savings, and it is here that the Chancellor is perhaps most culpable. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">My right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase> earlier quoted the Prime Minister in opposition. The Chancellor said in opposition:</p>
	<p pid="a.506.2/9" class="indent">&quot;I want the next Labour Government to achieve what in 50 years of the welfare state has never been achieved: the end of the means-test for our elderly people&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.2/10">What has happened to means-testing under the Government? When we left office, the percentage of pensioners who were means-tested was 37 per cent., whereas now it is 46 per cent. and climbing.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.2/11">What has happened to saving? Since 1997, the personal savings ratio has fallen by half. This Budget will do nothing to take savings in the right direction, any more than it will restore the &pound;45 billion that the Chancellor has plundered from pension funds since 1997. Yesterday, the Chancellor could not even bring himself to admit that he expects the savings ratio to fall yet again next year, any more than he could bring himself to mention&mdash;I will be interested to see whether the Paymaster General can manage this&mdash;the words &quot;Lord&quot; and &quot;Turner&quot; in the same sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.506.2/12">Above all, we need investment with reform. We have had the spending&mdash;money has been poured into hospitals, schools and child care&mdash;but we have not had the reform. Yesterday, the Chancellor had scarcely a word to say about, and no action to take, on the NHS. I concede that the Chancellor had plenty of words and an action plan for education, but it was an action plan with no timetable.</p>

	<p pid="a.511.3/1">No, I shall answer the questions that hon. Members have asked and, if I have time, give way to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.3/2">The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex made many points about pensioners. I agree that every hon. Member should be concerned about that, but I want to remind him of a few factors. Reforms to pensioners' tax and benefits since 1997 have meant that pensioners are, on average, &pound;27 a week better off and the poorest third of pensioners are &pound;39 a week better off. Let me put it another way: 2.1 million pensioners have been lifted out of absolute low income between 1996&ndash;97 and 2004&ndash;05, and more than 1 million have been lifted out of relative low income in the same period. They became the victims of low income and poverty under the previous Government's policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.3/3">I stress to the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex that, of course, it is important to have an effective pensions system in future. Lord Turner's contribution to the debate and the Government's response will ensure that a carefully considered programme that balances the principles of personal responsibility, fairness, simplicity, affordability and sustainability, is implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.3/4">The hon. Gentleman also asked about the ombudsman's report. He acknowledged that the Department for Work and Pensions had made a considered response to it and I do not believe that I can add anything to that. However, in May 2004, the Government set up the financial assistance scheme, covering 15,000 people, and we have made a commitment to review the fund for the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.3/5">The health service was mentioned repeatedly. Let us get a few things straight. The Government's plans for the NHS were set out in the Budget of 2002, providing clear plans for right up to 2008, offering long-term certainty for the NHS in order for it to plan. Since 1997, UK health spending has risen from the &pound;33 billion that we inherited from the previous Conservative Government to &pound;97 billion, representing a 7 per cent. real-terms increase per year. Now, 99 per cent. of people suspected of having cancer are seen by a specialist within two weeks, and we no longer have to listen to horrendous stories in our surgeries resulting from Conservative Government policy. If the Conservatives want to know where the money went, I shall tell them. It has gone towards 660,000 more operations and 1 million more elective admissions each year. These represent increases of 88 per cent., 89 per cent. and 108 per cent. in people's treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.3/6">Alongside that, there are now 79,000 more nurses and 27,000 more doctors. By the end of the 2004 spending round, the NHS will have 90 per cent. higher spending in real terms than it did in 1997. The money has not gone to pay for managers' salaries, as Conservative Members insist on saying. NHS managers now comprise 3 per cent. of the staff, whereas that figure was 5 per cent in 1997, so the percentage is falling under this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.3/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">The hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> made a measured contribution, in which he mentioned productivity. He had the good grace to acknowledge that, in the public services&mdash;including the national health service&mdash;measuring and improving productivity presented a challenge. However, the NHS report shows improved productivity as a result of lower levels of staff sickness and the reduced use of agency staff in 2004&ndash;05, which freed up about &pound;60 million more for patient care. But, of course, it cannot end there.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-23a.515.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1415" speakername="Clare Short" colnum="515"  time="018:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/debtext/60323-37.htm#60323-37_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.515.2/1">I want to raise the case of Omid Farivar and his family, who are asylum seekers from Iran living in my constituency. Over the years that I have been in the House, I have dealt with many hundreds and probably thousands of asylum cases. Some have been distressing, and some disturbing, but probably none has been worse and more worrying than this one. I have therefore written to the Home Office and the Minister on a number of occasions, and have asked for a meeting with the Minister, which he refused. I am therefore bringing the case to the Floor of the House to try to draw the Minister's attention to this case's extremely distressing features, which inspire compassion, in the hope that I can get him to reconsider.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/2">All of us who deal regularly with asylum cases know that there has been a continuing hardening of attitudes in the Home Office in recent years, and a growing unwillingness on the part of Ministers to use the discretion given them by Parliament to deal with cases that truly arouse compassion. I still find it hard to believe, however, that any UK Minister, let alone one who claims to be a Labour Minister, can possibly refuse this case. If I do not achieve a reconsideration by the Minister, my concern is that the doctors of my constituent's 13-year-old daughter fear that she is unlikely to reach the age of 14 and extremely likely to commit suicide. I will come to the evidence of that in a moment. In addition, her father, if returned to Iran, is very likely to be executed.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/3">I should stress that I am anxious not to identify the family too closely. I have given the name of my constituent, and I hope that that will not cause ramifications. The obvious reasons for my hesitation are those of privacy and concern for the mental health of the daughter, but also that the family are fearful of any consequences of publicity here for their family in Iran. My regional television company, Central television, was anxious to take up the case and interview the family. Although that might have helped them, they refused, because they fear what might happen at home if they draw attention to themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/4">My constituent is a graduate in chemical engineering. For a time, he was a lecturer, and then became a development and research manager in a substantial factory. His wife is also a chemical engineering graduate, production manager and part-time chemistry teacher. Obviously, the family are highly educated and were living comfortably in Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/5">In February 2003, however, my constituent was involved in a road traffic accident in which a child was seriously injured. That was obviously a tragedy, but it turned into a nightmare for the family, because the boy was the son of a high-ranking member of an Islamist group referred to in Iran as Hizbullahi&mdash;as I understand it, all such groups are fanatically supportive of the Government, but this particular group is especially fanatical, tends to enforce Government rules, and is known as Feshar. My constituent tells me that its members are hard-line militant enforcers of Islamist rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/6">After the accident the police went to the scene, talked to witnesses and took my constituent to a police station, where he was held for three days. The father of the boy then went to the police station and claimed that my constituent had knocked the boy over on purpose. He kicked and beat him. At first the police were inclined to stop that, but when the political-activist senior figure said that my constituent had knocked the boy over on purpose they joined in, and he was beaten very severely.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/7">On the second day, my constituent was asked to sign a confession. He resisted, but was beaten more and then gave in. The confession stated that he had deliberately injured the boy because he was trying to harm the father, and that he had been drinking alcohol. That was all completely untrue, but he signed the confession because he was beaten. He was then taken to court, and was detained while they waited to see what would happen to the boy. He was in prison for two to three weeks; then the boy sadly died.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/8">My constituent's family experienced great difficulty in getting any solicitor to represent him because of the political position of the boy's father, but eventually they found a solicitor who secured his release from prison on bail. When the boy died, however, he was detained again. The court then ordered him to pay blood money or be executed. Obviously he accepted the order to pay blood money, but in such cases the offended party must agree. The boy's family would not accept blood money, but said they would agree to accept it and would not demand execution if my constituent agreed to engage his 11-year-old daughter to the brother of the boy's father, a 42-year-old. The boy's father also went to see my constituent, and said that even if my constituent was executed he would follow his family and take the life of a young person to pay for the life that his own family had lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/9">My constituent then talked to his wife and father about what he should do. He thought that perhaps he should accept execution to release his family from the pressure that they were under, but they said &quot;No: agree to the deal. Then at least we can get you out of prison, and try to find a way forward.&quot; He therefore accepted the deal and paid the blood money, which he tells me was 15 million toman. I have no idea how much that is, but I imagine that it is a substantial sum.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/10">Then the daughter was engaged to the brother, but whenever the man called at their house she would shake in fear. Her father felt absolutely dreadful, and decided that he could not do it: she was too young. Then his father paid a people-smuggler&mdash;one of those people who now run the asylum system of the world&mdash;to take the family out of the country. But the smuggler was arrested&mdash;I do not think that it was to do with this case&mdash;and put in prison, so the money was lost and that plan did not work.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/11">The fianc&eacute;&mdash;the 42-year-old brother&mdash;kept calling at my constituent's house to see his daughter. My constituent said that he could not accept it any more. He dismissed the engagement, and returned the presents that the fianc&eacute; had brought.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/12">Before the engagement, the family of the boy who had died in the accident had come to my constituent's house, broken windows and harassed and threatened the family. All that stopped when the engagement was on, but after it was broken off the attacks started again. That led to an invasion of the house. The invaders found the satellite television, which is illegal in Iran. They also claimed to have found political books and alcohol. My constituent tells me that he did have a satellite television, but did not have political books or alcohol. He was not involved in any political activity in Iran. However, the allegations were being made by a political faction, which made him into a political prisoner.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/13">My constituent was then taken to the fanatical group's own prison, which he tells me was very nasty, like a cage, with sharp needle-like pieces of metal embedded in the cement of the floor. He was there for 10 to 12 days. There was no light, and he did not know whether it was day or night. He was taken out of the cage and beaten, then put back, many times. He was then released, because his father had paid a lot of money for him to be released, and told to report to the group daily. He tells me that there are special courts to deal with political offences&mdash;Islamic revolutionary courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/14">Given the doubts of the regrettably misinformed adjudicator in the case, let me say that Human Rights Watch is very clear about the fact that there are political courts in Iran: there is no question about that. My constituent was not politically active, but he was accused by a political faction of being politically motivated, and was therefore treated as a political prisoner.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/15">My constituent's father, having got him released from prison, looked for a way to get him and his wife, son and daughter out of the country. They found and paid a people-smuggler, who got them false visas on their real passports. By now, they were not staying at home but moving between friends and family. Then, they got the message to go to the airport very early on a fixed day. The smuggler gave them their passports and told them which passport check-line and door to go through. My constituent assumes that people were bribed to let them through. They did not know until that morning where they were going. They had no motivation to get to the UK; they just wanted to get out of the country and the danger that they were in. They were given tickets and told to rip up their passports on the plane and to apply to UK authorities when they arrived, which they did. My constituent knew nothing whatsoever of asylum or any asylum seekers before he came to the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/16">Since the family have been in this country, the daughter has had constant nightmares and will not eat. Her doctors have written medical letters to me; indeed, they are so worried about her that they have even come to see me at my advice bureau. They are extremely fearful that she will commit suicide. I have provided the Home Office with copies of those letters. Dr. Usha Jayarajan, clinical psychologist, and Dr. Irene Lampert, consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, of Birmingham Children's hospital&mdash;a fine and prestigious hospital&mdash;say that the girl</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/17" class="indent">&quot;suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and associated Mood Disorders.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/18">She</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/19" class="indent">&quot;has difficulty sleeping, waking frequently from frightening nightmares where she sees the cyclist who died in the accident in Iran, covered with blood and chasing her with knives in his hands, threatening to kill her and her family.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/20">When she is awake</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/21" class="indent">&quot;she sees people who are walking towards her as the cyclist covered in blood and becomes afraid that he is going to kill her&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/22">She</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/23" class="indent">&quot;experiences many symptoms of acute anxiety; she is sweaty, dizzy, trembling hands, fidgety, palpitations and suffers from headaches.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/24">On one occasion, she</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/25" class="indent">&quot;became dizzy resulting in her falling and breaking her leg in three places.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/26">She</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/27" class="indent">&quot;is visibly very tense and has a constant sense of dread&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/28">and</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/29" class="indent">&quot;is unable to eat as it makes her feel nauseous.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/30">When she is awake,</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/31" class="indent">&quot;she reports finding it difficult to think about anything other than the events that led them to flee Iran and how terrible their situation is now, compared to the comfortable life that they had prior to the accident.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/32">She</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/33" class="indent">&quot;has a sense of despair and hopelessness resulting in a persistent wish that she were dead. She has tried to persuade her mother to agree to a suicide pact for the whole family.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/34">The letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/35" class="indent">&quot;As we have already indicated, a strong feature of&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/36">the girl's case</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/37" class="indent">&quot;is her persistent wish to kill herself. It is our strong belief that if&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/38">she</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/39" class="indent">&quot;believed that she was to be returned to Iran she would make a serious attempt to kill herself, and would quite possibly succeed, before she ever reached there.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/40">Since that letter was written, I have received a further letter from the doctors. It states that</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/41" class="indent">&quot;the situation has gone from bad to worse.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/42">The father is now deeply depressed and there is a lot of blame between daughter and father for what has taken place. The letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/43" class="indent">&quot;We have a very real worry, that if the situation is not swiftly resolved, i.e. the family are given permanent permission to stay, then&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/44">she</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/45" class="indent">&quot;is not going to make a recovery.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/46">The doctors have discussed the case with a senior hospital figure, and they are all worried that she</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/47" class="indent">&quot;will not see her 14th birthday. If this were to be the case, then the subsequent impact on the rest of the family is too horrific to contemplate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/48">As if that were not bad enough, since the family has been in the UK the son has developed leukaemia. A letter from a consultant paediatric haematologist at Birmingham Children's hospital&mdash;I have sent a copy of it to the Home Office&mdash;dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June 2005</phrase> states that the son</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/49" class="indent">&quot;was first diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia at the beginning of March 2004 and he received intensive chemotherapy until August 2004. He is currently in remission and on regular follow up. He is not requiring any active treatment at present although there still does remain a significant risk of disease relapse, particularly over the next two to three years . . . treatment was quite intensive and we are continuing to monitor him in the Outpatient Department for any sign of toxic effects following this treatment. He does have a significant risk of relapse and if this occurs he will need intensive further treatment and bone marrow transplant. Were he to return to Iran it is unlikely he would get the sort of follow up that would pick up complications following his treatment and secondly should his disease relapse, he will not have access to multi-agent chemotherapy and transplant as would be available in the U.K. Even should he relapse, he has a good chance of being cured with further intensive treatment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/50">The tragedy of the boy comes on top of the rest of the tragedy for that family.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/51">Since they have been in the UK, they have kept in touch with the father and mother of my constituent. Their house has been invaded twice by that fanatical group and they have been beaten on both occasions. After the second invasion, the mother had a heart attack, but is still alive.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/52">My constituent is a very intelligent, calm and reflective man. There is no doubt about the sincerity of his belief&mdash;I have been to their house and spoken with them at some length&mdash;that if he is sent back he would be sent before a political court, because he has been accused of political activity, and probably executed. His children would also be targeted, as was threatened.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/53">I have written to my hon. Friend the Minister and asked for a meeting. His letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March</phrase> relies on an adjudication that turned down the family's case. Some of the medical evidence that I have given today was not put before the adjudicator, but the adjudicator simply did not believe the story. There is no doubt in my mind that the adjudicator was simply wrong. The reason Parliament gives Ministers discretion is so that they have the right to overturn a decision when the adjudicator gets it wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/54">It is notable also that in October 2003, before the adjudication, the Home Office argued that the general human rights situation and freedom of speech in Iran were improving, and the country was in a state of transition. I hope it is accepted&mdash;it is certainly the rhetoric of our Government&mdash;that since the 2005 elections and the appointment, in particular, of Mostafa Pour-Mohammadi as Minister of the Interior, that is emphatically no longer the case. He was previously involved in a decision to execute thousands of political prisoners in 1983, an event that Human Rights Watch considers a serious crime against humanity under international human rights law.</p>
	<p pid="a.515.2/55">That is the case that I am bringing to the Floor of the House and before the Minister tonight. I am sure that he is very busy and has many cases to consider. Perhaps he has not in the past had time to consider all the details of this case, but I ask him to please, please use his discretion to allow the family to remain in the UK on compassionate grounds because that would save their lives. They are a very nice and highly educated family and, if allowed to stay, I am sure that they would be very good citizens of our country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-03-23a.521.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" speakername="Tony McNulty" colnum="521"  time="018:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060323/debtext/60323-38.htm#60323-38_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.521.1/1">Members find ways and means of raising aspects of cases each and every day. I shall not comment directly on the outcome of the judicial process until it is complete. We are doing all we can through the immigration and nationality directorate, to ensure through correspondence, e-mail, hot lines and so on, that any subsequent information that a Member wants to submit about an individual case can be taken fully into consideration. I spend much of my time deferring decisions on removal directions or other aspects of cases so that new information&mdash;if it is genuinely new&mdash;can be put before the caseworker concerned, or me.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/2">With the greatest respect, I have to point out that with the best will in the world, the issue is not simply about meeting the Minister in every instance. I meet individual MPs and they talk to me about cases and raise specific points with me every time I am in the House. It is right and proper that I should make myself available in that way. As and when appropriate I meet MPs on a regular basis, but I do not do so in every case where a Member has requested a meeting. I do not think that doing so would be fair on the MPs, given the expectations that may or may not be raised with the applications or the general process that I undertake in dealing with cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/3">I hope that my right hon. Friend will accept that things are improving in our interactions with MPs in such cases. We are doing all we can to improve not only the decision-making process and the information made available during that process, and how the IND and the Home Office work with MPs and their caseworkers and correspond about cases, but more broadly in creating a more robust asylum process, rooted in the 1951 convention, which is and must be our starting point.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/4">In conclusion, the IND and the Home Office are doing things far more efficiently, but not in the context of a more hard-headed approach or a growing unwillingness to use discretion. Of course the asylum system, rooted in the 1951 convention and the European convention on human rights, is and should be about dealing with political repression and the circumstances of specific cases and their ins and outs. Rather going into the specifics of a case&mdash;to be perfectly honest, it would be inappropriate to do so on the Floor of the House or in any public forum&mdash;it is right and proper that I have dwelt on the broader issues that I hope will be of some use to my right hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/5" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.521.1/6">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-six minutes past Six o'clock.</p>
