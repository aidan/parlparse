	<p pid="b.461.4/1">Let me answer the hon. Gentleman's question. The Government's position on the reform of capital gains tax was set out in the pre-Budget report on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October</phrase>. However, I have subsequently received representations from a number of organisations and individuals with whom I have been consulting, and as a result of which a wide range of proposals have been made to me. Because those proposals cover a wide range of approaches, and in some cases are quite complex, I think it desirable to have further discussions with those groups before I finalise my proposals. It is not now going to be possible to conclude that process until the new year. I can tell the House that when I am ready to make proposals, I will come to the House and make a statement in the usual way.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.4/2">For the sake of completeness, I understand that the hon. Gentleman, who is the acting leader of the Liberal Democrat party, was moved to ask this question because he saw on today's Order Paper notice of a written ministerial statement on Finance Bill measures. Perhaps I can tell the House that those measures relate to two types of corporation tax avoidance involving the leasing of plant machinery, such as combine harvesters, tractors and so on, which had a potential tax loss of hundreds of millions of pounds. The written ministerial statement had nothing whatever to do with capital gains tax.</p>

In the meantime, thousands of small businesses and employee share owners do not know what to do or what the position will be next April. He knows what the concessions will be.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-13b.464.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="464"  time="011:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/debtext/71213-0004.htm#07121353001770">
	<p pid="b.464.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the future business. I should like to join her in wishing you, Mr. Speaker, all the staff in the House who provide us with support and all right hon. and hon. Members a very merry Christmas and a happy new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.3/2">The right hon. and learned Lady said that there would be a debate on the armed forces on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-10">Thursday 10 January</phrase>, but, given the topical debate on that day, we will have less than half a day for that important subject. It seems that we will now have a part-time debate for a part-time Secretary of State for Defence. Will she rearrange the business so that we can have a full-time debate on the armed forces?</p>
	<p pid="b.464.3/3">Last week I suggested that the right hon. and learned Lady should select the housing market as the subject for this week's topical debate. If she looks at the front pages of today's newspapers, she will see that it is not only a topical issue, but an extremely worrying one for millions for families. Will she now commit to a debate on the economic slow-down, and the problems in the banking industry and their effects on the housing market?</p>
	<p pid="b.464.3/4">Last weekend the Prime Minister went to Basra, where he promised that the troops would be home by Christmas. Why did he not make a proper statement about that to the House? How many troops will come home? When will they come home? Will they go back if there is trouble in Basra? How many troops will stay to train Iraqi forces? It is to answer questions such as those and many more that we need a statement. Every week the Leader of House tells us that she puts Parliament first; every week her colleagues, from the Prime Minister down, treat Parliament with disdain.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.3/5">The Pensions Minister and the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions want to compensate the 125,000 people who lost their savings after their pension schemes went bust, but the Prime Minister and the Chancellor appear to have blocked them. Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Cross-Bench Peers, Labour MPs and Peers, Ros Altmann, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and now the Work and Pensions Secretary all now believe that those innocent people deserve full compensation. They did the right thing and saved for their pensions, but lost everything through no fault of their own, so will the Work and Pensions Secretary make a statement on why the Government refuse to compensate fully those innocent victims?</p>
	<p pid="b.464.3/6">Some 89 Labour MPs have signed a motion calling for the Government to honour the police pay award recommended by the Police Arbitration Tribunal. According to the Chairman of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, 10 Ministers oppose the Home Secretary's policy. Police authorities in England and Wales have already budgeted to meet the cost and the Police Federation has called it &quot;a betrayal of trust&quot;, so can we have a debate in Government time on the breakdown in the crucial relationship between the police and the Home Secretary?</p>
	<p pid="b.464.3/7">On Europe, the Prime Minister said this morning:</p>
	<p pid="b.464.3/8" class="indent">&quot;I think you'll find we are leading the way.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.464.3/9">However, he is reluctantly making his way to Lisbon today to sign the renamed constitution, explicitly breaking his manifesto promise not to sign without a referendum. He is too frightened to let the people decide, and too frightened to be photographed with the other Heads of Government. Is this really what the Prime Minister means by &quot;leading the way&quot;?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-13b.465.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1472" speakername="Harriet Harman" colnum="465"  time="011:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/debtext/71213-0004.htm#07121353001771">
	<p pid="b.465.0/1">The right hon. Lady mentioned the debate on the armed forces on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-10">Thursday 10 January</phrase>, and the topical debate on the same day. I would say two things in response. First, she supported the introduction of topical debates, as did the whole House. I believe that they are going to be very important. Secondly, we have five days' debate on defence as well as Defence oral questions and other statements that are made from time to time. Defence and our armed services are of importance at all times to Members on both sides of the House, and we ensure that they are debated regularly and that they remain at the forefront of the concerns of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.0/2">On the housing market, the right hon. Lady will know that it is important for that market that we have low inflation, and that people can pay their mortgages because they are able to remain in work and because interest rates are low. She will also know that it is important for that market that there is affordable housing, and that means that there should be a greater supply of housing. If she is as concerned as she says she is, I hope that the Opposition will support our Housing and Regeneration Bill, which will make the biggest possible contribution to the housing market.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.0/3">The right hon. Lady asked a number of questions about the Prime Minister and Iraq. Perhaps she will remember that, only yesterday at Prime Minister's questions, the Prime Minister answered questions about Iraq, as he does nearly every Wednesday at this Dispatch Box. Indeed, he also made a statement on Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.0/4">On pensions, the right hon. Lady will know that we have just concluded deliberation in this House on one Pensions Bill, and that our legislative programme contains another pensions Bill. She raised the question of the police pay award, and I want to pay tribute to the police for their important and courageous work. She will know that it is Government policy to ensure that we deal with police pay within the overall context of the Government's public sector pay policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.0/5">The right hon. Lady raised a range of issues about Europe. She will know that, because the Prime Minister believes in the importance of the House, he was answering questions before the Liaison Committee this morning. He cannot be in two places in once, so he has answered the Committee's questions and he is now travelling to sign the treaty. She then raised a whole load of other spurious questions about Europe&mdash;I know that this is the festive season, but this is supposed to be business questions, not panto.</p>

	<p pid="b.466.2/1">I was tempted to say in response to the earlier reply from the Leader of the House that we could have both business questions and panto, which might be more acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/2">I am grateful for the announcement of a debate on police funding on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-10">10 January</phrase>. I join the Leader of the House and the shadow Leader of the House in extending my best wishes and thanks not just to the police, but to all Officers of the House and, of course, to you, Mr. Speaker, as we approach Christmas and the new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/3">May we have a debate about the growing number of Government policy reviews? After the recent announcement by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families of four more such reviews, they are now up to 31. As Tony Travers said this week, evidence-based policy is a good thing, but it is necessary to have the policy and the policy making. It would be good to know how the Government are seeking to develop policy and whether Parliament is going to play a part in that.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/4">I understand that the Government were intending to produce the results of their review of electoral systems across the UK, including those used in this year's Scottish elections, by the end of the year, but that it has now been postponed. May we have a statement announcing the new timetable, as the Leader of the House must ensure that the review does not disappear into the long grass?</p>
	<p pid="b.466.2/5">The Prime Minister is probably just about to set off to Lisbon to sign the European treaty. Presuming that he gets there and he signs it, when can we expect to start debates on the legislation to implement that treaty? We know that the debates will take a long time and we know that they will be on the Floor of the House, but it would be helpful for colleagues to know&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-13b.481.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" speakername="Jacqui Smith" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="481"  time="012:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/debtext/71213-0007.htm#07121353001847">
	<p pid="b.481.1/1">Following my statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-13">13 November</phrase>, I would like to update the House on the actions that we are taking to address Security Industry Authority licensing checks and the issue of entitlement to work in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.1/2">An SIA licence demonstrates that the holder has undergone training and that identity and criminality checks have been completed. An SIA licence has never constituted evidence of entitlement to work in this country, and it is the responsibility of employers to ensure that the people they employ are entitled to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.1/3">Before my previous statement, steps were already being taken to prevent illegal working in the security industry. From <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July 2007</phrase>, the SIA introduced immigration status checks with the Border and Immigration Agency on all non-European economic area applicants as part of the security industry licensing process. That is not a substitute for employers meeting their clear obligations, but the SIA checks provide a double lock on illegal working in this area. Alongside the immigration status checks, my Department took steps to determine how many people who were granted licences prior to <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase> did not have the right to work. Plans were put in place for the BIA to check all the 39,885 non-EEA nationals licensed by SIA before <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>. Manual checks had already started at the rate of 1,000 cases per week.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.1/4">I wanted the process to be speeded up without compromising accuracy. I therefore ordered automatic matching between the SIA list of non-EEA nationals and databases operated by BIA and UK Visas. The BIA and SIA have now completed the checks on the 39,885 non-EEA nationals licensed by SIA before <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>. On the basis of those checks, I am advised that the BIA is fully satisfied that 28,737 have the right to work in this country; the BIA believes that 6,653 do not have the right to work in this country; and, in 4,447 other cases, the BIA is not satisfied that the individual has proved the right to work. The balance of 48 represents duplicate records.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.1/5">The following steps are being taken to revoke the licences of those found not to be entitled to work in this country. The SIA has written to all companies on their database to remind them of the need to check regularly on the SIA's website the registers of licence holders and of revoked licences, to ensure that all their staff have the right to work. The registers are currently receiving more than 1,000 hits a day. Apart from a small number of cases whose SIA licence is close to expiry, the SIA has written to all of those individuals&mdash;more than 10,500&mdash;for whom checks indicate no right to work or where the BIA is not satisfied that the individual has the right to work. Those letters advise the licence holder that the SIA is minded to revoke their licence. The SIA gives recipients 21 days in which to respond with further information, and it expects that many will do so. If evidence is not forthcoming, the SIA will move to revocation. The law then allows the individual a further 21 days in which to appeal to the magistrates or sheriff courts. Once the SIA has completed the process, it will be in a position to determine the number of individuals who were not entitled to work but obtained SIA licences prior to the new double lock checking regime that is now in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.1/6">The SIA expects that a significant proportion may yet establish that they have a right to work in this country. I am advised that, of the new applicants for licences initially considered for refusal by the SIA on the basis of checks with the BIA after <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>, more than 30 per cent. have since shown that they have the right to work. The SIA will publish the final numbers of the pre-<phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase> group on its website when they are complete.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.1/7">I repeat that it is important that all employers fulfil their obligations by carrying out all the proper checks before taking anyone on. We are also taking further steps to protect the public from those individuals whom we suspect have breached our immigration laws by working here illegally. First, all the cases where &quot;minded to revoke&quot; action is being taken against individuals have been passed to the BIA enforcement intelligence units to be assessed for further action. The BIA is screening those individuals against the police national computer and other databases so that we can target any individuals who may pose a risk to the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.1/8">Secondly, the cases are being analysed for evidence of employers who appear to have a track record of employing people who do not have a right to work. The BIA tells me that a third of its illegal working operation is deployed on that employment sector. Visits to specific individuals and employers have already begun and swift action has been taken in those cases that merit it. A series of targeted enforcement operations will take place in the coming months, with a view to prosecuting employers and removing or prosecuting individuals in the worst cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.1/9">Thirdly, in line with our enforcement strategy, we will continue to target illegal working on the basis of the risk of harm to the public. New powers which come into force in February will mean that we can more easily fine employers who break the rules. Now that we have identified a significant problem in the security industry, we will maintain a focus on its employers and staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.1/10">We are taking other steps further to guard against illegal working in the security industry. First, the BIA has passed to the SIA the right-to-work expiry dates of all licence holders and recent new applicants. The SIA has agreed that in future it will send &quot;minded to revoke&quot; letters to all those licence holders shortly before their right-to-work status expires. Secondly, I have asked the BIA to work with the SIA to provide specialist advice to enhance its ability to spot fraudulent documentation.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.1/11">Thirdly, the SIA's licence application form does not specifically ask applicants to state that they have the right to work in the UK. I have therefore asked the SIA to review the application form to ensure that it contains all the information both the SIA and BIA may need, with a view to making changes as soon as possible. Fourthly, in January the SIA will run a joint seminar with the British Security Industry Association to underline the importance of employers' meeting their responsibilities in that area. Fifthly, the taskforce that I set up to resolve the issue in September, chaired by the Under-Secretary of State for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>, will continue to oversee action.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.1/12">I believe that the update that I have provided today demonstrates my determination, and that of the Government, to put in place effective systems and procedures to protect the public further. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-13b.483.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" speakername="David Davis" colnum="483"  time="012:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/debtext/71213-0007.htm#07121353001848">
	<p pid="b.483.0/1">I thank the Home Secretary for advance sight of her statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/2">Last month, we were told there were 5,000 illegal foreign workers in the security industry. Then it was 10,000. Now it is up to 11,000. First, will the Home Secretary answer some simple factual questions? How many of the 11,000 people working in security positions without a work permit have had their SIA licence revoked? Is she telling us that so far there have been none after nine months? How many have been removed from their security posts? How many are still in place, and why? How many have been deported? How many of those illegal workers does she expect to be deported? Can she now answer the question that I asked her last month: how many have been engaged protecting police, military or Government posts or critical national infrastructure?</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/3">My next questions relate to how on earth the system went so badly wrong. The Home Secretary said today that an SIA licence has</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/4" class="indent">&quot;never constituted evidence of entitlement to work in this country&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/5">That is not what the SIA says, and nor is it what any reasonable employer would accept. In a document published by the SIA in 2006, and repeated on its website, it states:</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/6" class="indent">&quot;To obtain an SIA licence it is necessary to pass checks relating to competency and being a fit and proper person for the role.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/7">It goes on:</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The fit and proper person check is made up of the following checks&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/9">and No. 1 is the</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/10" class="indent">&quot;right to work in the UK&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/11">Does the Secretary of State accept that the SIA led the industry to believe that it checked immigration status?</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/12">The SIA required a range of documents including passports and driving licences. It held those documents for up to three months. In some 5,000 to 11,000 cases they were presumably forgeries. How was the SIA&mdash;I emphasise that it is the Security Industry Authority&mdash;able to miss up to 11,000 forgeries? Who is responsible for that failure? Will there now be prosecutions in every case where forged documents were provided?</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/13">Not just the SIA was fooled. The application form provides for the applicant to give a national insurance number. In how many cases were illegal immigrants given a national insurance number? What are the checks made before a national insurance number is given? Is there a check on immigration status, and if not, why not?</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/14">There is also the issue of the Government's candour&mdash;or lack of it. In her November statement, the Home Secretary said that Ministers were informed about the problem in June, yet the Minister for Borders and Immigration told the Select Committee on Home Affairs on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-27">27 November</phrase> that he knew in April. Was he mistaken or did the Home Secretary accidentally misinform the House earlier?</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/15">The Home Secretary told the House in her last statement that she did not tell the Prime Minister until the weekend before. She said:</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/16" class="indent">&quot;I did not tell the Prime Minister because there was not a fiasco&quot;.&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-13">13 November 2007</phrase>; Vol. 467, c. 538.]</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/17">I will pass over what it takes to constitute a fiasco in the Home Office these days. The problem we have is that when the Prime Minister was asked the very next day to confirm when the Home Secretary had told him, he refused to answer three times. When I asked him the next week by written question to confirm the account, he referred me back to his non-answer. When his spokesman was asked at the Lobby briefing, he replied that he would not get into internal government processes and discussions.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.0/18">Let us be clear about what the Home Secretary has said. She was aware in July. However, in August, September and October, when the Prime Minister was actively considering an election, she did not tell him about the brewing scandal in the Home Office. Will she confirm that neither she nor her office and her advisers informed either the Prime Minister or his office before <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-10">Saturday 10 November 2007</phrase>? Yes or no?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-13b.484.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1776" speakername="Jacqui Smith" colnum="484"  time="012:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/debtext/71213-0007.htm#07121353001849">
	<p pid="b.484.0/1">First, the right hon. Gentleman's point about certainty of information proves the point made in my last statement about the importance of ensuring that information is certain before reporting it to the House. He has just cited a series of figures, even though I made it clear when I made that statement that they were not certified and checked. That was why I argued as I did and have come back to the House to provide the detailed information in my statement today.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/2">There have been 409 revocations of licences from before <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>, when the new immigration checks were brought in. More than 10,000 letters instituting revocation have been issued, but as the revocation process involves a minimum period of 42 days, there will obviously be more. However, 409 is the figure at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman asked me specific questions about enforcement. The Border and Immigration Agency has rightly focused its attention on working with the SIA to identify the scale of the problem so that further work can be done. At the same time, however, the BIA has also started investigations into 328 of the cases referred to it. It has carried out 101 enforcement visits and arrested 15 individuals, and plans to make at least 400 further visits by the end of January.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/4">The right hon. Gentleman then spoke about the system as a whole, and I want to begin my response to that by repeating what I said in my previous statement to the House. The SIA was not failing to do anything that it was legally required to do. The legal requirement to check an employee's right to work has always fallen on employers, but the SIA did carry out spot-checks on a sample. Along with the enforcement activities that took place in April, those spot-checks identified that there was a need to tighten the system even further by the application of what I have described as a double lock. That is what has happened. It is why, from <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>, 100 per cent. of those applying for a SIA licence have been subject to a check of their immigration status. It is also why the evidence required for identity checks was upgraded from <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October</phrase>&mdash;a change that will impact on everyone with a SIA licence that comes up for renewal.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman asked about forgeries. He will know that they can be very expert, but the BIA has considerable expertise in discovering them and winkling them out. That is why, as I said in my statement, I have asked the BIA to provide the SIA with advice on how to identify forgeries.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/6">As for national insurance numbers, I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that anyone applying for an employment-related NI number must supply proof of the right to work in the UK by providing a limited number of specified documents. I repeat what I said in my previous statement to the House on these matters: my hon. Friend the Minister for Borders and Immigration told the Home Affairs Committee that we undertook an enforcement operation in April. In other words, that was precisely the sort of action in respect of the immigration system that we must take if we are to clamp down on illegal working. The operation identified a potential problem in the security industry, and led to the action that was taken subsequently.</p>
	<p pid="b.484.0/7">Finally, the right hon. Gentleman asked about keeping the Prime Minister up to date about what is happening with this matter. In fact, in his response to my statement he quoted how we did just that.</p>

	<p pid="b.487.0/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for raising the point about a positive declaration of the right to work on the application form. We have taken cognisance of it and I have asked the authority to redesign the form to ensure that all the necessary information is included.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/2">On what my right hon. Friend describes as the endgame, I can say that the result of the action we have taken, particularly since <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>, is to strengthen, on an ongoing basis, both the immigration checks made when somebody applies for a Security Industry Authority licence&mdash;there is now a 100 per cent. check&mdash;and, from <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October</phrase>, the nature of the evidence required to verify somebody's identity, which will ensure, as I said in my statement, that any doubt about the veracity of identity documents will be dealt with as licences come up for renewal.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/3">My right hon. Friend asked when we would know the number of revocations. In my statement, I said that the revocation process takes a minimum of 42 days. Some individuals will exercise their right to lodge an appeal in the magistrates courts or sheriff courts, but I have made it clear that the SIA should maintain a record of licences that are being revoked, so that when we complete the process it should be able to report on the total number of licence revocations.</p>

	<p pid="b.488.3/1">I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is talking specifically about the situation in Scotland, where the need for an SIA licence was implemented only on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November</phrase>, although people have been able to apply for licences since <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February</phrase>, which is clearly a much longer period than two months. My understanding is that 80 per cent. of licences are issued within eight weeks. The only instances where there may be a short delay&mdash;perhaps one to two weeks&mdash;are in respect of applicants from outside the European economic area, where, as I have already said, we are making additional checks.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-13b.512.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1866" speakername="Anne Snelgrove" colnum="512"  time="014:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/debtext/71213-0012.htm#07121353001915">
	<p pid="b.512.0/1">I welcome this topical debate. I am going to speak of my experience of the collapsed hamper and voucher company, Farepak, which brought me into contact with families on low incomes who regarded themselves as savers. Farepak was not, in fact, an officially recognised savings scheme; it was a prepayment scheme. That is where the trouble stemmed from, because the company was not covered by the strict financial regulations relating to financial services and savings schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/2">The savers in such families are mainly women who save for specific, short-term goals such as holidays, events such as Christmas, large items of furniture or white goods. Very few savings schemes within the financial services remit cover such goals and items. The schemes that are available are not as attractive to low-income savers as some of the schemes outside the regulatory framework. I hope that the Minister will address that point in her response, and in her work on these matters in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/3">Those savers are suspicious of credit cards and bank accounts, because of the charges that have been mentioned and because of the temptation to get into debt. They are a difficult group to reach, mainly because they are a quiet group that did not come to the fore until Farepak collapsed. Their wariness of middle-class financial services has been underpinned this year by the collapse of Northern Rock and by their disillusionment with the Government. Present and past Governments have been unable and unwilling to tackle the problems of low-income savers, or the fact that they suffer when schemes such as Farepak collapse.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/4">Prepayment schemes of that type have been examined by the former Department for Trade and Industry and the present Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform over a period of 20 years, and the conclusion is that they are too tricky to regulate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" name="Mark Hoban">The hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)</phrase> said that he would be reluctant to consider regulation. It is difficult to regulate prepayment schemes because they cover a range of concerns, including small businesses asking for a deposit for furniture making, for example. Such enterprises could be put out of business very easily by clumsy regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/5">In dealing with these low-income families over the past year, however, I have come to the conclusion that they will not have confidence in financial services unless we do something about prepayment schemes. They are the most attractive schemes to them, and they are going to continue to use them, and it is up to Parliament to legislate to ensure that those people can save safely in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.512.0/6">I note with pleasure that the statement made on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-10">10 December</phrase> by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform leaves the door open to reassessing the regulatory framework once the outcome of the investigation has been made available and the advice of other agencies has been taken into account. I hope that that will lead to some kind of regulation. It will be tricky to achieve, but we must do it. I thank the Prime Minister for meeting the Farepak MPs earlier this month, and I particularly want to give credit to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> for the distinguished work that she has done on this issue. The Prime Minister promised us that he would look again at the question of regulation, and I hope that he does so. I also hope that Members on both sides of the House will support this move.</p>

	<p pid="b.532.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move amendment No. 4, in page 15, line 2, after '(6)', insert</p>
	<p pid="b.532.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">', but no later than 9 months after the day on which the railway mentioned in section 1(1)(a) is first used by Crossrail passenger services,'.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.2/3">The clause and the amendment will be of particular concern to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" name="Peter Soulsby">the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby)</phrase>, who said in the previous debate that he was worried about periods of time, because they focus on the infamous &quot;interim period&quot;, which, for the purposes of the Bill, is the time between the granting of Royal Assent and the date on which passenger services commence on Crossrail. During that period, the Office of Rail Regulation has an overriding duty to exercise its access contract functions in such a way as to facilitate the operation of Crossrail. I accept that principle, which, as the Minister pointed out in another context, has, like so much of the Bill, a precedent in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.2/4">That was a fine Bill enacted by a fine Conservative Government, but the Minister will recognise that even legislation such as that can sometimes be improved upon. We do not necessarily have to take the example of that Act and look no further&mdash;and the amendment would look further. It would give some clarity and definition to the phrase &quot;the interim period&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.2/5">Clause 23(7) gives the Secretary of State the power to extend the so-called interim period. In Committee, I expressed more than once the idea that the during the interim period, which takes place between the granting of Royal Assent and the day on which passenger services commence, the ORR has the overriding duty to ensure that the construction phase of Crossrail is prioritised. That is right, but should not that power be restricted? Should not the ORR have the overriding duty only during the construction phase? Is it really right that it has that overriding duty once services are up and running? I have tabled an amendment that would restrict the extension of that overriding requirement to nine months and restrict any duty beyond the interim period.</p>
	<p pid="b.532.2/6">When we discussed the matter previously, the Minister was concerned that a restriction of six months would be too short. He rejected an amendment to that effect on the grounds that passenger services will be phased in on Crossrail over a period of time. He suggested that even six months after the first service, a full service might not be operational. He repeated that view to Committee members in his letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>. On reflection, it is just about possible to suggest that. We may well see an example of that with the channel tunnel rail link and the services run on it out of the excellent new St. Pancras station. However, if we consider the possibility of phasing in services, can we really say that a Crossrail service will not have a full timetable in place nine months after operation? In the Minister's response to the Committee, he clearly implied that he does not believe that the interim period should extend for time immemorial. He hopes that it will not extend wildly beyond the time when passenger services are fully operational. As so often in this Bill, he wants the flexibility to determine when that may be. We see that that flexibility is reasonable.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-13b.542.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" speakername="Stephen Hammond" colnum="542"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/debtext/71213-0016.htm#07121353002754">
	<p pid="b.542.10/1">Those hon. Members who had the joy of serving on the Public Bill Committee with me will know that we raised a number of concerns about consultation in that often informative and good humoured Committee, and had useful discussions about the subject. The Minister often dismissed my amendments outright, but at other times he appeared to be tempted by them. With that in mind, may I thank him for his letter to Committee members dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>, in which he expanded on some of the points that he raised in Committee about consultation? He made it clear that he was not opposed to the principle of enlarged consultation, but he suggested that there were a number of cases where that process would not be either desirable or practical. He also accepted in that letter that one of the many amendments that I tabled on consultation had some merit.</p>
	<p pid="b.542.10/2">In Committee, the Minister said that he more or less accepted the principle of an amendment that I tabled, and it is now in the form of Government amendment No. 1. It is marginally different from my original amendment and I assume that the wording needed to be tightened up or made legally acceptable. In any case, I hope that we now have a practical and workable consultation procedure. We therefore welcome Government amendment No. 1 and we are disappointed only that the Minister did not accept more of our suggestions.</p>
	<p pid="b.542.10/3">Amendment No. 5 is in the same vein. It relates to consultation, and I tabled a version in Committee. The Minister was tempted by it, and pledged to look at it with his officials. I hoped that we might see it tabled as Government amendment No. 2, but unfortunately that has not materialised. I have therefore tabled my amendment, and it uses the same wording as the Government use in Government amendment No. 1. It has the same format and I hope that the Government will accept it on that basis. As it replicates the Government's language, it should be consistent with the Government amendment, which should ensure that the phrasing is legally binding, unambiguous and workable.</p>
	<p pid="b.542.10/4">I shall explain why consultation is so important. Crossrail is a massive project that will affect a lot of people. We believe and hope that more people will be positively affected, at least in the long term, than will be adversely affected. None the less, those who will be affected in any way should have the right of consultation. The consultation procedures already employed have been very successful. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1708" name="Alan Meale">the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale)</phrase> and his Select Committee team on such sterling work in hearing from those people who wished to present their case. It is undoubtedly right that the Bill is better for having gone through the hybrid procedure and allowing that consultation. The decisions and hearings of the Committee have enhanced Crossrail and improved its legitimacy in the public eye.</p>
	<p pid="b.542.10/5">Consultation on railway matters is important. The Bill will give the Secretary of State new powers and will modify existing powers, and that will have the effect of interfering with current procedures and the norms of the railway industry. I accept that some of that is necessary and we do not object to the principle. However, we want to be certain that it is done in a way that is transparent and accountable, and that the affected parties are consulted. It is in that context that I return to clause 26, which deals with the amendment of the pre-commencement access contracts by the Office of Rail Regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.542.10/6">Clause 26(4) gives the Office of Rail Regulation the power to require concerned parties to submit proposals for how it should amend the contracts, and that is welcome. Clause 26(5) provides that the ORR must also consult the Secretary of State as part of the process, but that is where the consultation process ends. The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the ORR is open to the concerns of other appropriate and relevant parties, and consults them in an appropriate and relevant fashion. The Minister said in Committee that nothing in the clause prohibits the regulator consulting in such a manner. That is true, but it is not enough. If the Minister accepts that we can amend the Bill elsewhere using words that are similar to</p>
	<p pid="b.542.10/7" class="indent">&quot;such other persons (if any) as it considers appropriate&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.542.10/8">surely the ORR should have the duty to consult with persons other than the Secretary of State as it considers appropriate. That would be consistent with the duty of consultation. We all agree on the value of consultation and we agree that the ORR could consult in such a way. Why should we not make it an obligation and put it in the Bill?</p>
	<p pid="b.542.10/9">In Committee, the Minister accepted that the amendment had some merit. I believe that it still has. In fact, it has more than that. It is right that if the Government are prepared to accept wording elsewhere that makes a minor change but increases consultation, making it more binding, they should do the same in this clause. I hope that the Minister will reflect on my remarks. The Government have accepted the principle in Government amendment No. 1, and so it would be only right and proper to accept it for clause 26, too.</p>

Members will agree that the Bill is a better piece of legislation following the Committee's scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="b.551.1/4">Rather more routinely, the Bill was then scrutinised by a Public Bill Committee which, after four good humoured and entertaining sittings, reported on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-27">Tuesday 27 November</phrase>. On Third Reading, hon. Members will be asked to approve the Bill and, in so doing, approve the building of Crossrail. Before that question is put to them, I recognise that it is important that they are given a full understanding of the special considerations that apply in a case such as this, where the House is being asked to approve a project that will have significant environmental impacts. I fear that this involves a rather technical explanation, for which I apologise in advance.</p>
	<p pid="b.551.1/5">In t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" name="Stephen Hammond">his connection, the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase> raised with me specific concerns about the parliamentary procedures for the Bill, in the light of correspondence from a group calling themselves the coalition and their legal representatives. I can confirm that I and my officials have read the correspondence and taken advice. I am content that the procedure is compatible with the relevant EC obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.551.1/6">The environmental impact assessment directive requires that decision-making bodies should give consent to development projects likely to have a significant effect on the environment only after assessment of those environmental effects has been carried out. To that end, the directive sets out a procedure to be followed that requires a proper assessment of the likely significant environmental impacts of a project, which is published in the environmental statement; proper consultation of interested parties, including the public, on the environmental statement; that the views of the consultees should be taken into account, and that the decision whether or not to consent to the development should be given publicly, with the reasons for the decision. The environmental statement for Crossrail was published in February 2005. It has since been supplemented by a number of additional volumes, reflecting changes to the project made during the parliamentary process or additional information that became available later. Responses to the consultation exercise on the environmental statement were published in Command Papers issued in July 2005 and last month. We also published a third Command Paper last month; it summarised the work done to assess, control and mitigate the environmental impacts of Crossrail and the reasons why the Government continue to take the view that the project is worthy of their support.</p>
	<p pid="b.551.1/7">I deposited a written statement before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase> to draw hon. Members' attention to those documents and to the obligations placed on this House, as the decision-making body for Crossrail, by the environmental impact assessment directive. I especially draw attention to appendix A of Cm. 7250. It summarises the Government's reasons for urging this House to endorse its proposals for Crossrail, notwithstanding the unavoidable environmental impacts of such a project, on which subject I shall say more in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.551.1/8">It is now for right hon. and hon. Members to decide, in the light of the information provided by the Government and the views expressed by interested parties, whether the project should be allowed to proceed, taking into account its environmental effects. When considering that question, right hon. and hon. Members will no doubt bear in mind the excellent work done by the Select Committee, which considered many environmental issues as part of the process. Indeed, the Select Committee process resulted in a number of changes to the project, many of which helped to reduce Crossrail's likely environmental impacts.</p>
	<p pid="b.551.1/9">However, the remit of the Committee did not permit it to consider all the environmental issues raised by petitioners. This House instructed the Committee to report separately on those further issues so that hon. Members could consider all views raised on the Crossrail project. The Committee issued its special report in October, and it included a chapter on environmental issues. Hon. Members will wish to consider whether any matters raised there, in the environmental statement, in the consultation responses or in any direct representations from their constituents lead them to conclude that the project should not be granted consent.</p>
	<p pid="b.551.1/10">For my part, I am satisfied that the Crossrail project is in the wider public interest. It is not possible to build a large public transport infrastructure project in a densely populated area without some adverse impacts on those living and working on or near the intended route. Those impacts will include noise and various adverse effects on the townscape, landscape, visual amenity, heritage, archaeology, traffic and transport, as well as on certain businesses and local communities. In the Government's view, those effects are outweighed by the benefits that Crossrail will bring&mdash;not just to the United Kingdom as a whole, but to the local communities that will benefit from improved transport connections.</p>
	<p pid="b.551.1/11">The Government do not take lightly the environmental impacts of the project and I draw hon. Members' attention to the complex package of controls, mitigation and compensation measures put in place to reduce and mitigate the potential adverse impacts. They include changes to the project, made during the Select Committee process, that reduce environmental impacts; Bill provisions requiring detailed consents and approvals from relevant bodies such as local planning authorities; and the obligations to be placed on the Crossrail-nominated undertaker in the environmental minimum requirements, including a range of undertakings and assurances addressing environmental concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.551.1/12">On the plus side of the balance sheet, Crossrail has the potential to improve the lives of commuters as nothing has before. It will provide London and the south-east with a world-class railway, delivering high-capacity mainline rail services to and through the heart of the City and west end. It will provide a new fleet of trains, operating a 24 trains-an-hour peak service in both directions through central London, carrying some 200 million passengers a year. Crossrail has a strong economic case; the benefit-to-cost ratio is 1.8:1. We estimate that, in addition, Crossrail will generate cash benefits to the UK gross domestic product of at least &pound;20 billion. Others have suggested that those benefits to the national economy could be substantially higher.</p>
	<p pid="b.551.1/13">It goes without saying that Crossrail will significantly increase the capacity of the rail network into and across London. It is expected to add 21 per cent. and 54 per cent. to rail capacity to the City and the Isle of Dogs respectively, thereby relieving congestion and overcrowding on the existing national rail and underground networks. It will support the development of London as a world city and in its role as the financial centre of Europe and the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.551.1/14">The improved east-west rail access into and across London from the east and south-east regions will also support local and national Government policy for economic development and regeneration, particularly in the Lea valley and Thames Gateway, attracting some additional 80,000 jobs to regeneration areas.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-13b.555.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" speakername="Stephen Hammond" colnum="555"  time="017:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/debtext/71213-0018.htm#07121353002773">
	<p pid="b.555.0/1">Of course, I am not here to answer for the undertakers of the Bill, or for the Secretary of State, but my hon. Friend's point is well made. I am sure that it will have been heard by the nominated undertakers. He makes the point, as has everyone in the House today, that the Select Committee has done an amazing job. We are all thankful for that, principally because we were not on the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/2">The Conservative party's position has been clear throughout the Bill's parliamentary stages. It was stated initially by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1575" name="Chris Grayling">my hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling)</phrase>, and it has also been stated by the shadow Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1500" name="Theresa Villiers">my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)</phrase>, and myself, on numerous occasions in this House and other places. We have always supported Crossrail in principle, but we needed to be certain of the funding, and we needed to be certain that the funding package was robust.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-05">5 October</phrase>, the Government announced the funding package in what seemed some undue haste, before the Prime Minister changed his mind about a general election. It is most regrettable that during all of our scrutiny, we have not had the chance to discuss the funding package in any real depth, notwithstanding the Minister's generosity in putting at our disposal the heads of agreement between the Mayor and the Secretary of State. The Minister was also kind enough to brief <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">myself and the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/4">However, we need to understand exactly the consequences of this package and its robustness. The Mayor of London intends to levy a supplementary rate of 2 per cent. on businesses throughout London, and there will be relief for small businesses. He will raise &pound;3.5 billion, or more precisely he is going to raise &pound;3.5 billion in debt. However, the supplementary level can take place only, and I quote from the heads of agreement, when</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/5">&quot;such consultation as may be required is undertaken&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/6">That touches on my point about our inability to scrutinise matters, for what is</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/7">&quot;such consultation as may be required&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/8">Who is going to be consulted? Where will the results be accessible?</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/9">There are large grants from the Department for Transport and Transport for London, which come to close to &pound;8 billion. If any rational decision is to be taken, one needs to be able to scrutinise those grants. There are also very large contributions in the funding package from developers and sums raised from the sale of land. Again, it would be helpful if we were able to scrutinise the robustness of the whole package.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/10">I say to the Minister that Crossrail has our support, and it will continue to have it. However, we questioned the financing previously. We questioned it at the time of the referral to the Lyons inquiry and that whole debacle; during consideration of the carry-over motion; and, where we could do so in some minor, ingenious way, in Committee. I have questioned it again this afternoon by attempting to introduce a new clause. We will continue to question the package to ensure its robustness.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/11">The Minister will also know&mdash;we alluded to this earlier&mdash;that we raised the question of the right to consultation several times in Committee. Notwithstanding the legal questions raised by the coalition, and the Minister's reassuring answer, I have been approached latterly by representatives of Smithfield market tenants. That process reflects something that we discussed in Committee, which is the right to compensation. That right has been confirmed, but people are concerned that there has been no further discussion about the sums that may be granted. Those making representations to the Committee were assured that they would be compensated for the costs of going before the Committee and of making submissions. Again, there has been no further discussion with the people who made those petitions about the substance of that compensation. It would be helpful if the Minister&mdash;either in his closing remarks or by some other method&mdash;made clear the Government's intent on those two points. None the less, Crossrail is important to London and what benefits London will benefit the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.555.0/12">I have already mentioned the commitment and hard work of the Select Committee and of other hon. Members. I note that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase> is in his place. During the Bill's passage, we have had the chance to consider what would be included on the Crossrail route and, at times, to make sensible decisions for the greater value and benefit of the scheme. That was highlighted in our debates about Woolwich station. They led to the Government changing their position and allowing a Select Committee to consider the matter, and to an innovative funding solution. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman will confirm my comments in his speech, but I believe that Woolwich station will make a valid contribution to the regenerative effect of Crossrail on the Thames Gateway. It is to the credit of our parliamentary procedures that we were able to achieve what we did.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-13b.561.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" speakername="Brian Binley" colnum="561"  time="017:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/debtext/71213-0019.htm#07121361000153">
	<p pid="b.561.0/1">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1675" name="Peter Soulsby">the hon. Member for Leicester, South (Sir Peter Soulsby)</phrase>, who has proved to be a wise and experienced counsellor on matters of this kind. I am sure that his local government experience created that ability. I also pay tribute to the Chairman of the hybrid Bill Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1708" name="Alan Meale">the hon. Member for Mansfield (Mr. Meale)</phrase>, who led us with humour, gentleness and kindness, and managed to keep our interest going when most of us were flagging. His work ought to be recognised, and tribute should be paid to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.0/2">Sadly, I cannot share the confidence and enthusiasm expressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" name="Stephen Hammond">my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase>, for I have sizeable doubts. In my defence, I will add only that I had those doubts before the scheme began, and the work that I did in Committee did not change that; indeed, it rather strengthened my doubts, which relate to three specific issues. I am concerned about what I consider to be the poor costing regime used for the project to date, and referred to numerous times both in Committee and in the Bill; I fear that Crossrail will remove the focus from vital projects in other parts of the United Kingdom; and I am shocked at the lack of any attempt to put a cost on the blight and disruption that has been caused to London so far. Yet here we are, making a final decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.0/3">All those matters have a direct impact on the end cost of the Bill and the economic return of the scheme. It strikes me as disturbing that we should make decisions in that financial environment, and I think that the next hybrid Bill should make it possible for us to consider those matters as well. That we have not been able to do so on this occasion seems to me to be a major oversight. I realise that it could have been slightly embarrassing for the Government, but preventing embarrassment for the Government is not the purpose of a hybrid Bill or indeed of this place. I should like my opinion to be recorded, and to be considered for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.0/4">The poor cost accounting for the project became obvious to me as the hybrid Committee's deliberations continued, in two contexts. The first was floating track. More and more of it was demanded by petitioners and promised during our consideration, but the figures given for the amount of floating track and the increased cost that it would entail were extremely vague. I think it unacceptable that the House should make a final decision without an understanding of the true impact of those factors.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.0/5">My real concern, however, relates to Woolwich station. If the project goes ahead, that station is vital. As was pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1602" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford)</phrase>, the need for regeneration in the area is equally vital. The first estimate of the cost of a station was &pound;350 million. I gained the impression that the cost had been pitched very high because the promoters did not want the station. As we whittled away at the problem, however, the estimated cost fell to &pound;200 million. By <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October</phrase> it was &pound;186 million, and the final cost turned out to be about &pound;172 million. If that is an example of the costing used for this project, I despair. It does not give me much confidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.0/6">As for my fear that the focus will be removed from other projects, the <i> Financial Times </i>has already made the point that Crossrail covers roughly the distance between Leeds and Manchester but a northern Crossrail has not been considered, although it could have a tremendous impact on the whole economy of the north, an area on which the Government say they wish to make an impact. Many people would say that such a project could be implemented at a considerably lower cost than Crossrail. There are many other examples. The truth is that London has attracted many major infrastructure projects, and the rest of the country is deeply concerned about how much resource and finance will be left for their own particular projects and concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.561.0/7">Let me turn to the important matter of the final costings. Many Government schemes lead taxpayers to despair: the initial price is very acceptable, and we make the decision on the basis of that acceptable price, and we then find to our horror that the final cost has doubled or trebled&mdash;and sometimes it is four times as great as the initial estimate. I do not wish to embarrass the Government too much.</p>

	<p pid="b.568.2/1">I thank the House and Mr. Speaker for granting me this Adjournment debate. I shall talk briefly about the operation of the UK-Pakistan protocol, but specifically about how it has affected Asma Akhtar and her four children. You will be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the case is currently before the family division of the UK High Court, although I have the permission of Mr. Justice Ryder to raise the issue in the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.568.2/2">The UK-Pakistan protocol on children's matters is an agreement signed in 2003 between the president of the family division and the honourable chief justice of Pakistan. It aims to</p>
	<p pid="b.568.2/3" class="indent">&quot;protect the children of the UK and Pakistan from the harmful effects of wrongful removal or retention from one country to the other&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.568.2/4">Article 1 states:</p>
	<p pid="b.568.2/5" class="indent">&quot;In normal circumstances the welfare of a child is best determined by the courts of the country of the child's habitual/ordinary residence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.568.2/6">Article 2 continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.568.2/7" class="indent">&quot;If a child is removed from the UK to Pakistan...without the consent of the parent...the judge of the court of the country to which the child has been removed shall not ordinarily exercise jurisdiction over the child, save in so far as it is necessary for the court to order the return of the child to the country of the child's...ordinary residence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.568.2/8">Article 7 requires that</p>
	<p pid="b.568.2/9" class="indent">&quot;the respective governments of the UK and Pakistan give urgent consideration to identifying or establishing an administrative service to facilitate or oversee the resolution of child abduction cases&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.568.2/10">That is an important point, to which I shall return later.</p>
	<p pid="b.568.2/11">In reply to a written question that I tabled, the Minister wrote:</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-12-13b.569.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="569"  time="017:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071213/debtext/71213-0020.htm#07121361000166">
	<p pid="b.569.0/1">The family was due to return to the UK on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-26">26 April</phrase>, having confirmed return airline tickets. Just before the return flight, Asma's father claimed that he was not well, and the visit was extended by 15 days, by agreement. Her husband then tried to extend the visit further. Asma refused, as she wanted to get the three oldest children back to school. She was also studying for an Open university degree, which she was due to complete this summer.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/2">Asma then asked her husband to return her passport and her children's so that she could return to the UK. He refused, saying that neither she nor the children would be allowed to return to the UK. Asma then escaped from her brother-in-law's house in Rawalpindi, where she was being held, and sought the assistance of the British high commission in Islamabad.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/3">The high commission organised a meeting between the two parties at the high commission on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May</phrase>. At the meeting, Zahoor agreed that the whole family would return to the UK to settle the question of the children's custody. Flights were booked for <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-26">26 May</phrase> and, in the meantime, Asma and the children were to stay at a women's hostel.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/4">Before the meeting at the high commission, Zahoor was asked to bring the passports to the high commission. He did not do so. He said he would bring them to the high commission on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-25">Friday 25 May</phrase>. He did not do that either, and nor did he answer calls from high commission staff. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-25">Tuesday 25 May</phrase>, the high commission found out that Zahoor had applied for court orders preventing his wife from taking the children out of Pakistan. Asma's mother Nasreen then approached me and asked for my assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/5">Having got confirmation from the high commission about what had happened, I advised Asma to return to the UK to commence court proceedings here. That is what she did, with her mother flying to Pakistan to help look after the children. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-09">9 July</phrase>, a court order was granted by Mrs. Justice Hogg that made the children wards of court. It stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/6" class="indent">&quot;said wards be brought to the jurisdiction of England and Wales no later than 27th July&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/7">and it also invoked</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/8" class="indent">&quot;the Protocol made on 17th January 2003...so that all judicial, administrative and law enforcement authorities of...Pakistan help in locating, safeguarding and facilitating the return to England and Wales&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/9">of the children.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/10">The court order was conveyed to the judge in Pakistan by Asma's solicitors. Further court orders were laid before the High Court on 27 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-30">30 July</phrase>, 14, 20 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-26">26 August</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-14">14 September</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-11">11 October</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November</phrase>. However, none of them received a response from the husband.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/11">Since then, Asma has been forced to remain in Pakistan because she is not prepared to abandon the children. Despite numerous requests, the High Court in Pakistan has refused to respond to the invocation of the protocol, regarding it as a non-binding &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot;. Although the courts in Pakistan have granted Asma custody, and even though Zahoor has to pay maintenance there, they have refused to lift the exit control orders.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/12">Asma is a young woman in a foreign country, with no available family support. I have had experience of dealing with many families of Pakistani origin, and I know that that is highly unusual. She is very much on her own. Zahoor and his family have made death threats against her, as the following extract from a letter to the British high commissioner, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-24">24 August</phrase>, shows.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/13">She said:</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/14" class="indent">&quot;I am a woman fighting for the right of my children without any financial or emotional support...I am deeply concerned for the psychological trauma that has been inflicted upon my children...I have received numerous threats from my husband and his family. I have been told I will not leave Pakistan alive and that he will take my children from me.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/15">She is very much a woman alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/16">I make no criticism of the support provided by the high commission. Asma was helped to get a place at the hospital and to find a solicitor. I realise that the commission deals with many similar cases and the staff are overworked; nevertheless Asma and her children have been stranded in Pakistan for seven months.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/17">What can the Minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office do? The High Court order of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-30">30 July</phrase> is particularly important in that context. It requests:</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/18" class="indent">&quot;The UK Passport Agency and the Consulate in Islamabad do communicate in order to reissue passports for the wards...for the purpose of their re-entry into England and Wales.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/19">The UK Passport Service has not responded to the substance of the order made by Mr. Justice Moylan. However, yesterday I met Mr. Justice Ryder, who today issued an order asking the service to respond to that request.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/20">Since August, I have been asking the high commission to issue new passports. Once that has been done, Asma will have a powerful bargaining tool to challenge the exit control orders. I have discussed the case with the Pakistan high commissioner and deputy high commissioner. In an e-mail to me of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-07">7 November</phrase>, the deputy high commissioner confirmed:</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/21" class="indent">&quot;Their current British passports are with their father who refuses to give them back. Can you kindly press the High Commission in Islamabad to issue passports.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/22">The Minister will be aware of the strained relations between the courts and Government of Pakistan. It is clear to me that the Pakistan Government can be persuaded to allow Asma and the children to return to the UK. If the Minister agrees to issue the passports, it will put pressure on the Pakistan High Court to respond to the protocol, and send a clear signal that the UK Government are backing Asma in her fight to get her children back to the UK. If the Minister is prepared to do that, I will travel to Pakistan to negotiate their safe return. Can he think of a better Christmas or Eid present for Asma and her family?</p>
	<p pid="b.569.0/23">For the long term, the Government should begin talks with the Pakistan Government, as envisaged by article 7 of the protocol. Agreed administrative machinery could remove the frustrations and distress caused by the delaying tactics used in this case. The protocol was an important first step forward by the courts&mdash;an imaginative response from Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss. We need the Government to put some teeth into the protocol, and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

	<p pid="b.571.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> for securing a debate on the UK-Pakistan protocol on children's matters, and in particular on the case of Asma Akhtar. We are very much aware of Mrs Akhtar's circumstances and I welcome the opportunity to set out clearly the position of Her Majesty's Government in relation to that case. I thank the hon. Gentleman for so clearly setting out the difficulty and complexity of the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/2">As the hon. Gentleman told us, international parental child abduction is not a new issue, nor, unfortunately, is it uncommon. As more people live and work overseas, so there will be more families with parents from different countries. Sometimes relationships break down and decisions have to be taken over where a child will live. In some cases, parents cannot agree and one parent decides to move the child to another country without the permission of the other. In this case, there are four children, and the circumstances are pretty exceptional.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/3">Where parents cannot agree, and cannot reach a mediated solution, custody is a matter for the courts. However, it is a serious and distressing issue, particularly when there is an international dimension. We cannot interfere, or take sides, but the Government are committed to helping where we can. I am glad that the hon. Gentleman has spoken about the matter with Mr. Justice Ryder of the family division of the High Court. It is important that the hon. Gentleman gets guidance from Mr. Justice Ryder.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/4">To provide a focal point for our work, in 2003 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office set up a dedicated child abduction section within the consular directorate. The section provides advice and support to parents affected by child abduction. For many years, countries have looked for ways to resolve disputes in the best interests of the children. The 1980 Hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction is an international convention under which legal procedures are agreed between a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, to assist in the return of a child who has been abducted.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/5">The hon. Gentleman did not have time to remind us, but The Hague convention does not work for all countries. For example, there are aspects of Islamic or sharia law, as practised in some countries, that can conflict with the principles of the convention. The convention argues that the country of habitual residence should be the deciding factor in determining where custody issues should be resolved. As he reminded us, the children are British. They were taken to Pakistan on holiday and they and their mother now find themselves more or less incarcerated in the country. Sharia law does not always support the notions enshrined in The Hague convention and so in many countries it can be very difficult for parents to have their children returned to their normal place of residence.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/6">Pakistan is such a country. It is also the country to which most abducted British children are taken by a parent&mdash;accounting for almost a fifth of our total case records. The United Kingdom-Pakistan protocol, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, was signed in 2003 following an initiative by Dame Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, who was then president of the family division of the royal courts of justice, and senior judges. The aim was to provide a mechanism for communication between judiciaries to handle better child abduction cases between our two countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/7">The judicial initiative reflected the fact that although Pakistan, a country practising Islamic sharia family law, was unlikely in the near future to sign The Hague convention of 1980 on international child abduction, our countries shared many legal principles. They shared a desire to see child abduction cases handled in the best interests of the children. The protocol is a judicial consensus and, as the hon. Gentleman said, is not legally binding. However, in legal systems that draw heavily on precedent, it was clear that further establishing the principle of habitual residence as a strong assumption in child abduction cases would be very helpful. Judicial co-operation on this level is also important in trying to foster international co-operation between judiciaries.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/8">The protocol aims to secure the return of abducted children to the country where they normally live, without regard to the nationality, culture or religion of the parents, so that matters of custody and access can be resolved by the courts there. The protocol, which Her Majesty's Government fully support, has made a difference. According to the most recent records, 84 cases have been handled under the protocol. Of these, a total of 49 involved actual abduction or wrongful retention of a child by a parent. Some 22 cases resulted in returns from Pakistan to the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/9">As well as offering the advice and support provided by the child abduction section in London, our consular staff based overseas are committed to supporting British nationals. That includes giving all the support that we properly can to those who have had their children abducted overseas, or are involved in custody disputes. We provide a list of overseas lawyers who speak English, conduct welfare checks on children&mdash;provided, of course, that the other parent agrees&mdash;offer travel information, and help with finding accommodation locally. Where appropriate, we contact the courts overseas to express our interest in a case and ask about progress. In exceptional circumstances we also attend court hearings. However, we can only operate within the confines of the law and cannot interfere in foreign court proceedings, just as other countries cannot interfere in our judicial system.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/10">The hon. Gentleman spoke about the case of Mrs. Akhtar and her four children, all of whom are in Pakistan. Our consular staff at the British high commission in Islamabad became aware of the case when Mrs. Akhtar's family in the UK contacted the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Consular staff have been in regular, frequent contact with Mrs. Akhtar since <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-01">1 May 2007</phrase> to offer and provide advice and assistance. That has included accompanying Mrs. Akhtar during a court hearing. Consular officials in London have also been in contact with Mrs. Akhtar's family in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/11">Mrs. Akhtar has asked us to issue new passports for her children, because her husband has effectively taken the passports away, and refuses to give them back to the children. We have not issued new passports because Mrs. Akhtar has started court proceedings in Pakistan under the protocol, seeking the return of the children to the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the protocol, we must await the outcome of the proceedings before issuing passports. Of course, as the hon. Gentleman told us, a lot of time has passed. The poor woman finds herself in dire straits, with her four children in Pakistan. It is important that decisions on travel are made by the appropriate courts of law and that we do not issue passports before a decision is taken; that is the normal situation. To do so could be seen as pre-empting court decisions, or assisting one parent to move the children before the courts have reached a decision on travel. Furthermore, a court order forbids the removal of the children from the jurisdiction of Pakistan without permission from the Pakistani court.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/12">We appreciate the family's frustration about the lack of progress in the case; the hon. Gentleman told us very clearly about that. I stress again that the British Government cannot interfere in the judicial systems of other countries, but I am not sure that that is what the hon. Gentleman is asking us to do; I think that he is asking us to do something rather different. We can and will express our concerns to the Pakistani judiciary at the highest levels at the lack of progress in the resolution of such cases, making reference to the undertaking signed by the judiciary in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/13">The British high commissioner in Islamabad is aware of the issues, and this week spoke to the protocol liaison judge, Justice Khokhar, a member of the Supreme Court. The high commissioner did not discuss individual cases, but expressed our concern that cases in Pakistan are not being resolved quickly in the best interests of the children. Justice Khokar promised to look into the matter with the district courts, and was concerned that cases were not being handled expeditiously.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/14">The protocol works in many cases, and we would much prefer to have it place than not, but there are cases where the protocol has not immediately been seen to help, and the case in question is just such a case. We have raised our concerns, but it remains a matter for the courts in Pakistan to decide. We hope that the conference that we plan to hold in Pakistan next year, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, will be a real opportunity to examine the functioning of the protocol and to look for practical improvements, but that is months away, and the hon. Gentleman clearly described the dilemma that faces Mrs. Akhtar and her family, who are in the UK, in the hon. Gentleman's constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/15">We have discussed whether giving replacement passports or adequate travel documents for the children to Mrs. Akhtar would help in resolving the case more quickly. I understand that there have been discussions with the Pakistani deputy high commissioner and the hon. Gentleman. The deputy high commissioner confirmed that he had passed on to the hon. Gentleman advice that he had received from Mrs. Akhtar's lawyer, and that if the passports were handed on, it would not jeopardise the case and might even help it.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/16">The family court in Rawalpindi has awarded temporary custody of the children to Mrs. Akhtar. It stipulated that the children must not be taken out of the country without the permission of the court. We will be happy to give a letter to the mother, Mrs. Akhtar, saying that once the court gives permission for the children to leave Pakistan, we will issue the passports immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/17">However, I know that the hon. Gentleman feels that there is another way of dealing with the matter. As we heard, he offered to travel to Pakistan if he believed that that would help and after he had discussed the matter with the various authorities, to try to move this distressing case forward. I want to ensure that he will have access to the appropriate officials so that the implications of his plan can be examined properly. I know that he feels that the welfare of Asma and her children count most. We share that view deeply. We will attempt to help the hon. Gentleman in whatever way we can. I am not giving him an undertaking that his plan can be agreed by the Foreign Office, but we will look at it closely and sympathetically.</p>
