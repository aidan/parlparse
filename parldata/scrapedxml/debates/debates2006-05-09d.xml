	<p pid="d.158.5/1">I find myself in complete agreement with my right hon. Friend, who has real economic expertise given his role on the Treasury Committee. We should bear in mind that the survey to which he referred was not an isolated one, but that it reflects the strength and confidence of the Scottish economy in the eighth year of a Labour Government. For reference, I quote comments made about the recently published CBI Scotland industrial trends survey. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-25">25 April</phrase>, Iain McMillan, the director of CBI Scotland, stated:</p>
	<p pid="d.158.5/2" class="indent">&quot;This is a sparkling set of results, with Scottish manufacturers doing better than expected and even outperforming the rest of the United Kingdom.&quot;</p>

Friend is aware that when Sir Henry Hodge gave evidence to the Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March</phrase>, he said that the number of unprocessed appeals had gone up from 22,000 to 82,000 when 60,000 files were found because the cupboards had been cleared out. He blamed the entry clearance officers and the Home Office, but they hold the Department for Constitutional Affairs responsible because they say that the cases were sent over in December, but left unopened in bags in the Department. The delay for our constituents is intolerable. Who is responsible for this appalling lack of co-ordination?</p>

	<p pid="d.171.1/1">On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. As you will know, the Identity Cards Act 2006 received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-30">30 March</phrase> this year. The Government described it as one of their &quot;flagship Bills&quot;, which was designed to protect us from and to deter all manner of crimes, such as terrorism, benefit fraud, identity fraud, breaches of immigration law and other serious crime. Now is not the time to rehearse the arguments that I deployed against that piece of legislation in the time permitted to us by the Government since last June. Have you, Mr. Speaker, received a request not from the old Home Secretary, but from the new Home Secretary to make a statement to the House explaining the Government's incompetence in repealing by means of the Identity Cards Act 2006 section 5 of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, under which it was an offence punishable by up to 10 years' imprisonment to possess with intent to deceive forged passports and other travel documents, money orders, postal orders, postage stamps, Inland Revenue stamps, share certificates, cheques, travellers cheques, bankers drafts, debit and credit cards and certified copies of entries in certain registers such as those for births, deaths and marriages? Does that chaos not demonstrate, Mr. Speaker, that the Government are utterly out of control&mdash;</p>

You have always been very good at defending the rights of this House to ensure that statements by Ministers are made first to this House, not to the media in advance of the House being informed. I have been given a written answer by the former Leader of the House, now the Minister for Europe, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" name="Geoff Hoon">the right hon.

	<p pid="d.173.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to reclassify methylamphetamine as a category A drug.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/3">This is yet another sad tale of a failing Home Office. This time, it is failing to protect people from the misuse of crystal meth, which is seriously bad news for individuals who use it and for society at large.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/4">The widely respected New York police chief, Anthony Izzo, told the Select Committee on Science and Technology:</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Crystal meth makes crack cocaine look like a Hershey Bar.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/6">He bases his view on hard evidence and experience. UK Sky TV news coverage showed the drug's impact on individuals and called for Government action before use of this nasty drug becomes endemic. But the Home Office says that it is not yet very prevalent in the UK and that, in effect, they will reclassify when a greater number of people have been damaged and communities are suffering more serious consequences. That is hardly the precautionary approach that the public deserve. It is hardly the action of a Government who care about their young people or want to minimise the impact of drug abuse on society.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/7">Methylamphetamine is one of a group of psychostimulant drugs called amphetamines that act on the brain and nervous system. It is produced in tablet, powder or crystalline form. It is taken orally, snorted or injected, but unlike amphetamine, it can be smoked.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/8">The term &quot;crystal meth&quot; is often used for the purer crystalline form. The drug's street names include &quot;yaba&quot; for tablet form, &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;glass&quot;, &quot;Tina&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot; and &quot;Nazi crank&quot;. It was first developed in 1919 and used by troops to keep awake. It was rumoured that Hitler injected it twice a day, hence the name &quot;Nazi crank&quot;. The chances of getting hooked are incredible compared with other illicit drugs. Psychological and physical dependence happens quickly. It affects the brain reward pathways. Users must take more to achieve the same effects, as tolerance quickly builds up. Using the drug by intravenous injection or smoking is especially likely to cause addiction. Smoking the purer, crystalline form produces an intense rush, similar to that of crack cocaine, but much longer lasting&mdash;not only minutes but four to 12 hours. That is highly reinforcing and becomes highly addictive. The higher potency, especially when smoked, makes the drug a greater threat. It is, all too often, a one-drag-and-you're-hooked drug.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/9">The drug's effects are appalling. They include agitation, paranoia, confusion and violence, usually against innocent bystanders. It damages more than those who take it. It can bring on feelings of exhilaration and produces increased arousal and activity levels. It causes a rapid rise in heart rate and blood pressure, and the higher the dose, the greater the effects.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/10">The risks are enormous. Methylamphetamine-induced psychosis has been widely reported in countries where use has become endemic. High dosages lead to strokes and pulmonary, renal and gastrointestinal disorders. Coma and death can and do follow. It is a much more serious drug than the class A ecstasy that killed Leah Betts in Essex a decade ago. Yet the Government appear to have learned nothing from that tragic wake-up call.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/11">Methylamphetamine is often injected, with sharing of paraphernalia and all the consequences of infection. The drug also increases libido and risky sexual behaviour, thereby increasing blood-borne virus transmission. Home Office research shows that the drug is especially used by the homosexual community. It is disastrous for that group to reduce sexual inhibitions or undertake ever more risky behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/12">Methylamphetamine is currently a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. That historical classification results from the drug's chemical association with amphetamines, which were all classified B. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which reports to and advises the Government on the classification of drugs, is as dysfunctional as the Home Office. It meets just twice a year with a quorum of only seven, but comprises 38 people, some of whom are caring, knowledgeable, professional and sensible. However, too many represent a neo-liberal, politically correct rag-bag, who appear to make decisions without excessive reference to the evidence and the consequences.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/13">James Randerson, science correspondent for <i> The Guardian</i>, reported on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-24">24 April</phrase> that Professor Rawlins, chairman of ACMD</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/14" class="indent">&quot;blew the gaff on government claims that its drug policy is 'evidence based'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/15">The classification for illegal drugs is riddled with anomalies and simply does not work. That is echoed by the Science and Technology Committee's research, which found:</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/16" class="indent">&quot;Drugs are not classified on the basis of... the harm they cause.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/17">Indeed, they are not classified according to any consistent set of criteria. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase>, <i> The Times</i> home correspondent, Richard Ford, ran the headline:</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/18" class="indent">&quot;Lax laws 'could turn Nazi crank into global epidemic'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/19">The article stated:</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/20" class="indent">&quot;A new highly addictive drug used in Britain by clubbers and gay men is becoming a global problem, according to a United Nations report.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/21" class="indent">The huge increase in crystal meth is helped by lax restrictions on the chemicals used to manufacture it. People who take it can experience a ten-hour high and increased sexual arousal.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/22" class="indent">Professor Hamid Ghodse, president of the United Nations' drug control agency, said:</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/23" class="indent">'If I want to pick on one major drug problem pandemic today, it is methamphetamine'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/24">Yet, last year, the ACMD recommended that it remained a class B drug.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/25">Professor Nutt, a distinguished psychopharmacologist and chairman of the ACMD's technical committee, told the Science and Technology Committee that upping the classification could have the perverse effect of making the drug more desirable and thus stimulate demand. He argued that downgrading mushrooms might stimulate demand and that upgrading crystal meth would have the same effect. That is perverse and muddled thinking. I sometimes wonder whether the ACMD is personally testing the products when making decisions.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/26">A shift up the scale could well give a drug more kudos, as Professor Nutt suggests. However, that undermines one of the key tenets of the United Kingdom's drug laws, which is that the more dangerous drugs should be placed in higher, not lower, categories because of the greater risks attached to them. The ACMD seems totally unimpressed by the principles of UK law, by international experience, or by the evidence base.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/27">Methylamphetamine can be produced in small domestic laboratories from non-controlled precursors. I will not go into details about those precursors today, as it would not be helpful. I have asked the Home Secretary to control those precursors, but he has not done so. The ACMD recommended close monitoring of the drug's use, but this is difficult because the extent of the drug's use in Britain is, in the words of the president of the UN narcotics control board,</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/28" class="indent">&quot;hidden because seizures were included in figures for amphetamines&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/29">The Home Office confirmed that, stating:</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/30" class="indent">&quot;The British Crime Survey does not differentiate between methylamphetamine use and amphetamines&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.173.1/31">I respectfully maintain that the Government are failing to control the drug's precursors and not effectively monitoring its usage. That is unsustainable. The Home Secretary said that he would publish a consultation paper on a review of the drug classification system. He has not yet done so, although he promised this on, I think, <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-19">19 January</phrase> this year. So I call on the new Home Secretary to bring forward that review urgently, and to change the drug classification system to a more consistent and rational one. The Government should take a precautionary approach and immediately reclassify methylamphetamine as a class A drug, so that we can save individuals and society from its terrible consequences.</p>

	<p pid="d.184.3/1">Yes. If hospitals were genuinely free and given the opportunity to behave in a businesslike way, they would be able to make different arrangements for their financing needs. Indeed, some PCTs are doing just that; things are getting so desperate in the NHS that a PCT in my constituency has borrowed &pound;2.5 million from the local authority. However, I must make progress because we have only reached the new year.</p>
	<p pid="d.184.3/2">In January, the Secretary of State's operating framework for 2006-07 said that new guidance on PFI would be published, with the effect of cutting the PFI programme by a third. The guidance never appeared and it is reported that it has gone into limbo, and nobody with a PFI project in prospect knows what will happen. The same document stated that in this financial year</p>
	<p pid="d.184.3/3" class="indent">&quot;for the system as a whole we expect to recover any overspend from 2005/6 and we are planning for a surplus.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.184.3/4">It said that individual NHS bodies should plan both to achieve in-year balance and recover 2005-06 deficits.</p>
	<p pid="d.184.3/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-12">12 April</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Health sent me a letter in response to my inquiries. She said that the objective has changed:</p>
	<p pid="d.184.3/6" class="indent">&quot;All organisations are overspending to show improvement during 2006-7, and by the end of the year everyone should have monthly income covering monthly expenditure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.184.3/7">What kind of financial balance is that? It happens to coincide with the 12th month of the financial year. The Government's policy has completely changed. They did not tell the House about it; it emerged from a letter written to me. The policy is no longer to achieve financial balance in 2006-07&mdash;it may not even be to do so in 2007-08. We simply do not know what is the Government's policy to restore NHS finances.</p>

	<p pid="d.185.3/1">I recall visiting the Fraser Day hospital. For a growing city, with a capacity-constrained hospital, the importance of the intermediate care facilities in the community or the support that could be given to patients who are discharged is terribly important. The Secretary of State is always talking about preventing readmission to hospital and reducing the length of bed stay. That cannot happen while the services that my hon. Friend describes are being shut down. It is a disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="d.185.3/2">By February, things had got worse. The home oxygen service collapsed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February</phrase>: the first day of the new contract&mdash;of course, helpfully scheduled for the middle of the flu season. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-06">6 February</phrase>, the latest figures on MRSA showed no further progress. On Valentine's day, the Secretary of State plumbed new depths when she told the &quot;Today&quot; programme that she would vote to exempt clubs from a smoking ban but did the opposite in the afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="d.186.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-22">22 February</phrase>, the Department withdrew the NHS tariff on the basis that it had underlying errors. Hon. Members might wonder what sort of underlying technical errors they might be. They were really complicated things: the Department was supposed to take &pound;140 million from patient transport, but it only took &pound;140. Things like that happened. So the NHS did not get its tariff until 10 working days before the start of the new financial year.</p>
	<p pid="d.186.1/3">It became clear in February and March, too, that the Government's legislative programme had collapsed. The new Leader of the House is here, and I welcome him to his post. I am sure that he will be interested to know that the Department of Health was given the benefit of three measures in this legislative programme, but the policy on the Health Bill collapsed and the Government had to do a U-turn, the NHS Redress Bill has been radically changed in the Lords from the Government's original proposals and the draft Mental Health Bill has been abandoned. We simply do not know when the Government's new and, I hope, better proposals will arrive.</p>
	<p pid="d.186.1/4">In March, the trauma got worse. Deficits turned to disasters. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March</phrase>, Sir Nigel Crisp resigned. The chief executive took responsibility for the problems of the previous months&mdash;what a pity Ministers did not.</p>

	<p pid="d.186.3/1">The hon. Gentleman does not yet know how many hospital trusts had deficits last year. Certainly, more PCTs had deficits last year than the year before. It might be true that more hospitals had deficits last year than the year before, and more might do so this year. As I made clear earlier, we have gone from six to seven to 12 to 21 strategic health authorities that, in the total health economy, have a deficit. We are not talking about an isolated instance. If those deficits were being disguised in the past by brokerage from surpluses elsewhere, there would not now be a system-wide deficit&mdash;there would still be surpluses to offset the deficits. The point is that very few such surpluses are being created to mask such deficits. The Government will have to create surpluses by the expedient of cutting money from primary care trusts, which will cause a great number of problems in the hon. Gentleman's constituency.</p>
	<p pid="d.186.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-22">22 March</phrase>, the Chancellor's Budget ignored the NHS. There were job losses at the Royal Free hospital and the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, and many other hospitals followed. The total list of job losses to date is more than 13,000&mdash;it is 13,700. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-30">30 March</phrase>, the <i> Health Service Journal </i>disclosed that central Department of Health budgets are overcommitted because Ministers have been making commitments without understanding the financial consequences. Delays on programmes such as the bowel cancer screening programme are the result.</p>
	<p pid="d.186.3/3">In April, there was the issue of dentistry. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase>, there was the new contract&mdash;a shambles, as it was called by the British Dental Association. Some 10 per cent. of dentists have left the NHS and 1 million fewer patients have NHS dentists. Patients who do have NHS dentists are paying a third more in total for the cost of their NHS dentistry as a consequence.</p>

	<p pid="d.187.3/1">The question of whether the Secretary of State acted wisely or even reasonably in relation to that matter will be tested soon. We will come back to that question in due course.</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/2">I am afraid that we arrived at the point in April when the latest statistics added insult to injury for NHS staff. The work force census showed that the number of managers had doubled since 1997. In the last year for which the figures were gathered, the number of administrators went up by 11,000&mdash;while the number of nurses went up by 6,000. That is in the teeth of all the Government's claims to want to cut the bureaucracy of the NHS. That is not happening at all. On the basis of all that, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-23">23 April</phrase>, the Secretary of State called it &quot;the best year ever&quot;. I never want to be around when she thinks that things are going wrong.</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/3">The Prime Minister has retained the services of the Secretary of State at the Department of Health, apparently to push forward NHS reforms. If the Prime Minister believes that, he is living in the parallel universe that the Secretary of State inhabits. Conservative Members believe that reform is essential, but that even more so is leadership and competence. The Government's combination of arrogance and incompetence is a recipe for disaster.</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/4">Every aspect of desirable reform is being undermined by the actions of Health Ministers. Patients should have choice, but PCTs, through referral management centres, are controlling and subverting choice. Patients need a voice, but after scrapping community health councils, the Government are going to abandon patients forums and have no idea what to put in their place. GPs need real GP budgets, but the Government's plans do not offer them the incentives to reinvest their savings or give them the power to negotiate contracts with providers. The Government talk about local decision making, but that is being abandoned because the SHAs are top-slicing PCT budgets and controlling the growth money for the NHS for this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/5">Progress towards foundation hospitals is being delayed and their freedoms are still severely limited. National standards need to be set through the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, but the guidelines are not being implemented and the postcode lottery goes on. The independent and voluntary sectors have no clarity on their future involvement in the NHS. The second wave contracts are being scaled back, and the wave 1 contracts cost 11.2 per cent. more than the NHS price. As independent sector treatment centres are guaranteed payments whether or not they do the work, they are bringing the system of independent contracting into disrepute.</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/6">One cannot talk, as the Prime Minister does, about a patient-focused service that is locally delivered when at the same time the NHS is controlled by an overbearing bureaucracy and politically dictated targets. The team at the Department of Health knows neither what NHS reforms are actually needed, nor how to deliver them. No one in the NHS can say what the destination of reform is. Who will be commissioning services in the future? Will PCTs be both commissioning and providing services? Who will set the tariff? How will financial control be enforced? Will the independent sector have a long-term commitment and the opportunity to supply services to the NHS? What happens to failing hospitals? The team does not know, and the Government will not give, or simply do not know, the answer to any of those questions.</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/7">The time has come for a turnaround and a new team at the Department of Health. Ministers should be removed from their interference in the NHS. If we cannot immediately get a new Government, let us at least have a team brought in that is empowered to deliver NHS reform and the long-term stability that the NHS so badly needs. Such reform should reflect the principles of equity, choice, competition and independence for which we have argued.</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/8">Most of all, the NHS needs leadership. Professor Halligan, who was deputy chief medical officer of the Department of Health until last year, said that the NHS has</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/9" class="indent">&quot;a leadership void, which has caused it to lose its way&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/10">He describes the service as &quot;rudderless&quot;. Tellingly, he adds that it is</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/11" class="indent">&quot;extraordinary, the gap between highly motivated frontline staff and the systematic dysfunctionality in which they operate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/12">At the risk of using an unparliamentary expression, the situation is what the <i> Health Service Journal </i>describes as a &quot;total cock-up&quot;. Only days ago, the outgoing director of human resources at the Department of Health, Andrew Foster, who is one of the most senior NHS officials, said:</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/13" class="indent">&quot;It's been almost tangible over the last 15 months, the growing sense of dislocation between the NHS and the Department of Health and a growing lack of confidence in the leadership of the Department&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.187.3/14">Even those working most closely with the Secretary of State express their lack of confidence. NHS staff did so in loud and clear terms. We have no confidence in her stewardship of the Department. It is time for a turnaround. It is time for Conservative policies and, frankly, it ought to be time for a Conservative Government who are committed to a NHS that is energised and equipped to deliver. It is time for change, and I commend the motion to the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.193.0/1">In an Adjournment debate on the Floor of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-25">25 April</phrase>, the then Under-Secretary of State for Health, now the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety told me that he would need to &quot;consider what action to take&quot; in response to the threatened closure that I highlighted of the Nuffield speech and language unit, a centre of excellence for 35 years, providing for children with some of the most severe speech and language disorders. Can the right hon. Lady, free of party politics, tell the House what she will do to safeguard that vital national resource? If it is lost, it will not come back.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-09d.231.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1725" speakername="Desmond Swayne" colnum="231"  time="019:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/debtext/60509-0013.htm#06050987000263">
	<p pid="d.231.0/1">I remain absolutely convinced that my constituents are fortunate indeed to live where they do and to be served by the national health service, and I make no apology for that. Labour Members who have implied that there is no common ground between us and that some of us are not committed to the NHS do themselves, and us, no justice whatsoever.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/2">I caution Labour Members who have quoted reams of statistics at us with the intention of giving the impression that things are much better than they appear. I recall listening to &quot;Yesterday in Parliament&quot; during the late 1970s and mid-1980s, when Mrs. Thatcher was challenged week after week on the state of the NHS. She always answered robustly from the Dispatch Box with reams of statistics saying how many more operations had been carried out and so on. Even in those years, despite the myths that may be spun, the NHS was improving. Nevertheless, it did not work, because it did not match up to the ordinary people's perceptions based on their experiences. That is the problem that my constituents are having at the moment. Their perceptions of what is happening in the NHS are informed by the difficulty, or otherwise, that they face in seeing their doctor or dentist.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/3">I should like to give hon. Members an impression of what it is like in my part of the world. We have a vastly expanding population. As the Deputy Prime Minister's rules, particularly on density, begin to bite in urban centres such as New Milton, and townscapes are changed for ever as family houses are pulled down and replaced with blocks of flats, the population is expanding fast. Yet only one GP practice south of the A337 is still taking on new patients. That outgrew its existing premises some time ago and is short of space, whatever measure one chooses to use, and sometimes the cramped conditions in the waiting room are unacceptable. A few years ago the practice secured the primary care trust's permission in principle to expand its premises, but before it could do so, a directive from the Department of Health instructed that that was not to happen because the funds were to be allocated not to the primary care trust but to Hampshire as a whole. Hampshire's priorities are different; they apparently lie in Portsmouth. There is now not the remotest chance of that practice, or any practice in my constituency, being able to expand its premises.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/4">My constituents write to me in droves complaining that they can make an appointment with their GP only on the same day. It does not suit most people to have to spend hours ringing the surgery in the morning, only to find it engaged, when they would like to organise their lives so as to see the doctor at a time convenient to them, as they used to in the past. They feel that the situation is not as good as it was before. That is entirely a consequence of the targets to which general practitioners have been subjected.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/5">During the election campaign, on the &quot;Question Time&quot; interview, the Prime Minister was confronted with that problem, appeared greatly surprised, and said that he was going to do something about it. I have not noticed any result. I have written to the Secretary of State saying, &quot;Please find enclosed a copy of a letter from my constituent complaining about X, Y or Z. I remember the Prime Minister saying he was going to do something about it&mdash;what has happened?&quot; The answer is, &quot;You can rest assured that patient satisfaction will be one of the measures on which general practitioners will be remunerated in future.&quot; That does not deal with the perceived deterioration that my constituents experience in booking an appointment.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/6">Let us examine the possibility of booking an appointment with one's dentist. A couple of years ago the situation deteriorated. It got so bad that constituents of mine who were lucky enough to have an NHS dentist were receiving letters telling them that there were not going to be any more NHS dentists, but they were welcome to stay on as private patients if they wished. When I raised that at Prime Minister's Question Time, the Deputy Prime Minister, who was answering on that occasion, said :</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/7" class="indent">&quot;I am well aware of the problem that the hon. Gentleman mentions because I have experienced it. My dentist declared that he was going private and I declared that I could not stay with him. Many of our constituents have faced this problem. As the hon. Gentleman said, each one of us has been confronted with it.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-09">9 June 2004</phrase>; Vol. 422, c. 270.]</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/8">That does not actually address the problem. He went on to tell me that it was all the Tories' fault for having closed down the dental schools. A decision by the university grants funding body more than 10 years ago is not germane to our problem now. The problem is that NHS dentists are leaving the NHS. It is not a question of a shortage of dentists but of how they are employed.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/9">The problem got worse. Several constituents wrote to me complaining that they had received a letter from their dentist saying that he was no longer going to be an NHS dentist but would nevertheless continue to treat their children under the NHS as long as they, the parents, remained as private patients with the practice. They did not like being held hostage in that way, but felt fortunate at least to have their children still being treated as NHS patients. The Secretary of State acted to right that perceived wrong. Instructions were issued to primary care trusts whereby they were empowered to prevent dentists from maintaining children-only NHS lists. So in the past few months, parents in my constituency, particularly vulnerable families, have been receiving letters from those self-same dentists saying, in effect, &quot;You will recall my letter of such and such when I undertook to keep your children on as long as you remained as a registered private patient at the practice&mdash;well, sorry, that deal is off and your children will either have to find another dentist or stay with me and pay.&quot; That is a very worrying letter for the many families with children who have orthodontic requirements and all sorts of work to be done.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/10">As a consequence of the Government's policy, it is much more difficult to secure NHS dental treatment. However, my constituents have been told that the seventh cavalry is on the way, and that some 12,500 new dental registrations will be available to the good people of New Milton. To take advantage of those as yet virtual dental registrations, a new model is to be used to avoid the inconvenience&mdash;and, of course, the attendant unpleasant publicity&mdash;of long queues forming and being photographed.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/11">The people of New Milton have been invited to telephone a number to secure their dental registration. I have a letter from a constituent who tried that. The announcement was made in February and he began to make telephone calls. The letter states:</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Since then I and friends have telephoned this number many times only to hear an automated voice saying 'The number you called is busy. To ring back please press five'. Furthermore, if you press five a similar voice tells you 'Sorry, there is a fault please try again'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/13">He writes that he tried the number on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-03">3 April</phrase> from 1.55 pm to 2.25 pm, from 3.30 pm to 3.50 pm and from 4.43 pm to 4.52 pm. He tried again on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-04">4 April</phrase> between 1.45 pm and 2.10 pm, and 4.10 pm and 4.35 pm. Each occasion met with the same result. Let that be a measure of the frustration of ordinary constituents in trying to secure the NHS treatment to which they rightly believe that they are entitled. Those perceptions mean that there is an understandable belief that things have got worse.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/14">We have been told that the position on waiting times has changed; the claim was repeated today. We are told that a magnificent improvement has occurred, but that is not the experience of many of my constituents. At previous Health questions, I asked about audiological waits in my constituency. It has a disproportionate number of elderly people, and thus a disproportionate number suffering from poor hearing, which is one of the most socially isolating experiences. As I said in Health questions, there is a significant danger that many patients will die before they secure the hearing aids that they require.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/15">Strangely, I received a letter about the problem today&mdash;although it is not an amazing coincidence, because I am afraid that I receive such letters almost every day. My constituent's 17-month wait for a hearing test was over in February. His appointment was on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-06">6 February</phrase> and the consultant told him that it would take three months for the hearing aids to be made up. My constituent wrote:</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/16" class="indent">&quot;A reliable person tells me it ought to take... say, a fortnight.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/17">He waited and waited. After a further three months, he rang the hospital to find out what had happened to his hearing aids, only to be told that it would take another six months before they were delivered. That is a measure of ordinary people's experience of the health service. Can we blame them if they believe that it is getting worse?</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/18">We have five community hospitals in New Forest. We launched a massive campaign in the past year to save them because the primary care trust intended to close them. It backed off and said that it no longer planned to close them, but that it would have to work with the community to find a role for them&mdash;exactly the model that the White Paper, which the Secretary of State launched, set out. There was, therefore, progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/19">However, community hospital supporters now experience huge frustration and staff morale is low because nothing has emerged from the process. Whatever is suggested about the role of a specific hospital&mdash;whether in Fordingbridge, which could be a centre for best practice or nursing excellence, or the hospital in Milford on Sea&mdash;the PCT response is that there is a difficulty because it is building a new hospital in Lymington. That is one of the first new hospitals in which the PCT will employ a private supplier to provide the health care. It does not yet know what services will be provided at Lymington, and will not therefore make any commitment about the services that need to be provided in any of the community hospitals. The new hospital in Lymington is due to open in January next year. Is that the way to run a national health service? We are only a few months away from the opening of the new hospital, yet we are told that decisions cannot be made about existing community hospitals because the PCT does not know about the services that it is commissioning at the new one.</p>
	<p pid="d.231.0/20">I understand my constituents' frustration and anger. They say, &quot;Yes, expenditure on the NHS has increased enormously, as have our taxes&mdash;but have we had value for money?&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-05-09d.241.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" speakername="Richard Taylor" colnum="241"  time="019:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060509/debtext/60509-0014.htm#06050987000280">
	<p pid="d.241.2/1">Absolutely. Matron's ward round was seen as an event, and everything had to be just right. I think that some things in the past are worth remembering.</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/2">Another economy could be made. Every week the <i> Health Service Journal</i> provides two, three or four glossy brochures giving details of courses. The cost of a one-day course is &pound;440.63, even for health service employees. That money comes from a health service fund. There are other ways of training people, and I think that the number of people we lose when they go on those terribly expensive courses is distinctly excessive.</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/3">There are many examples of the Department's making a mess of management. Perhaps there are examples of local bad management, but I wonder whether those involved have been given much of a chance. My plea is this: give the NHS a period of stability, stop the reforms for the moment and do not produce any new reforms just yet, and allow the NHS time to get into balance. It is impossible to be in balance within 12 months when some 15 per cent. of the budget must be saved.</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/4">If reconfigurations are necessary, the Government have established a mechanism to make them&mdash;politically, at least&mdash;acceptable: the independent reconfiguration panel. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1717" name="Siobhain McDonagh">The case cited by the hon. Member for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh)</phrase> was not referred to the panel. If it had been, it could have been seen to have been handled without political considerations.</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/5">If I were looking for savings, I would also sack some of the advisers. Prince Charles is often derided and some people do not think much of him, but some Members may recall that extracts from his diary featured in <i> The Times</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-23">23 February</phrase>. One of them referred thus to the Government:</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/6" class="indent">&quot;They then take decisions based on market research and focus groups, on the papers produced by political advisers and civil servants none of whom will have ever experienced what it is they are taking decisions about.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/7">I consider that very significant. I should like us to get rid of a lot of political advisers, and to listen to the professionals, the patients and the public. The Government must ensure that replacements for the patient involvement forums are provided very soon, and that they have teeth and can do something. They are the very people who can help the NHS to be a genuinely patient-led service.</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/8">I will leave the last word to a retired consultant who wrote this to <i> The Independent</i> last Friday:</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/9" class="indent">&quot;The crisis in the NHS appears to worsen, generating the usual knee-jerk response from politicians and the media: 'reform and reorganise'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/10">He went on to list the major problems.</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/11" class="indent">&quot;The first&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/12">he wrote,</p>
	<p pid="d.241.2/13" class="indent">&quot;is a surfeit of reforms and reorganisations. Should health care professionals introduce an untried and untested new treatment in an area of medicine of which they know little, there would be justifiable outrage. Yet ministers do this regularly without any protest other than from the professionals who have to try to cope with the resulting chaos and waste of money.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="d.287.2/1">Anybody looking at the title of this Adjournment debate could be forgiven for anticipating that I am yet another Conservative Member standing up to complain about the Government's closure of an RAF base. That would be very far from the truth. I am delighted to say that the Minister has been giving the utmost support and consideration to my efforts to prevent the closure of the base. He has been able to do that not only because he has safely survived the reshuffle, which I am delighted to see<i> &mdash;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> I am delighted that he is delighted. He has also been able to do it because RAF Hythe is not a British base at all. Since 1967, when General de Gaulle threw NATO bag and baggage out of France in the atmosphere of fraternal French military support to which we have become so accustomed, the base has been a US army facility in my constituency. It masquerades under the title of a Royal Air Force base and deals primarily with water craft, as one would expect given such consistency so far.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/2">What RAF Hythe has done over these years is quite phenomenal. It has developed from what was originally a storage base into an advanced network of shipbuilding maintenance repair and upgrading skills that is second to none in the US armed forces. That has been acknowledged. In order to give the House an idea of what the equipment that is so well looked after by the personnel at RAF Hythe is for, I ask hon. Members to imagine the Mulberry harbours, which, perhaps by coincidence, were also developed, constructed and deployed from the Solent and Southampton Water region. Mulberry harbours were the artificial harbours that enabled a port to be opened on the coastline of occupied France when opposed landings were being made.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/3">That is the work to which RAF Hythe has been essentially committed. It is involved in the preparation of causeways and the maintenance and upgrading of port-opening vessels, floating cranes, and medium-sized and small landing craft. Another particular line of expertise has been the maintenance of fleets of small vessels that were originally deployed on the back of a very large ship based in Diego Garcia, a place that I may mention again later. That large vessel, which was a semi-submersible, would be able to transport the small vessels to anywhere they were needed, flood down, and float them off, and thereby enable a floating point of deployment for the application of military force to a hostile shore.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/4">Over the years, the staff of RAF Hythe, who are, with the exception of two or three American personnel, entirely British, have been called upon to perform many functions, and they have never failed. They wrote the textbooks on the way to dehumidify and preserve water craft and other military assets so that they can be pre-positioned in various theatres around the world. What is more, they developed the techniques and wrote the manual for bringing those dehumidified and otherwise stored assets safely back into service and ready for deployment within a 10-day period. In 2002, it was decided that 30 of those vessels should be pre-positioned to serve the far east theatre at Yokohama north dock in Japan. In 2003-04, a similar pre-positioning of another 30 such vessels was arranged to be carried out in Kuwait naval base. That was in no way to diminish the role of Hythe, which was integral to setting up those two bases and has been essential in carrying out the missions that the bases perform.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/5">At Yokohama north dock, an attempt was made to contract out one of the less skilled functions that the direct US army-employed work force of Hythe had previously performed. It was such a failure both in the quality of the work and the cost that the services of ITT, the contractor company, were dispensed with and Hythe was recommissioned to carry on with the work.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/6">The key document to which I shall refer is an audit, which was carried out early this year and presented on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-13">13 March</phrase> to Major-General Johnson, who is at army field support command at Rock Island, Illinois. That is the next step up in the chain of command from which the facility at Hythe derives its work and instructions. The audit examined four options for continuing the work, which the work force at Hythe, who are directly employed by the US army, has hitherto carried out.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/7">Option 1 was to carry on with Hythe, option 2 was to continue with full and open competition, and options 3 and 4 were to use other agencies that had done similar bits of work, which related to part of the functions that Hythe had hitherto performed either for the Army or the US navy and ascertain whether they could apply. Five criteria applied: technical capability of sustaining the water craft; overall cost of the operation; contract duration; lead time to the award, and resident skills and expertise.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/8">Let me give the assessment of option 1&mdash;Hythe. The audit, by the US army's audit agency, found in favour of Hythe that maintenance costs were projected to be significantly lower through continuing with Hythe than the contracted operation alternatives of options 2, 3 and 4. It found that there was a completely trained work force, total resident knowledge and technical capability, and that Hythe provided maximum flexibility, resident expertise to support exercises and no security problems because all employees are security cleared through their affiliation to the US army.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/9">What was against Hythe? Only two things. The base closure was stated to be already in process, although nothing had been announced and no explanation has ever been given, and Hythe was not funded for the financial year 2007 and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/10">Options 3 and 4 did not come close. It is interesting that one of the arguments against option 2 was:</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/11" class="indent">&quot;Readiness may be impacted if any delays to contract award by <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> FY06&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/12">and that it would be a lower risk if the award date were postponed until <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/13">At the end of the process, a matrix was produced showing the four options and judging them against the five criteria. Hythe was the only one to score a 1&mdash;the top grading&mdash;for technical capability, a 1 for overall cost, and a 1 for resident expertise. The other two criteria, which covered contracts and how long it would take to get the operation up and running, did not apply because Hythe is already up and running. So Hythe had a top score of 3&mdash;the lower the score, the better. Option 2 scored 10.5, option 3 scored 16, and option 4 scored 12.5.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/14">This resulted in the realisation that, whereas it would cost $18.42 million for Hythe to carry on doing what it does, both locally and in running the bases in Japan and Kuwait, that sum would be at least doubled by option 2, to $37.73 million. The cost of closing Hythe&mdash;we assume that the Americans would act in good faith and pay off the pension fund in full&mdash;would have to be added to that $37.73. That would involve another $72.85 million, making a grand total of more than $110 million in the first year, compared with $18.42 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/15">Three additional vessels in Hythe have been separately budgeted for, which would keep the base going until the end of 2007. That would lessen the risk even if option 2 were chosen. When that is taken into account, we need to add another $27 million to the costs that would result from the closure, because the uncompleted boats would have to be towed back across the Atlantic for completion in US dockyards. If they stayed at Hythe, however, and if the work force were allowed to continue to work on them for that extra year, it would cost only an extra $10 million. In other words, this is the economics of the madhouse.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/16">The audit recommended to the commanding general in Rock Island, Illinois, that the closure notice that was under way&mdash;for reasons that have never been explained&mdash;should be rescinded, and that Hythe offered by far the best value for money. We do not know what went on when that audit report was received at the Rock Island base in Illinois. We do know, however, that no explanation has been given, and that no notice of any significance has been given. There seems to be a desperate rush to close the base at Hythe before the end of the American financial year on <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/17">By contrast, other bases that carry out only part of the work&mdash;in Germany and Italy, for example&mdash;are not being closed, even though the base at Germersheim in Germany consistently fails to meet its targets. It carries out work not on the water craft but on flat-bed trailers and mobile military generators, in which Hythe also specialises. A similar function is carried out at a base at Livorno in Italy, which has frequently been beset by labour troubles and strikes.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/18">We wonder whether Hythe is being picked on in this way because the American army authorities feel that it would be easier to divest themselves of their loyal work force in England than to divest themselves of people who are not direct employees of the US Army, and who are protected by all sorts of labour laws in countries on the continent that have shown themselves to be somewhat less reliable to the United States of America when the chips are down than have the people from this base in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/19">In short, we have a facility that is versatile to the extent that when it was invited to send volunteers to Afghanistan, 14 went, and let us remember that they are civilians and do not get medals or other recognition. Incidentally, volunteers were requested from the Rock Island headquarters, and I believe that three were obtained. Out in Afghanistan, the volunteers from Hythe were able to turn their hands to augmenting the armour on armoured vehicles to protect the lives of US service personnel. This is an expert force: as I said, it wrote the manual for the preservation and reactivation techniques of pre-positioned stocks. It is an economical force&mdash;it is half the cost to the US taxpayer compared with the next best option, and that is only the yearly cost, apart from the colossal closure costs to which I have referred. It is a reliable force and has never taken industrial action in well over 30 years of service to the United States of America.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/20">I have little time left, as I am anxious to hear the Minister's reply. I shall therefore mention quickly some of Hythe's commendations. One says:</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/21" class="indent">&quot;Reserve Storage Activity Hythe is official commended for extraordinary meritorious service in support of Operation Desert Storm&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/22">Another says:</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/23" class="indent">&quot;Presented to Reserve Storage Activity, Hythe, for your outstanding support during the Somalia deployment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/24">Another reads:</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/25" class="indent">&quot;Certificate of Appreciation...Presented to Combat Equipment Base-North Atlantic, Hythe, England. In recognition of your outstanding support and contributions to Task Force 143 during the...download of the MV American Cormorant&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/26">That is from Diego Garcia, an important base. We are showing rather more support to the Americans than they might perhaps be said to deserve given the way that they are treating RAF Hythe. On one occasion, RAF Hythe was told:</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/27" class="indent">&quot;Your commitment to excellence directly contributed to improvements in United States Army force projection capabilities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/28">It also received an official commendation:</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/29" class="indent">&quot;Their efforts, long hours and dedication has ensured that the work has been completed in a timely manner and within budget constraints.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/30">Some of the tributes that I have read go back a number of years, but here is one from last Tuesday, from the manager of the watercraft equipment site at the Kuwait naval base:</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/31" class="indent">&quot;Just a note to let you all know that the crew of maintenance personnel I have out here supporting our mission is doing a superb job&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/32">those are the Hythe people out in Kuwait. It continues:</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/33" class="indent">&quot;They are well ahead of our forecasted production schedule, in fact so much so that we feel we can have 7 of the 8 LCUs&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/34">landing craft&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/35" class="indent">&quot;at 10/20, minus the C41SR equipment, by the end of the&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/36">financial year. It continues:</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/37" class="indent">&quot;The skill set mix is right for what we have to accomplish, very little diverting skills to another skill requirement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/38">Reading through the jargon, I think that that means that Hythe is doing a very good job.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/39">I do not have time to quote from the 30 letters that I have from different companies whose ancillary business is worth &pound;4.5 million to the local economies of this country. Those businesses are not just from around Southampton but from areas as far afield as Leicester, Sunderland and Cwmbran.</p>
	<p pid="d.287.2/40">Will the Minister meet the work force, enlist the aid of the Foreign Office and, in particular, make written representations to the American authorities on behalf of the continuation of Hythe? There is no strategic reason for its closure or political justification for closing what amounts to 95 per cent. of the US army's footprint in this country. There is no economic justification, as it is a betrayal of the US taxpayer as much as of our ancillary industries, and there is certainly no moral justification for the closure.</p>
