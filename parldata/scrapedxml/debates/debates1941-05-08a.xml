<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether he is aware that some firms find difficulty in staggering holidays for their workpeople without a loss of production; and whether he will consider that closing for a week's rest may be the best in the long run?</p>

<p>asked the Minister of Labour whether he has considered the complete closing of selected works during successive weeks as an alternative to keeping works going uninterruptedly by allowing a proportion of workers off in successive weeks and so diminishing materially the effective supervision of the work and lowering the proportionate out put; and whether he has any statement to make on the subject?</p>

<p>It is not possible to lay down any rigid rule as to the most advantageous way of arranging the week's holiday. The circumstances of each case must be considered. I am arranging for the area boards to be brought into consultation in the various localities.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that there may be a decrease in production if holidays are staggered? Is it not better on the whole in certain instances to arrange for a clear week?</p>

<p>No, I have explained that you cannot have a universal scheme. It may be that some of the works are on such priority work that even a week's holiday may be difficult to give. In some cases we cannot afford to stop work on the machine tools, and there must be staggering. In others it may be that the type of work is of such a character and

the need for overhaul and renovation of such a kind that a week's stop may be preferable, but I must leave it to be adjusted by those concerned.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that there has been no appeal to retired scientists and technical men to place their names on this Register, and that the Register is running very dry with regard to certain categories of scientists?

<p>My predecessor made it clear when the Register was established that it applied to every person of all categories of scientists, whether retired or not, and there has never been any limitation. In fact, I was not aware that scientists ever retired, but there has been no distinction drawn between retired and unretired. In order to get over the difficulty about technicians, scientists and others of whom there is a shortage, an overhaul is going on in all the Departments in order to introduce a little dilution into the professions.</p>

<p>I do not accept that. I am constantly hearing these general statements without a single fact to back them up. The bulk of the people on the Central Register are in employment, but they have volunteered to help the State in any capacity. When those responsible for the Central Register are asked for a person, it would obviously be stupid to take a man away from a job which he is doing satisfactorily and merely put him somewhere else. It is not an unemployment Register. It is a Register of offers of service, and I can assure the House that it has been combed through time and time again.</p>

<p>I understand that certain arrangements have been made under the auspices of the Trades Union Congress for enabling foreign workers in industry to become members of the appropriate British trade union and also of their own national trade union group if such exists and is recognised by the T.U.C. My information is that these arrangements apply generally both to Allied nationals and to Austrians and Germans and that they include agreed voluntary membership contributions to the British union concerned, usually on the lowest scale permitted by its rules, and to the foreign


trade union group. I am not in a position to give more detailed information, but I understand that the whole scheme has been carefully worked out by the T.U.C. in conjunction with the International Federation of Trade Unions, which is operating from this country. The constitutions of the foreign trade union groups concerned before becoming operative are approved by the T.U.C. and the International Federation of Trade Unions.</p>

<p>I hope that further huts will be erected to meet a variety of needs in reception areas.

<p>As I gather from the Reply that the right hon. Gentleman

With regard to the second and third parts of the Question, I can assure my hon.

<p>I entirely agree with the view of my hon. and gallant Friend that every step possible should be taken to safeguard the dignity of His Majesty's uniform. The instructions of the Metropolitan Police are that drunken men, arrested at a distance from a police station, must be conveyed by police van, and that a van must be used even for a short distance if the prisoner is violent or incapable. I am informed by the Commissioner of Police that, in this case, the arrest took place at a distance of about a quarter of a mile from the police station. The police officers were of opinion that the prisoner was capable of walking to the police station.

<p>I am anxious to utilise the services of any trained nurse member of the Civil Nursing Reserve not already in employment, and, partly with this in view, I have recently extended the scope of the Reserve to cover almost every type of hospital, including certain special hospitals where the shortage of nurses is acute. Where a trained nurse has offered whole-time service without reservation as to place, regional nursing officers can ordinarily post her without difficulty. This cannot always be arranged, however, where the member's offer is restricted either to part-time service or to service in a particular locality, or in some other way. Such members are now being approached and asked to offer service not subject to these limitations, and the use to be made of their services will depend on the replies.</p>

<p>I am glad that the hon. Member has given me this opportunity of looking further into the matter. I find that before the making of the Orders some local authorities were informed that they might be authorised to issue civilian steel helmets to volunteers who were or who undertook to become members of supplementary fire parties. Subsequently, local authorities generally were given to understand that issues would be on a more restricted basis. I must, of course, honour the earlier assurance, although, on reflection, I think that it would have been better if it had been made a condition of a free issue that the volunteer should accept certain definite obligations, like other part-time Civil Defence volunteers. I hope that all who have enrolled as members of supplementary fire parties and are in a position to do so will assist local authorities to establish an effective service by undertaking, like other part-time members of Civil Defence organisations, to perform not less than 48 hours' duty per month where their services may be of most use. It is the occupier's responsibility to provide free helmets for persons working at business premises who perform duties on these

premises under the Fire Prevention (Business Premises) Order.<br/>
As regards compensation, the assurance given by my right hon. Friend the Minister of Pensions, in reply to a Question on 20th February by the hon. Member for Lincoln (Mr. Liddall), will be adhered to. Compensation for war service injuries will be made in accordance with the Personal Injuries (Civilians) Scheme to all fire watchers who are duly enrolled or registered. In addition, those members of the local authority's Civil Defence organisation who undertake to do not less than 48 hours per month and to serve anywhere in the area of their local authority may receive an allowance in respect of loss of earnings. As a result, they will get their normal weekly earnings for a maximum period of 13 weeks, provided that these do not exceed the basic weekly pay of whole-time Civil Defence volunteers.</p>

<p>I have seen reports in the Press on the case in question. The issue raised by my hon.

<p>There has been a marked increase this year in the demands for leaflets in the "Growmore" series for farmers and in the "Dig for Victory" series for allotment-holders and gardeners, and steps have been taken to ensure that these leaflets reach those who will derive benefit from them. From 1st January to 30th April this year, the demands for all "Growmore" leaflets totalled over 1,250,000, compared with about 400,000 for the same period in 1940. Nearly 250,000 leaflets on "The Early Bite," "Nitrogen&#x2014;The Way to High Yields," and "Kale for Winter Feed" have been issued to date this year, compared with about 30,000 during the whole of last year. During March last, the Postmaster-General, at my request, arranged for a house-to-house distribution in rural areas of the principal "Dig for Victory" leaflet&#x2014;"Vegetable Production in Private Gardens." Including demands from the urban areas, 5,000,000 copies of this leaflet have been distributed in the past two months, together with over 600,000 copies of a coloured cropping chart showing how to plan the production of vegetables for winter as well as summer. Over 1,000,000 copies of the various advisory leaflets in the "Dig for Victory" series have also been issued to date.</p>

<p>I will state first the function of the Lord Chancellor in this matter, which is to receive any complaint which may be made with respect to the conduct of a coroner, whether under Section 8 of the Coroners Act, 1887, or under the Common Law. If he forms the opinion that the complaint, if substantiated, would be such as to require him to remove the coroner from his office for inability or misbehaviour in the discharge of his duty, he investigates the complaint giving a full opportunity to the coroner to deal with any charges made and decides judicially on the matter. Section 8 (2) of the Coroners Act, 1887, <i>inter alia</i> makes

wilful neglect by a coroner a misdemeanour. Apart from this provision there is no power to take disciplinary action against a coroner where the complaint does not amount in the Lord Chancellor's opinion to inability or misbehaviour in the discharge of his duty. The existing provisions would seem adequate for dealing with any serious case.</p>

<p>The answer to both parts of the hon. and gallant Member's Question is in the negative.

<p>I beg to move, in page 2, line 3, to leave out from "scheme," to "and," in line 5, and to insert:
<q>(<i>a</i>) to which the debtor and a majority in number and value of such of the said creditors whose debts have been proved assent; or</q>
<q>(<i>b</i>) where there is one creditor whose debt has been proved or where there is one creditor whose debt constitutes a majority in value of the debts which have been proved, as to which the liabilities adjustment officer is satisfied;</q>
Provided always in each case that the scheme appears to him to be equitable and reasonable."<br/>
The Amendment is designed,' in the first place, to retain for this very desirable officer&#x2014;the liabilities adjustment officer&#x2014; all the powers given to him under the Clause as it stands, but by this Amend-

ment it is sought to make further use of his services and to give them an extended scope, so that his duties will cover not only the quasi-bankruptcy duty of presiding in cases where there are many creditors, but will give him an opportunity of taking part in the settlement of affairs where there is only one creditor or where one creditor is the predominant creditor. That is the circumstance which will prevail in a very large number of cases for whose aid this Bill has been brought forward. The wording of the Amendment may, perhaps, leave a little to be desired in its exact terms. Perhaps the expression "is satisfied" gives him too wide a scope, but if my right hon. and learned Friend will accept the spirit of the Amendment and give the liabilities adjustment officer a wider scope of duties than he now has, we shall be quite satisfied. If not, to the extent of enabling him to approve a scheme in the circumstances outlined by himself, at least I would beg my right hon. and learned Friend to give him the right, of his own volition, when he has considered schemes affecting one creditor, to approve a scheme subject to submitting it to the county courts before it becomes effective. This Amendment stands in the names of two hon. Members, including myself, who are both members of the legal profession, although of different branches, and is designed to enable matters to be settled out of court rather than in court. I hope the fact that members of the legal profession are responsible for this Amendment will induce the Attorney-General to give it favourable consideration.</p>

<p>I have an amendment in page 2, line 3, to leave out from "reasonable," to "and," in line 5, which I think may be discussed at the same time as this and which is intended to effect the same purpose. As the Clause stands at the present moment, it limits the operations of the liabilities adjustment officer in a way that does not seem to be necessary. The debtors are in any case protected by the provision under Sub-section (4) of this Clause by which they can have recourse to the courts if they are not satisfied with the scheme which is made by the liabilities adjustment officer. Therefore, as the debtors have that protection surely it will be far better not to reconsider the activities of the liabilities adjustment officer in the way which the


Clause proposes at the present time. There are, as the mover of the Amendment said just now, many cases in which there will be one creditor whose debt exceeds in value all the rest put together. There are cases of people who owe money to building societies or other bodies on 'the mortgages of their houses, and I would like to point out that there is nothing in this Bill, so far as I can see, -which provides that in assessing the value of the debt for the purposes of this Clause any deduction shall be made of the security which is held by the creditor. It may be that the power which is given later to the Lord Chancellor to make rules is intended to enable him to make a rule dealing with this particular point, but I am doubtful about that. It is certainly far from clear, and unless it can be covered in that way a creditor of that kind will be able to use the whole value of his debt as a lever and will be able to prevent a scheme being made in the great majority of cases which might come before the liabilities adjustment officer.<br/>
I think it is very unfortunate that we are introducing a new procedure which departs from the old traditions of bankruptcy law&#x2014;that we should fetter it by a condition which is appropriate to that but which is not appropriate to this new method. The result of the Clause remaining as it is at the present moment will simply be that the unfortunate debtor will have to make use of the more formal and legal procedure which is contemplated in the later Clauses of the Bill and which will involve him in additional expense in court fees and in obtaining legal assistance. Everybody knows that when a matter has to be dealt with before the courts people are, for their self-protection, forced to obtain legal assistance. If the matter comes before the liabilities adjustment officer, I presume that the proceedings will be quite simple and formal, so that there will not be the same deterrent to the debtor acting on his own behalf and so saving expense, trouble and inconvenience. On these grounds I hope the Attorney-General will be willing to accept a modification of this Clause.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-05-08a.999.0" hansard_membership_id="12013" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20792" speakername="The Attorney-General (Sir Donald Somervell)" colnum="999" time="">
<p>I appreciate very much the general desire that as many of these cases as possible should be disposed of before

the liabilities adjustment officer. On the other hand, one has to remember that the idea of that officer is that he should be a conciliation officer. What he is wanted to do, and what he is prepared to do, is to try and get people to agree, and it is because that is his function and because he has only limited compulsory powers, if I may put it that way, that he is able to adopt what the hon. Gentleman has just referred to&#x2014;simple and informal procedure. When we came to consider this matter on that basis, we had to consider a case where all creditors did not agree and where there were, perhaps, one or two outstandingly unreasonable or non-agreeing parties. Under bankruptcy law in that class of case the whole thing would have had to have gone before a court. We thought that that proceeding in this class of case would be undesirable, despite the fact that this officer will not be tied by legal forms and procedure and will be able to communicate informally with the people concerned. So we thought it right to insert a provision, if the majority agreed, that this scheme should be operative unless the minority appealed to the court, and I think that is reasonable and fair. I do not think either of the hon. Gentlemen' who have just spoken would object to that. They want compulsory powers to go further.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Carmarthen (Mr. Moelwyn Hughes) has an Amendment which deals with the case of the single debtor or where there is one single predominant debtor, and the hon. Gentleman the Member for North Batter-sea (Mr. Douglas) also referred to that case. I do not think it would be right to go further than we have gone in the Bill as it stands, whether there is one creditor or a number of creditors. I think if we were to adopt the methods here proposed, a strong case could be made that, if the liabilities adjustment officer is to have these compulsory powers, then he must be bound by certain principles of procedure and this would change his character, which I think would be unfortunate. In, the case of the single creditor if mortgagee or the landlord, as the case may be, and the debtor go before the liabilities adjustment officer and the debtor makes an offer and says "Here are my affairs; here is my boarding-house "&#x2014;if he is a boarding-house keeper&#x2014;"with nobody in it, or only a few people in it, instead of


being full, but I think I can get through," and if, in such a case, the landlord or the mortgagee is not satisfied with an offer which the liabilities adjustment officer considers reasonable, then, I agree, the matter has to go to court. But I will see that it is made quite clear that in those cases the expense of going to court can be placed on the landlord or mortgagee who has forced the tenant to go to court, because he would not accept the offer which the liabilities adjustment officer considered reasonable. I believe that that is a better way of dealing with the problem and that to extend the powers of the officer too far would be, as I say, to alter his character.</p>

<p>I wish to raise a question on this Clause, and if this is not the appropriate time for doing so, perhaps an answer can be given to it at a later stage. There is some uncertainty in the definitions in this Clause which may affect different classes of people, and one instance on which I think the Committee would desire to have some further information, is that, in which, under this scheme, the payment of rent is postponed. Is there any provision in the Bill&#x2014;I have myself so far been unable to find one&#x2014;that the person who owns the property in such a case shall be relieved of the payment of Income Tax upon it? In these days of high taxation, it seems

very unfair if Parliament, by a legislative Act, has postponed the payment of a sum that is due, such as rent, to deprive the property-owner of his rent and yet under another enactment place him under the obligation of paying taxation on that sum at the present high rates. As I say, if I am premature in putting this point I am willing to postpone it to a later stage.</p>

<p>May I make a suggestion? A great many questions will doubtless arise as to the effects of this Measure in relation to the Board of Inland Revenue. The hon.

<p>The point mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Sir A. Maitland) does not arise on this Clause.

I have been in touch with the Inland Revenue and while I cannot give any undertaking to deal with that particular matter, I certainly appreciate its importance.

<p>I wish to draw attention to one small point in connection with this Clause. Subsection (9) provides for registration of schemes of arrangement on the same register as that provided for under the Deeds of Arrangement Act, 1914. I understand that this Bill is designed to avoid any stigma of bankruptcy attach-


ing to an individual in these cases, and therefore I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will consider the advisability of having a separate register made under the provisions of this Bill. Otherwise, if the registration is to be under the normal bankruptcy procedure it will tend to cast the stigma of bankruptcy on the individual concerned.</p>

<p>I think the Bill itself meets, in substance, the point raised by my hon. and gallant Friend, by removing the stigma to which he refers. As regards the register, it might impose an undue burden on those who have to carry out searches if they were called upon to search two lists instead of one, and I cannot think that the mere fact of registration under the procedure now proposed would involve any unfairness to the debtor who has to go to the liabilities adjustment officer. I am, however, sympathetic to the idea, and I will look into it and if I find that it can be done without any inconvenience, I have no objection to these cases coming under a different heading. It may, however, be an unnecessary complexity to have two lists instead of one.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General has mentioned the case of the boarding-house keeper who, though unable to pay his rent at the moment, thinks he may be able to carry on his business. I foresee the possibility of tenants of another type finding themselves in serious financial difficulties to an extent which may affect a considerable number of the population. I refer to those tenants who have been "blitzed" out of ordinary houses and have lost their furniture and equipment and who, owing to force of circumstances, and because no other houses are available, may be compelled to seek refuge in houses which have been partially repaired. Under the law as it stands in Scotland, such a tenant under the contract of tenancy is required to pay the full rent if the house is wind and water tight. If such a tenant is in serious financial difficulties, I take it that he also would be entitled to apply to the liabilities adjustment officer to have an arrangement made between himself and the landlord for a suitable modification of the rent, to meet his difficulties and perhaps to compensate for the lack of amenities. That type of

case will be very prevalent. The Bill covers big property owners and so on, and I would like to know whether the Attorney-General has foreseen the possibility of the liabilities adjustment officer functioning in the cases to which I have referred.</p>

<p>I do not think that on this Clause we can go into special questions arising between landlord and tenant in connection with repaired houses, a matter which is really covered by the Landlord and Tenant (War Damage) Act.

<p>The right hon. and learned Gentleman the Attorney-General will remember that at a former stage of the Bill I raised the question of the costs of liabilities adjustment officers. I think that matter is relevant to the proposed Sub-section (3) of this Clause, and I should like to ask the Attorney-General, who was good enough to promise me that he would look into this matter, whether he is now able to announce any concession to debtors by means of the payment of some of their costs through the channel of the expenses of the liabilities adjustment officers. There are cases in which some small point of law arises as between a very powerful creditor and a very impoverished debtor, and it frequently happens that the debtor is drawn through the courts until he abandons the case altogether, and then has awarded against him enormous sums in costs out of all


proportion to his original debt. I think that in such cases, particularly if, for example, the Attorney-General certified that some principle of law arose which ought to be tested, the expenses of testing the point of law ought to be borne on the expenses of the liabilities adjustment officer. If the right hon. and learned Gentleman can make a concession of that sort, or at any rate state that he will look into the matter, it will make an improvement in the Sub-section.</p>

The question put was whether certain points of law might in form be decided by proceeding against the liabilities adjustment officer. I do not think that would be possible, and I foresee difficulties about it. However, I will look into the matter which the hon.

<p>I wish to raise a matter that was raised in another place, namely, the sort of persons who will be appointed as liabilities adjustment officers. As a layman, I was very much encouraged when I heard the speech of the hon. Member for North Battersea (Mr. Douglas), who is, I believe, connected with the legal profession, and who stated what seemed to me to be the broad and high-minded view that in this case we should do all we can to prevent legalism spoiling the working of the scheme, and that the scheme should not be regarded as a device for earning fees. That is the approach we ought to make. If that be the case, what sort of persons are to be appointed? A friend has written me in these terms:
<q>There is a feeling abroad that when it comes to these appointments, they will be for some existing court officials, and the whole thing will be linked up with the existing debt

procedure. Quite a number of people would much prefer that some ordinary citizens of the chartered accountant type, or anybody qualified, should be brought in.</q>
I am ignorant in these matters. I have never had any part in bankruptcy proceedings, either as a debtor or as a creditor, and I hope I never shall. I have been rather lucky. It seems to me that these officers should be essentially conciliators, and I think it would help us if the Attorney-General could give some indication of what is in the mind of the Lord Chancellor in regard to these appointments. Naturally, no-one can tie himself down as to what he will and will not do. It might happen that a legal gentleman would be just the right person for the job in some cases, whereas in other cases it might be somebody else. What we want to keep out of the operation of the Bill, when it becomas an Act, is the outlook of the bankruptcy courts. The scheme is a raft, and not a depth charge. The Bankruptcy Act is a depth charge. We want to make sure that the scheme is run on the right lines and animated by the right spirit.</p>

<p>With reference to the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams), I wish to make a suggestion. Recently, the Treasury introduced into the Finance Act a Section which gave them power to do away with the assessors under the Income Tax Acts. In future these assesors in various towns will probably find that their work is disappearing. It seems to me that they would be suitable persons to do the type of work that will fall upon the liabilities adjustment officers. They have been, as it were, the go-betweens between the Income Tax payers and the Income Tax authorities. I think they would be acceptable to both sides. They are not in any way connected with debt collecting, which I think it would be a great tragedy to associate in any way with this scheme.</p>

<p>Although I agree with the hon. Member for East Stirling (Mr. Woodburn), I would remind him that some people would regard anybody connected with Income Tax as suffering from a certain taint. My Noble Friend is very anxious to get the right type of men for this work. I do not think one can be too dogmatic on the subject. There are some conciliatory lawyers, there are some registrars of


county courts who might be available and who might be very good for this work, and solicitors, in spite of the taint of the law, might be found admirably suitable for it. I also agree that chartered accountants might be suitable. I think the right type of man might be found in all these categories. A suggestion was made in another place about Official Receivers, and it might be found that they would be perfectly suitable men, although there is not the slightest intention of appointing Official Receivers <i>en bloc.</i> The whole idea of the Bill is against what one might call the bankruptcy procedure. I think that the men available from those different categories will give complete satisfaction, but one cannot lay down definite rules in the matter. However, I can give this assurance, namely, that my Noble Friend entirely agrees with what has been said as to the desirability of getting men who will deal with this question on broad human lines, and will not approach it from the point of view of debt collecting or with any professional or personal bias. The principle of conciliation is the principle of this part of the Bill.</p>

This Clause gives jurisdiction to the courts to deal with applications. It not only gives jurisdiction to courts in a very important class of case, but also gives jurisdiction to the liability adjustment officers in those cases where all the creditors do not agree&#x2014;that is under Clause I, Sub-section 2 (b). The object of the

Amendment is in one sense to widen, and in another sense to try and simplify, the conditions under which applications may be made to the courts, and the treatment of cases which are dealt with by the liabilities adjustment officers, in the cases where all the creditors do not agree. As the Clause stands at the present moment, a double condition has to be satisfied. Firstly, the debtor has to satisfy the condition that he is unable to pay his debts, which I understand to mean that he is unable to pay his debts immediately, and not necessarily unable to pay them if the whole of his assets can be liquidated, and, secondly, he has to satisfy the condition that he is unable to meet any future liability in respect of which obligation has already been incurred. But it is quite conceivable that the debtor may be able to meet his future obligations because some asset may become available to him in the future which is not available to him at the present time. If that were his state of affairs, it would be impossible for him to make any application to the courts and to have the services of the liabilities adjustment officer under Clause I if any one of his creditors objected. Moreover, it is very difficult to decide whether a man will or will not be able to meet future liabilities, in view of the difficult conditions under which we are living at the present time. It might depend, for instance, on how long the war lasted. If the war ended this year, his position with regard to liabilities which might accrue next year might be quite easy. Therefore, I submit that under the Clause, as it stands at present, it may be possible that many deserving cases may be deprived of the procedure which this Bill seeks to introduce.</p>

<p>I should like to support my hon. Friend the Member for North Battersea (Mr. Douglas) in the Amendment which he has moved. I must confess that I was unable to understand what other kind of liabilities could fall due except future liabilities. The word "future" seems to be unnecessary. With regard to the other point that my hon. Friend has made, of course, if a man is unable to pay his debts, and that is left as a general term, it would certainly cover the whole question of bankruptcy. Therefore, with my hon. Friend, I think that there should be some provision made here


to cover a man who may be unable to meet his liabilities as they fall due, but who may be able to meet them after they fall due. In such cases the liabilities adjustment officer might be able to make some arrangement with the creditors whereby the debtor could pay his debts six or nine months hence. Some accommodation should be given, which, after all, is the whole purpose of this Bill, instead of making a man bankrupt when he can show he is willing to meet his debts.</p>

<p>The question is whether the word "or" or the word "and" is right in a case of this kind. It is very nearly as difficult to decide, as it is for me to decide whether one puts the clock on or back when Summer-time starts. We think we have got the right word and that the Amendment is wrong. The problem can be stated quite shortly. Let us assume the present debts of a man are &#x00A3;3. If he has less than &#x00A3;3, he is unable to meet his present obligations. Happily, that will be the majority of the cases, and we hope that such cases, will benefit by the Bill. But let us suppose that a man's present debts are &#x00A3;3, that he has &#x00A3;5 in his pocket, and that he will owe &#x00A3;3 rent in a fortnight's time. We drafted this Clause with a view to bringing that man in, namely, the man who can say that he has not got enough to pay his immediate liabilities. A man might say that if he waited until the end of the month, he would have a future obligation to pay &#x00A3;3, and that in the meantime he would have nothing coming in. He might say that if he paid his butcher and baker, he would be left with only &#x00A3;2. That is the case we wanted to bring in under the Bill&#x2014;it is a case of a man who is not insolvent at the moment.</p>

<p>It is a question of whether the word "and" or the word "or" covers it. We think the word "and" does it. It means that anyone can apply who is unable to pay his debts and meet them as they fall due&#x2014;that is, future liabilities if any. Therefore, a man could be covered if he could show that he was unable to meet his present debts. If he cannot meet his present debts, he will not be able to meet his future debts.</p>

I do not think that is a likely case, but it is a possibility. However, I am certain that the word "or" will not meet it, because it would exclude the man with &#x00A3;5 who has to pay &#x00A3;3 to-day and &#x00A3;3 liability in the future. That man could not show that he was unable to meet his present debts, because they are only &#x00A3;3 and he has &#x00A3;5. I will consider an amplified and clearer form of words.

<p>I beg to move, in page 4, line 24, after "be," to insert "in serious financial difficulties or."<br/>
Paragraph (<i>b</i>), as I read it, extends the benefit under these proceedings to those who have certain assets but who, if they were deprived of those assets for the immediate benefit of their creditors, would find themselves in, so to speak, a future difficulty. They would be unable to carry on business and would be deprived of the means of livelihood. In other words, in respect of businesses the Bill recognises the desirability in certain circumstances of retaining available assets in the possession of the debtor. My Amendment is designed to extend the benefit of that provision in proper cases to individuals not necessarily engaged in business. I have in mind an individual who has an insurance which has an immediate cash value, or one who would have a little money put by for contingencies, not much, but some asset which could be realised. I have sought to do this by using the phraseology of Clause I. As the Attorney-General has said, the sphere of operations of the Bill before the courts is more limited than that of the liabilities adjustment officer, because his duties extend to all persons who are in serious financial difficulties. But the Bill does not give to everyone in serious financial difficulties the power to come to the court seeking an


adjustment order. It limits it to the category that we discussed in the previous paragraph and those in the paragraph that we are now considering. It may be that the term is too wide to be included in paragraph (<i>b</i>) and that it needs to be further hedged, but I would press the right hon. and learned Gentleman to extend the provision which he is now going to make with regard to businesses to private individuals, so that they need not necessarily be deprived of all their available cash assets, or immediately realisable assets, before they can have the advantage of adjustment proceedings.</p>

<p>I thought, when I saw this Amendment on the Paper in the place where it was, that it was directed to the category of persons dealt with in paragraph (b) but, having heard the hon. Gentleman, I think he is really wanting to extend the class of case which in the Bill is dealt with under paragraph (<i>a</i>), because his words would cover all the people whom we have already defined, and to some extent limited, under that paragraph (<i>a</i>). They would all be in serious financial difficulties. I quite agree that you must decide in a Bill of this kind where to draw the line, and, wherever you draw it, some people will say, "Could you not go a little further?" We felt that the proper place to draw the line in this general class of case is where it is drawn in paragraph (a). We used the most general words when setting up the liabilities adjustment officer in Clause 1, because really we wanted to leave him with the door open. We did not want him to say, "I have no jurisdiction to look into your case unless you satisfy certain specific conditions." But, when you are coming to the court procedure, which one has to look at from the point of view of creditors as well as debtors&#x2014;and not all creditors are rich people&#x2014;you have to be specific.<br/>
The first suggestion that occurs to one would be to take the normal insolvency case and ask, "Can you meet your liabilities? If you can, you had better go ahead. Something might turn up." But we thought that would be rather too rigid with this exceptional and unanticipated type of circumstances. It was right, we felt, to give a man the benefit of these proceedings if, although he had

assets to meet his present liabilities, he could see what was coming in the future and would not be able also to discharge those obligations. That is where we thought it right to draw the line in ordinary cases. I think one has to distinguish and apply special treatment to businesses, particularly small businesses, which in some ways are the hardest hit of all and which it is most desirable in everyone's interest to preserve, and therefore paragraph (b) went rather further than (<i>a</i>) and said, "You may get a man who can pay his debts&#x2014;cannot say he cannot meet his future liabilities&#x2014;but he may say, If I exhaust my resources, I shall soon be unable to carry on my business.' "It would be because he was trying to keep his business that there would be a drain on his reserves, which would not arise in non-business cases. He would have his business premises to keep and might have other outgoings. Therefore, we thought that in the case of a business it would be right to look a little further into the future.<br/>
The point which I thought my hon. Friend was going to make&#x2014;and although he has not made it, I will make it&#x2014;is that the words "he would be unable to carry on his business" are a little too flat a test and that we ought to make the words a little vaguer by saying that he would be unlikely to be able to carry on his business. I think that a little further elasticity in this paragraph in that direction might be advisable, but we cannot accept the words "in serious financial difficulties" in the general form in which my hon. Friend has proposed. We think that in paragraph (<i>a</i>) in the general sense in which it is drawn we have gone as far as we can reasonably go.</p>

<p>Is my right hon. and learned Friend prepared to insert something in paragraph (<i>b</i>) that would extend this benefit to others than those who are possessed of businesses? I agree that there must be a definite line of demarcation, but I do not think it is right that only in the case of businesses anybody is to be allowed to retain money which could be available to pay debts with. If he is prepared to extend the paragraph beyond pure businesses I should be glad to ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</p>

<p>If I applied under paragraph (<i>a</i>), a scheme might be approved


by the liabilities adjustment officer whereby I paid 10s. in the &#x00A3; and I should be left with assets. My hon.

I take it that that will not necessarily be so, whether I am in business or not, for I would have to have a little left to live on.

On the point that my hon. Friend raised, I would draw his attention to the last words of paragraph (b), "or would otherwise lose his means of livelihood." It is not confined to businesses and the rentier, the man who has not a business or means of livelihood, comes within paragraph (<i>a</i>). In that case it would be difficult to go beyond what we are doing in the Bill.</p>

These Amendments prevent any argument arising on that point.</p>

It is obviously desirable that all proceedings under this Bill should be open and above board, and it seems to be right and proper that a copy of any report made by the liabilities adjustment officer to the court should be available for inspection by the debtor or any creditor. It is a practice in bankruptcy for the official receiver to make a report upon the conduct of the debtor. It is a public report and is read in open court. One wants to avoid the liabilities adjustment officer putting into a report anything which the debtor or any creditor should not have the opportunity of controverting, correcting, or acquiescing in, as the case may be. It may be more appropriate to deal with this point in the rules, and if the provision is made there, I shall be content.</p>

Sub-section (6) provides that if the court is satisfied in the case of any debtor that the matters set out in Sub-section (1) are correct they may make a protection order. The object of this Amendment is to provide that notice shall be given to all concerned. Presumably in the majority of cases it will be the debtor who makes application, and <i>ex hypothesi</i> he will, of course, have an opportunity of coming before the court. Presumably, also, where the petitioning creditor, as he is called, makes application, notice will be given to the debtor, but what will be


the position of the other creditors in such a case? It may be that they would take exception to an order being made, and there ought to be provision for other creditors to be given notice at some stage of the proceedings. It may be that this is not the appropriate place at which to introduce such an Amendment or, again, the point may be provided for in the rules, but if some provision is made for the contingencies I have referred to I shall be satisfied.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 8, to leave out lines 20 to 23.<br/>
According to the Clause, it would appear that the courts can only reduce the rent if the lettable value of the premises has fallen owing to war circumstances or to an amount less than the lettable value at the date of the Order, but in an evacuation area, for example,

the lettable value of premises in general may have risen, and in such an area and in such circumstances it might not be possible for the tenant to obtain a reduction of rent. It seems to me that some provision ought to be made for such a case. I gather that here the Government are trying to legislate by areas, so to speak, although I feel it would be more desirable to legislate on the merits of each particular case. I recognise, of course, that a landlord is entitled to consideration, and that it would perhaps be a hardship on him in some cases, though not in all, that if the premises were vacant and he could get a higher rent he should be compelled to take a lower rent, but it does not seem that he will be in any worse case than any ordinary creditor who, under this Bill, may have to forfeit some part of his claim. At any rate, I am drawing the attention of the right hon. and learned Gentleman to this point as one which seems to me worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>I feel that this part of the Clause is of tremendous importance to a large number of people because it will give blitzed tenants the right to have some adjustment of their rent made by the liabilities officer if war damage or war circumstances have altered the circumstances in which the rent agreement was made. But a difficulty arises over the words "lettable value," because where practically a whole town has been blitzed the lettable value of such houses as remain may have risen considerably owing to a shortage of housing accommodation. A landlord might argue that though the condition of the house had deteriorated by more than 50 per cent., though the tenant might be able to occupy only one room, yet the lettable value of the house had actually increased, and certainly not diminished, owing to the scarcity of houses. I should like the Attorney-General to look into the point, because it is already raising considerable difficulties. I have heard of landlords in a severely blitzed area who have said that they would rather see their houses stand empty than reduce the rents by one penny. It cannot be the intention of the Government to cover cases like that, and I think the Clause should be altered in such a way as to refer to the condition of the houses as well as to its relative lettable value in comparison with other houses.</p>

<p>This Clause was not intended to deal with the problem of blitzed houses, and I do not think it does. It was intended to deal with cases like that, say, of a boarding-house in London or on the East Coast with a pre-war rent fixed on the value of boarding-house property in the area. Where the conditions have changed to the disadvantage of boarding-house keepers the landlord will, in 9 cases out of 10, if the tenant is a good tenant, have made a remission of the rent voluntarily, but the idea of this Clause is that the court should be able to say in a case coming before it, "If the landlord turned you out he could not get more than a certain rent for the house and therefore, having regard to all the circumstances, we reduce the rent by a certain amount." We put it that that rent should not be reduced below the value at which the premises could be let. We think that is right. If you are to give power to vary the contract under which a man is to remain in your house, it is right that you should set this limit to the variation. You should not leave the matter completely at large, which would put upon the court a discretion which really would not be fair.<br/>
In moving the Amendment, my hon. and gallant Friend spoke about the reception areas. In the main, people in those areas are not doing so badly. The hard cases arise in evacuation areas. He took a case where the value of the house was maintained or increased and the tenant said that he wanted his rent reduced. If hardships are to fall, not by reason of this Measure but because of war conditions, on a great many people who own property, they will also include hardships in letting the property. If a man who owns a house is in a position to say, "I could get another tenant at so much," it would be wrong to reduce the rent below that amount, and it would be an impossible discretion to confer upon the judge. It would be impracticable to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure that the Attorney-General is right in his argument. Is he not giving a preference to the landlord in this case? There will be debtors who have to take advantage of this Measure. Merely because they happen to be in an area where rents have increased, are they to be deprived of obtaining a reduction in their rents, and are

their landlords to have a preference over other creditors?</p>

<p>No. The other creditors would be put into the position in which my hon. and gallant Friend would put the landlord.

<p>I am obliged to my right hon. and learned Friend. We are all trying to get the most desirable results. There is another argument which supports the right hon. and learned Gentleman's appeal, which is that if a landlord can get another tenant at a higher rent, he will be compelled by this Bill to continue to let to the present tenant at the same rent, that is to say, the rent which the tenant was previously paying. To that extent the landlord will be damnified, in that he will not be able to go into the open market and get a higher rent. Having regard to what the right hon. and learned Gentleman has said, I am willing to withdraw the Amendment, but I am not altogether happy about the position.</p>

<p>I have read the Clause again, and I am unable to see how a tenant in a blitzed area such as Clyde-bank, placed in a serious financial difficulty and unable to pay his rent, cannot apply for the benefit of this Measure and for the liabilities officer to adjust his rent with his landlord.</p>

<p>It is my fault. I did not mean to imply that persons who come under this Bill might not have their houses blitzed or that a house where a reduction of rent was in question might not have been blitzed. I wanted to remove what I thought was a misapprehension in the mind of my hon. and gallant Friend, and to make it clear that the general intention of the Clause was to cover, and that the Clause did cover, the case of a blitzed tenant who, without being in financial difficulties, felt that his case had to be dealt with.</p>

<p>I am glad that that point has been cleared up. I see also the possibility of a large family, where the


income has been seriously reduced, perhaps by the death of a breadwinner, finding itself in such serious financial circumstances that it is unable to pay the rent. So far as I understand the matter, the words "letting value" make it possible for the landlord to insist on the payment of the full rent, because the lettable value, owing to the area being blitzed, is perhaps above what the normal rent of the house would be. I referred him to the case&#x2014;I hope there are very few like it, but I understand that there have been cases&#x2014;where landlords in a blitzed area insisted on the full rent from people whose work necessitated their coming to the house, and would not have,an adjustment of this kind. It will be a great service to people who are suffering these difficulties if it is made clear that this Measure will bring them relief and adjustment of their difficulties upon a fair basis as between landlord and tenant.</p>

<q> and not being less than such a sum as added to the amount already paid by the debtor in respect to the hire-purchase price will equal the value of the goods at the date of the order.</q>
This Amendment is one which I think is of rather substantial importance. I am moving it at the request of a body known as the Conjoint Conference of Public Utility Associations, with which are associated all the municipal and company gas and electricity undertakings, and in addition I know that the Amendment has the approval of the Hire-Purchase Trade Association. When goods are out on hire purchase the reason is, as a rule, that the man who is seeking the ultimate ownership of the goods does not want to pay all

the money down at once, and therefore, instead of entering into a transaction involving a direct sale, he enters into such a transaction that he can spread the cost over a substantial period of time. It happens that from time to time hire-purchase transactions come into the courts, indicating that some of these transactions have features which are not too desirable. Of course, it has always been the bad cases which have come before the courts. It is very important to bear that in mind, for so far as 99 per cent. of hire-purchase transactions are concerned, I think they have been fair to both sides. It has only been the bad cases that have received publicity, and as a result there is, in the minds of some of those who administer the law, a measure of prejudice against the hire-purchase trader. I know that from what a number of them have said to me. They sometimes feel that the man who is buying the goods on hire purchase is always right, while the seller is always wrong.<br/>
What is the position of the hire-purchase trader so far as this Bill is concerned? He is a person who is a secured creditor. I am not very expert in regard to the law on banks and the rest, but he is a creditor who has a security. He is a form of creditor such as is included in the first Sub-section of this Clause, which also deals with secured creditors. Let us imagine that, whenever you rented a house, you were forced to have a hire- purchase agreement so that ultimately you became the owner, and that Clause 1 applied exclusively to such people. If we apply the same principle to that, it will be seen that as the man is to have the house there is not much difference. We have just accepted a Sub-section under which, if it were made similar to Subsection (3), the tenant of the house would be informed that the house belonged to him since he had paid so many years' rent. There is some analogy; I do not want to push it too far.<br/>
Let us take another case. This Bill is primarily designed for the benefit, not of private individuals, but of people engaged in trade, because I think, broadly speaking, the Attorney-General will agree that the Bill is designed to keep afloat people in business who are in great difficulties because of the effects of the war on districts in which they carry on their business. I am a trader, and for the purpose


of my trade I need plant and machinery and I need materials. Over a period of years I may buy far more materials than machinery, but I do not buy the materials on hire purchase. I get deliveries at frequent intervals, and I get a monthly account due for payment within so many days, and in a period of, say, six years the supplier of the materials will have been paid for probably 95 per cent. of what he has supplied. Now we come to the person who has provided the machinery on which those materials will be turned into something that can be sold. That person, instead of sending in a bill once a month for, it may be, a hundreth part of the plant and getting paid for it&#x2014; in which case the hundreth part has passed definitely to the trader&#x2014;allows the trader to have the use of the whole plant and, if so much a month is paid for so long, the whole of the plant belongs to the trader. That brings us to the position in which this Bill is to apply. There are two creditors; one is the hire-purchase trader, and the other the one who has supplied materials. The latter has already had 95 per cent. of his bill paid in the past, and the hire-purchase trader has perhaps had only half of it, yet under this proposal he is to be treated infinitely worse than the supplier of the material.<br/>
It is no business of mine to defend hire-purchase traders because they are hire-purchase traders, but it is only fair and just that all classes of creditors should have an equal measure of justice given to them, and after all, it should be remembered that not every debtor is necessarily an entirely virtuous person. We must not base laws on the assumption that all creditors are rogues and all debtors angels. That, broadly speaking, is not true&#x2014;I am inclined to think, in general, it is very much the reverse of true. It is the man who, in the ordinary way, does not incur heavy debts for whom I have the greatest respect. I think there is a substantial case for this Amendment, or alternatively for some other Amendment which will give some reasonable protection to the hire-purchase trader, first of all against the debtor who may be, in part, not too honest. But in any case I see no reason why a mortgagee, for example, should be put in a preferential position as compared with a hire-purchase trader. I think there ought to be equal justice for both.<br/>
I realise to the full that I am dealing with a matter in connection with which my own personal experience is very limited. I have tried to see the position fairly, and I sincerely trust that the Attorney-General, even if he cannot accept my Amendment in this form, will at least assure me that something will be done to protect the very large and very legitimate interests at stake. After all, the public utilities to which I have referred, both company and municipal, represent a capitalisation of &#x00A3;2,000,000,000. They are substantial people, and the money of the ratepayers is concerned to a substantial extent. The legitimate interests of the shareholders in the large public utility company are also at stake, and there is the general question of fair justice as between citizen and citizen. On those various grounds I move this Amendment, and hope the Attorney-General will find himself in a position to give me an encouraging reply.</p>

<p>When we were considering the provisions of this Bill it became clear that, whereas we had put what I call a stop upon the power of the courts to reduce rents, and while there is also a stop on the power of the courts to reduce mortgage interests, there was no such stop when we came to the exercise of discretion with regard to a hire-purchase contract. Under the strict bankruptcy law I think the hire-purchase trader is in a somewhat exceptionally favourable position. He can, I think, insist either on getting the full balance of the instalments or on taking possession of the article. In this class of case we felt that it would be unfair as between him and other creditors if that was the position, particularly having regard to the power of the courts in dealing with rent and mortgage interests. Hire purchase is a somewhat hybrid form of transaction. It is subject to the Purchase Tax, but it is in the form of hire, and has always presented certain difficulties in the direction of knowing exactly the fair way to treat it. I have always felt that if one could get a stop&#x2014;that is to say, a figure below which it would be unreasonable to value the goods&#x2014;it would be a prudent thing to do. But that would be difficult. It would seem to leave the matter too much at large, and I was not sure that it would be welcomed by those interests concerned. The value is usually fairly low


at the date of the order. The goods must have been used, since they are not as a rule vested in the debtor until there has been a substantial number of payments. The vast majority of those affected are, I agree, honest and reputable traders, taking an important part in the commercial life of the country, and I was not sure that they would rather have a stop.<br/>
I do not think it would be reasonable for the county court to make a vesting order if the sums paid or to be provided for did not amount to the present value of the article. If those concerned would like a provision to that effect inserted in the Bill, I am perfectly prepared to do that. We cannot accept the Amendment in its present form. I think that this condition would be better inserted as a proviso. Moreover, it does not cover the possible case of where 75 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the instalments might have been paid, and the court might properly make a vesting order without providing for any further payment. The Amendment assumes that there will always be provision for a further payment. We are very anxious to make it clear that we are trying to consider the interests of all concerned. This is not a debtor's relief Bill, but an attempt to get a fair arrangement between creditors and debtors, to tide people over a difficult time. I do not think that this proposal will operate unfairly to the debtor. I think it is a perfectly fair method to adopt, and I recommend the Committee to accept it in principle.</p>

I put this Amendment down at the request of the Federation of British Industries, upon the executive committee of which I happen to serve. They were

a little perturbed because they thought there ought to be a security that nothing should be done without all parties concerned being informed. I rather gathered from the Minister's speech that, instead of being put into the Act, that will be done administratively, after the Bill has been passed. Perhaps my right hon. and learned Friend will be good enough to put that on record. Then I will ask leave to withdraw the Amendment.</p>

It has been pointed out that the Clause seems to assume that in all cases the mortgagee would want to value because he would want to prove the balance of the debt, but that there may be cases where the mortgagee wishes simply to rest on his securities. In those cases, if there had to be a valuation that would simply mean incurring unnecessary costs, and a difficulty might arise at a later stage for purposes of discharge.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 9, line 46, to leave out Subsection (4).<br/>
This Sub-section seems to introduce a far too rigid restriction upon the discretion of the court or of the adjustments officer. It says:
<q> The court shall not reduce the rate of interest under the last foregoing Sub-section, unless the annual amount payable by way of interest at the existing rate exceeds the net annual profits&#x2026;.</q>
There may be circumstances, which can-not be foreseen in the Bill, which might require that that rate of interest should be reduced, to leave a margin.</p>

<p>I am afraid that we cannot accept this Amendment. Thisis rather similar to the point that we discussed just now of the reduction of rent and to the point we discussed of the reduction of hire purchase. It must be appreciated that in this class of case the mortgagee is being deprived of his normal contractual rights, and the question is how far it is legitimate to go in that direction in these circumstances. The court has the power to reduce the rate of interest if the annual amount payable at the existing rate exceeds the net annual value of the mortgaged property. I think that it would be going beyond what was right to say that interest should be reduced in such circumstances. This is very like the other point. We want the Bill to be fair as between all those who are interested. I think that the present power to reduce interest is right and that the net annual value is a fair condition.</p>

<p>It does seem that under this legislation&#x2014;and it carries our minds back to the War Damage Bill&#x2014;that the whole of the benefits have always to be on the side of the mortgagee rather than giving any relief to the mortgagor. An insurance company insuring goods is let out of its liability if the damage is the result of an act of God or an act of war; the person who insures does not get the full benefit of his contract if it is an act of God or an act of war.</p>

<p>Exactly. When these contracts that we are discussing now were made no one anticipated that there would be an act of war and liabilities would occur such as have occurred. Both the War Damage Act and this Bill are introduced in order, as the Attorney-General said, to be fair to both parties. It appears to me to be reasonable that, if there is to be fairness to both parties, both parties must bear some of the loss. There is just a suggestion that on every occasion the mortgagee must be protected up to the hilt, and no margin is left for the mortgagor. The Attorney-General recalled the point that I made with regard to the War Damage Act that in the case of a person whose house has been destroyed and who is not going to get the cost of works payment, all the value might go to the mortgagee, and that the

mortgagor, although he might have put all his savings into the part-payment of the house, would get nothing. I would ask the Attorney-General to leave some discretion to the court to deal in a fair way with all parties.</p>

This is the Clause which deals with the continuation of adjustment proceedings if the original debtor has died.

I think that it was obviously a sensible provision. It has been pointed out to us that it might be some time before that could finally be ascertained. This Amendment and the two following Amendments, therefore, put the thing round the other way. They entitle the court to continue unless it is satisfied that the benefits are going to people other than the debtor's family. It will prevent a certain amount of delay. In the ordinary case inquiries will be made apparently, and it will be clear whether the estate comes within the Clause or not, and I think it improves the Clause to put it in this way.</p>

I can put the purpose of this Amendment very briefly. The effect of paragraph (<i>a</i>) of Sub-section (3), as I understand it, is to deprive those persons where the estate is insolvent of the right to have their debts paid in priority. I raise this question because, although I understand there has been some correspondence between the Association of Municipal Corporations and the Attorney-General, there is still some doubt in the minds of local authorities as to whether they are in fact deprived of that right in the case of people coming under this Clause. If we could have an assurance that they are under some misapprehension, I should at once be able to withdraw the Amendment.</p>

<p>This Clause provides that in certain cases, if a debtor dies, proceedings shall continue. The proceedings which are to continue are, of course, based on the principles of this Measure, and it is, therefore, necessary to provide, as is done under Sub-section (2, <i>a),</i> that if an estate is insolvent, Section 34 of the Administration of Estates Act shall not apply. If that were not done, it would be dealt with according to ordinary insolvency principles regarding a bankruptcy estate. My hon. Friend and those with him are afraid that that will mean that priorities in which they are interested will not apply. They are wrong about that, because if my hon. Friend will look at Clause 9, he will find that the priority of debts which he has in mind is a very important principle of this Bill. It shows that priorities under Section 3 of the Bankruptcy Act, which are the ones he has in mind concerning local authorities' rates and taxes, are one of the principles of this Bill. That principle will apply to the estate of the deceased debtor, because the court is enjoined to continue to deal with the estate under this Bill. Having already got the priorities provided for under the Bill, it would be wrong to do what the Amendment proposes to do&#x2014;to have them in the second time under insolvency proceedings.</p>

This is one of three Amendments to this Clause which stand in my name on the Order Paper. It is made to help remove a misunderstanding with regard to the scope and intention of the Clause, and it concerns the effect of liabilities adjustment proceedings or a scheme of arrangement on persons liable jointly or as securities. An important case I have in mind is a case where rent is reduced under the Clause which we were considering earlier or where the mortgage interest is reduced. The reference in the Clause as to providing "a scheme of arrangement approved under this Part of this Act "led, I think, to a misapprehension and made people think this Clause went wider than it does. They thought that where there was simply an ordinary debt for &#x00A3;50 or a loan which had been guaranteed, the guarantor would get off if the debtor was able to pay only 10s. in the <i>&#x00A3;.</i> That was never our intention. If a debt is guaranteed, then the guarantor must pay, and references to any other contract are references to contracts varying under Section 7 of the Act, and the only circumstance in which an executory contract can be varied is where the variation is in the interest of both parties and where, of course, he could otherwise disclaim. These are the three cases where the sureties' liabilities may be cut down. It is not effective in the case of an ordinary debt. Where the rent is reduced, the surety liability goes with it. Where the mortgage interest is reduced, the surety liability goes with it. The executory contract can be varied. The first two Amendments are drafting, and the third Amendment proposes to leave out the words, "or a person in the nature of a surety." Those words are taken from the Bankruptcy Act. I am not clear what a person in the nature of a surety is, and whether, indeed, there are any such persons.</p>

<p>Having regard to the fact that the Attorney-General made a statement which very conveniently dealt with the whole significance of the Clause, I think it might save time, Colonel Clifton Brown, if I could go a little beyond the scope of the Amendment, because frankly I am in a realm with which I am not very


familiar. My right hon. and learned Friend is aware that many people are greatly perturbed about this Clause. They regard it as something which relieves certain people who undertake certain obligations from their obligations because somebody else is in trouble. As I understand it, if one goes surety for a man, the object is that if he cannot do the job, one has to pay up. If circumstances arise in which a person cannot do the job, this Clause appears to relieve the man who has gone guarantee for him. I should like to be told what is the exact effect of the Amendments that are proposed. I think the minds of all hon. Members might be influenced to some extent by an explanation of that sort.</p>

<p>I quite understand that this Clause is one which has raised some apprehensions and that it requires discussion. As I have already said, I think some of the apprehensions are unfounded. I will leave aside for a moment the reference in the Clause to "contract other than a hire-purchase agreement," and will consider leases and

mortgages. That is the case with which the Clause is intended particularly to deal, and with which I think it deals logically. If, under Clause 6, the court decides to reduce the rent, the reason will be that, owing to war conditions, which neither landlord, tenant nor guarantor contemplated, the house is very likely to become as near as may be unlettable, while there is a pre-war rent of, it may be, &#x00A3;400. I will quote a case which has come to my notice. I do not do so because hard cases make good Acts of Parliament, but the possibility of hard cases is very often a very good reason for inserting a provision of this kind in a Bill. The case which I am about to quote would not be an isolated one. It is a case where a youngish man took a boarding house, it may have been for seven or 10 years, at a rent which was in the neighbourhood of &#x00A3;400 a year. It was in a part of the country where war conditions rendered the whole thing unprofitable. When he entered into the lease, the landlord not unreasonably got the man's mother to give a guarantee for the rent. In normal times, what would have happened if the son had failed in his business would have been this. He might have got into arrears and if he had gone on failing, it would have become apparent fairly soon that he could not run the business and that he had better take up some other line of business. The limit of his mother's responsibility would have been comparatively small. The landlord would have applied to her, and she would have taken the matter up with her son, and would have said to him, "If you cannot make it pay, you had better clear out and let the landlord regain possession." The matter would have solved itself with a comparatively small liability to the guarantor.<br/>
The war has produced a very different set of circumstances. The landlord, in the circumstances, does not want possession; he cannot get another tenant, and the building is simply an uneconomic structure. I quite agree that the man could file a petition in bankruptcy and disclaim the lease, but nobody wants him to be forced to do that. Short of that, however, and but for this Clause, the mother in this case would have to go on paying the full rent of the uneconomic structure. It might take the whole of her resources or her savings. What we


say is that we are not dealing with the normal ups and downs of success and failure which people look for guarantors to cover. We are dealing with a case where war circumstances have rendered the particular buildings uneconomic structures, possibly for a long period. Where they are unlettable or lettable only at a very reduced value, it is reasonable that the guarantor's liability should come down, too, for otherwise the landlord could get the full pre-war rent from the guarantor, the guarantor would be en-titled to go to the debtor for what he had had to pay, and in effect, if the debtor had any resources, one would not be reducing the rent as far as he was concerned to anything like the figure one appeared to be. Although he would have to pay only, say, &#x00A3;50 to the landlord, the landlord would get the remainder from the guarantor, and the guarantor would come back to the debtor for the balance of what he had had to pay. If the debtor had resources he would have to pay too. That is the case of rent and I think it is fair. As far as ordinary debts are concerned, that is to say debts for goods supplied or services rendered, the guarantor remains under his liability and that can be enforced. What I have said about rent applies also in substance to cases in which there is this limited reduction of mortgage interest. At present there are these words in the Clause "or contract." They are clearly qualified by the words now to be inserted&#x2014;" varied under Subsections (6) or (7)." Clause 6, Sub-section (4)&#x2014;this is the only case where guarantors under contracts might be relieved &#x2014;states:
<q> Where it appears to the court that it would be in the interests of all parties under a contract &#x2026;which could be disclaimed under the last foregoing section that the contract should continue in effect in a varied form rather than be disclaimed, the court may in the liabilities adjustment order vary the contract accordingly.</q>
That is limited to executors' contracts and to cases where it is in the interest of all parties. I have been told by the hon. Member for South Kensington (Sir W. Davison) and others that, in a great many cases, local authorities take a guarantor not so much for a money payment but for performance. Where a man puts in a tender for building, someone guarantees his performance. I suppose there is some penalty if the work is not done to time, or is not up to quality. That was not the

type of surety we had in mind. I am not sure how it would arise. It may be that, without damage, we could leave out the reference in this Clause to contracts and confine it to leases and mortgages. I should like a little more time to look into the matter. I do not want to do anything which would prejudice either local authorities, or contractors in the sort of case which my hon. Friend has put to me. Supposing one of those people who got into difficulties was a contractor to a local authority. He might be able to disclaim the contract or he might be able to continue it with variations. I should like to know rather more than I do about the terms of these guarantees. It may be that the question of the guarantor can be left where it is. On the other hand, it may be that it would be desirable to give him some relief. However, I should like to look at the matter more fully. I hope I have described the sort of cases we intended to meet.</p>

<p>As the Attorney-General has just said, this Bill, with the general approval of all parties, was introduced mainly in order to keep in being small businesses, lodging-house keepers, boarding-house keepers, and others. Its object was to enable them to tide over a difficult time, and to have equitable arrangements made between themselves and their landlords, so that, in the interests of both parties, the businesses could start again after the war on the same footing as before. It seems to me, however, that this Clause goes very much further than the main objects of the Bill. The Committee will remember&#x2014;and I "nave drawn the attention of the Attorney-General to it in private&#x2014;that it is practically the universal custom of local authorities, when entering into contracts involving substantial amounts, to require a surety. Until 1933 this was obligatory under the Public Health Act, 1875, in cases where the amount involved exceeded &#x00A3;100. This was repealed by the Local Government Act, 1933, Section 266 of which provides a local authority with powers, almost directions, to establish Standing Orders to carry this into effect. Mode! Standing Orders were prepared by the Ministry of Health, and a common form of Standing Order was supplied and adopted by practically all local authorities. I have a copy of that Standing Order with me which states:


<q> Every contract which exceeds &#x00A3;100 in value or amount and is either for the execution of works or for the supply of goods or materials otherwise than at one time shall provide for some pecuniary penalty to be paid by the contractor in case the terms of the contract are not duly performed and the Council shall require and take sufficient security for the due performance of every such contract.</q>
That, I believe, is the universal practice. The Attorney-General asked for instances. With regard to the supply of particular things it is the common practice among local authorities to take the lowest tender. It would add greatly to their burdens if in every case they had to make elaborate inquiries into the stability of the lowest tendering contractor and whether he could carry out the work for, say, paving, painting railings or lamp-posts, tar spraying, building contracts, etc., and the thousand and one other things which local authorities have to do. Therefore they adopted this method of asking for a guarantor to guarantee the due performance of the contract. The way it works is this. Supposing a local authority asks a contractor to supply building material or shovels, for which he has submitted a tender, and then he says that he cannot supply them. The local authority in that case can go into the market and find out the best terms on which they can obtain the shovels or the building material&#x2014;then they can ask the guarantor to pay the difference between the amount in the contract and what the local authority has paid.<br/>
That seems to me to be something quite different from the real objects of this Bill. I am anxious to make it quite clear that the Bill is not intended to deprive local authorities of this practice of obtaining guarantees for the fulfilment of contracts by contractors. It is a system which has been universally admitted by Parliament as a proper system to adopt, and it is very much in the public interest. I know it was not intended to include such matters as those to which I have just alluded and, if the right hon. and learned Gentleman does not like my proviso, perhaps he will put in some other words which will make it clear that the Bill is not intended to apply to guarantees of contracts such as I have described.</p>

<p>I am completely in agreement with what my hon. Friend has said, but I am anxious that this should

not be limited to contracts with local authorities, because the same thing happens in industry. I have had representations from the Association of Municipal Corporations and also from the Federation of British Industries, who are concerned with identically the same problem, where a third party guarantees the performance of that contract between two others. That is a legitimate form of guarantee and it does not necessarily follow that there should be complete exemption for these people. The Clause seems to me to be rigid: the words of my Amendment would make it more elastic. It is a proposal that all the circumstances shall be taken into account. It may well be that someone has insured with a well-to-do corporation for the performance of a specific task. We relieve the person who has failed to do that task, in certain directions, but this may be the eventuality against which he has insured. There is a wider problem affecting the position of building societies. There, again, I think there is a problem to be examined. Possibly at the conclusion of our discussion the Attorney-General may find himself in a position to state that the whole Clause will be re-examined before Report.</p>

<p>I should like to endorse my hon. Friend's suggestion. The Attorney-General has recognised the disquietude which the Clause has caused. We should bear in mind that in the peculiar circumstances of to-day our proceedings do not get the publicity which they would receive in normal times. We may be passing very important Measures, the full significance of which is not realised by people who, in normal times, would certainly have something to say about them. While we have the greatest sympathy with the genuine desire of the Government to help distressed debtors, these provisions are likely to have reactions which deserve consideration as much as the difficulties of the debtor. I know a pathetic case of two old people, the owners of two houses, which represent their life savings and their sole means of support. It is a hard case, similar to that which the Attorney-General mentioned. It seems to me that by this Clause you are defeating a very important principle which is adopted in ordinary day-to-day transactions and doing something which will have a retrospective effect and


extend the possibility of further trouble. I sincerely hope the Attorney-General will reconsider the whole question in the light of the effect upon local authorities and contracts generally. If this Clause is carried as it was first put down, even in the light of the Attorney-General's Amendments, which are Amendments of form rather than of substance, it will do a good deal of harm. As there are grave doubts about it, I suggest the best method is to leave it out.</p>

<p>I desire to support this Clause, for it is based upon a sound principle. The idea which underlies it is that the liability of the surety should not be increased by the operation of the Bill. It is not intended to relieve him of such amount of liability as he would have been under in any case, if this legislation had not been passed. If it is passed, surely it is unfair that the surety's liability should be increased by something which he could not possibly have foreseen, which was never in contemplation when he entered into the contract of suretyship, and which is an extraneous thing imposed by Parliament. If the Clause is omitted, it may tend to destroy the purpose of the Rill because the court is not under any obligation to make an order under the liabilities adjustment procedure. The court has merely a permissive power, a discretion as to what action it shall take, and, exercising that discretion, it may very well have regard to what the consequences will be upon a surety. If this provision is omitted, the court will be restricted in its power to deal with the application of the debtor by consideration of the fact that it will be increasing the liability of the surety and it will be unable to give the surety any relief whatever. To meet that case is the purpose of this Clause, and it is a sound purpose. Therefore, it ought to apply in every case.<br/>
I am very interested in local authorities, but I cannot come here and ask for a special privilege to be granted to them in this Bill in regard to their sureties which is not given to other people. A provision of that kind would not be fair. Once that is admitted, the argument is admitted for extending it to private corporations, building societies and other people, and if it is extended in that way, the whole purpose of the Clause will be weakened and more unfairness will be

caused. We are dealing with a very exceptional situation and with legislation of an exceptional character which is intended to protect debtors and to prevent the full extent of the law being applied to them, in bankruptcy or otherwise, as it could be at the present moment. In doing that, we are automatically affecting the position of sureties, and we ought not to obtain relief for the debtor at the expense of imposing on the surety an obligation which was never and could never have been in contemplation.</p>

<p>I would like to emphasise again what my hon. Friend the Member for North Battersea (Mr. Douglas) has made clear, that this Clause is deemed to deal only with cases in which under the Bill the court has power to order the continuation of a contract in a varied form that is to keep alive leases and mortgages. The important cases we have in mind are leases and mortgages. We added the words "or contracts ", but the Committee will see in Clause 6(4) that the only cases in which contracts other than leases or mortgages are concerned are those in which:
<q> it appears to the court that it would be in the interest of all parties under a contract &#x2026; which could be disclaimed &#x2026; that the contract should continue in effect in a varied form.</q>
That does not, in terms, say that all the parties have to agree to the continuation, but it implies it in substance. The court in deciding whether it should be continued in a varied form is to be satisfied that it is in the interests of everybody. If either debtor or creditor says, "I do not want it in that form; it is no good to me ", the court can exercise its discretion. That being the only form of contract which can come in, my view, particularly in view of what we have heard about local authority contracts, is that the best thing is to leave out of the Clause references to other contracts. They have obviously caused a good deal of misunderstanding, and I do not think, looking at Clause 6(4), that they really fulfil any useful purpose. The guarantor himself would be a party and would be entitled to be heard under Clause 6(4), and what is contemplated by that Sub-section is quite a different sort of arrangement by agreement from what is contemplated under Clause 18. I do not think that local authority contracts would really have been affected by this Clause, although difficult points might


have arisen as to whether they were or were not. It was not the type of guarantee we had in mind and it is not the type of guarantee which would be made more onerous by the operation of this Bill. It could only be extended by Clause 6(4) when it was for everybody's benefit.<br/>
It would be to the advantage of everybody and to the disadvantage of nobody if we deleted on the Report stage the references in the Clause to other contracts. My hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Sir A. Maitland), who was particularly concerned with local authority contracts and contracts of that form, thought that the Clause should be left out altogether, but while there is no case for retaining the words referring to contracts, I think that, as far as leases and mortgage interest are concerned, the Clause is right. Where rent is reduced under Clause 6, or mortgage interest is reduced under Clause 7, I think that it would be right that the guarantor's liability should be affected. I will look into the Clause again with a view of taking contracts out and leaving in leases and mortgages.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that the Attorney-General is right in his view. The essential thing is that where sacrifices have to be made they should be fairly and equitably spread, and it seems tome that if this matter were dealt with in the way he has suggested the power to ensure that would be given to the Court. It also seems to me that it is right to exclude "other contracts," because frequently they are, as my hon. Friend the Member for Faversham (Sir A. Maitland) said, subjects of insurance policies, or payments have been made in respect of them, and therefore it would not be right to give relief in those cases. At the same time, there will continue to be some feeling that a guarantor ought to obtain relief in the same way as the person whom he has guaranteed is relieved, and in such cases perhaps relief might be granted on the overriding principle set out by the right hon. and learned Gentleman, namely, that at the time it could not have been within the contemplation of the parties that circumstances of war would cause a default on the part of the principal debtor. In such cases, therefore, I think that relief might equally well be granted. I take it that the right hon. and learned Gentleman

will bring up a further Amendment on the Report stage and that we shall then have an opportunity of looking at the matter again.</p>

<p>This Clause confers jurisdiction upon county courts, and a


question has been raised whether the publicity of the proceedings in those courts may not prevent deserving cases applying to them for relief. I do not know what view the Attorney-General may take on that question, but in my experience, latterly at any rate, not much publicity has been given to proceedings of this nature. Of course bankruptcy proceedings, applications for discharge and so on are reported. It may be that it will be sufficient if special courts are held to deal with these cases. I do not think we ought to insist on no publicity at all being given to these proceedings, but, on the other hand, one would wish that some discrimination should be exercised. Those who brought this point to my attention were very much concerned lest by reason of the fear of publicity many people might not take advantage of this Measure who otherwise would do so. I do not altogether subscribe to that view, but I should like an assurance from the Attorney-General, if it is possible for him to give it, that discretion will be exercised and that perhaps special courts will be held. Of course, the court cannot prevent legal proceedings being reported, but the Press themselves may exercise a wise discretion in not reporting proceedings of this nature, unless there are special circumstances which make it desirable.</p>

In most of these cases, there will not, I think, be anything of general interest to the public, and one hopes that not much publicity, or at any rate no unnecessary publicity, will be given to them, and that people will not be deterred from taking advantage of this legislation for fear of publicity.

<p>I beg to move, in page 21, line 34, after "England," to insert:
<q> or has property situated in England.</q>
The object of this Amendment is to fill a gap which I believe exists in the Bill, relating to persons who may make use of the proposed relief. At present, the Bill applies only to persons who ordinarily reside in England, carry on business in England or are members of firms which do so. On the other hand, there are people who, but for the war, would have been ordinarily resident here, but who may have been evacuated to Scotland, Ireland or elsewhere. I know a number of such cases in which the only income arises from property here. Their only liabilities, apart from their day-to-day expenses, are in connection with that property. One can say that they have ceased to be ordinarily resident in England. I believe that this difficulty is solved for Income Tax purposes by such people being regarded as resident for the greater part of the year. It seems unfortunate that those people should, by accident, be deprived of the advantage of this Measure available in other cases.<br/>
I think it would be better if the provision in regard to businesses and firms were left out, and the Bill applied merely to individuals in respect of their private obligations. There might be more logic in it. As it is, there is an arbitrary distinction between people who have property here, because they are carrying on business, and who are entitled to this relief and other people who may be equally deserving, but who because they are not carrying on business, although their property and its liabilities are here, cannot do so. I hope that the Attorney-General will give a sympathetic consideration to removing this distinction from the Bill.</p>

<p>I hope that I shall consider this Amendment and all others sympathetically, but I am not sure that I can consider this Amendment a good one. The proper jurisdiction, or rather the most convenient, in cases of this kind, is the jurisdiction of the place where the majority of the creditors are. We want to try to get all these people to agree, and we have done our best to arrive at that result by taking those who are either ordinarily resident here or have business here. "Ordinary residence" will probably mean the place where the rent liability arises, and where the tradesmen will present their bills. Of course, we cannot satisfy everybody, but I think the arrangement which we propose will satisfy the maximum number of creditors. Obviously if a man is carrying on business in a place, his creditors will be likely to be found there also. For a man who is fortunate enough to live in Scotland and to have his business in England, we thought it right that he ought to come under the Bill, because this is the place where his affairs would have to be wound up. I can relieve my hon. Friend of anxiety on one point. Perhaps he would look at Sub-section (1) of this Clause. I think those words meet one of the points which he made. Apart from that, if we accepted the Amendment, it would produce the result that a man living in Scotland who happened to have some small piece of property in England would not come under the Bill, and the creditors in England of a debtor in Scotland could not start proceedings.</p>

This Amendment deals with a point which was raised by the hon.

We hope that the possibilities which he contemplated will not materialise. I therefore think it is a good point.

I have put down this Amendment in order to stress the desirability of this legislation being brought into operation as quickly as possible. It is now some weeks since I put it upon the Order Paper, and the Bill was brought from the other House a month ago. The war is impinging more and more harshly, naturally and inevitably, upon a great many people, and the operations of the Attorney-


General's colleague, the President of the Board of Trade, in regard to the concentration of industry and many other things, are creating difficulties. The Measure ought to be applied as speedily as possible, and if there is any possibility of bringing it into operation sooner than the date which is contemplated, it would certainly be a very good thing.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 1, line 27, to leave out the words "or capital."<br/>
This Amendment, I regret, has only been put in in manuscript form. My hon. Friend the Member for Bilston (Mr. Hannah) and myself wished to put it down in the belief that the Bill was coming on next week. Its object is to secure from the President of the Board an assurance that every care will be taken to provide that capital shall be replaced if it be used in consequence of a scheme to be carried through under the provisions of the Bill. It is quite obvious that the use of income in a war-time emergency stands on an entirely different footing from the use of capital, and while there is everything to be said for diverting income that is not likely to be profitably used during the war to an urgent need of the school, it is very undesirable that capital should be used in that way unless very careful provision is made for its replacement over a period of years during the happier days of peace-time. I think that would be an object which would commend itself to everybody who believes it to be desirable to continue the trusts under which capital is held, and I hope that the President may see his way to give an assurance to the Committee that in all cases where a scheme is prepared, provision will be made for the replacement of capital to be used under the terms of this scheme, although, of course, that replacement may take place, in some cases, over a long perod of years. I do not wish to take up the time of the Committee, but I hope very much that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to give an assurance of that kind.</p>

<p>I am certain the hon. Member does not expect me to accept the Amendment as it stands, but I am very willing to assure him, as far as I can, on the point he has in mind, which is, of course, of considerable importance. Indeed, in my speech on the Second Reading of the Bill I said that I was sure the House would agree with me that it would be most undesirable to spend trust capital on current needs unless that capital could be replaced. There are various safeguards in the Bill which make it very difficult improperly or rashly to use capital without an opportunity being given to the House to raise objections. I can assure my hon. Friend that I will bear his point carefully in mind. I do not think these occasions for the use of capital will be very numerous, but where they do arise they will be subject to very careful consideration.</p>

<p>I am sorry that a better opportunity was not afforded for us to make one or two Amendments on the Committee stage. It is quite clear, from the Ruling we had last week, that our opportunities for Debate would be very much curtailed. So far as I am concerned, I can only say that if one agrees with the principle of the Bill, the Bill itself is an effective instrument to achieve that purpose; and I had no special occasion to want to put down Amendments in Committee. As I tried to make clear last week, I do not sympathise with the general purposes of the Bill. It is not my intention, however, to be obstructive at this stage.<br/>
There is a great deal of feeling about this matter. Anyone who has studied the controversy in educational journals during the last six months will know that there is a large body of opinion that the time

has arrived for the public schools of Great Britain to be drastically remodelled. I hope that that opinion will soon find expression in pressure upon the Government. I do not agree that these are things that ought necessarily to be left until after the war. There are very grave reasons why they should be dealt with during the war. One of the main reasons why the public schools of Great Britain should be reorganised is that that would reassure people that desirable changes are taking place in the social structure of Great Britain. That would be a contribution to the maintenance of morale behind the war effort. There is also a great body of opinion, which is not sufficiently articulate, that the public schools should be allowed to die a natural death. Some would like them to die a little more violently.</p>

<p>I agree that the discussion on the Third Reading is bound to be much narrower than that on the Second Reading. It was impossible to discuss the Bill on the Second Reading, and our difficulties are bound to be greater now. I appreciate that; and I shall not come into conflict with your Ruling, Sir, for a moment. As I said on the Second Reading, it appears to be more in order to praise this Bill than to condemn it. But I hope that the Government will seek an early opportunity of meeting a representative body of educational opinion on this matter&#x2014;which has not been done, I regret to say, on this occasion&#x2014;and try to bring about a reconstruction of the public schools system in accordance with civilised and intelligent needs.</p>

<p>I sympathise with my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Bevan) in his inability to discuss the possibility of keeping the public schools alive. He has spoken of their dying a natural death. I should not be surprised if he would like to see them die a violent death. This Bill is of narrow scope, and he is precluded from starting an argument, in which I should have been delighted to take part, as to the merits or otherwise of the public schools. This is a limited Measure, to give public schools power to apply capital


which is extremely necessary for their continued existence. That capital, as provided by a number of benevolent well-wishers and well-doers of the schools, might be very well disposed of in accordance with the terms of the Bill. I happen to be one of the governors of a school which has a number of trusts that have been provided for it from various sources. I am sure that the donors of the money would have been only too glad that this Bill should pass, and that the school, which is doing very useful work, should have power to apply the money to immediate and pressing needs. I welcome the Bill, which I think will be of very considerable use to the public schools.</p>
