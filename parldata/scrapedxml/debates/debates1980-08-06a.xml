<p>I have to inform the House that yesterday, together with other right hon. and hon. Members, I attended upon Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother to deliver the House's message of congratulation on her eightieth birthday. I have received the following answer from Her Majesty, signed by her own hand:
<q>My Lords and Members of the House of Commons:</q>
<q>I thank you for your messages of congratulations on my 80th birthday and I am deeply touched by the very kind sentiments that you have expressed.</q>
<q>Eight decades is certainly a considerable span. During this time a great deal of history has unfolded and in many ways our lives have been transformed. New discoveries, new inventions, new outlooks continually challenge the established order. But I am happy to feel that there is one constant factor: the good sense, loyalty and patriotism of the people of our land.</q>
<q>During the war The King and I, on our visits round the country, were sustained and inspired by the steadfastness, courage and compassion shown by our people. It is encouraging to find today that in our schools and universities and among the younger generation these same qualities live on.</q>
<q>I feel deeply grateful to have been given the opportunity to serve our beloved country in some small way and through the years, in peace and in war, I have been always helped and uplifted by the love of my family, the loyalty and understanding of our people, and by my faith in Almighty God.</q>
<q>Once again, may I thank you all from my heart for your very kind messages on my birthday.</q>
<q>ELIZABETH R</q></p>

<p>My right hon. Friend discussed with the convention on 20 June the need to bring the level of current expenditure in 1980&#x2013;81 back to the level assumed in the rate support grant settlement, and gave notice of the need for further reductions in 1980&#x2013;81. My right hon. Friend has also concluded that he must ask authorities to plan to reduce expenditure in 1981&#x2013;82 to a level 2 per cent. below the volume assumed in the rate support grant settlement for 1980&#x2013;81.</p>

<p>Does the Under-Secretary accept that there will be a great deal of anxiety about the further reductions in public spending because of the rapidly mounting levels of unemployment? Would it not be sensible to take a more flexible view, given the damage that has been done because of the ever-increasing number of people who have been thrown out of work? Will the hon. Gentleman give a categoric assurance that there will not be new legislative powers to inhibit


the freedom of local authorities to increase the level of public services by the use of rates?</p>

<p>The taking of further legislative powers will depend upon the attitude of local authorities towards a reasonable level of expenditure. If local authorities abide by the figures proposed for 1981&#x2013;82, it will mean that they will spend more in real terms than they did in 1977&#x2013;78. That must be taken into
account.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that costly experience shows that there is little, if any, connection between the level of local services and manning levels? Does he agree that the appalling statistics of empire building announced yesterday by the Lothian region offer, not hope to the people of that region, but more misery for the wretched ratepayers?</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for that reply. Do I take it that there will be no cuts in the services provided, and that that will apply to ear,

<p>Is my hon.

<p>I am not sure that that is so. There may be some confusion in the minds of some hon.

<p>The first part of the hon. Gentleman's comment is incorrect. In the two weeks that elapsed certain liabilities may have been incurred, but they were nothing like the total amount that is now being questioned.

<p>At their request, the Secretary of State and I met the chairmen of health boards on 25 July.

<p>What does the hon. Gentleman mean by "essential services"? Do he and his right hon.

There is major progress in Glengarnock and there is the St. Enoch's project, involving &#x00A3;40 million and 1,500 new jobs. That is action on unemployment.</p>

<p>I have received the report, and copies have been placed in the Library. The report confirms that the initial purchasers of the land made a considerable profit out of the transaction, realised very soon after the purchase, and for this reason the transaction has attracted criticism. It confirms that the sale of the land at Robroyston was carried out regularly in accordance with the prescribed procedures, and that the responsible officials performed their respective duties conscientiously and with care. It finds that the relevant decisions of the regional and district councils on the planning applications made to them were made with care and a due sense of responsibility. The report criticises the dispersal of responsibility for conducting sales of property occupied for Health Service purposes and makes recommendations for changes in procedure.

<p>With regard to earlier statements on this matter, is the Secretary of State aware that when I contacted the office of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food yesterday morning I was informed that no statement was to be made yesterday afternoon on the question of aid to the fishing industry? It is therefore untrue to suggest that a ministerial statement on this matter could not be made because of the actions of the Opposition. Is the Secretary of State further aware that when &#x00A3;3 million of aid was announced there was a proper

ministerial statement? If the intention is to make the announcement during the debate on the EEC, that will be wholly unacceptable.</p>

In view of that, and the fact that on this matter Scottish law is different from English law, will he undertake to ask the Law Commission in Scotland to consider producing a separate report on this problem?</p>

<p>At this stage the English Law Commission has produced only a working paper. It has yet to produce any final recommendations. I agree with the hon.

<p>I announced today's business yesterday&#x2014;[<i>Interruption</i>]&#x2014;but as there was a certain amount of noise at the time not all hon. Members may have heard what I said. It may be for the convenience of the House if I make a fuller statement now.<br/>
The business for today is as follows:<br/>
Consideration of Lords amendments to the Housing Bill, to the Tenants' Rights etc. (Scotland) Bill and to the Health Services Bill.<br/>
Motions on the horticulture and agriculture grant orders, and on the Capital Grant (Variation) Orders.<br/>
Motion on Commission documents on fisheries.<br/>
Motions on the British Aerospace (Borrowing Powers) (Increase of Limit) Order and on the Financial Limits National Enterprise Board and the Secretary of State) Order.<br/>

Debate on procedure.<br/>
Motion on financial assistance to Opposition parties.<br/>
On Friday 8 August, it will be proposed that the House should rise for the Summer Adjournment until Monday 27 October.<br/>
Consideration of any Lords messages which may be received.</p>

<p>First, the business that the right hon. Gentleman has announced for today, particularly in the light of events in the House over the last 24 hours, is an absurdity and an outrage to the House. It is quite impossible for business of this nature to be pushed through on the basis that the Government previously proposed. That is why we urged the right hon. Gentleman to take account of what we said last night. It would have been better if he had waited; then he would have been able to make his statement to the House on a better basis.<br/>
If any hon. Member looks through the business on the Order Paper today he will see that it is impossible for the Government to force through that business on the basis on which the Government have presented it. If the Government were to attempt to push it through on that basis it would be an outrage to the proceedings of the House of Commons. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman and the Government understand that that is the Opposition's view on the matter.<br/>
I understand also that there have been discussions in order to try to secure changes on the proposals that have been made to the House on the Housing Bill. There would also be some connected implications for the Scottish legislation, which it is also proposed to discuss. Therefore, I hope that a statement will be made, presumably by the Secretary of State for the Environment, either now or a little later in the proceedings. That will also give some time for the discussion.<br/>
We are proposing a method by which the Government may be enabled to escape from the situation that they have created. Many hon. Members were not present on Monday night, but the Government were warned of all the difficulties then&#x2014;before we started these discussions. If the Government had been prepared to take account of our warnings on Monday, many of these difficulties could have been avoided. I hope that the Leader of the House will be prepared to look afresh at the extent of the business


that he has proposed for today and to try to postpone some of that business until tomorrow. That would be the sensible course to take.<br/>
In the meantime, I hope that the Government and the Secretary of State for the Environment will be prepared, after further discussions if they wish, to make a statement that will enable us to proceed with some of that business. On the basis on which the Government have so far proceeded, it would be intolerable for the dignity and proper conduct of the House of Commons for this business to proceed.</p>

<p>The heavy business programme today has been created by the direct action of the Opposition. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] The Opposition were perfectly entitled, as they did&#x2014;and I have never questioned this&#x2014;to use parliamentary procedures to extend the debate on the Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill so that it went into the next day's business.</p>

<p>Yes, it has been done before. I am not saying that there is not a right to do that. I accept that there is a right to do that. But the right hon. Gentleman must accept the natural consequences of his actions. If the Opposition choose to use those procedures they will end up with an overcrowded timetable, which is not desirable in the interests of the House. The right hon. Gentleman has had his say and I have had my say. [AN HON. MEMBER:] "Sit down."] No; I have one other point to make.<br/>
I turn to the second point made by the right hon. Gentleman. It is vital that, apart from the Government and the Opposition exercising their legitimate rights, which I accept absolutely, we should proceed with these matters in accordance with the dignity and traditions of the House. If there is a possibility of some accommodation being reached on these matters, through the usual channels&#x2014;an accommodation that will satisfy the parties involved and will be in accordance with the dignity of the House&#x2014;I shall certainly support it.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1775806" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-08-06a.525.3" hansard_membership_id="4533" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14997" speakername="Mr. Foot" colnum="525" time="">
<p>I certainly hope that the House will be able to proceed. I still

think, and I believe that anyone who looks at the matter objectively will see, that the full programme proposed by the Government for transaction today is intolerable. Anyone who looks at it in the light of the proper conduct of the House of Commons, to which the right hon. Gentleman appealed, will see that it is impossible for the House to carry through all that business. Some of that business could, without any disturbance or addition to the Government's difficulties, be postponed until tomorrow. I have no doubt that we can have discussions about that and reach a perfectly reasonable result. But it would mean that the amount of business today would have to be curtailed from what is proposed.<br/>
I think that much the best course would be to let the discussions proceed. The right hon. Gentleman knows that discussions will be proceeding. I hope, at least, that they will be proceeding, and that a statement will be made at a very early date. Of course, we shall have to judge whether we think that statement is satisfactory. Such a statement will be the natural consequence of the action that was taken by the House of Commons. That statement was not offered to us before. We think that it will be offered now. We hope that it will be offered in proper terms. If so, I believe that it will assist the House of Commons to do its business.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for those helpful contributions. I entirely agree that an agreement that respects the rights of the Government and the Opposition&#x2014;I fully accept that the Opposition have rights in the House&#x2014;is desirable. Such a statement will be in accordance with the dignity of the House and with the maxim, which I think is respected by the right hon.

he said that the proposed business for Friday was the Adjournment of the House. I thought that that had been decided by the House, and was no longer a proposal.<br/>
Secondly, is it not correct that there is a Standing Order of the House that prohibits the Second Reading of the Consolidated Fund (Appropriation) Bill being taken on the same day as the Committee and remaining stages? Is it not correct that the extension that permitted yesterday's events was a Government motion to adjust that Standing Order for reasons which, frankly, I do not understand?</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. In view of what the Leader of the House said and the remarks made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot) in response to some kind of mumbo-jumbo that has been taking place, would it not be in accordance with the decorum and dignity of the House, which has so often been trundled out by the Leader of the House, for you to suspend the sitting so that those of us who want to know what is taking place between the various spokesmen may know precisely what is likely to take place when the sitting resumes?</p>

<p>I should like to ask the Leader of the House two questions on the business. First, what has happened to the fisheries statement? Because of what happened during Scottish questions, I think that we are entitled to ask this question. Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that in reply to my right hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Grimond), the Secretary of State for Scotland implied that there was to have been a statement on fisheries yesterday? The right hon. Gentleman must be aware that no such notice was given to Opposition parties in the normal

Will he come clean on what happened? When are we to get the statement?<br/>
Secondly, as the right hon. Gentleman is a believer in a bicameral legislature, if the discussions between the usual channels involve some acceptance of the policy changes and improvements made in the other place to the Housing Bill, does he not think it unwise to proceed further with the Tenants' Rights Etc. (Scotland) Bill and to leave it unimproved if some improvements to the Housing Bill are accepted?</p>

<p>In the statement that I have just made there is provision for a debate on fisheries. In this situation that may be the most convenient position for any statement to be made. I shall certainly look into that.<br/>
As for giving undertakings about the making of a statement, as the right hon. Gentleman will recognise, the situation is somewhat fluid. I cannot give an undertaking that a statement will be made at any particular time, but I certainly take on board what the right hon. Gentleman said.<br/>
On the Housing Bill, it is vital that Scotland and England should be treated equally in these matters. Therefore, it is right that the interests of Scotland should be taken into account on an equal basis with the interests of England.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. It will be within your recollection, if not that of the Leader of the House, that there was some controversy during Scottish questions about whether a statement on aid to the fishing industry had or had not been made yesterday. In response to questions, the Secretary of State for Scotland said that any reports in today's press about money for the industry were purely speculative and that no statement had been made. In the Aberdeen <i>Evening Express</i> of last night which I received this morning, there was not only a full statement on the amount of money that was to be made available to the industry but comments by members of the fishing industry on what the response to that sum should be.</p>

<p>I was about to utter my last sentence on this issue, Mr. Speaker. I was about to say that the Aberdeen <i>Evening Express,</i> in its stop press, carried two short lines that told readers that the statement had been withdrawn. Surely you can rule, Mr. Speaker, following a point of order, that a Secretary of State cannot say to the House that no statement has been issued and that reports are purely speculative when clearly statements have been issued. It is unfair and an abuse of the procedures of the House that statements should be withdrawn in the certain knowledge that questions were on the Order Paper&#x2014;namely, in Scottish questions&#x2014;dealing with the fishing industry in Scotland.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I think that I am right in saying that you are responsible for the Votes and Proceedings that we receive each day. The Leader of the House made a statement in which, inadvertently, he made a false statement. He said that he made a statement yesterday. He did not. Those who were present yesterday will know that at 2.32 pm the Government moved, That this House do now adjourn. That proposal was carried with acclamation. No one shouted "No". Although I understand that the Chairman of Ways and Means is going to suggest that he did not put the Question, the fact is that the House adjourned at 2.32 because there was no voice heard against the Government's proposal.<br/>
On reading the Votes and Proceedings and the press&#x2014;the information has been given conveniently to the press&#x2014;I find that the House adjourned at nine minutes to 3 o'clock. Nineteen minutes elapsed between 2.32 and nine minutes to 3 o'clock. I have never known&#x2014;I have not been here very long but I have been here long enough&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear".] I have never known an occupant of the Chair to wait 19 minutes to put

the Question when there has not been any opposition.<br/>
You came into the Chamber, Mr. Speaker, without knowledge of that which had taken place previously. Of course I know that the Chair is never wrong. I know that the Chair cannot be wrong. I do not suggest, Mr. Speaker, that you were wrong. However, you did not know what had happened. You came into the Chamber after 2.32, Mr. Speaker, and you took the chair. You called the Leader of the House and his shadow, my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot) &#x2014;I am not sure in which order they were called&#x2014;but, with respect, the House was not sitting.<br/>
You were not in the Chair, Mr. Speaker. You could not call the Leader of the House or my right hon. Friend because the Question had been put and agreed to. I know that it is convenient that the Government give the time that the House rises to the press and I know, Mr. Speaker, that you are not responsible for that. However, it is carried in the press today that the House adjourned at nine minutes to 3 o'clock. It is wrong to put that in the Votes and Proceedings, because anyone with ears, who was there at the time, knows that we adjourned at 2.32 pm.</p>

The sequence of events is not quite as the hon. Gentleman described them. As soon as the Government Whip had moved the Adjournment of the House the Deputy Speaker proposed the Question in the usual manner. However, he did not take the voices. The fact that some hon.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. A matter arises from the Scottish fisheries question, upon which I hope you can help the House. Ministers and other Conservative Members have given the impression that there was an intention to make a statement yesterday about fisheries, and that the making of that statement was prevented by the action of the Opposition parties. It would help us, Mr. Speaker, if you would confirm the firm impression that I have, namely, that no such notice was given, either to you or to your office. Will you also confirm that neither a Minister nor the Leader of the House took any of the usual steps to inform you that a statement was to be made? From my knowledge of the situation, I believe that no such steps were taken. However, it would help, Mr. Speaker, if you made clear to hon. Members and to those outside that, rightly or wrongly, there was no specific intention to make a fisheries statement yesterday and that such a statement was not prevented by the events that followed.</p>

<p>Did any Minister give the Leader of the House any information yesterday that might have led him to believe that a statement would be made on education, or on fisheries?

Yesterday, it seemed that the Secretary of State was anxious to make a statement. Since he is not taking the opportunity to make a statement today, are we to believe that that anxiety has evaporated? Perhaps the Leader of the House will inform me that I am wrong, and that he is going to make a statement later. In the absence of any statements, will we have to rely, as we did last week in terms of the abolition of the Clegg Commission, on planted written questions in order to ensure that important Government statements and policy announcements are made?</p>

They do not expect the Government to get the motions through at the tail end of parliamentary exhaustion. Will he discuss through the usual channels the desirability of their being deferred for consideration until after the Summer Recess?</p>

<p>There are four motions involved, and it is the intention that they should be taken two at a time. That will involve a debate of one and a half hours each. It is quite normal for motions of this kind to be taken after the end of the main business.</p>

<p>Is it not obvious that the business of the House is in chaos


because the Government have attempted to cram far too much business through the House, even in this extended Session? We know that there are many statements that the Government wish to make, and I hope that the Secretary of State for Scotland will apologise for saying that he was prevented from making a statement when obviously he was not prevented at all. We understand that these matters are to be considered, but it is not only the Opposition but Back Benchers who have rights in this House. There are many Back Benchers who wish to say something. We understand that there will be discussions. Can the Leader of the House tell us when he expects the discussions to finish and when he will come to the House again to make a further statement to enable us to treat the business of the House with the dignity about which everyone is so keen?</p>

<p>I do not think that we are in a state of chaos. The Opposition may be in a state of chaos, but that is another matter. There appears to be a little local difficulty and I hope that it can be resolved by reasonable conversations through the usual channels. If it is possible, I always prefer to settle these strongly felt disputes on a rational basis. I am well aware of the rights of Bank Benchers. The Leader of the House has a duty to get Government business through&#x2014;everyone accepts that&#x2014;but throughout this year I have done my best to ensure that Back Benchers enjoy their full rights.</p>

<p>Is the Leader of the House aware that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has today used a planted question to make a statement of major financial importance to Northern Ireland, indicating a transfer of resources from education, health and social services, and a cutback in public expenditure in the Province?

Friends suggested that the House should be suspended while the matter was considered. You have already suspended the House for a few minutes, and I realise that that is not a normal occurrence. I am not suggesting that suspending the House is a normal procedure in any sense. But I believe that if you, Mr. Speaker,


are willing to suspend the House for half an hour, that might provide the best opportunity to obtain a proper means by which the House can proceed in an orderly manner. We have already had one suspension, and if we do not follow my suggestion we may find ourselves in further difficulty. I suggest that the House should be suspended until 5 pm or 5.15 pm. By that means we should be able to find a method by which we could proceed. I think that the House will find that that is the most reasonable way to move forward. It would be fair to Back Bench Members who have a paramount interest in the matter.</p>

your reticence in wishing to refrain, if possible, from suspending the proceedings of the House. I understand that that is not a normal procedure. However, I seriously suggest that if we are to deal with the matter in a sensible manner my proposal is the most likely way to achieve that. I do not believe that a series of applications under Standing Order No. 9 is the best way to proceed.<br/>
There is another difficulty. My right hon. Friend the Member for Craigton wishes to make an application under Standing Order No. 9 on another matter. He has a right to do so. We have given notice on that matter previously. However, he is also concerned in the discussions on another matter.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. On 18 July, when the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, placed the appropriation accounts for Northern Ireland before the House, he gave an assurance that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would make a statement about public expenditure cuts amounting to about &#x00A3;92 million. On that occasion I described the appropriation order as a fiction because we were asked to approve something that the Government were abandoning. The Secretary of State should have made a statement. I asked the Leader of the House earlier whether he would make a statement, but he said that there was no need to do so. I subsequently discovered that the Secretary of State had made a statement about the public expenditure cuts attached to an answer&#x2014;</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. With respect to my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot), he made a suggestion which might suit the two Front Benches but I am more concerned with the Back Benchers, who will not be involved in any discussions. Eventually, we shall have to come to a guillotine motion. However

we were to have had five and a half hours, I think, to discuss Lords amendments Nos. 1 to 116. At the present rate, it looks as though it will be 9 p.m. before we even reach them. Unless Back Benchers have the chance to move manuscript amendments to the proposed guillotine motion, we shall have no time at all to discuss any of these amendments. This is a very important matter.<br/>
Therefore, if you, Mr. Speaker, cannot agree to the suggestion of my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale for an adjournment, may I ask the Leader of the House, through you, Mr. Speaker, to accept an adjournment so that we can get together to discuss this matter? I suggest that we are entitled to have the five and a half hours for the first group of amendments&#x2014;the Government's proposal&#x2014;one and a half hours for the second group of amendments, and another one and a half hours for the next group, irrespective of when we start.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. You will see from the Order Paper that my name is at the head of those of a group of hon. Members who have put a block on the Eastbourne Harbour Bill. Two of those hon. Members, myself and my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Crayford (Mr. Wellbeloved) have written to the promoters, at their offer to discuss the matter of the Bill. We would not wish in any way to prejudge a meeting. The fact that the Bill is on the Order Paper and has been announced by the Leader of the House as being taken preempts the rights of Back Benchers to be able to discuss private business in the traditional way of the House of Commons.<br/>
Therefore, it seems to me that this is a factor which ought to enter into the views of the Leader of the House when the discussions are taking place through the usual channels. This is an entirely new factor which no one has mentioned so far, and it seems to me that the suggestion of my right hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Foot) should he allowed to proceed&#x2014;that is, that the sitting should be suspended for three-quarters of an hour so that the rights of six Back Benchers, at least, can be taken into account in adjusting the business.</p>

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, following discussions through the usual channels I would like to make a Business Statement.<br/>
The business for today will now be as follows:<br/>
Consideration of Lords amendments to the Housing Bill;<br/>
Opposed private business;<br/>
British Aerospace Borrowing Powers (Increase of Limit) and Financial Limits (National Enterprise Board and Secretary of State) Orders.<br/>
The business for tomorrow will be:<br/>
Consideration of Lords amendments to the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Bill and the Health Services Bill;<br/>

<p>I thank the Leader of the House for rearranging the business. I certainly think that that will greatly assist the House, because I believe, as I previously indicated, that the business for today was impossible for the House to deal with.<br/>
In the matter of the Housing Bill I suggest that the best way to proceed is for the Secretary of State for the Environment to make a statement before we proceed to the guillotine motion. That would be the most agreeable way for the House to deal with the matter. If the Secretary of State is prepared to make a statement at that stage, I believe that the House will be able to embark upon the Housing Bill with a clear understanding of what the Government are proposing.<br/>
I hope that the proposal made by the Leader of the House and my proposal dealing with the way in which we should approach the Housing Bill will be satisfactory to the House. As a result of these discussions I hope that we shall be able to overcome some of the difficulties with which the House had to contend earlier today.</p>

<p>I should like to draw the attention of the Leader of the House to question No. 20 on 10 July by the hon.

Gentleman was given an undertaking by the Minister of State that before the Summer Recess an answer would be given to that question. That answer was given today and I have absolutely no quarrel with it. But in that answer there is a statement of Government policy on financial arrangements in Northern Ireland.<br/>
Tied in with the answer relating to De Lorean there is a statement that there is to be a &#x00A3;10 million cutback on education, a &#x00A3;10 million cutback on health and social services and &#x00A3;10 million to be added to what are known as protective services in Northern Ireland. Does the Leader of the House regard it as fair to the people of Northern Ireland that a statement of such magnitude should be issued in that way without Northern Ireland Members having an opportunity to question the Secretary of State on the implications?

<q>the announcement today that the Salford engineering firm of Sir James Farmer Norton has been placed in the hands of the receiver and is to be offered for sale.</q>

<p>Certainly, Mr. Speaker. The importance is that many of these skilled men, who are in danger of dismissal, will not return and will be lost to the industry for ever. That would be a tremendous loss to the country as a whole.<br/>
This morning I spoke to the AUEW representative for the area, who told me that every morning he is frightened to look at his post because a new announcement of a closure takes place every day. The whole city is being denuded of employment.<br/>
Normally, when a liquidator takes over there is a subsequent closure and all those concerned are made redundant. That is what might happen in this case. This is a textile engineering firm, and there is little chance of its being taken over as a running concern because the Government, through their high interest rates, have made the pound overvalued, and the company cannot sell its products. The firm produces textile machinery, and if it falls&#x2014;along with others on the danger list&#x2014;the industry will virtually collapse. Therefore, this is a subject that deserves precedence over all other issues today.</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 9, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter which falls wholly within ministerial responsibilities and which should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the duty of the Government to publish immediately the criteria against which they will judge whether local authorities are to be penalised by a reduction in their supplementary rate support grant.</q>
This is a matter of complexity, but it is also a matter of considerable democratic importance. A number of local authorities are about to be punished for what the Government call over-spending. Yet the rules that define that offence have not been made available to local authorities. Therefore, at the moment it is impossible for them to know how they can avoid those penalties. The Opposition believe that it is urgently necessary for local authorities to be provided with that information.<br/>
The Secretary of State has already announced that he will withhold grants from 20 authorities, and he has described guidelines under which and within which every local authority could be penalised. The guidelines cover 241 authorities out of a possible total of 450, and there is no way in which those authorities can know how they can avoid the penalties and how they can receive the full amount of rate support grant to which they are entitled.<br/>
Responding to your wish that there be the briefest of discussions, Mr. Speaker, I shall describe neither the uncertainties of local authorities which put them under the most deplorable and intolerable conditions nor how the Secretary of State may use his discretion in a way that I would describe as arbitrary and possibly capricious. I simply repeat that at this moment local authorities cannot be told and do not know how they can avoid penalties with which they have been threatened by the Secretary of State.<br/>
To the Opposition it seems an elementary item of justice that the rules governing the conduct of local authorities, the breaking of which results in punishment, and the observance of which results in absolution, should be published in time for local authorities to respond to the Secretary of State's threats in the knowledge of the penalties and offences.<br/>
On many occasions this week the Opposition have pressed the Government to make clear those rules. The information necessary to do so is now at their disposal as local authorities made new returns for spending available to the Department by Friday last week. We asked the Government to make clear those rules at Question Time and during the debate on the Summer Adjournment. It is an elementary item of justice that the offence should be publicly defined. That will only happen if the House debates the matter at the first possible moment.</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 9, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter which falls wholly within ministerial responsibilities and which should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the question of British aid to the Caribbean in the aftermath of Hurricane Allen.</q>
This hurricane is one of unprecedented force and has affected islands such as St. Kitts, St. Lucia, Dominica, Barbados and Jamaica&#x2014;islands in which our constituents' relatives live. I note from the evening papers today that there are thousands of British holidaymakers on those islands whose whereabouts and welfare are not at present known. This is a tragedy that is close to people in this country. There have been deaths, and there are reports of extensive damage. This matter is important, both to those islands and to people in this country, and it should receive urgent consideration.<br/>
There is a second reason why the matter requires urgent consideration. Those islands have been badly hit by oil prices, they rely heavily on crops such as sugar and bananas, and the damage caused by a hurricane has a far greater effect than it would have in an industrialised country.<br/>
There is a final reason why the matter should be given urgent consideration. The Government have been negotiating with Jamaica about a loan to that country, but they have postponed the negotiations because of the Government's view of Jamaica's economy and because of the difference of opinion between Jamaica and the International Monetary Fund. In the light of what has happened yesterday and today, I believe that this matter warrants urgent consideration by the House.<br/>
Elections are due to be held in Jamaica in the autumn, and it is possible that high winds in Jamaica and elsewhere could have not only physical repercussions, but political repercussions also. It would be wrong to withhold aid, and we should have an opportunity to discuss the matter. Consideration can be given under Standing Order No. 9 to the administrative responsibilities of Ministers, and consideration should be given to whether there is any other possibility of Parliament discussing the matter urgently.


Clearly, between now and Friday there is no possibility of hat arising.<br/>
Urgent aid should be given to Jamaica and to the other islands that are affected. This is a matter for urgent consideration, particularly in view of political developments, and on that basis I seek leave to move the Adjournment of the House under Standing Order No. 9.</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 9, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the decision of Her Majesty's Government to spend &#x00A3;<i>5</i> billion on a Trident nuclear missile.</q>
The matter is undoubtedly specific in the sense that the Government have definitely made the decision and have specifically said that the cost will be &#x00A3;<i>5</i> billion spread over five years&#x2014;not &#x00A3;4.9 billion, not &#x00A3;51 billion, but &#x00A3;5 billion exactly. It will probably be twice that figure before we get the thing. In that sense, Mr. Speaker, you might argue that it is not specific.<br/>
The matter is certainly important. Its importance cannot be exaggerated. At a time when the Government are actively engaged in slashing expenditure on all the social services&#x2014;on housing, health, education, school meals and home helps&#x2014;when they are set to rob the old-age pensioners this coming November of about &#x00A3;100 million by deferring the payment of their pensions increase for a fortnight, when council house building is to be virtually drawn to a halt, and when total national output is on the slide, it is the height of folly and irresponsibility for the Government to commit themselves unequivocally, irrevocably and come what may to this extravagant nonsense. The outcome of a referendum would support the views that we are advancing.<br/>
The House and the electorate have been kept in the dark about these matters. The Tory Party's claim that it believes in open government is shown by this exercise to be the nonsense that it is.</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 9, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the situation in Vanuatu, formerly the New Hebrides.</q>
This is a serious application. It concerns a subject that I have now been raising in the House for well over a year. The situation in Vanuatu is now more serious than it has ever been. It is important, because the House was misled on 24 July by the Minister of State when he said:
<q>British and French troops, acting together, carried out an operation to restore the authority of legitimate Government on the island of Santo, thus putting an end to the eight-week rebellion. The operation appears so far to have been a complete success."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 24 July 1980; Vol. 989, c. 801.]</q>
We know that the operation was almost a complete failure and that the Royal Marines have taken no action of any sort to preserve the integrity of the newly independent country of Vanuatu. It is especially urgent in view of the news this week that there has been a landing of a large quantity of automatic weapons on the island, almost certainly by American interests, in league with the French residents on Vanuatu and with Jimmy Stevens, that are intent on disrupting the territorial integrity of Vanuatu. The matter is particularly urgent because the British soldiers who are stationed on the island failed completely to prevent this disruption of this newly independent Commonwealth country.<br/>
It is important that we have a debate on this matter, because there is a real danger that the military conflict that is about to grow on the island of Santo will be one between British and French soldiers. The French are there to protect their citizens, many of whom are actively backing the rebel regime, and the Royal Marines are there to protect the integrity of the new Commonwealth country of Vanuatu. There is a real danger that the conflict will worsen.<br/>
It is for those reasons that I beg leave to have a debate on the issue, so that the Minister may tell us what the present situation is and give us an assurance that the British troops will remain there as long as the French troops to carry out our obligations to this newly independent Commonwealth country that desperately needs our help.</p>

<q>the report of the Health and Safety Executive on the leakage of radioactive liquid into the ground of British Nuclear Fuels Limited, Wind-scale, 15 March 1979.</q>
The matter is important, because health and safety matters are rarely debated in the House. They are of great importance, because many more days are lost through industrial injury than through strike action and industrial action. However, the Government have wasted many hours of parliamentary time with legislation on industrial injury.<br/>
The matter is urgent, because the House should debate the issues that are raised in the report on the procedures, methods and lack of safety that led to radioactive contamination of a level that would have killed anyone who had been placed in the soil that was contaminated.<br/>
The matter is urgent, because we have a Government who are hell-bent on embarking on a programme of 10 fast-breeder reactors with a Nuclear Installations Inspectorate that is below strength


because of Government cuts in health and safety expenditure as well as other expenditure.<br/>
The matter is important and urgent, because we want to ensure that we do not have, through laxity or failure to meet standards, a Three-Mile Island incident in Britain. It behoves Parliament to ensure that the report does not, like many other health and safety reports, merely gather dust without any debate.<br/>
Parliament would seem to be prepared to debate such urgent and important matters only when a grave accident occurs, with consequent loss of life and limb. Radioactivity is a serious issue. The House should discuss it, so that suitable publicity can be given and remedial action can be taken. In particular, the Health and Safety Executive appears to be so complacent that no prosecutions are being undertaken.</p>

<q>the danger to the freedom of the press due to the decision of the House of Lords in the case of the British Steel Corporation v. Granada.</q>
The matter is urgent, because it has been reported today that Granada cannot comply with the ruling that the House of Lords gave last week. It cannot name the British Steel Corporation employee who leaked BSC's confidential documents.<br/>
Since your previous ruling, Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has stated that the Law Commission's report&#x2014;which had been expected by the end of the year&#x2014;will have to be reconsidered. Indeed, the report may not appear until later. In addition, since your ruling, the Attorney-General has stated that the House of Lords will not give reasons for its sad judgment until the next Session. In the meantime the vacation court will sit. The journalists involved, those who employ them, and other journalists, are at grave risk.<br/>
The matter is both urgent and important. I had no hesitation about renewing my application under Standing Order No. 9.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I understood from the Leader of the House that the Secretary of State for the Environment would make a statement on the progress that he hopes to make and on the changes that he will make to the Housing Bill. It would be convenient to have that statement now.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. The House will be aware that Lords amendments

to the Housing Bill are tabled for consideration later today. They will significantly widen the exclusions from the right to buy. Not only will sheltered properties be excluded; in addition, those properties designed or specially adapted for old people will be excluded.<br/>
The Government have considered the amendments and have decided to widen the exclusions so that genuine elderly persons' accommodation is excluded. We shall accordingly invite the House&#x2014;with your permission, Mr. Speaker, and with that of the House&#x2014;to consider a manuscript amendment to that effect.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Most of us wish to make progress. It would help if the Secretary of State were to state clearly and categorically that the Government will no longer pursue the sale of those properties that are specifically designed for the use of, and occupation by, the elderly. Will he confirm that the will of the House of Lords is to be endorsed, on the Government's advice?<br/>
Secondly, will he confirm the statement made by the Leader of the House, namely, that that which applies in England should apply to Scotland? Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that it will apply to Scotland? Will he also confirm that a suitable measure will be brought forward to ensure that this substantial concession applies to Scotland as well as to England?</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker. I wish to comment on this very important statement. Concessions have been wrung out of the Government at a very late


stage in the Session. I believe that those concessions could well have been improved upon. I hope that the Tory Government&#x2014;especially Tarzan himself&#x2014;understands that the House has ways and means of trying to extract such concessions. It is possible to do that without a parliamentary majority. The events of the past 24 hours demonstrate that. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues in the Cabinet understand that if the next Session lasts its full course, similar ventures may take place in order&#x2014;</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. It is not technically possible to amend the Tenants' Rights Etc. (Scotland) Bill. There is no opportunity to do so within the broad rules of order.

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I accept that the only way in which the Scottish legislation can be amended is by a new instrument, but I think that the House would agree that it would be wholly unreasonable if the Government promised to prohibit, or at least not enforce, the sale of old people's dwellings in Scotland as soon as they had legislative time, but then allowed these dwellings to be sold in large numbers throughout the summer. We need an assurance that the Government's intention will be honoured in the spirit and the letter and that the Secretary of State will not give any authority for the sale of


property which will not be compulsorily sold when the new Bill is brought to the House.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I want to express a view on the Scottish matter. A Government Minister from Scotland is sitting on the Front Bench and it is quite intolerable for the Secretary of State for the Environment to speak on behalf of the Scots when they have a Minister here.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. You have called the Minister and you have said that points of order will come out of the time for the guillotine motion, which will take one hour. The Minister rose at 6.2 p.m. The Order Paper today on page 5396&#x2014;No. 2 Order of the Day&#x2014;states:
<q>HOUSING BILL [Allotted Day]: Consideration of Lords Amendments.</q>
Just above the sentence in bold type it says:
<q>If the Motion (Housing Bill (Allocation of Time)) is agreed to:&#x2014;At the conclusion of the Proceedings of the Housing Bill &#x2026;</q>
then we shall have the proceedings on the Eastbourne Harbour Docks Bill. Does that mean that if the motion is not agreed to by 7 pm&#x2014;and the Minister rose with only 58 minutes to go&#x2014;at 7 pm opposed Private Business must be taken? Surely this sentence cannot be put into operation,


because the motion will not be agreed by 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>According to our Standing Orders, Private Business is taken at the end of the Bill which is subject to the guillotine motion. I believe that that is made clear on the Order Paper&#x2014;that it will come at the end of the discussion on the Bill.</p>

<p>That is my understanding from the front page of the Order Paper, but that seems to contradict the statement that the guillotine motion must be agreed to before 7 pm. If it is agreed to by 7 o'clock the Private Business is put back till the end of the day. The word "if" is there. If it were not, I would not be raising this point of order.</p>

<p>The original order covers it. It is very long but I shall read it. Paragraph 8 says:
<q>Any private business which has been set down for consideration at Seven o'clock on an allotted day shall, instead of being considered as provided by Standing Orders, be considered at the conclusion of the proceedings on the Bill on that day, and paragraph (1) of Standing Order No. 3 (Exempted business) shall apply to the private business for a period of three hours from the conclusion of the proceedings on the Bill or if those proceedings are concluded before Ten o'clock for a period equal to the time elapsing between Seven o'clock and the conclusion of those proceedings.</q></p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I ask for further clarification. It seems to me that if we have agreed a motion for a guillotine, Private Business is not taken at 7 o'clock but at the end of the business that is covered by the guillotine. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) has raised a different question. If 7 o'clock arrives and at that stage we have not agreed the motion for the guillotine, we then have no motion for a guillotine, so what is there in the Standing Orders to prevent the business set down for 7 o'clock being called then?</p>

<p>The Housing Bill that we have been considering for more than six months is perhaps as far-reaching and as comprehensive a housing measure as has come before the House in the post-war period. On this side of the House we look forward to its early enactment. I do not think that anyone can reasonably deny that the Bill has been debated at great length&#x2014;both in the House and in another place.<br/>
A total of 167 hours was spent debating the Bill in this House before it went to another place. Of that time, 139 hours were spent in Committee, covering 46 Committee sittings spanning over three months. In another place there has been further detailed consideration of the Bill over a period of another 58&#x00BD; hours. To date, therefore, both Houses have spent a total of 225&#x00BD; hours discussing the Bill.<br/>
I do not believe that there are any substantive provisions that have not already been discussed at some length. Indeed, there are some provisions that may have been debated as many as seven times&#x2014;on Second Reading, Committee and Report in this House, and then on Second Reading, Committee, Report and Third Reading debate with amendments in another place.<br/>
The Opposition may no doubt refer to the number of Lords amendments for consideration by this House. The numerical total is 251, but it would be highly misleading to do what the Opposition may be tempted to do, namely, to argue against this motion by reference to the number of amendments passed in another place. Of the 251, a considerable number, 143 in all, are of a minor, technical or drafting nature.<br/>
The remaining 108 amendments can be said to relate to substantive issues, but that total includes all the consequential or drafting amendments relating to those issues. The majority of the substantive amendments have, in fact, been made to meet the points put


by hon. Members on both sides of the House and also to meet points put by bodies outside the House.</p>

<p>I am interested to learn of the reports that have been discussed. The Minister will recall that on a number of occasions the hon. Members for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean), Cheltenham (Mr. Irving) and myself have raised the issue of houses in multiple occupation. We were given to understand that a survey was being carried out in conjunction with local authorities and the Department and that a report would be produced outlining some of the conditions, such as fire precautions. On a number of occasions, both in the Chamber and in written answers, the Minister said that that report would be made available before the end of the Committee proceedings on the Bill. Can he tell me where I can obtain a copy of that report, so that even at this late stage I can consider it and be in a position to discuss it on the relevant part of the Bill? If it is not available, when will it be?</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman refers to exactly what I said he will see that it was to the effect that it was our intention to try to make that report available before the proceedings on the legislation was concluded. Unfortunately, that has not been possible. As the hon. Gentleman knows probably as well as any hon. Member, some extremely difficult and complex issues are involved. As I think he is also aware, as a result of representations that he and some of my hon. Friends have made, we have made significant progress on the legislation governing houses in multiple occupation.<br/>
We have moved amendments to meet points made by a great variety of outside bodies&#x2014;the local authority associations, the Building Societies Association, the Law Society, the Federation of Private Residents Associations and the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, among others.<br/>
The Opposition may try to make the point that it does not say too much for the Bill as originally drafted that we had to take so much account of representations made by outside bodies. However, if the right hon. Member for Birmingham,

Sparkbrook, (Mr. Hattersley) in particular seeks to make that point, I put it to him that had he been more responsive to the representations made by people both inside and outside the House, some of the legislation for which he was responsible would have been mightily improved.<br/>
We have introduced amendments to meet in whole, or at least in part, points made by many Members on both sides, in both Houses. We have met some of the points made by the hon. Members for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean) and St. Pancras, North (Mr. Stallard), as well as my hon. Friends the Members for Anglesey (Mr. Best) and Cheltenham (Mr. Irving) on matters relating to hostels. We have also brought forward amendments to meet an important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Trippier) on successor children, under the right to buy.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. Kaufman) made an important point relating to rental purchase. Points were made by my hon. Friend the Member for Petersfield (Mr. Mates) on rural areas.</p>

<p>As it seems possible that we shall not reach a debate on those amendments, I should like to register my appreciation, on behalf of my constituents and a large number of victims of these people in the North of England, for the amendments that the Government have tabled. They do not cover the whole problem but they represent a valuable safeguard for those affected. I would not like the Bill to proceed without registering my thanks to the Minister for what he has done.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1776048" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-08-06a.572.1" hansard_membership_id="230" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3340" speakername="Mr. Stanley" colnum="572" time="18:07:00">
<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. I acknowledge the fact that, had it not been for the way in which the right hon. Gentleman raised that problem in regard to his own constituency, it would not have been drawn to our attention in the way that it was. Therefore, the fact that we have brought these amendments forward relates directly to the action that he took on behalf of his constituents.<br/>
We have also brought forward important amendments that were asked for by the right hon. Member for Ardwick and


my right hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Sir G. Page) on the application of the two-thirds rateable value rule under the Rent Act. Points were also made by my hon. Friends the Members for Kensington (Sir B. Rhys Williams), Chelsea (Mr. Scott), Paddington (Mr. Wheeler), St. Marylebone (Mr. Baker) and Fulham (Mr Stevens) on service charges. Points were also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Cadbury) and the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Ross), together with Lord Banks in another place, on option mortgages for the elderly, where we have made an amendment which I believe commands widespread support on both sides of the House. Another amendment was moved in another place by Lord Greenwood and Lord Selkirk on home ownership for Service men. That shows that throughout this legislation we have endeavoured to make a reasoned and sensible response to sound cases for amending the Bill.<br/>
That means that the House now faces a considerable number of amendments that have been brought forward from another place. If the Opposition want to argue against the motion on the grounds that there are too many amendments, my reply must be that the Government could have taken up quite a different stance. They could have closed their ears to all the representations that have been made and paid not one jot or tittle of attention to them. In that event, the Housing Bill would have returned to this House with far fewer amendments than 251. Indeed, it might have come back with precisely five amendments, namely, the five on which the Government were defeated in another place.<br/>
Had that occurred, and had the Government brought the Bill back with precisely five amendments to it, I have a pretty good idea what the right hon. Member for Sparkbrook would have said. I am certain that he would have castigated the Government for not bringing forward enough amendments. He would have said that it was outrageous that the Government had not accepted more of the amendments that were tabled in another place. I am sure that if there were only five Lords amendments on the Amendment Paper he would still oppose the motion on the ground that the Opposition

needed more time to persuade us to accept more amendments.</p>

<p>I recall several amendments designed to deal with drafting errors in the previous Government's housing legislation, which they had lost sight of. In any event, a considerable number of the amendments that have been brought forward are in response to points made on both sides in both Houses.</p>

<p>I accept that there have been drafting errors in previous legislation. Does the Minister accept that the majority of errors that have occurred have resulted from the introduction in the Lords of amendments at a late stage&#x2014;the Rent Act 1974 was a supreme example&#x2014;which were not properly examined by the House? Does he agree that we should learn the lesson from our past mistakes and ensure that, in future, rather than coming back to the House with a 42-page Bill to be debated in six hours, we should refer Lords amendments back to a Committee so that they can be properly discussed?</p>

<p>I do not want to trespass onto questions of procedure. However, I believe that the course of the Bill underlines the Government's position and their attitude towards the other House, which is certainly not the position that has been adopted by the Labour Party.<br/>
If the Opposition wish to argue that a large number of these amendments are, in fact, controversial, that is hardly borne out by the proceedings that have taken place in another place. Of the 246 Government amendments that were tabled in another place, the number against which the Opposition divided was exactly zero. That does not suggest that we are bringing forward a large number of controversial amendments. I accept that not every amendment is entirely free from controversy, and there are the five amendments to which the Government have tabled motions to disagree. One of those&#x2014;the one to extend option mortgage arrangements to annuities bought by the


elderly&#x2014;is purely a technical disagreement to enable us to rectify the drafting of an amendment that we have already made clear we are accepting. We are left, therefore, with just the four right-to-buy amendments, with which we disagree. We shall table a further amendment to one of them in lieu.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the Minister regards have no doubt that the Minister regards the concession that has been made this afternoon as tremendously important. I do not. It involves 200,000 houses out of a total of 6 million. I wanted the whole Bill to be postponed for three months. The Minister and his hon. Friends, one of whom appeared on television last night, said that that would deny tenants the right to buy. That is misrepresentation. What is really happening is that councils are being compelled to sell even if they do not want to. That puts a different emphasis on the situation.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has been following our proceeding closely. The only interpretation of the legislation is that we are doing that which we promised&#x2014;to give a legal right to buy to 6 million council tenants.<br/>
Each of the four right-to-buy amendments has been debated extensively already. We have endeavoured to arrange the timetable motion to give the House the opportunity to debate these subjects today. However, in Committee and on Report, in both Houses, apart from the time spent in the Second Reading debates, the issue of dwellings for the elderly has been debated for three and a quarter hours, the rural areas for seven and three quarter hours, the option provisions for five hours, and the Secretary of State's intervention powers for five and a half hours. The four right-to-buy amendments have been debated extensively already in both Houses. In the circumstances, the timetable motion, with the extension to midnight, provides reasonable time for the consideration of Lords amendments.<br/>
Whatever view is taken in the House, I am sure that the thousands of tenants who are anxiously waiting for the right to buy their homes will agree that the time provided is ample.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that in my constituency there has been considerable anxiety in the past few days about this matter?

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am sure that his view is shared by many thousands of council tenants. I am sure that it will be shared by the many hundreds of Birmingham tenants who were in the process of buying their homes, only to be stopped last May. I am sure that it will be the view of the hundreds of Manchester tenants who were in the process of buying their homes when they were stopped by a change in control in 1971 and had to fight their way through the courts for eight years. Such tenants, and thousands like them, have been waiting for the Bill for 15 months with increasing impatience. I hope that the House will agree that they should not have to wait any longer.</p>

<p>It would be ungracious of me not to respond to the concern expressed for the tenants of Birmingham by the Minister. If he visited the Spark-brook division and the great housing estates at Foxholes and Acocks Green, he would obtain a clear picture of what the tenants think of the Government in general. I should be delighted to take him round the estates while he discusses these matters with the tenants.<br/>
I am in a benevolent mood, matters having turned out as they have, and I shall give the Minister credit since he wrote his speech before the Government made their major concession of which he seemed to be unaware. When we debated the timetable motion on the Report stage I said that I was not attracted to the normal rituals of guillotine debates. That is still my view. However, today's debate, by any standards, cannot be called a normal guillotine debate. The facts and figures speak for themselves.<br/>
The House of Lords spent eight days considering and amending the Bill. Initially, the Government offered the


House of Commons eight hours to consider what it took the Lords eight days to consider. In fact, the period will be substantially shorter. No reasonable person will argue that eight hours or less is adequate time to decide whether their Lordships were right in the considerations which took them eight full days.<br/>
In the House of Lords 255 amendments were carried. The Minister said that the figure was 251 because he did not separate amendments with the same number but with different letters. I understand that that was a genuine error and I forgive him. Two new schedules and 11 new clauses were passed. Even allowing for the full day which it is charitable to assume that the Government felt would be devoted to these matters, we would have been allowed two minutes' discussion per amendment in the House of Commons.<br/>
Hon. Members will argue that that is a bogus time because amendments and new clauses are grouped together. The provisional selection offered the House 79 separate debates which, had the debate today begun at 3.30, would have given us six minutes per group of amendments. It would not have given us time to vote on each group, nor to debate each group. The Government would have hardly had time to describe each group.<br/>
I hope that the Minister and the Leader of the House have learnt one or two lessons in the last couple of days. They must realise that it is not for them to tell the House what is an important issue and what is not. Perhaps 243 amendments would be judged by hon. Members on both sides of the House to be of no great significance. However, that is for the House to decide. It is an unacceptable use of the Government's power for them to decide that certain amendments are unimportant and to decree that the House should not have the opportunity to make its own judgment and have its own discussions. That is for the House of Commons to decide. It has not been allowed that proper courtesy and right.<br/>
Why are we in the present position? Part of the reason is the Government's incompetence, although the Minister tried to pass over that with a blandness which is new to him. It is no good his saying that the Government could have

rejected every amendment made in the House of Lords. If the Bill had come here unamended, large parts of it would have been unworkable. I suppose that the Government, hell-bent on getting the Bill through, might have been sufficiently wrongheaded to turn down the corrective amendments which they moved themselves. Many of the amendments are necessary because of the Government's incompetence.<br/>
That incompetence was demonstrated dramatically by the Minister of State last Wednesday. The Minister of State is not the type of performer that we expect to stop the show, but he managed to stop the House of Lords for half an hour a week ago by making an announcement which has been gainsaid by the Government. It was typical and indicative of the incompetence with which the Bill has been pursued.<br/>
The Bill was debated in the House of Commons Standing Committee for 136 hours or 46 sittings. Yet it was so deficient, and remains so deficient, that literally dozens of technical amendments had to be moved in the House of Lords. It may be that most are no more than corrections of errors that a competent Government would have discovered earlier. However, I repeat that it is for this House to decide whether they are matters of substance. It is a denial of our right not to be given time to make that judgment.<br/>
Why are we being required to dispose in an afternoon and evening of what it took their Lordships eight days to deal with? The answer is in three parts. I want to explain why the Government have forced themselves into a humiliating position over the past three days and why a major concession has been granted at the last minute, much to my pleasure, but in a way that does the Government no credit and reveals that the Leader of the House is the most incompetent man to occupy that office for a long time.<br/>
One reason is the strange and dangerous psychology of the Prime Minister, who is never prepared to be seen to change her mind, especially when she is wrong. Time after time the Government are required to plough off the straight furrow, irrespective of whether they are proceeding in a manner that will do


them, the Commons and the country great damage. However, I echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Lewis): when Labour Back Bench Members demonstrated that they would not have it, the Prime Minister at least saw sense on one issue.<br/>
The second reason why we have been rushed along in this wholly unacceptable way is the arrogance of the Leader of the House. Over this, as over so many other matters, he has not behaved as a Leader of the House, protecting our rights to debate issues in the proper way. He has behaved as a functionary of the Conservative Party. I warn him, and I hope that his hon. Friend will draw my warning to his attention, that the more he pursues the narrow party line while occupying the great office that he does, the more he is bound to face more difficulties of the sort that he encountered on Monday and today. When he starts behaving like a Leader of the House, we shall make more progress.<br/>
It is not only the Prime Minister's obduracy or the incompetence and arrogance of the Leader of the House that has led to the House being rushed. The third reason is the ambition of the Secretary of State for the Environment. Smiling in that simpering way that he has, the Leader of the House said that the Bill would now be passed in time for the Conservative Party conference. Pressure is being put on us in order that the customary ovation for the Secretary of State can be enhanced by his announcement that the Housing Bill has passed into law. That is why Conservative Members will have only six days in which to prepare to shoot whatever they shoot on 12 August. That is why holidays have been abandoned, pairs have been broken, yesterday's business was lost and we shall stay up late tonight. It is in order to further the most carefully contrived and long-winded ovation that even the Conservative Party has ever known.<br/>
I leave the Government with this thought. Having obtained a major concession, we look forward to voting against those Government propositions to which we take the strongest objection in principle.<br/>
We shall go through the evening and the night sustained by the thought that we are voting for principles. Conservative Members will be voting for the Secretary of State's ambition. I wish them well with it.</p>

<p>I have two important points to make. First, the Shadow spokesman has accused others of attributes that many would attach to him. He accuses my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister of not changing her mind. He is not willing to change his mind so that ordinary working people can have the chance to buy their homes. About 30 per cent. of my constituents will not have the opportunity to buy homes unless the Bill becomes law. The local authority, allegedly representing ordinary people, considers that they should not have that chance. They are told that they should look for homes on the private market, which in most cases would mean leaving the constituency. Over the past 25 years the average rate of owner-occupation has doubled, but that is not true in my constituency, where a great many homes are owned by the local authority. Unless the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley) believes that those people must always be council tenants, whatever the general pattern of owner-occupation, he should change his mind.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman wants ordinary working people in his constituency to buy their houses, why does he not tell them that there is plenty of private housing available?

<p>I do not know how familiar the hon. Gentleman is with my constituency, but it contains many empty public sector houses because of the difficulty experienced by one local authority in managing so many homes. As a result there is more friction than if there was ordinary marketing.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman accused my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House of arrogance. However, the right hon. Gentleman is arrogant to suggest that


people who want the chance to own their homes should not have it. I own my home, or at least that part of it which is not owned by the building society, and I imagine that the right hon. Gentleman owns his. Many people have not had the opportunity to buy a flat or small house to begin with and to move as they changed jobs. We are not here to represent only those who own their homes. We should try to make it possible for more people, especially young people, to own homes. We should give those who moved into a council house when they first got married the opportunity to own homes.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman accused my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment of ambition. We all have ambitions. My ambition is not to become Secretary of State for the Environment in a Labour Government or leader of the Labour Party. It is that more people should have the opportunity to own homes. The right hon. Gentleman and his party fail to understand the ambitions of those they represent. If he believes that so many people want to buy their homes, why does he not give them a chance to do so?

<p>I believe that there is a tendency for local authority elections to be influenced by the party in power. Over the past 20 years there have been massive swings in local elections away from the party in power. It is misleading to claim that a single item of policy makes an enormous difference. In my constituency many people who would normally vote Labour have made it plain that they want the chance to buy their homes.<br/>
If Labour Members think that because people, by chance, could not get their own homes when they were young and managed to get a council house, they should be left in servitude to the local authority, not sharing in the distribution

of wealth that has been argued for by many Labour Members and not being as mobile as those who own their own homes, they have got things the wrong way round.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman represents a constituency which is similar to my own. When his constituents say that they want to buy their own homes, does he explain to them that the easiest way for them to do that would be for the Government to give them a large deposit, to reduce interest rates, so that buyers could afford mortgages, reduce inflation&#x2014;instead of doubling it&#x2014;sand reduce VAT, so that purchasers would have more money in their pockets to pay for a mortgage? Those actions would help all his constituents to buy their homes, but the Government have done the reverse of all those actions.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Salford, East (Mr. Allaun) has got it wrong. Many people do not manage to get a council house or choose to buy small flats that may be in worse condition than those owned by local authorities. Most of those people do not continue to live in their inexpensive or less desirable flat or house, but do it up&#x2014;which helps to regenerate run-down areas&#x2014;and it represents their first rung on the housing ladder. They have mobility and they have had the opportunity to put their money into what matters to them rather than into other areas of expenditure.<br/>
Many council tenants of what appear to be less desirable flats and houses would be well advised to buy those properties. If the council homes are as undesirable as many Labour Members suggest, what sort of housing system have we had that has condemned so many to live in sub-standard housing? Secondly, can we not learn from what has happened in many parts of the country where ordinary working people have


had the opportunity of doing up their homes, have enjoyed living there and, because of the value that they have added to the properties, have been able to sell at a better price?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman may think that he is presenting a reasonable case, but he is missing the point of the argument. If the Bill goes through and meets all the requirement that he is asking for, and council houses are sold&#x2014;and, because of high mortgage rates, houses are being taken off the market&#x2014;what will happen to the multitude who cannot afford to buy their own homes? There will be no council houses for them.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has made the point which I thought had been made often enough for me not to offer it to the hon. Member for Morpeth (Mr. Grant).<br/>
I am prepared to stay here right through the night and, if necessary, to come back next week, because I regard the extension of home ownership to council tenants as one of the most important aspects of policy, towards which there ought to be a bipartisan approach. Only Labour Members' ambition, arrogance and refusal to change their minds have stopped the proposal going through in that way as an important part of social legislation. It is as important as the Education Acts and the introduction of old-age pensions, and it will be as important as the increase in child benefits which I hope we shall see in the future.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Woolwich, West (Mr. Bottomley is said to be one of the

leading wets in the Tory Party. Having listened to his speech, I feel as though I have walked through a lukewarm shower. It is not convincing for the hon. Gentleman to bleed his heart for ordinary working people when he has walked through the Lobbies with his hon. Friends in support of policies that are making hundreds of thousands of ordinary people unemployed so that they have no chance of buying their home, whether they live in private rented accommodation or council housing.<br/>
The Bill is not only irrelevant to the housing needs of the nation but is supremely damaging to them. It is so damaging that not even this Government could convince another place, which has an overwhelming number of their own supporters, on certain major aspects. Not once or twice but five times the Government were defeated because of defections among their own supporters.<br/>
It is astonishing that the Government, who, we have been told, are so attached to another place, should have acted in such an arrogant way towards the institution which they hold so venerable. My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. Kaufman) will recall that it was not long ago that the Secretary of State for the Environment, when he was Opposition spokesman on aircraft and shipbuilding, was beating the Labour Party over the head for daring to disagree with another place. He said:
<q>The Government cannot have it both ways. They either believe in the reforming ability of a second Chamber as they presumably intended in their Parliamentary Act 1949, or they do not. They cannot have a reforming second Chamber and then criticise it when it scrutinises legislation from this House."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 8 November 1976; Vol. 919 c. 99.]</q>
The Secretary of State not only criticised another place when it started to scrutinise his legislation; he slapped it in the face.<br/>
The Leader of the House, who has conducted our proceedings with such skill in the past week, said during the election campaign:
<q>A unicameral legislature constitutes a giant step towards tyranny, yet it is precisely this which is proposed by the Labour Party.</q>
One of the good things to come out of this fiasco is that the Government have turned their noses up at another place and hastened its abolition. Let us be clear


that the victory achieved today is partly a victory for Labour and cross-bench Peers&#x2014;to whom I give credit&#x2014;but mainly a victory for the Opposition in this place. It would not have been possible but for the log jam of business that the Government created and the tactics of the Opposition in forcing the Government to concede. Anyone who doubts that should look at the Amendment Paper and note that time and again the Secretary of State is asking this House to disagree with Lords amendments. The Government have had to stand on their heads because of pressure from the House.<br/>
The second reason why this is a humiliating day for the Government is that time and again in Committee they rejected our pleas on the need to amend the Bill in order to prevent tens of thousands of dwellings used for old people from being sold on the private market and no longer being available for old people. The result would have been to force those old people into NHS hospitals, many of them old workhouses, or to put additional pressure on social service homes.<br/>
We argued with the Government time and again, but they turned us down. They turned down the arguments in another place, but, because of the chaos that they have produced and the pressure that they were under, they have had to eat their words, stand on their head and accept what they have spent five months objecting to.</p>

<p>Does my hon Friend agree that it is the utmost hypocrisy for Conservative Members to claim that they are trying to establish the right of tenants to buy their homes? If that is the principle involved, why is it that all attempts to persuade the Government to extend it to private tenants have been refused? We can only reach the conclusion that it is a vendetta against the rented public sector. It has nothing to do with the rights of owner-occupation.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is right. The Government are only too delighted to sell public assets on the cheap, while carefully defending the rights of private property owners.<br/>
More time should be made available to debate the matter, not only because of the items on the Order Paper, but

because there are many important matters relating to shorthold tenancy that should be discussed. In Committee we asked the Government why the survey of empty houses in England had not been produced. Question after question was turned down with the promise that, at some stage, the survey commissioned in 1977 would be produced. That has finally happened. I am not surprised that the Minister sat on it for so long. It explodes the idea that there are vast numbers of empty properties waiting to come on to the market when shorthold comes into force. It states that the numbers of empty properties have been consistently overestimated, and that the number of empty properties empty because of the Rent Acts is, at the maximum, 41,000. If shorthold does not work, it will not be because of the Labour Party's promise to repeal the legislation, but because the property is not available.<br/>

<p>That is right. I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman said that. He said that it was all very well for the Secretary of State to set himself up as the gauleiter of housing but that the next gauleiter might be a commissar. That worried the hon. Gentleman, and he refused to vote in favour of the Bill on Second Reading. The Secretary of State is destroying basic principles of constitutional relationship between the local authorities and the Government. Labour Secretaries of State may be tempted to use the powers which the present Secretary of State has taken unto himself for other purposes. I do not think that that temptation will come to my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley, who will be the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. He is a man of the utmost principle. But it is conceivable that others with fewer scruples about the needs of local government will occupy that seat, even from the Labour Benches, and that those powers will be used.<br/>
Nothing in the course of the proceedings on the Housing Bill during the past seven sorry months has undermined the hon. Member for Buckingham's description of the Secretary of State as a gauleiter&#x2014;for gauleiter he is and gauleiter he has been. He has jackbooted his way through the housing needs of the nation. He has jackbooted his way not only through the House of Lords but through the House of Commons.</p>

<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) on his success in eliciting from the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) his description of the Secretary of State. Whenever we repeated that description in Committee we drew rebukes as though it was our invention. I am glad that the original author has acknowledged his paternity of that remark.<br/>
In its election manifesto last year the Conservative Party gave prominence to a section headed "The Supremacy of Parliament". It stated:
<q>the traditional role of our legislature has suffered badly from the growth of government over the last quarter of a century.</q>
<q>We will see that Parliament and no other body stands at the centre of the nation's life and decisions, and we will seek to make it effective in its job of controlling the Executive.</q>
Of all the many broken pledges in that manifesto, none has been more cynically betrayed than that.<br/>
Let us consider the extraordinary progress of the Housing Bill through Parliament. It was introduced last December, seven months after the election. When it first appeared in the Vote Office it consisted of 129 clauses and 20 schedules, covering 142 pages&#x2014;a modest measure costing &#x00A3;3.50. The Secretary of State and the Minister clearly felt that it was far too modest: if they were to make their names as legistlators, they would have to do better than that.<br/>
In Committee they increased the number of clauses from 129 to 136, the number of schedules from 20 to 22, and the number of pages from 142 to 156. They raised the price from &#x00A3;3.50 to &#x00A3;4.50. For the Ministers the Bill had become not simply an embryonic statute, but a way of life. On Report the Government added another eight clauses, two

schedules and 11 pages, and they raised the price to &#x00A3;5.<br/>
In a moment of rapture they realised that they need not stop there. It dawned on them that we have a bicameral legislature, and that the Bill's transit to the House of Lords opened up a whole new world. With a whoop of glee they added a further six clauses and one schedule at the Lords Committee stage, and another four clauses and one schedule on Report there. The original 129 clauses had multiplied to 154, and the 20 schedules to 26. At the last count, with final returns not yet available, the length of the Bill had increased by 27 per cent. and its price by 43 per cent.&#x2014;higher even than the rate of inflation under this Government.<br/>
That does not take amendments into account. Last week I tabled a question to the Minister asking how many Government amendments had been made to the Bill. He went to a great deal of trouble to ensure that I received his answer, even to the extent of sending it to my flat in Manchester. I am grateful to him for taking that trouble, but his answer was that he did not really know. He said:
<q>There is no easy way of providing the analysis nor, to avoid disproportionate cost, has a detailed check of the analysis been made.</q>
The Minister has tabled so many amendments that he has lost count of them. His estimate&#x2014;and it was only an estimate&#x2014;was that 159 amendments were tabled in Committee, and 100 on Report. In addition, 99 were tabled in Committee in another place, 87 on Report, and 48 on Third Reading, making a grand total of 493 Government amendments in addition to the extra clauses and schedules.<br/>
The Ministers have amendments in the way that dogs have fleas. Their slogan is "If it moves, amend it". Today the House is having to pay the price of their legislative incontinence. We are being asked to absorb, deal with and, in some cases, dispose of or reject 255 amendments in a few hours. There was to be another new clause, but its has been withdrawn.<br/>
I draw attention to the fact that the Leader of the House has not troubled to be present during the debate. He and the Secretary of State are turning this House into a mincing machine. They are making a mockery of the parliamentary


process. Yet it was they, in their manifesto, who promised that they would
<q>see that Parliament and no other body stands at the centre of the nation's life and decisions</q>
and that they would
<q>seek to make it effective in its job of controlling the Executive.</q>
Four years ago in this Chamber the Secretary of State, sitting in the position which I have been occupying with my right hon. Friends today, achieved notoriety by rising, seizing the Mace and brandishing it. Today he is degrading it more than he did on that night, because he is dragging it into the mire by asking Parliament to deal with 255 amendments, in 79 groups, in this minimal time&#x2014;an average of five minutes per group of amendments, provided that there are no Divisions.<br/>
The Leader of the House and the Secretary of State and his colleagues are treating Parliament with contempt. Their puppet majority will provide their guillotine in a minute's time, but their majority will not eradicate the stain of what they have done to the reputation of parliamentary government. When a Labour Government return to office, we shall repeal the unacceptable parts of this Bill.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The object of the amendment is to exclude from the right to buy housing associations that have never received public subsidy. The great majority of associations in this position are charities which have provided their housing from private donations rather than from public funds. They are already excluded from the right to buy by virtue of subsections (1) and (2)(a). There are, however, a handful of associations which are not charities and which have not received public subsidy. It has been put to us that such associations can scarcely be described as being in the public sector. We accept that view and this amendment therefore excludes them from the right to buy, although the associations concerned, as charities, will still be enabled to sell.</p>

<p>I congratulate the Minister on getting his tongue round that phraseology. I believe that he will find increasing difficulty as the night goes on. No one will think any the worse of him if he sounds as though he is lisping. It is difficult. I thank him for the concession. We regard this as important. My hon. Friend the Member for Lambeth, Central (Mr. Tilley), as the Minister will recall, was particularly concerned about it. We are pleased that the amendment is being made and accepted by the Government.</p>

<p>These amendments set out the provisions for commencement of the various parts of the Bill. Their result will be that the right-to-buy provisiions in chapter I of Part I will come into operation eight weeks after Royal Assent. The tenants' charter provisions of chapter II will also come into force eight weeks after Royal Assent unless it proves practicable to get the necessary regulations laid more quickly, in which case they will be brought in without waiting for the expiry of eight weeks.<br/>
Part V amending part V of the Housing Act 1957 and part VI which introduces the new housing subsidy system will come into operation on enactment of the Bill. The following provisions will also come into effect on enactment&#x2014;the improvement for sale scheme for local authorities in clause 103, the vesting powers of local authorities on mortgage default in clauses 107 and 108, clause 114 which provides for an increase in the Housing Corporation borrowing limit, the provisions giving housing associations the power to sell whether outright or by shared ownership and also to improve for sale, and also provisions laying down accounting requirements and providing for the establishment of grant redemption funds for registered housing associations in clauses 116 to 121, 123, and 124.<br/>
The lifting of the existing restriction on working balances held in the housing revenue account and other matters related to housing accounts in clauses 127 and 128 will also be brought into effect on enactment, as will new clause H, introduced

in another place to restrict local authorities' powers to make certain disposals, and clauses 130 to 132, which include the provisions to exclude shared ownership tenancies from the Leasehold Reform Act 1967.<br/>
In addition, the interpretive clauses 124 and 139, the regulation and order making provisions of clause 140, subsection (2) of clause 141 and clauses 142 to 144 will all have effect from enhancement.<br/>
The remaining provisions of parts VII, VIII, and IX, covering amongst other items improvement and repair grants, service charges and the new provisions relating to houses in multiple occupation, will be brought into force by appointed day order. So also will those dealing with the new shorthold and assured tenancies and other provisions relating to the Rent Acts, part II.<br/>
The new rights for public and private sector tenants to make improvements with their landlords' consent&#x2014;part III&#x2014;and the amendments relating to jurisdiction and procedure in part IV are all provisions that depend upon the making of regulations or orders or the restriction on form of notices and so on, where it is desirable that those affected should first be able to obtain copies of the Act. The appointed day procedure is clearly the appropriate procedure to use in those circumstances.</p>

<p>I should be grateful if the Minister could give us some idea when he intends the new shorthold tenures to commence. I put down a question about the matter and he was not then able to clarify the position. It would be of help to many people to know that.<br/>
Secondly, I welcome the Government's decision to bring forward the security of tenure for local authority tenants in so far as that is administratively possible&#x2014;as I understand is their intention&#x2014;with eight weeks from Royal Assent being the latest possible day but it being permitted within the Bill for that to be earlier. Although I understand the difficulties, it would be of assistance to many local authorities if at this stage, with the Bill approaching Royal Assent so soon, the Minister could give some idea whether he believes it will be possible to bring about the security of tenure before the end of the eight-week period and, if so, how much before.<br/>
I should like to take this opportunity to ask the hon. Gentleman to reiterate as emphatically as he can, and if possible to give it somewhat more fully than the Under-Secretary was able to do in the Consolidated Fund Bill debate, the commitment with regard to the wish of Wandsworth borough council to sell certain properties. In that debate my right hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) drew attention to the pernicious fact that the authority was seeking to evade the provisions of the Bill&#x2014;a Conservative authority seeking to circumvent a Conservative Government's measure&#x2014;by selling off those properties before the security of tenure bestowed upon the tenants would prevent that sale. It seems to us, as I am sure it would to all fair-minded people, that it would be entirely wrong for those properties to be sold in anticipation of, and in spite of, a statute that will come into effect within a few weeks.<br/>
We very much welcome the Under-Secretary's commitment that while the matter is being examined the Secretary of State's consent for disposal of the properties is being withheld. It would be of great assistance to the House and to the people of Wandsworth if the Minister said that that consent would not be given before the security of tenure provisions came into force, so that the will of Parliament, which on this issue is a united will, cannot be thwarted by a hasty and furtive act by a local authority. I very much hope that the Minister will be kind enough to give us that commitment.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman asked me first about the date of coming into effect of the shorthold provisions. It is the Government's wish to bring all the provisions of the Bill, including that one, into effect as rapidly as possible. For reasons that the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate, in view of the secondary legislation involved in some parts of the private rented sector, it is administratively easiest to make the bulk of the provisions to do with that sector commence on the same date. I cannot say today when we shall be able to make an appointed day order, but we hope by October-November to have all the salient provisions of the Bill in operation.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman is entirely right about one of the effects of the amendments being to give us the flexibility to bring into effect the tenants' charter provisions, and in particular the security of tenure provision to which he specificially referred, earlier than the maximum period of eight weeks. I emphasise that it is a maximum period. Because of the need to carry out a considerable volume of administrative work so that that chapter of the Bill can be brought in properly by local authorities, I cannot say whether we shall be able to improve on the eight-week time scale. Certainly, if we took the view that for policy reasons it was important to do that, we should make every effort to bring that date forward.<br/>
On the right hon. Gentleman's specific point about Wandsworth, I cannot add to, and I do not wish to subtract from, what my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State said in the debate earlier this week.</p>

<p>May I put to the Minister again a point that I think is important? He will want to think about it, and I appreciate that he may well not be able to give me an instantaneous reply.<br/>
It would be deplorable if, with security of tenure for tenants coming no later than 2 October and possibly sooner, a short gap before the bringing into force of that provision enabled a local authority to act in clear defiance of what the Act will state when that part of it is brought into operation. Therefore, now that the Under-Secretary has said, and the Minister has reinforced his statement, that consent for disposal is being withheld while the matter is being looked at&#x2014;a very proper response and one that I welcome&#x2014;I very much hope that the Minister will not give his consent. I hope that it will continue to be withheld until the security of tenure provisions come into operation, so that those tenants, like all other tenants, will be able to profit from them and will not have their security taken from them what might well be a matter of days before that security would have been given.<br/>
I do not ask the Minister for a response now, but I shall be grateful if he will consider the matter and write to me and to my right hon. Friend the

<p>These are fairly straightforward amendments which allow flats in the same block which are sold under the right-to-buy provision to have leases which end on the same day. The main amendment, as I think will be clear to the House, is to schedule 2. That provides that, once one flat in a block has been leased under the provisions of the Bill for a term of 125 years or more, any subsequent lease of another flat in the block under the right-to-buy provision may terminate at the same time as the lease on the first flat.<br/>
That would apply whether the first flat had been sold under the right to buy, or voluntarily under the powers in part V of the Bill. It is right to say that this was a matter that was discussed in Committee. We have had representations from a wide variety of bodies, including the Association of District Councils, the London Boroughs Association, the Law Society, the GLC, the Housing Centre Trust, and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors. I am glad to say that on further reflection we were able to advise another place to accept this amendment. The amendments, therefore, to clauses 6 and 15 are consequential. They deal with assumptions for valuing of the flat and the landlord's duty to complete.</p>

<p>As you observed, Mr. Deputy Speaker, this is a series of amendments and I should like to speak first to amendments 2B and 2C. The Bill provides for a tenant to receive discount in respect of a spouse's secure tenancies provided that the tenant and the spouse are living togther when the notice is served.<br/>
But if, for example, a widow has taken over the tenancy on the death of her husband and wishes to exercise the right to buy, the rule as it exists would have meant that she could not rely upon any of her dead husband's entitlement to discount. These amendments would allow her to do that, provided that she became a secure tenant on the death of her husband and the two partners were living together at the time.<br/>
This ensures that the discount she receives is no less than her husband would have been entitled to had he lived. This provision, I need hardly add, applies to widowers as well as to widows.<br/>
The remaining amendment to clause 7 mirrors a similar provision in the Tenants' Rights Etc. (Scotland) Bill. In broad principle it provides that a person who exercises the right to buy in England and Wales under the Housing Bill after spending time as a tenant in Scotland or Northern Ireland will be able to claim discount in respect of those periods


tenancy provided that the tenancies correspond to one of the categories of tenancy in England or Wales for which discount may be claimed.<br/>
That ensures, as I feel sure the House would wish, that discount entitlement does not simply vanish if a secure tenant moves across the border in either direction. The new clause meets a commitment given to the House on Report. One of the Members who raised this issue was my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Trippier).<br/>
It applies in cases where a child becomes the secure tenant of a dwelling whose preceding secure tenant was one of his or her parents. It would allow landlords the discretion to grant such a tenant credit towards the right to buy under clause 1(3), or discount under clause 7, or both. That would be on the basis of time that he had spent since the age of 16 occupying as his only, or principal, homes dwellings of which the parent was a secure tenant.<br/>
Amendment No. 11 provides that if the maximum discount to be prescribed under clause 7(4) has affected the price that the tenant must pay for his home, he must be told about it in the notice which the landlord serves on him under clause 10 setting out the purchase price and other matters. The tenant will, obviously, need this information to make sense of the price that this landlord was quoting.<br/>
These are all modest provisions designed to ensure that secure tenants receive a fair deal in all circumstances under the discount provisions of the Bill.</p>

<p>I take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Construction for being so sympathetic to the appeal that I made when I spoke on Report.<br/>
That resulted in their Lordships moving the amendment to clause 14 which is now before the House. The amendment will be welcomed by thousands of potential home owners who will benefit from the provisions detailed in this clause. It will ensure that the children of deceased parents who would, previously, have lost the discount entitlement carried by their parents and to which they had contributed by paying the rent or part of it

have that entitlement protected with the permission of their local authority.<br/>
I am pleased that the wording of the amendment to subsection (2) makes it clear that the child of the original tenant can qualify for the discount entitlement in the eyes of the local authority only if he or she has occupied the council house in question as his, or her, only, or principal, home. In other words, the child must have lived with the parent or parents who were the secure tenants. I was searching for that wording in my original speech on this matter.<br/>
Since speaking to my amendment on Report I have received numerous inquiries from tenants affected by this provision in my own constituency. As a result of national publicity at the time I received an enormous correspondence from all over the country. I am entirely satisfied that the provisions detailed in this amendment will meet the criteria which I tried to lay before the House on a previous occasion.<br/>

<p>These amendments follow an undertaking that my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead (Mr. Finsberg) gave to the hon. Member for Liverpool, Edge Hill (Mr. Alton) on Report, when he said that he would consider further the possible loophole in the provision in clause 8 for the repayment of discount where a purchaser under the right to buy resells within the five years. There was the possibility that the liability to repay discount in these circumstances might be avoided by granting a subsequent purchaser an option to buy rather than conveying the dwelling house to him straightforwardly during the five-year period. Because the grant of the option would not count as a disposal, there would be no liability to repay discount at that stage, and when the sale finally took place the five years would be up.<br/>
These amendments deal with this possible loophole and a similar one which could exist on the 10-year rural area

pre-emption safeguard under clause 18. They also cover the parallel case of discount sharing or a rural area safeguard imposed on a voluntary sales scheme under part V.</p>

<p>I acknowledge the Minister's concession. But I draw attention to the absence of the Liberal Party from the debate.

The Liberal Party is a propaganda party which is not interested in serious debate. I hope that it will be noted, as I shall make it known in Manchester, that when the Minister was responding to one of the rare Liberal amendments, the entire Liberal Party was absent from this place and it has so far not shown itself interested in one of the most important Bills to go through Parliament since the general election.<br/>

<p>These amendments revise the provision in the Bill for a tenant whose mortgage entitlement is insufficient to enable him to exercise his right to buy at once and to be able to deposit &#x00A3;100 with his landlord and have the option to defer completion for two years.<br/>
These amendments enable the tenant to claim his right to defer completion of


his purchase by depositing &#x00A3;100 with his landlord without having to wait for a completion notice. That was the previous structure of the Bill. The purchaser will be warned of the right to deferred completion when he receives notice of the purchase price under clause 10. That is provided for in amendment No. 12. The notice of mortgage entitlement under clause 12 will also advise him of his right to deferred completion and enclose a form for claiming it, as provided in amendment No. 14.<br/>
Where appropriate, the tenant will be able to claim deferred completion within three months of the landlord's notice under clause 12(4), which informs the tenant of the landlord's calculation of his mortgage entitlement, or within a longer period if the landlord or county court considers that there are reasonable grounds for extending the period.<br/>
The amendments also cover the requirement in deferred completion for the tenant to complete his purchase within two years of the service of his notice claiming to exercise the right to buy. Amendment No. 25 provides that, where a tenant has indicated his willingness to proceed with the sale by requiring the landlord to reassess his mortgage entitlement within two years but the sale has not been completed within that period, the landlord may, where there are reasonable grounds for doing so, extend the period for completion at the original price.<br/>
This may be desirable where, for instance, there had been some delay over processing the revised mortgage application. If there are reasonable grounds for the landlord to act in such a way, but he fails to do so, the county court may extend the period by order.<br/>
Amendment No. 20 incorporates an Opposition amendment to clause 15. It makes it entirely clear that the right to defer completion is open only to those tenants whose mortgage entitlement is insufficient to enable them to buy outright.</p>

<p>I should have wished to oppose vigorously this group of amendments had it not been for two matters. The first was the Minister's last sentence, in which he made it clear that one of the amendments was acceptable to the

Opposition. Therefore, it would be somewhat inconsistent to oppose a group that included an amendment that I support, and inconsistency is alien to my nature.<br/>
Secondly, we wish to concentrate the debate on the &#x00A3;100 option on amendment No. 23. Since we are proceeding under the guillotine, I do not wish to take up more time on that matter. However, we do not like the way that the Government seem in some circumstances to be extending this option even beyond the two-year period and in certain circumstances giving the court the right to do so.<br/>
We shall not vote against the amendment, but I make it clear that that is due to the shortage of time.</p>

This is a procedural amendment. Its effect is simply to require the local authority, when notifying the purchaser of the amount it considers may be left outstanding on mortgage and the way in which this amount has been arrived at, also to notify him of the provisions which it proposes should be included in the mortgage. The Housing Corporation is to be under a similar obligation when advancing money to housing associations.<br/>
By "provisions" I refer, of course, to such matters as the rate of interest and the period of repayment. It is obviously important for the purchaser to have this information at an early stage. The amendment will achieve that and will be in the interests of those exercising their right to buy.</p>

<p>These are procedural amendments to clause 13, which governs what happens when there is a change of secure tenant after the service of a notice claiming the right to buy.<br/>
When the change of tenancy takes place, the landlord may already have served on the former tenant a notice under clause 10 telling him the price to which he is entitled and, among other things, about his right to a mortgage.

Amendment No. 16 therefore provides that, where a notice has already been served under clause 10, a new form is to be sent to the new tenant for him to give details of his own financial circumstances if he wishes to exercise his right to a mortgage.

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The whole purpose of the option provisions of the Bill is to give a tenant who is not able to afford to buy outright immediately the opportunity of saving for a two-year period while the price of his house or flat remains fixed. Yet the intention of this amenedment is not that the price should remain fixed during the option period but that it should go up by half of the increase in the value of the house between the time that the tenant applies to buy and the time that he actually completes the purchase.<br/>
We made it clear at the election that the price would be fixed during the option period. Our objective is to help council tenants to buy, and that means keeping the price fixed so that tenants know exactly how much they have to save during the option period.<br/>
Unless the price is fixed, tenants will simply not know how much they will have to save. They will be at the mercy of whatever happens to be the rate of increase in house prices during the option period and, as the House knows, that can vary greatly from year to year.<br/>
A tenant, and perhaps other members of his family buying with him, could, for instance, save furiously for the two-year period and accumulate perhaps an extra &#x00A3;200 to &#x00A3;300. But, if this amendment were accepted, they would not know whether they had saved enough until the house was valued again at completion. If they even found themselves, say, &#x00A3;500 short because of the rise of house prices, the family would reasonably feel that they had had a thoroughly raw deal, having saved hard and then found themselves short.<br/>
This amendment is yet another reflection of the fact that the Labour Party wants to stop as many tenants as possible from being able to buy their homes. Our objective is quite the reverse, and I ask the House to reject the amendment.</p>

<p>This is one amendment on which the Opposition strongly disagree with the Government. The vote in the other place was 90 to 86 in favour of the amendment. The amendment was moved by Baroness David&#x2014;a Conservative&#x2014;which should make Conservative Members in this House


hesitate before they pursue the point. An enormous bonanza is given to purchasers&#x2014;up to 50 per cent. discount on the price of the house if they have lived in it for 20 years, plus up to 20 per cent. or more if this clause is included in the Bill. A discount of 70 per cent. is a giveaway, and clearly the buyer's gain is the community's loss.<br/>

<p>I have made a mistake, and I cannot put it right, but that is what Baroness David said. She said that it was a tremendous gift at the expense of the local authority, the taxpayer and the ratepayer.<br/>
I repeat that the purchaser's gain is the community's loss. We cannot give such a vast handout without someone having to pay for it&#x2014;and it is the rest of the community who will have to pay. Under this amendment a further two years' bonus will be given to the purchaser.<br/>
Every year house prices rise and, according to the Nationwide Building Society, with which many hon. Members are familiar, in the two-year period from 1977 to 1979 house prices rose by 63.7 per cent.&#x2014;31.8 per cent. per annum. Admittedly, that was a period of high inflation, but there have been other periods of high inflation. Purchasers will be able to buy their houses at the price that was payable two years previously. In addition to the discount of up to 50 per cent., they will receive a discount of up to 20 per cent.<br/>
I and my hon. Friends maintain that if options are allowed the house should be purchased at the existing market price.<br/>
We are giving away a lot in allowing a discount of up to 50 per cent. The proposal from the Lords is a generous compromise. My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. Kaufman) nods assent. The price should not be one penny less than the market price.<br/>
Governments are not bound by acts of previous Governments, but I can envisage, on the eve of the next general election, queues of people forming to pay the &#x00A3;100 option of this sort. That would mean that for the first two years of their existence a Labour Government would be forced to compel councils to sell houses which neither the council nor the Government wished to sell. That is monstrous, and it is in conflict with the principle that I have stated.<br/>
If the sale of the house had been completed, it would be wrong for a Labour Government to interfere. However, if the sale of the house had not been completed, a Labour Government should pay back the &#x00A3;100 deposit or the option payment plus interest. That would be fair to all concerned.<br/>
Lord Bellwin's brief reply to the debate on this amendment was worthless, depreciatory and hardly worth making. He said:
<q>it is harder to save up when the price against which you are saving is in fact increasing as you <i>save,"&#x2014;</i>[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 21 July 1980; Vol. 412, c. 66.]</q>
That was really all that he did say. Everything else is increasing in price. Are people to be protected because the price of potatoes increases, so that they may buy potatoes at their price two years earlier? Clearly, that is ridiculous. Why should one item be under the Government's protection? It is because the Government are so desperate to sell council houses. For the reasons that I have stated, I and many of my hon. Friends are completely opposed to the Bill.</p>

<p>I endorse the argument of my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, East (Mr. Allaun). I draw to the attention of the House the finding of the Environment Committee on the sale of council houses. It appears in the Committee's report on the implications of the


public expenditure White Paper. It states:
<q>Your Committee estimates that an average of between five and 10 houses will need to be sold in order to build one replacement.</q>
For that reason the Committee considered it extremely important that the volume of sales should be limited as effectively as possible.<br/>
If sales are to be effected at a price which is subject to 20 per cent. per annum inflation in house prices, we are discussing a price that will be 40 per cent. below the market price, without taking into account the discount. The pressure on local authorities to replace the houses that are lost to meet the housing need will be greatly intensified.<br/>
There was a strong thread running through the evidence that the Select Committee received from local authorities of all political complexions&#x2014;namely, that the option provisions are causing them great anxiety. They feel that it will be extremely difficult to ascertain to what extent a secure tenant claiming to exercise the right to buy genuinely fails to meet the financial qualifications and is thus able to claim the option provision.<br/>
The scope for abuse is enormous. It will be very much to the advantage of anyone to seek to use the option provision rather than to purchase at the price that applies when he gives his notice. The option provision is a bad one and the Lords amendment, which limits the damage that will be caused by it, deserves the support of the House.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that anyone with average common sense will rush along to put down his &#x00A3;100. It is a pity that the Government do not treat private assets as they treat public assets. Their aim is to boost the sale of council houses. That policy does not produce one additional housing unit.<br/>
I was chairman of a housing committee for a considerable time. I am still the committee's vice-chairman. The authority has been selling council houses for almost three years. It has 37,400 council houses and it has sold about 300. The 300 are all semi-detached houses on the best parts of the estates.<br/>
If someone lives in a council house, he has secure tenure. The house is his in any event. Anyone who knows anything

about public housing knows that allocations and transfers are decided mainly by relets. There is an average reletting of between 3 per cent. and 5 per cent. Most new building is slum clearance. A total council house stock of 37,400 leads to 1,000 relets a year. If council houses are sold, tenants do not apply for reallocation.<br/>
What happens if the price of a house decreases? Consett, Corby and other towns are being murdered. Houses in those areas may decrease in value in two years' time. Will the Government say that that price will not apply and there will be a revaluation? Will they acknowledge that Government policy has murdered the town, that no one is living there and that houses have become readily available?<br/>
The other place did not go far enough. The Government's policy is nonsensical. Their aim is to persuade tenants to rush to deposit their &#x00A3;100 and to give a boost to the section of the Tory manifesto on the sale of council houses. The provision is nonsensical and I hope that it is rejected.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Dixon) escorted me round some of the housing in his constituency a short while ago. I was able to see for myself the difficulties in his area. I had explained to me the situation that he has described to the House. He has spoken with great experience of local government housing. That is the most authoritative experience, from which the House can benefit.<br/>
I take the opportunity to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann), the chairman of the Environment Committee, on his Committee's report. His Committee produced an outstanding report a few days ago. It indicts the Secretary of State on a number of issues. It draws attention to facts that otherwise would not have been elucidated. My hon. Friend and his Committee have done a service to the House by providing us with those facts and by giving the Secretary of State a case to which he will not easily find a credible response.<br/>
In moving disagreement with the Lords amendment the Minister made a most amazing claim. He said that when another place decided to insert the


amendment it was an example of the hostility of the Labour Party to home ownership. I live and learn every day, but that is the first news that I have had that there is a Labour majority in another place and that the Labour Party is able to impose its will upon that place.<br/>
My noble Friends who campaigned against the Bill and who won a significant number of victories by their dedication and hard work could not have won one victory if they had not been joined by members of other parties and by those of no party. They could not have won if the Conservative Party had been able to muster its full strength in another place. Such is the disillusionment with the Bill in another place that my noble Friends were able to obtain a majority for their amendments. That did not happen because we have a majority in that place. If we had, some of the accidents that took place in the previous Parliament might not have taken place.<br/>
I express my agreement with all my hon. Friends who have spoken in this debate. It is undoubtedly one of the nastiest aspects of the compulsory sale of council houses. I refer to the &#x00A3;100 option. It is nothing less than a rip-off of public assets. The Government are forcing up the cost of so many items such as fuel, telephone bills and railway fares, and this is the one price that they have decided to freeze. They are in favour of the free market on every other issue.<br/>
The &#x00A3;100 option with a frozen price is especially offensive to private house buyers, who are finding it especially difficult to buy because of the high mortgage interest rate that has been brought about by the Government's economic policies. House price inflation is still very high. The rate has been falling because of the lack of buyers caused by the high mortgage interest rate, but, it is still very high. Other purchasers have to accept it.<br/>
The Minister tried to draw tears from us by painting a picture of council house tenants wishing to buy and being at the mercy of house price increases. Thousands of people in humble circumstances who are not council tenants wish to buy houses. They are at the mercy of increased house prices. The Government are responsible for those price increases,

yet they can offer them nothing. Such people have been priced out of home ownership. In addition, they must pay their rates and taxes and contribute to a rip-off that will benefit a small and privileged minority.<br/>
Private home owners have to accept house price inflation. Yesterday, figures were published showing that only 628,000 new mortgages are expected this year, compared with 715,000 last year. That is a reduction of 12 per cent. Such people get no help from the Government. A small minority will have its privilege paid for by everybody else. The &#x00A3;100 option is an offence to the taxpayers and ratepayers who must pay for it.<br/>
If I have a criticism of the noble Lords who carried the amendment against the Government's wishes, it is that the amendment is over-generous. It still gives the beneficiary of the &#x00A3;100 option a large gift at the expense of taxpayers and ratepayers. Those taxpayers and ratepayers will pay interest on the building of such houses while the purchaser is given the option to buy. The purchaser will not suffer fully from house price inflation. In addition, the discount will eat up some of the price increase.<br/>
If the amendment is accepted, the purchaser on the &#x00A3;100 option will have to share some of the burden of inflation with his benefactors, mainly the taxpayers and ratepayers. It redresses the balance to some extent. That is why we believe that the amendment should be accepted.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I shall respond briefly. The hon. Member for Salford, East (Mr. Allaun) referred to the noble Baroness who moved the amendment in the other place. He described her as a Conservative peer. I note that Dod's Parliamentary Companion describes her as a Labour Life Baroness. I am delighted to know that there has been yet another convert to the Tory Party. No doubt there are many more to come.<br/>
The hon. Member for Salford. East made a significant statement in his capacity as a member of the national executive of the Labour Party. He made clear that his view&#x2014;and I assume that his view represents that of the national executive&#x2014;was that, if there were a


change of Government, the Labour Party would not honour options that were still running. Although he accepted that if an option had been completed it would have to be honoured, he made clear that the Labour Party would not regard itself as bound by options that were running when a change of Government took place. I am sure that that will not be forgotten.<br/>
The hon. Member for Salford, East and the right hon. Member for Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. Kaufman) made similar points. They suggested that there should be continuing price inflation during the option period. That would effectively nullify the effect of the option. The purpose of the option is to enable those who cannot buy immediately to save up during that time and to accumulate the difference between their maximum mortgage capacity and the price of the house. Inevitably, the price of the house will be somewhat higher. However, if the price escalates all the time that will defeat the purpose of the option. There would then be no point in having an option provision.<br/>
We want to give those council tenants who want to buy their homes every possible opportunity to do so. Inevitably, a considerable number will wish to exercise the right to buy for the first time. Although they may not be able to afford the full purchase price, they might have a maximum mortgage capacity equal to 70 or 90 per cent. of the purchase price. Over a two-year period, those tenants would have a reasonable opportunity to increase their earnings and savings, and would then be able to buy their houses.</p>

I remind the House of what my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Construction said in Committee:
<q>I give him a clear assurance on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment that we regard the matter not just as one of consultation between the local authorities and the Secretary of State but as a matter for initiative by the local authorities. We have no pre-conceived view about areas that are suitable for rural designation. We regard the initiative as lying with local authorities and it is for them to take a view as to the relevance of the clause to their circumstances. I am sure that they will put forward proposals to the Secretary of State if they feel they should have designations in their areas. We regard the involvement of the Local authorities as integral with the operation of the locality covenant, in the new way that is described here."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee F,</i> 19 February 1980; c. 406.]</q>

<p>I anticipated that that might be said, and I shall come to the point in a moment.<br/>
In trying to convert an undertaking into a statutory duty, the amendment risks causing confusion without achieving valuable practical effect. The local authority would now make the order to designate the rural area under clause 18(1), but the Secretary of State would still have the job of designating the regions from which future purchasers must come where there was a locality covenant. The Secretary of State would also still have to give or withhold his consent under clause 18(4) to the imposition of the alternative safeguards of a 10-year pre-emption condition. Out of necessity, the arrangements under clause 18 are already complicated. Surely the subdivision of duties between the Secretary of State and the local authority provides an additional complication that is unnecessary.<br/>
There are further objections to the amendment. If the orders were made by a local authority and not by the Secretary of State, they would not come under the scrutiny of Parliament.</p>

<p>That was exactly the point made by Lord Bellwin, but I fail to understand it. If the Secretary of State's consent is required, the exercise of that consent will properly be the subject of scrutiny by this House.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1776211" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-08-06a.623.2" hansard_membership_id="9928" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14877" speakername="Mr. Finsberg" colnum="623" time="20:30:00">
<p>That is almost the next point that I was coming to. Not only does the absence of scrutiny seem constitutionally undesirable. It would also mean that there would be no way of finding out whether orders had been made, such as would be provided by the relevant statutory instrument if the Secretary of State made the order.<br/>
I suggest that the amendment would lead to administrative inconvenience and inefficiency. I ask the House to consider what the effect would be on a tenant of the inconvenience and inefficiency. It would enable a local authority to delay the exercise of the right to buy by saying that it was considering whether to make an order, and, when it had done so, approaching the Secretary of State for his consent. In our view, that would get the right to buy off to a thoroughly slow start in many areas. No doubt that

thought has occurred to some Labour Members who support the amendment, but it is not an argument that commends itself to me or to my hon. Friends. Therefore, I urge the House to disagree with the amendment.<br/>
Let me repeat, so that it is on the record once more, that any considered recommendation by a local authority for the designation of an additional rural area under clause 18(1) will receive my right hon. Friend's careful investigation and consideration.</p>

<p>I listened with care to the Under-Secretary, as usual, but I found him less convincing than usual. He failed to give a proper answer to the question that I asked. One of the arguments that the Government have used&#x2014;at length&#x2014;in another place is that to provide that the initiative should rest with a local authority would be to ensure that there would be no parliamentary scrutiny of the decisions made by the Secretary of State in exercising his consent. That is simple nonsense.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for drawing that analogy to my attention, but I hope that he will agree that, in fact, there will be every opportunity for scrutiny, because any decision that a Minister makes is subject to scrutiny by the House through written and oral questions and through the normal processes of debate.<br/>
The Under-Secretary is also wrong to allege that we should not be able to find out how the Secretary of State had exercised his consent. I hope and assume that the hon. Gentleman was not suggesting that the Government would refuse to answer questions about whether, and in what circumstances, the Secretary of State had decided to exercise his consent. Those objections of the Under-Secretary are worthless and should be treated as such.<br/>
Throughout the debates on the Bill, the Labour Opposition have fought, often


with the support of Conservative local authorities, to say that local authorities and local people know most about defending the housing needs of their areas. The Government have wished to provide a uniform scheme irrespective of local circumstances and whether, for example, council houses that are desperately needed in rural areas could be snapped up as second homes and removed from the market of working people.<br/>
Bit by bit, the Government have conceded some changes and improvements to give some protection to those living in council houses in rural areas and those in need of such houses, but they have refused to accord local authorities the responsibility, that they deserve, for deciding whether they should be treated as rural areas. It is our view that the initiative must rest with the local authorities.<br/>
The Under-Secretary said that if that happened it would ensure that the right to buy got off to a thoroughly slow start which was what most Labour Members wanted. Occasionally, the hon. Gentleman gets at the truth and it is true that we wish the sale of council houses to get off to a slow start. However, that is not our intention in putting forward this proposal. Neither, in response to the hon. Member for Huntingdonshire (Mr. Major), will it be the effect. Although the designation of a rural area is on the initiative of a local authority, it depends for its consent and its operation upon the Secretary of State. The present Secretary of State, for the foreseeable future, will exercise that discretion, and he will no doubt do so swiftly and exercise it in those areas where he is convinced that the local authority is justified.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that the local authority could take a considerable time before deciding to designate the area and indicating that it has such a designation in mind? That, in itself, could cause considerable delay.</p>

<p>A local authority could do the same now. It could indicate that it intended to apply to the Secretary of State for an order. As long as the local authority has not applied, and no order has been given, under the present provisions, and provided that the local authority has made no order under the clauses

proposed in another place, that would in no way affect the rights of individuals wishing to buy their council houses. The Minister's suggestion that the right to buy would be seriously undermined by the amendment is nonsense. It would enhance the right of local authorities. They have the information, and they know when to take the initiative. I support the amendment.</p>

<p>As the House will be aware, the Environment Committee has taken evidence on the financial and social consequences of selling local authority houses. Among that evidence were representations from a number of rural authorities, including oral evidence from the South Lakeland district council and the Allerdale district council. As a consequence of their evidence the Committee instructed me to write to the Secretary of State to draw attention to the anxieties felt by a large number of rural areas about the prospect of the loss of the few council houses in villages&#x2014;not necessarily in areas of national parks or outstanding natural beauty, but in agricultural villages where the council houses are occupied by key workers. They are at risk of being compulsorily sold with the consequence that within a few years the houses will be taken over as second homes.<br/>
I accept that since the time when I, on the instructions of the Committee, communicated with the Secretary of State amendments have been introduced which improve the position for those areas that have been designated. Subject to the Lords amendments, the defect in the Bill as it stands is that there are large parts of the country where a local authority may feel, rightly and essentially, that if it loses the few houses upon which the key workers depend, a village will die. I am sure that Conservative Members will know even better than Opposition Members the extent to which a village can suddenly be transformed from a place with real life to a place which is a source of commuters or a base for holiday homes. I urge the Minister and Conservative Members to seek to protect the viability of rural communities by maintaining the Lords amendment as it stands.<br/>
The Minister will be aware that, in a question which was answered in


<i>Hansard</i> on 30 July, c. 741, I asked which local authorities had made representations to the Secretary of State about the provisions of the Housing Bill for rural areas. The Minister listed 12 authorities which had made representations about the dangers to rural areas. I draw his attention to the fact that only one of those 12 authorities was a Labour-controlled authority. The remainder were Conservative, independent or non-party authorities, and they made the greater part of the case in urging him to have second thoughts about this measure.<br/>
The Minister must know what harm this Bill can cause in an area in which those on whom the rural economy depends are liable to find that they no longer have the opportunity to be housed by the local authority. I am glad that the Government have accepted that they should not make changes in the provisions of the Rent (Agriculture) Act. But, if they lose local authority houses, how will they fulfil their obligations? How will they sustain the life of rural areas if they allow these few houses to be sold?<br/>
It is the local authorities in those areas that know, far better than the Minister or anyone in Whitehall can know, the extent to which the few houses in a particular locality are essential to the economy and to the society of that locality. It is for them to make the representations.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) has demolished the Under-Secretary's point about Parliament not having the opportunity to exercise control over this. Let the local authority make the representations. Under the amendment, the Minister has the power to say "No, this is a nonsense."</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is raising a point which no doubt he can raise on another occasion. It is not directly relevant. Local authorities said

There is no need for the Government to use their majority to crush this amendment on this minor proposal for a degree of local government autonomy. The Government have been crushing local government democracy with measures such as the Local Government, Planning and Land (No. 2) Bill and this Bill. This opportunity for local authorities to take the initiative to propose is something which should be enacted in the statute. We have had the undertaking from the Secretary of State in Committee, which the Minister has repeated. As I pointed out in an intervention, an undertaking in Committee is in no way enforceable. The courts will not look at that. They will look at the words in the statute. I urge the House to ensure that these words remain in the statute.</p>

<p>Without being contentious, I should like to draw attention to the fact that a Member of this House took part in a television debate on this matter last night, apparently misinforming the public about the content of the Bill, and has not seen fit to be present when the House of Commons is debating it. I regard that as an abuse of the House. It is Parliament where these matters are debated. If an hon. Member is to discuss a piece of legislation which is being debated in this House the next day, apparently inaccurately representing, in any case, what the legislation contains, I should have thought it incumbent on the hon. Member at least to do the House the courtesy of attending the debate on the matter on which he has been lecturing us on television.</p>

<p>I even made the point of speaking to the hon. Member for Lichfield and Tamworth (Mr. Heddle) prior to this debate. I did not know that this matter was to be raised. However, as the Minister will be aware, there are many people in the national parks, nationally, who are very anxious about the clauses which would require them to sell property in the event of the tenants applying under the right to buy.


As a result of the programme last night, whatever the hon. Member for Lichfield and Tamworth said, it has been construed from his statement that in the national parks people do not have the right to buy their homes. Indeed, the local authorities were today celebrating their belief that this right to buy did not exist. I think that it is incumbent on the Minister in this debate to make clear nationally what the law is, and to take into account the position of local authorities which not only own properties within a national park but whose national parks are surrounded by other rural areas which are just as exciting for potential second home owners&#x2014;indeed, great parts of my constituency&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Reading, North (Mr. Durant) is so gallant. I admire him for his efforts on this issue.<br/>
As my hon. Friends who have spoken in favour of the amendment have said, and as I hope a number of Conservative Members will also agree, this is a modest amendment. It is not an amendment that will do what television viewers were apparently told last night. It will not end the compulsory sale of council houses in this area.<br/>
The amendment is so modest that I find it impossible to understand why the Government are so determined to smother it. Strong arguments have been advanced far beyond the limits of the Labour Party for the exclusion of rural areas altogether from the compulsory sale of council houses. As my hon. Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden (Mr. Douglas-Mann) has pointed out, great damage can be inflicted on the balance in such communities if high proportions of a small housing stock are being sold off.<br/>
The amendment does not go anything like so wide as the kind of exclusion that we have achieved for old people's dwellings. The amendment accepts the principle and content of clause 18 as it stands. We regard clause 18, even with its improvements, as unsatisfactory, but we are not seeking to have that clause rejected. All the amendment does is to say "Do not leave it to the Secretary of State to decide what is a rural area." After all, the Secretary of State, any Secretary of State&#x2014;I am not making a personal reflection on the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;cannot know the whole country intimately. Lord Bellwin, for the Government, admitted in the Lords that he did not know what areas, or even what kind of areas, the Secretary of State is going to designate as rural areas. We have not had that clarification.<br/>
We are saying that the local authorities, which do know the areas intimately, should have the initiative in designating those areas. We are not asking that the local authorities be given the last word. We are not asking even that they have a deciding word, because the Secretary of State will have to give his consent if a local authority seeks to designate


itself as a rural area. It would not be possible, for example, in my constituency, for the Manchester city council to seek to evade the provision by designating Ardwick Green of Victoria Park as a rural area.<br/>
9 pm<br/>
The answer to my hon. Friend for Mitcham and Morden which my hon. Friend has quoted shows that a considerable number of local authorities, often Conservative-controlled, are very worried about the impact of the Bill, even with clause 18, on rural areas. Lord Hylton, a person of Conservative antecedents, said:
<q>it is entirely consistent with Conservative principles that there should be this initiative in the hands of the local authority, who know the area and who are elected to represent it." <i>&#x2014;</i>[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 21 July 1980; Vol. 412, c.76.]</q>
I am not a connoisseur of Conservative principles, but the Secretary of State is supposed to be. This small amendment would alleviate the concern of rural areas. I cannot imagine why the Government will not accept it. I trust that they will.</p>

<p>I announced on 29 July in a reply to a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Mr. Cadbury) that the Government accepted the principle of the new clause agreed to in another place. In the light of the argument advanced during the proceedings both on this Bill and on the Social Security Bill the Government have decided that the option mortgage scheme should be extended to provide additional income to elderly non-taxpaying owner-occupiers who buy an annuity on the security of their home. This will help them to remain longer in their homes, which is the wish of the great majority of them.<br/>
The amendment that was carried in another place is incompatible with the statutory framework of the option mortgage scheme. The Government amendment is essentially a technical measure that will further the intention of the Lords amendment.<br/>
The consequential amendment ensures that the provision applies to Scotland as well as to England and Wales. I believe that the alteration to the option mortgage scheme will be widely welcomed among the considerable number of low-income owner-occupiers who are seeking to supplement their income so that they may remain in the homes that they own.</p>

<p>I am not able to give my hon. Friend the Member for Fulham (Mr. Stevens) a precise answer now.

<p>We have reached a stage where we wonder


into which precise category the Government's attitude may be placed. Is it to be placed in the "half a loaf" category or the "discretion is the better part of valour" category? There is no doubt that the Government's attitude in accepting gracefully that which was moved in another place is a substantial change in the attitude that was evinced by their spokesman in another place on more than one occasion. The Government having advanced their argument time after time and subsequently having made a substantial U-turn, we are entitled to a debate and an explanation.<br/>
First, we are entitled to say that the amendment that was moved in another place had the support of all the Benches in that place. There was support from the Liberal Benches. I pay tribute to the part played by Lord Banks to support that formidable trio of Ladies Vickers, Faithfull and Phillips. The support that came in another place had all-party support and that must be acknowledged.<br/>
It must also be acknowledged that the Government's acceptance of the principle that is enshrined in their amendment in lieu thereof is a major tribute to the tenacity of two responsible and respectable organisations&#x2014;namely, Help the Aged and Age Concern. They were tenacious in their attempts to obtain equity in other legislation for the group of elderly citizens that we are discussing. They have been persistent. They will be delighted with the result of their efforts.<br/>
9.30 pm<br/>
We are entitled to remind the House and those affected by the Bill of the present position, and of the effect of the changes. An elderly person who owns his own home, and who has an inadequate income, can supplement his income by raising a mortgage in order to purchase an annuity. From that annuity, he pays interest on the mortgage. The balance of the annuity provides the extra income. It is right that those who pay tax should enjoy tax relief on mortgage interest, thus making the arrangements much more attractive to them than to non-taxpayers. When the Minister acknowledged the amendment from the other place he failed to mention not only that it had been carried but that it had been carried by a substantial majority, in

House of Lords terms. There were 114 votes in favour of the amendment and 85 votes against. Those who read the proceedings of the other place will know that the figure of 85 represents the type of support that the Government had during most of the proceedings. The figure of 114 was made up of Lords from both sides and by those who sit on the Cross Benches.<br/>
The Lords amendment and the Government amendment seek to extend to non-taxpayers the option mortgage arrangements that are available to the non-taxpayer, who raises a mortgage to buy his house. The benefit of paying a lower, Government-subsidised rate of interest on a mortgage should be extended to those elderly people who do not pay tax. In the same way, elderly taxpayers get a tax benefit. I was delighted to note the success of Lord Banks. During the debate in the House of Lords, he successfully quoted the words of Lord Carr. All hon. Members are aware that he was an eminent and respected hon. Member. He was once Home Secretary, and a leading member of the Conservative Party. He expressed support for the principles contained in the amendment. The Minister's friends in the other place advanced arguments that have now been reversed. They repeatedly advanced the argument that no general principle stated that tax relief for taxpayers should be matched by subsidies for non-taxpayers. The Government have clearly made a concession to that argument.<br/>
The argument was also advanced that option mortgages are designed to encourage home ownership. The amendment would have been a new departure. The Minister appears to have accepted that new departures should be welcomed and that there is nothing wrong in redressing a clear injustice. It was also said that if the amendment were accepted, the effect would be more attractive to non-taxpayers. It was said that taxpayers' money would be used to subsidise a special group. The philosophy of the Conservative Party is to encourage and sustain home ownership. Secondly, the Conservative Party has a special place in its philosophy for looking after the elderly. Thirdly, the Conservative Party continually seeks to maintain its interest in equity. Those three principles were


thrown overboard by the Conservative spokesman in the House of Lords during resistance to the amendment.<br/>
The other argument which has now been accepted by the Government is that of cost. A Government spokesman in the other place said that if the amendment that the Government are now moving were accepted, it could cost any-think up to &#x00A3;10 million. Of course, the mover of the successful amendment claimed that at most the amendment might cost &#x00A3;2&#x00BD; million. It was estabblished quite clearly in the other place that there was likely to be a greater burden on the taxpayer by not assisting elderly non-taxpayers&#x2014;that is if the concession were not made. We all know that in many instances if the elderly were denied the opportunity of continuing to own their own homes&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am a little worried about my hon. Friend's remarks. If he accepts the principle that the subsidy given to taxpayers should now be given to non-taxpayers, will he go further and say that the same subsidy should be given to those elderly constituents of mine who do not own their own homes and who do not have the ability to do so? Are we supporting the principle of the subsidy all the way along the line?</p>

<p>With respect, the argument here relates to those who own their own homes or who wish to own their own homes and who are elderly. At present those who are not elderly have the opportunity, whatever their circumstances, of taking advantage of the option mortgage. The principle now enshrined in the amendment, and previously resisted by the Government, is that the benefit of the option mortgage, open at present to those who are not elderly, should be extended to the elderly who are non-taxpayers and for whom the option mortgage is the best arrangement. I am grateful to the Minister for having indicated that the technical defects in the Lords amendment have now been put right in the amendment before us.</p>

Very late in the day, the Government, despite resisting the arguments in another place, have come before us tonight with an acceptable form of words. In view of the fact that the Government have accepted the principle and will put the matter right, I have pleasure in urging my right hon. and hon. Friends to accept the Government amendment.</p>

I wish to speak not only on the amendment in lieu but on the proposition that the House doth disagree with the Lords in their amendment. One of the myths is that the Conservative Party believes in home ownership and that the Labour Party seeks to deny home ownership to millions of people. The records of the parties since the war make it clear that the only party which has taken positive steps to extend the opportunity for people to purchase their own homes is the Labour Party.</p>

<p>There was no inconsistency, simply the omission of an adjective. I meant to say that the Labour Party was the only major party which sought to extend home ownership. In its heyday the Liberal Party, some years before the hon. Gentleman was born, also assisted in that aim. I hear Government Members laughing at the proposition. The Labour Party has taken positive steps to extend home ownership.<br/>
Finance Acts provide that interest payable on the purchase of a home is eligible for relief against tax. That provision has been in operation since before the war.

What other changes have been made to assist people to buy their own homes? The most important is the provision of the option mortgage scheme which appeared in the 1964 Labour Party manifesto and which was implemented in 1967. That provision is aimed at lower income families who do not have the full benefit of tax relief. That was the first important improvement which the Labour Party made towards assisting home ownership.<br/>
The second improvement was the provision to assist first-time buyers. Under the last Government loan and grant schemes were introduced to assist first-time buyers.</p>

<p>It is continuing to do so. The development of council housing has transformed the housing condition of this nation and made us one of the best-housed nations in Europe.<br/>
I have experience of council housing. I lived in a council house until I was married. My family was able to move out of two privately rented rooms and at least live in accommodation that was dry and large enough for a family of five and my parents because of council housing. Conservative Members should give us no lectures about the importance of council housing. My right hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. Kaufman) is right to pledge Labour to repeal this damaging and obnoxious legislation. It will undermine the opportunity of local authorities to house those in need of housing in the way that my parents were housed in 1952, albeit by a pretty reactionary Conservative council.<br/>
Local authority housing stock will be denuded by the so-called right to buy, and in years to come waiting lists will grow longer. We do not say that no tenant in no circumstance should have the right to buy, but we believe that the decision should be left to local authorities, which know the housing needs in their areas. We also firmly believe that discounts of this size should not be given.<br/>
I return to owner-occupation. Because Labour believes in meeting the housing needs of the whole nation, whether through rented accommodation or owner-occupation, we have sought to increase and improve the public rented sector, while encouraging those who can do so to buy homes in the private sector. That is why we introduced the option mortgage scheme and schemes to provide assistance to first-time purchasers. That is why we support the scheme that my noble Friend Lady Birk and other Labour peers helped to push through. It extends the assistance that we have always supported.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point, which I intended to refer to after dealing with the record of the Conservative Government between 1970 and 1973.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) asked my hon.<br/>
Friend the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Graham) whether it was right to agree to the extension of tax relief as set out in the amendment when elderly people in council accommodation would not have such tax relief.<br/>
I understand that point, but I believe that we should act fairly between all owner-occupiers. That was the reason why we introduced the option mortgage scheme. Wage earners on low incomes were not able to benefit from tax relief to the full extent and the option mortgage scheme provided compensation.<br/>
Similarly, those with sufficient income could obtain tax relief if they entered into the sort of annuity arrangement that has been described. The amendment provides that those with a lower income should have the same benefit, in relation to tax relief, as if they had a sufficient income to get that relief.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that the elderly people who are to have the option mortgage scheme, and therefore tax relief, extended to them probably received tax relief when they were younger and buying their first home? His argument that they must get tax relief in the same way that a taxpayer would does not hold water.<br/>
Will my hon. Friend explain what other subsidy is given to any other category who are not taxpayers? When do we say that taxpayers receive a subsidy because they are taxpayers, but that because another category does not receive it because they are not taxpayers we must give them some other form of subsidy? Where is the equity in that?</p>

<p>The elderly living in rented accommodation receive rent rebates if they are in public sector accommodation and rent allowances if they are in private sector accommodation. Equity is involved there. Given the present structure of reliefs available for rent allowances and rent rebates for rented accommodation, and tax reliefs for the elderly with sufficient income in private accommodation, it would be inequitable to exclude the lower income category seeking an annuity arrangement.<br/>
My hon. Friend's first point was whether it was genuinely equitable for those who had enjoyed tax relief in the

past to enjoy it again. That raises an interesting question whether tax relief on the purchase of homes should be restricted, for example, to a 20-year period in a person's life, and should not be repeated. There are strong social and economic grounds for that. In the long term the major benefit of existing tax reliefs is not to the individual because the tax reliefs are capitalised in the capital values of the properties.</p>

<p>Surely my hon. Friend cannot be right. Is it not the case that every man and woman pays taxes? They pay VAT and other taxes. They cannot get out of that.

Friend suggesting that the elderly should not contribute to the child allowance?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his intervention. I would not dream of answering for my hon. Friend the Member for Ormskirk concerning his suggestion. Despite the respect and esteem in which I hold him, he must speak for himself. My hon. Friend the Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Lewis) is right to say that everybody pays taxes in one form or another. But we are concerned with the reliefs available through the payment of income tax. The value of such reliefs clearly depends on the size of an individual's income.<br/>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Edmonton I am glad that the proposal was moved in substance in another place, and passed against the advice of the Government. I am glad also that on this relatively minor matter the Government have had the grace to return to the Commons, without having to be pushed by the Opposition, with an alternative which is almost acceptable.

<p>I wish to make it clear that I have no intention of speaking about council housing. It may come as a surprise to the House to know that council housing has nothing to do with the amendment that we are discussing. Neither do I propose to engage for any length of time in a Dutch auction about which party has in the past been more beneficial to owner-occupation.<br/>
I propose to concentrate my attention wholly on the original amendment from another place, and on the words that now appear on the Order Paper. Although I take nothing away from those responsible for passing the amendment in another place, I wish to place on record the fact that in the 10 years that I have been in the House I have constantly pressed successive Governments to include the elderly in the option mortgage system. It is a great pleasure for me this evening to find some reward&#x2014;although I should have preferred my hon. Friend the Minister to accept the proposal when I pressed him no later than June of this year, rather than wait for an amendment to be passed in another place.<br/>
10 pm<br/>
However, there seems to be a misconception running through the House. We are not talking about elderly people buying their properties. We are talking about elderly people who already own their properties and who wish to sell their properties, to take a loan upon them and, with the proceeds of the loan, to effect an annuity, and who are prevented from doing that at present because there is no taxable income to offset against the interest that has to be paid on the loan.<br/>
I welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Graham) made certain that there would be a debate on this subject. I could have wished, however, that during his contribution he had cast a little more clarification on the Opposition's thinking on the matter and, most particularly, that he had made clear what this scheme is not, as well as what it is. Unless this debate is publicised, there is a serious danger that it will be assumed that this is a new clause that is universally advantageous to all elderly people. I place clearly on record that that is not so. There are undoubtedly powerful reasons why we should introduce the new clause this evening. For example, it is one ideal way of sustaining the independence of elderly people. Secondly, it is a way of using their principal, sometimes their only, asset, whereas otherwise it may lie dormant. Thirdly, it is a method of improving their standard of living in the later days of their lives without having to resort to social security, which is anathema to many of the people about whom I am talking.<br/>
Those are the points in its favour, but it is not for everyone. For example, if there are relatives who are confidently expecting the property to be their sole inheritance and would be put out at any suggestion that that property were to be sold effectively over their heads, it cannot be advised as a suitable scheme for elderly people in these circumstances. Even there, however, I have found in the past that where that becomes evident, the sons and daughters are frequently moved to assist the elderly people to boost their income, so that the house that is to be inherited by sons or daughters remains intact.<br/>
In these circumstances considerable care has to be directed before it is decided that this is a desirable scheme.<br/>
Secondly, it is not as easy as saying "I shall sell my house to an insurance company or to a financial institution, and I shall take an annuity on it to boost my income". The market for this sort of home reversionary plan is very limited. One of the disadvantages is that in taking the loan from an insurance company or an institution the annuity tends to be tied to the same insurance company or institution, and that need not necessarily mean that the individual is getting the best deal.<br/>
I hope that as a result of this change in the law that we are here enacting, more institutions will come into the market and we shall have rather more schemes under which the financial institution giving the loan on the property leaves the person free to search for the best annuity available in the market.<br/>
I have heard reference to high interest rates and the disadvantage to owner-occupiers. Perhaps I should say that if there is one area in which high interest rates are of enormous advantage it is that of purchased annuities. So here we are doing something for elderly people that has not been possible to do previously, which is advantageous on two fronts.<br/>
The other point is that the elderly people to whom these schemes will apply should be rather wary. I speak as one who has been in the field and knows that many opportunities are available for attracting business from such elderly people. I also know that there are many people in the field&#x2014;let us call them salesmen&#x2014;who are not always on the level in


introducing these schemes to the elderly people. Not only do I suggest a careful shopping around for the correct scheme for the elderly person but I also believe that the elderly person concerned would be well advised to seek professional advice.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
This amendment covers the Housing Corporation. As the House knows, the Housing Corporation has only narrow powers of deregistering housing associations under the Housing Act 1974. These, in effect, apply only when an association is no longer operating as such. The sort of


circumstances in which these new powers of voluntary deregistration would be of benefit mainly involve housing associations whose registration has always been unnecessary or inappropriate.<br/>
When the 1974 Act first came into effect, as many hon. Members will recall, the corporation registered a number of associations, which continue to exist but whose activities are untypical of those of a registered housing association. Such associations will not have received public money in the form of housing association grant and have probably never had any intention of applying for grant. Their registration often stems from a lack of understanding of the purpose of registration in the early days of the Act. They remain on the register simply for want of a power to remove them. This clause enables associations that have not received public money to be deregistered with the corporation's consent. That consent is necessary to ensure, for instance, that an association does not deregister merely in order to avoid an inquirey into its affairs.</p>

<p>We do not challenge this unexceptionable amendment, but it raises a question. As the Under-Secretary said, it lays down functions for the Housing Corporation to carry out.

I believe that this is a suitable occasion for a Government spokesman to assure us that this is not an otiose amendment, in the sense that there will be a Housing Corporation, that it will continue its activities and existing responsibilities, and that the very important functions of, among other things, registering and maintaining the probity of the housing association movement will continue.<br/>

Under the clause as drafted the Secretary of State may demand interest on surpluses accumulating in the grant redemption funds at rates to be decided by him for any period beginning up to 12 months before he serves a notice on a particular association to direct the use of the surpluses. However, this carries a risk that associations will be charged interest for a period during which they had no knowledge that interest would be payable, or at what rate. Clearly that is


not a satisfactory position for them to be put into.<br/>
I believe that the amendment puts matters right. In practice, my right hon. Friend intends to make a general announcement in advance of the rate at which interest on surpluses arising will become payable where those surpluses remain in the funds after the end of the accounting period in which they were generated. When the Secretary of State subsequently gives a notice to an individual association to direct the use of its surpluses, the amendment provides that the earliest date from which interest will be payable is the end of the accounting period. The amendment therefore removes the risk of associations incurring unknown liabilities.</p>

During the passage of this Bill Parliament has expressed its clear will that secure tenants of local authorities and certain housing associations should have the right to buy their homes.

<p>I shall not criticise the right hon. Member for Ardwick. I hope


that, equally, he will not criticise me for bringing forward the new clause.<br/>
The basic purpose of the clause is to ensure that no landlord should be able to succeed in frustrating the right to buy by disposing of some or all of his housing to some other body to whom the right to buy does not apply. The Bill, in some cases by amendment of prior legislation, provides for a comprehensive requirement for ministerial consent both to the disposal of part V houses and land and also to the disposal of land and houses by registered housing associations.<br/>
This consent requirement is needed in order to simplify the present law. It is also needed to ensure that tenants whom Parliament intends to have the right to buy shall not be deprived of that right as a result of disposals to other bodies to whom the right does not apply.<br/>
However, as it stands, section 128 of the local Government Act 1972 has the effect that if a disposal takes place without necessary consent the person to whom it is made still gets valid title. The Bill makes similar provision in respect of housing association disposals in clause 121. We have come to the conclusion, therefore, that as the Bill stands, the rights of tenants are not yet adequately protected.<br/>
The new clause deals with the problem by providing that a disposal that takes place without ministerial consent will be void. In other words, it will be as if the disposal had not taken place, thereby ensuring that tenants will still have their right to buy. The important exception is made to deal with the case where an individual makes a single purchase of a house or flat. It is possible that an authority would sell or lease a house or flat and do so without consent, unwittingly, because it had not conformed with the terms of an available consent. Such a disposal would clearly not subvert the right to buy, and it is clearly right to protect the position of the individual purchaser in such cases.<br/>
The new clause also deals with a gap in the present requirements for ministerial consent for the disposal of part V council houses, that is, the requirements that apply until the relevant part of the Bill comes into force.<br/>
Under the present law, the consent requirements may not cover all possible

disposals. We are not prepared to see the right to buy taken away from tenants by any landlord who seeks to make such a disposal in the short time that the Government hope remains before enactment. Therefore, the new clause provides that such a disposal would also be void. We must ensure that individual tenants have the rights that Parliament intends them to have and that those rights are not taken away. These provisions have that purpose. They apply only to transactions after the new clause was tabled in another place.<br/>
The Department and the Welsh Office have already written to all local authorities warning them of the new clause. The Housing Corporation has written similarly to housing associations.<br/>
The new clause is essential to protect the interests of tenants from any landlord who may attempt to use this legal device to deny tenants the right to buy. I hope that it will be agreed to.</p>

We shall oppose this provision within the law. We shall not in any way seek to have the law broken. I made that clear on many occasions in Committee, and I am glad to take this opportunity to repeat it, because it is important to emphasise that all parties in the House should accept the law as it is made by Parliament. If Ministers have some intention, it is not the duty of the citizen to obey that intention; it is the duty of the citizen to accept the law.

I should like to make two points on the new clause. First, it shows that the Government have some kind of obsessessive mistrust of local authorities. In Committee we were assured that Ministers were confident that the reserve powers in clause 22 would not have to be used, but they are now sticking their fingers into what they think are holes in the dyke.<br/>
The Minister, with his zealous, clever, dutiful and agreeable officials, has been putting bits of sticking plaster all over the Bill since January. More than 500 bits of sticking plaster are stuck all over the Bill. The Minister may find that those bits of sticking plaster do not fill all the gaps in the Bill. It may be that he would have liked another stage&#x2014;perhaps a third House of Parliament&#x2014;to put through a further 200 or 300 amendments to improve the situation still further. We do not like the new clause for that reason. But for a Department that has to deal with local authorities, it seems obnoxious that the motivating thought should be that local authorities are not to be trusted.<br/>
The reason why I particularly do not like this provision is that it is retrospective. It will go back a number of weeks and cover events that will have taken place before Royal Assent. The Minister, when referring to remarks made by my hon. Friend the Member for Salford, East (Mr. Allaun) about the &#x00A3;100 option, for example, accused him of wishing to legislate retrospectively on that matter. Yet the Government are legislating retrospectively in order to require local authorities to be relieved of public possessions.<br/>
I should also like some information from the Minister, because it is not clear to me what disposals are covered. I pluck an example at random from my constituency, of the Birch housing co-operative, which is anxious for Manchester City Council to sell it a small number of houses for its co-operative, which it can then modernise and turn into habitable dwellings. Under the Bill that is possible for an individual, and a sale to an individual is not prohibited by this new clause. I shall be interested to know the position of a sale to a housing co-operative.<br/>
I have written to the chairman of the Housing Corporation&#x2014;which I am pleased will remain in existence long enough for him to be able to reply to me officially&#x2014;about this co-operative. I should also be interested to know what will happen when a local authority sells to a housing association in order that the housing association can sell on to a housing co-operative, the housing corporation having carried out the modernisation

work. I take a moment to pay tribute to the Minister for his knowledge of the Bill. I wish that it were matched by flexibility in policy, but we cannot always hope for that.<br/>
It would be helpful if we could be assured that worthy, small co-operatives in inner city areas were not prohibited from their activities, even in the short period that remains before the Bill is enacted, or, indeed, afterwards, The Minister knows that many inner city areas have problems such as those of Manchester. I do not apologise to the House for using an example in my constituency in order to draw attention to a general point. It will be helpful if the Minister will provide an answer to that question in his reply. I should add, almost in passing, that we shall of course vote against the amendment.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. Kaufman) criticised this amendment as being retrospective. Although I do not often pray in aid nationalisation legislation, if he looks at the Labour Government's Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act, with which he was so intimately associated, he will note that it included a provision that rendered null and void anything that took place in the companies concerned after the date of publication of the legislation. That thought struck us when we considered how to deal with the problem.<br/>
On the specific point of disposals, the effect of the amendment is not to prohibit disposals but to ensure that where the consent of the Secretary of State is required for a disposal, that consent is obtained. If it is not obtained the purchaser will not obtain valid title. There would be nothing to stop a disposal by a local authority to a housing association, which could then be the subject of further disposal, but disposal by a local authority needs the consent of the Secretary of State.</p>

a local authority which has failed to gain consent as a result of a mistake? Will that innocent purchaser fail to gain title as a result of this amendment?</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
I shall wish to move a maunscript in lieu of the Lords amendment, in schedule 1, page 95, line 23, at end insert&#x2014;
<q>5. The landlord has, within six weeks of the service on it of a notice claiming to exercise the right to buy the dwelling-house, applied to the Secretary of State for a determination under this paragraph, and the Secretary of State has determined that the right to buy is not to be capable of being exercised with respect to the dwelling-house; and he shall so determine if satisfied&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) that the dwelling-house is designed or specially adapted for occupation by persons of pensionable age; and</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) that it is the practice of the landlord to let it only for occupation by such persons.</li>
</ol></q>
As my right hon. Friend made clear earlier today, the Government have agreed to accept the intention of the amendment passed in the other place and to exclude from the right to buy those dwellings that are designed or adapted for elderly people&#x2014;[Hon. Members: "Hear, hear"]&#x2014;and that it is the practice of landlords to let to the elderly. We have, however, accepted the amendment so that these dwellings, and only these dwellings are excluded, and at the same time scope is not provided for excluding tenants from the right to buy if the dwellings are not in the particular category of dwellings covered by the amendment.<br/>
For that reason, a local authority will have to apply to the Secretary of State within six weeks of service of the right to buy notice, if it wants to exclude a dwelling under this provision.<br/>
10.45 pm<br/>
Just as conditions are placed on the way in which the local authority must operate, so there is also a clear obligation placed on the Secretary of State. He will not be able to withhold giving a determination if he is satisfied that the application relates to a dwelling that falls within the terms of the paragraph. The amendment provides that in those circumstances he shall so determine.<br/>
The House will wish to know what sort of dwelling is likely to be covered by this provision. The paragraph will apply to any dwelling-house that is designed or specially adapted for occupation by persons of pensionable age and that it is the practice of the landlord to let only to such persons. That definition is taken from the amendment made in another place, with the addition of the word


"only". That addition is based on an amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop), which we thought was an improvement.<br/>
In practice we envisage that the amendment will extend the provisions in the Bill, as introduced in this House, to exclude a further category of dwelling for the elderly from the right to buy. The original provision in the Bill was intended to exclude what is widely known as sheltered accommodation for the elderly. That is the kind of dwelling that falls within what is known as category 2 for the purposes of granting subsidy. In essence the amendment extends the exclusions to what are known as category 1 dwellings for subsidy purposes.<br/>
The type of dwelling for which a determination would be made would be, for example, a bungalow specially designed for an elderly person. However, it would not be made for an ordinary dwelling that happened to be occupied by an elderly person. The amendment that we shall move is based closely on the Lords amendment, with the changes that I have described. It widens the exemptions in the Bill as introduced, to exclude what can broadly be described as all special-purpose accommodation for the elderly. I hope that the manuscript amendment which we have moved will meet with the approval of the House.</p>

<p>This is a very important day for Parliament because the amendment that the Minister is to move means that the Government have accepted the will of Parliament&#x2014;not of one party but of many parties and of no party. They have accepted the will of all those who have felt strongly about this issue. When Parliament expresses its will, even a Government with a majority as large as this one, must give way.<br/>
I pay tribute to my noble Friends in another place who carried the amendment against the Government last month. They worked hard at it. The Minister now says that he accepts the Lords amendment, but when my noble Friends moved it in another place Lord Bellwin told my noble Friend Lady Birk that it was unacceptable, and he spent many minutes explaining why. One can tear up

those pages of Lord Bellwin's speech in <i>Hansard</i> now, because in President Nixon's words "they are now inoperative".<br/>
I also wish to pay tribute to my hon. Friends in this House who made the Government concession possible. What they did on Monday night and yesterday made the Government aware of the power of my right hon. and hon. Friends to continue through today and tomorrow. Without that, the Government would not have made the concession. That being so, this is a victory for my noble Friends and my right hon. and hon. Friends. The Parliamentary Labour Party has shown that we are fighting the Government. Most of all, this is a victory for good sense.</p>

<p>That is a hypothesis that might or might not be tested in the future. When I put such questions to the Minister in Committee he said that he was not prepared to answer hypothetical questions.<br/>
This is a victory for good sense, because many people of all parties, all persuasions and convictions asked for the amendment. In the House of Lords the Bishop of London begged the Government to grant the amendment. He was supported by other bishops and members of other parties, including former Conservative Ministers.<br/>
The Government derided the arguments. I cannot understand why they were so obstinate. It is an issue that might be small numerically but in social and human terms it is a large issue. It has spanned parties. In moving the amendment the Government agree that the judgment of local authorities should be accepted. The Government are accepting the judgment of local authorities and are placing a requirement upon the Secretary of State to accept their judgment.<br/>
Of course we accept the amendment. We are glad that the exclusion will be included in the Bill and that such houses will not be sold under compulsion. The day will come when no local authority houses will have to be sold. That day


cannot come too soon. Meanwhile, we welcome the amendment and support it.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the amendment. It avoids the potential abuses of the amendment carried in another place while achieving the substance which many of us in all parts of the House wish to be achieved. There was a defect in some of the earlier arguments, in that the relief that would have been granted would have been applicable to groups of old people's bungalows where there was, for instance, a warden in attendance. That applies to towns, but certainly it does not apply to villages that have only a few old people's bungalows.<br/>
The form in which the Government have drafted the amendment will achieve what many of us wish to achieve without opening the door to the abuses that could have been used to circumvent the major provisions of the Bill in a spurious manner. I congratulate the Secretary of State on the drafting of the amendment and thank the Government for introducing it.</p>

<p>I am worried that we might be on the verge of congratulating the Opposition on a confidence trick. The amendment uses the word "only". The regular practice in my part of the country, where there are a number of old people's houses, is that occasionally they are let to single-parent families or to someone else who at that time has a good argument for being on the housing list. I should like to know exactly how the word "only" will be applied. If the person asking to buy an old folk's flat can produce evidence that in the past five years one has been let to a single parent for two or three weeks or a couple of months, would that pre-empt the clause and invalidate the exercise? If so, I am doubtful whether we should so readily accept it.</p>

<p>When the Bill came from the Lords it was perfectly plain from reading the amendment that the Minister was right in being prepared to reject it. It would have been easy to drive a coach and horses through the Bill. By introducing small amendments it would have been easy to say that the accommodation could have been let to persons other than old people. Further, there was no provision that the accommodation would be

let only to persons of pensionable age. Those of us who have a large number of old people's homes in our constituencies, which are especially designed for the purpose and usually but not only let for such purpose, were in that difficulty.<br/>
For that reason, my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop), myself and others considered it necessary to include a provision which has been ably drafted by the Government, that it is the practice of the landlord to let only for the occupation of such persons. Additionally, there are two clearly defined objectives. The accommodation must be specially designed and adapted for occupation by persons of pensionable age and let only to them.<br/>
I congratulate the Government with complete sincerity. The amendment has been ably and quickly drafted. They are to be commended.</p>

I told the Government that I wanted to see the amendment effectively redrafted. They achieved the redrafting in effective terms and in a way that retains the principles that they are following. They will also be able to provide what is necessary&#x2014;that houses especially adapted for the purpose should not be sold and that we have houses that are let only to people of pensionable age.<br/>
Happily, both sides of the House support the amendment. I do not criticise the Labour Party for its opposition generally. Indeed, I approve of it. However, the Government have demonstrated ability and flexibility. As a result, the decision is supported by the whole House. The Ministers have recognised the importance of what they are doing. We should for once leave it at that.</p>

<p>The occasion should not be allowed to pass with no more than the platitudinous twaddle


uttered by the hon. and learned Member for Thanet, West (Mr. Rees-Davies). The concession was not obtained from the Government by a consensus arrangement; it was won from them by the hard work of a number of Labour Members, with one or two Liberals, behaving as a united and determined Opposition.<br/>
We are giving notice to the Government that although they have an overall majority of 50 or 60 they will meet more determined opposition in the next Session, because we shall be representing the people of this country against the oppressive measures of what the Lord Chancellor called an elective dictatorship. That phrase is not used much today. The Lord Chancellor used the expression about the minority Labour Government. What about the present Government, whose Back Benchers have tramped through the Lobbies in support of all sorts of amendments and proposals, including the original provisions in the Bill as they existed before Labour Members got them altered?<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Thanet, West talked about the amendment being drafted sensibly as the result of an arrangement reached yesterday. But why is it a manuscript amendment? Why was it not prepared yesterday? Why was it not drafted and printed in the normal way? The reason is that it arises as a result of the pressure exerted by the Opposition Front Bench because of the views expressed by Labour Back Benchers. It was determined opposition, lock, stock and barrel, to the whole of the wretched Bill.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is correct. It ill behoves Conservative Members to talk about getting drafting alterations. I cannot remember their being thick on the ground yesterday, when we were arguing for parliamentary scrutiny of expenditure of &#x00A3;42 billion. I thought that Parliament

was supposed to exercise scrutiny. I cannot recall the hon. and learned Member for Thanet, West's scrutiny of that &#x00A3;42 billion.<br/>
It is a matter of concern that paragraph 5(<i>b</i>) of the manuscript amendment refers to:
<q>the practice of the landlord to let it only for occupation by such persons.</q>
If a local authority is to have the full, proper and unfettered discretion that the Tory Front Bench talk about in relation to private education&#x2014;when it is called freedom of choice&#x2014;the word "only" should not be included. A local authority should have the opportunity to switch some bungalows, for example, from ordinary dwellings to old person's dwellings if it wishes.<br/>
When a Labour Government are returned to office&#x2014;and that cannot come too soon&#x2014;we shall have a massive amount of legislation to put through in order to get rid of the pernicious and oppressive legislation that has been put through by the Tory Cabinet and its hacks who troop through the Lobbies. Occasionally, one or two of them abstain and tell their local papers that they are fighting their Government tooth and nail.<br/>
I do not think that there has been an occasion on which the Tory hacks of the Back Benches have voted against Government policy and expressed a positive point of view. There is no doubt that there are one or two rumbles and grumbles swelling up from their ranks, but it is nothing compared to the concerned and dedicated opposition that is now swelling up throughout the country, which is being reflected on the Labour Benches, and which will continue to be so reflected.</p>

<p>I thank the Government for accepting the amendment in its present form. It is exactly the same as the proposal put forward by my city council. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) was not correct when he said that the amendment applies mainly to country areas with only one or two dwellings. It applies to certain older cities with ageing populations, which were quick off the ground and built elderly persons' dwellings before the time that the idea of attaching wardens to the dwellings was introduced. They would not have come within any other definition. They have been habitually and historically occupied by the elderly.<br/>
In my city only 270 elderly persons' dwellings would come within the definition and therefore not available for sale, but 700 other dwellings would be eligible for sale, which would leave us with an inadequate number of houses for our considerably ageing population. The number of old people in Lancaster is considerably higher than the national average. It is a matter of importance. We are accordingly most grateful to the Minister for agreeing to the amendment.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The question has been raised whether we could delete the word "only". You have ruled that you cannot accept such an amendment. Is it not possible for the House to request Mr. Speaker to return to the Chamber to enable such an amendment to be moved? Although the amendment is an enormous improvement on that which previously existed, it is&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. I think that I can assist the hon. Gentleman. Mr. Speaker is always available to anybody who wishes to see him on these matters. I believe that one hon. Member has already gone to see him. I checked on the position, and it is not within my power to accept a manuscript amendment.</p>

<p>I had not intended to intervene in the debate until I heard the speech of the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer). Nobody could accuse me of being a hack in relation to this piece of legislation. As a signatory to the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop),

I welcome the concession that has been made. I wish to repeat a point that I made in an intervention during the speech of the right hon. Member for Manchester, Ardwick (Mr. Kaufman). Whatever is said, and whatever the humbug that we hear from the Opposition, if we have single-Chamber government in Britain it will not be possible to reconsider matters. It must be rubbed home that it does not matter whether it is a Tory or a Labour Government&#x2014;if we have a single-Chamber Government we could not reconsider matters.<br/>
If the Bill had remained as it stood, or if the pre-emption clause originally on the Order Paper had been moved, no Government&#x2014;whether Tory, Labour, Liberal or Flat Earth&#x2014;could ever build a custom-built old person's house again. We have made considerable progress in the sensible compromise that has been reached. I congratulate the Government Front Bench.</p>

<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) on having been consistent in raising this point throughout our deliberations on the Bill. He voted against the Government on this question and on other questions. That courage showed also some practical common sense. It was clear that he had had experience of the problems which local authorities will be up against because of the compulsory nature of the Bill.<br/>
Again and again we have found that the sheer dogma which the Government have enforced on us through the Bill has taken the place of common sense. I have had to administer a city's housing committee, as chairman, for over a year. It would have placed us in an intolerable position to have to sell property which had been specially built for elderly people or for disabled people at a premium. It would have meant that these properties, which are very few in number and for which there is obviously great need on the part of people who have special problems, could have disappeared out of the local housing stock. That would have meant that people in special need would have gone without the kind of accommodation to which they are entitled.<br/>
In some ways, the amendment tries to rectify that. It was an amendment for which Liberal Members pressed on Second Reading. Regrettably, as a party


we did not get the opportunity to press for it in Committee because, as hon. Members will know, the Liberals were excluded from membership of that Committee. That was a matter which we raised repeatedly because we were so disappointed by that exclusion.<br/>
However, this sheltered and special accommodation is prized by a local authority. It would be very foolish to allow it just to be sold off without trying to build in adequate safeguards. It is clear that the safeguard in this manuscript amendment is insufficient, because paragraph 5(<i>b</i>) says clearly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) and the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) have said, that it is "only" for occupation by such persons.<br/>
Not all property that has been built as sheltered accommodation is necessarily used by people who are elderly. Sometimes, on a short-term basis, for instance, a single-parent family might be moved in, or someone just appearing lower down the housing register might well be moved into a special-category style of accommodation. In that way it would still mean that there would be a loophole through which could flow some properties which had been built specially for people in need. That seems to be the point which the Minister and the Government have accepted in principle. Therefore, I hope that the House will consider replacing the word "only" with the word "normally". That would be one way of ensuring that this abuse does not occur.<br/>
In conclusion, I make one other point. It seems that the manuscript amendment demonstrates yet again this incredible act of folly by the Government in taking away decisions of this kind from local authorities and determining on the Floor of this House what we believe to be right in any district of the country regardless of the local circumstances.<br/>
I am one of those who believe very strongly in home ownership. My local authority sold off certain categories of council accommodation. We preferred to develop our build-for-sale policies in order to give the maximum opportunity of home ownership and to encourage people out of properties which were rented and into houses for sale. In that way we were able to create more home ownership as well as being able to provide

properties for people in need. Having done that, we still felt that there was a case for some people to get the chance of owning their council homes if they wished. That was a decision taken in local circles by that local authority. But one man's meat is sometimes another man's poison. What might be right in that local authority&#x2014;the decision taken by local councillors elected by their electorate&#x2014;is not necessarily right in another part of the country, and anyway, the local councils there might well have been elected on a different mandate altogether.<br/>
It seems to me, therefore, that this is just another example of sheer bloody-minded dogma. I am pleased that as a result of a lot of pressure in the House, particularly yesterday, when much feeling on the subject was expressed by Opposition Members, there has been some response. I hope that the Government will not hoodwink the House by pushing through what is not an adequate amendment, but will accept the common sense of replacing "only" by "normally".</p>

<p>Will my hon. Friend, as chairman of a housing committee, confirm that it was perhaps not the practice but at least an exception to a general rule that property clearly designated, designed and built for the elderly was occasionally used for other purposes? I cannot see how any other translation of the clause could lead to the conclusion that that would exclude such properties.</p>

<p>Of course that is the guts of my argument. There are occasions on which this very expensive and highly desirable property for people who are disabled or elderly is used for people from other categories of housing need. If the amendment goes through in its present form, there will still be a loophole, as a result of which that property can be sold. It will be taken out of the housing market for people in special need and will go for sale to someone with no particular need.<br/>
For that reason, it would be wise for the House to reconsider passing the amendment in its present form.</p>

<p>I do not wish to delay the House, because the argument has


been advanced from both sides of the Chamber. However, I should like to give some personal examples.<br/>
I have a close friend, who is aged and living in accommodation specially built for the elderly in my constituency. She has a disabled daughter below pensionable age, who lives with her. Under the amendment, the word "only" would take that house out of the category of protected dwellings. If the word "normally" were used instead there would be protection, because the house is let to a particular aged person. In the way in which my local authority works, that accommodation would normally go to the disabled daughter. It then ceases to be "only" let, and becomes "normally" let. If we allow it to be "normally" let, my constituent and the house are protected. If we leave "only" in the amendment, they are not protected in the way that we desire.<br/>
The matter of sheltered housing for the aged has caused more concern than any other matters that have been raised with regard to the sale of council houses.</p>

<p>I do not wish to speak at great length, but there is one aspect of the matter of which it might be useful for the House to take note. Slightly less than a week ago I presented a petition on the selling of bungalows. I doubt whether, in the several hundred years of this House's history, Parliament has responded to a petition with the same speed. Therefore, it is only right that on the behalf of the Rotherham borough council I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Stechford (Mr. Davis) and those who encouraged him.<br/>
There is one difference between the decision reached by the House today and the request made by the Rotherham local authority in its petition last week&#x2014;namely, purpose-built accommodation for the handicapped. I hope that the sensible views of local government&#x2014;and local government should have had a fulsome tribute from my hon. Friend as well as others of my hon. Friends, both here and in another place&#x2014;will be heeded by the Minister. I hope that in due course the hon.

<p>The manuscript amendment, which we brought forward earlier this afternoon, has been the subject of detailed study and discussion. We are satisfied that it fully reflects the intention of the amendment that was agreed in another place.<br/>
I assure the House that the situation to which the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) referred&#x2014;which would be a short-term let for a week, or possibly a few weeks, to a single-person family in what would normally be elderly persons' accommodation and which it is the practice to let as elderly persons' accommodation&#x2014;would be governed by the word "practice", which implies some measure of latitude. If we replaced the word "only" by "normally", it would substantially widen the intention behind the amendment, which is to provide an exclusion for category 1 accommodation and not a basis for excluding accommodation that may regularly be let to people of pensionable and non-pensionable age. That is why the Government do not feel able to accept the Liberal amendment.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman explain why the Government

have changed the wording of the Lords amendment on this matter? Will he also explain whether, if it is the practice of the landlord to let only to people of pensionable age and a house is let to a man aged 65 and his wife who is 59, that would take it out of the exclusion? This is the kind of problem that arises from the inclusion of the word "only". Will the hon.

<p>Inevitably, there is no way in which we can say that every case is totally black or white. In the majority of cases a dwelling will be excluded from the right-to-buy provisions, or it will be within the right-to-buy provisions, but in certain circumstances there will be a slightly grey area in between. However, the dwelling has to be designed or specially adapted for, in addition to it being let to, a person of pensionable age. We are satisfied that that will exclude the category of dwellings that has exercised hon. Members on both sides of the House and their Lordships in another place&#x2014;the category 1 type of accommodation, the genuine purpose-built, specially adapted accommodation for the elderly. That has been the subject of this debate and we are satisfied that it is covered by our amendment.</p>

<p>May I press the Minister a little further? The Opposition wish to exclude, and wish to obtain an agreement to exclude, from the obligation to sell property that was intended and designed for old people. As I understand, the argument falls into two categories. The first is whether, by a change of words, there is an opportunity for councils to exclude from the provisions of the Bill houses and flats that were not intended for old people, but that are occupied by old people. I accept that the Government's position is clear on that, although I do not agree with it. I do not wish to disagree with the Government's insistence that houses and flats that are temporarily occupied by old people are not covered by the amendment.<br/>
Many hon. Members pointed out that unless this single word is changed, unless the semantic argument is altered, there


may be flats that were intended, maisonettes that were built, and houses that were designed for old people, which despite the principle that the Government have conceded are nevertheless in the area of obligatory sale. If that is the case, the House will agree that the intention described by the Secretary of State has not been fulfilled. I ask the Minister in all humility&#x2014;I do not understand the semantics and technicalities&#x2014;to make clear whether the change of a single word makes a material difference between what the House intended and what he promised.<br/>
My position is clear. Our understanding from the Government is that accommodation that was intended for and designed for elderly persons shall be excluded from compulsory sale. I shall vote for every amendment that clarifies, stipulates and confirms that. I accept that accommodation that is temporarily occupied by elderly persons is a different matter. Does this amendment make a material difference to what the Secretary of State promised?<br/>
I accept the Minister's judgment, and I accept his word. This is an argument not about honour but about interpretation and clarification. If the Minister tells me that the difference between the two words is immaterial I shall not support the Liberal amendment, but if he tells me that there is a material difference, the understanding given by the Secretary of State to the House is of such a character that I shall regard the Liberal amendment as clarifying and confirming any implied agreement. I hope that the Minister will make the position clear.</p>

<p>Will the Minister clarify one point? He said in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) that if a category 1 house was let temporarily to a person who was not of pensionable age, that would be covered by his amendment, because of the word "practice". I know of cases in my constituency&#x2014;let us leave aside the fact that the Bill does not apply to Scotland, because presumably it happens elsewhere&#x2014;where category 1 houses are allocated to tenants who are below pensionable age because of specific needs. By no stretch of interpretation could it be said to be the "practice" of landlords to let such houses only for occupation by

persons of pensionable age, when they may have been let for some years to people who are below pensionable age. Our amendment is designed to cover those houses.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will give an assurance on that point, and that if he is in any doubt about the matter he will consult a Law Officer on the interpretation. I believe that the assurance that he gave a few moments ago will not cover the sort of houses that I have described. That is why the word "normally" is essential. I do not believe that it opens any loophole. One still has paragraph (<i>a</i>) as well as paragraph (<i>b</i>). I believe that we have made a sensible improvement to this amendment.</p>

<p>Unless the Government are prepared to accept the new manuscript amendment, clarifying the position, they can be accused of ratting on the agreement drawn up this afternoon at a time, let it be said, when the Speaker of the House was trying to take part in some kind of agreement and ensure that the House of Commons could be satisfied as to the conduct of its Members during the course of the events later in the day.<br/>
I hope that the Secretary of State for the Environment will realise that we are not finished yet. He was gloating initially when reference was made to this matter, because he felt that he had got away with something by his sleight of hand. It is necessary for the Government to make it clear that they have not ratted on the agreement.<br/>
Let me give an example, which occurred many years ago when I was in local government. This example could be repeated many times. Often bungalows are built for old-age pensioners, but circumstances change because of a mine closure, for example, and there is a population drift. In 1959 about 30 bungalows were built for old people in my area. The Tories took control of Clay Cross council and broke an agreement by letting the bungalows off to single people. The following year I was elected to the council and we shifted the Tories out. We regained control, and those bungalows reverted to their original use&#x2014;occupation by old-age pensioners. How would they fit into this proposed category? How


would those who have retired at 60 under the miners' voluntary retirement scheme be dealt with? How do they fit into this provision if it is on the basis of "only" and not "normally"?<br/>
It is time that the Government spoke up clearly on this matter. They have been dragging their feet and trying to escape from the decisions made in the Lords weeks ago. It is time they made clear just what they mean by the amendment, so that we can vote for the amendment that gives most pensioners the chance to remain in their homes and ensures that fewer bungalows are sold.</p>

<p>We do not yet have the <i>Official Report</i> for this afternoon's proceedings, but I listened carefully to what the Secretary of State said when he made his statement. My recollection&#x2014;the right hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;is that at no time did he suggest that the manuscript amendment to be moved would be qualified by the word "only". The import of what he said was that the spirit of what was proposed in the Lords, which did not include the word "only", would be embodied in the manuscript amendment, subject to the Secretary of State's having the power to decide whether categories of dwellings came within the specifications of the Lords amendment.<br/>
At no time did I hear him use the crucial qualifying word "only". If I am wrong, I will give way immediately, to be corrected, but if I am right, the Minister and the Secretary of State appear by sleight of hand to be twisting the agreement that was reached&#x2014;in this House, not behind the scenes&#x2014;and that resulted in our withdrawing our opposition.<br/>
Therefore, I ask the Minister what the Secretary of State did say. Is our recollection right, that he did not use the word "only"? When the right hon. Gentleman claimed to clarify paragraph 5(<i>b</i>), he said that even where a landlord let a dwelling for a period to someone who was not elderly, that would not undermine the statement that it was the practice of the landlord to let it only for the occupation of an elderly person. Either words mean what they say or they do not. If it is said that it is the practice of the landlord to let the property

only for the occupation of elderly persons, surely if the landlord lets it for occupation by someone else it is the practice of the landlord to let it for occupation by people other than elderly people. Therefore, the Secretary of State will refuse his consent.<br/>
Does the Minister intend to accept the Liberal amendment? If not, what will his administrative practice be to ensure that dwellings that are generally used by the elderly are not excluded from this amendment simply because, from time to time, they happen to be let to people who are not elderly?</p>

<p>Many Opposition Members talk about the spirit and the intentions of the amendment. Many of us are aware what the spirit is among them. They want an amendment so loose that a dwelling with a longer toilet chain or a handrail on the bath can be called a dwelling for the elderly.</p>

<p>The hon. Member represents a part of the city that I represent&#x2014;as does my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley)&#x2014;so he knows what examples can arise there. What happens in such cities, with many hundreds of tower blocks, the ground floor flats of which are, by and large, let exclusively for elderly people&#x2014;they are, in effect, bungalows&#x2014;but occasionally for the disabled? In other words, they would be covered by the word "normally", but not by "only". Are the ground floor flats that the hon.

<p>The hon. Memmer speaks emotionally, as ever, but he used the phrase "by and large", so he knows that the situation would not be covered. Therefore, it does not matter. It always sounds good to talk as the hon. Member does, but we want to ensure that people are allowed to buy their own properties. What we do not want is a clause so widely drawn that friends of hon. Members opposite, by some minor amendments to property, will be able to frustrate what many of us were elected to do&#x2014;give people the right to buy their own homes. If anyone withdrew the word "only" we should not vote for the amendment.</p>

<p>I should like to put an idea into the Minister's mind to try to get him to agree that it should be "normally" and not "only". In my constituency a number of the dwellings that are normally reserved for old people are let to miners who are suffering from pneumoconiosis and need this type of dwelling in which to spend the remaining years of their lives. These houses are normally old people's dwellings.<br/>
The other thing is that the Bill refers to lodgers. Many an old person will take his son or daughter into that type of house, and that will become the only rather than the normal dwelling. Therefore it is imperative in my constituency that the word is "normal" rather than "only".</p>

<p>The deep divisions that have arisen during the debate show the unwisdom of immediately accepting just a change of word. As I interpret the Government's intention, the sort of amendment that ought to be put in is not one concerned with "only" or "normally "but one that refers to the type of accommodation that is usually occupied. The question of "normally" or "only" makes no difference.</p>

<p>I think that the House knows what the amendment to the proposed amendment is trying to achieve, but I question whether the word that is being used is the right one. My hon. Friend has stuck fast to his guns and insisted that "only" is the word to be used. Labour Members have said that "normally" was the word that should be used. Surely the phrase "normally occupied" demonstrates the manner in which the property is to be occupied rather than the circumstances under which it is to be occupied.<br/>
The phrase that should be used is either "usually occupied" or "customarily occupied" which is different from "normally occupied". If that is so, the amendment to the proposed amendment is misconceived, and should be rejected.</p>

<p>I hope that the Government will take account of some of the specific points that have been made by hon. Members about the precise circumstances in which

this phraseology would be unhelpful and that the amendment to the proposed amendment would make the matter more sensible. I think that discussions are still being held and advice is still being taken as I speak which may lead to that.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dorking (Mr. Wickenden) suggested an alternative that is no less acceptable to us, but we would not wish to complicate the proceedings. The hon. Gentleman suggested that "usually" might be a better word, but we are all trying to get at the same thing. We are trying to find a form of words that will achieve what the Minister said he wanted to do in practice.<br/>
The Minister said, quite helpfully, that in practice an authority that had special reasons to let&#x2014;perhaps temporarily&#x2014;such a property to somebody who was not a pensioner would not be covered by the word "only", but Ministers are not always the final judge of the law on these matters, and even if the Minister attempts, in the best spirit, to interpret this provision flexibly and freely, at the end of the day he may fall foul of the strict form of the law.<br/>
In the circumstances, I think that it would be sensible to take due account of the various suggestions that have come from various parts of the House. If the hon. Gentleman finds "normally" unattractive, there are still a few moments left in which to consider using "usually" or to find some other suitable word. "Normally" is a word that appears regularly in statutes in circumstances such as these, and I hope that in these few moments the Minister has found it possible to regard these words as acceptable.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The House is confronted with a problem relating to a guillotine motion that will bring the debate to a close at 12 o'clock. The last seven hon. Members who have spoken have asked the Government a question, and the guillotine motion is such that the Government can simply not answer the question and wait for the guillotine to fall at midnight.<br/>
May I plead with the Government simply to answer the question, even though the guillotine will allow them to escape from doing so? The House was under the impression that the statement made by


the Secretary of State and the amendment proposed by his hon. Friend made it clear that accommodation intended for the use of elderly persons should be excluded from the compulsion to sell. If the right hon. Gentleman makes it clear that his amendment will fulfil that principle, I for my part will accept his word without qualification. What we need from the right hon. Gentleman is a clear undertaking that, semantics apart, words apart, what he intends, and what he said, are met by his amendment, namely, that accommodation intended for elderly persons will not come under the provisions relating to compulsory sale. Even though the guillotine might allow the right hon. Gentleman to escape, I ask him to make a statement of clarification before midnight.</p>

<p>I should point out that this matter is bound to be put to a vote even if it continues to midnight. The Minister may speak again by leave of the House, but he cannot keep intervening while other hon. Members are seeking to catch my eye. However, if hon.

<p>I should be grateful, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if I could catch your eye. I have listened to what right hon. and hon. Members have said, and I should like to try to clarify the situation. Of course, we gave an assurance earlier today that it was our intention to exclude those units of accommodation that are built, converted and used for the elderly. We have tried in honour to draft and agree an amendment that carries out the intention that I first announced to the House. I assure the House that in my view, having listened to the arguments, there is broadly no change in the commitment.<br/>
I appreciate that if we try to examine every word we shall run into the difficulty that we have always experienced with this legislation, and I do not try to escape from it at this late hour. The problem with this legislation is that it can deal with the issue from two points of view. It can be dealt with from the point of view of those who are genuinely trying to ensure that the accommodation built or adapted for the elderly is preserved

for that purpose, and I have assured the House that that is our intention. It can also be dealt with from the point of view of those who are looking for different opportunities within the drafting. I do not suggest for a minute that the hon. Members who raised this point have such a thing in mind. However, as the Minister sponsoring the Bill, I must always have in mind the possibility that others less charitably disposed to what the Government are seeking to achieve might have such a purpose in mind.<br/>
I gave the assurance this afternoon in total sincerity and I still believe that that is the way in which the amendment will work out if it is incorporated by this House and their Lordships in the legislation.<br/>
I cannot deny to the House&#x2014;and it is clear from the amendment&#x2014;that there will be questions at the margin. There is no way of escaping that situation. We have tried to deal with that by taking the view that where the case is at the margin the discretion remains with the Secretary of State, to whom the individual authority will have to apply. If the amendment is accepted the Secretary of State will have to act within the law of the land. That is laid down, and it is quite clear what it will be.<br/>
Nevertheless, the sort of questions that are being raised enable the Secretary of State to look at the practice of the local authority. If it is the view of the Secretary of State, looking at that practice in the context of a specific house, that it has been the practice to let that house for the elderly&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Only."]</p>

<p>I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will forgive me. I want to


try to explain the situation as best I can. It will be for the Secretary of State, acting within the law, to interpret "practice" and the relationship of the word "practice" to the word "only". It would be perfectly possible for the Secretary of State to say that although there had been the sort of exception that right hon. and hon. Members have raised, nevertheless it was the practice only to let to elderly people. This is totally compatible with the assurance that I gave the House. It is completely within the spirit of the amendment that I have tabled, which is also in keeping with my assurances.</p>

I trust that the right hon. Gentleman is giving an assurance that will meet the views of my hon.

I trust that the Secretary of State will not wilfully set aside the authority's wish and that its wish not to sell in such circumstances will be accepted by the Secretary of State in the spirit of the statements that he has been making today.

<p>The right hon. Gentleman knows the problems of guillotines. He has used as many as anyone else in the House.<br/>
Within the definitions that my hon.

There is documentation, and the houses are known. There are perhaps a few more than 200,000.<br/>
It is difficult to foresee these things, but I may be the Secretary of State who has to bear the first responsibility of administering the legislation. If I receive a bona fide application from a local authority that has old people's accommodation of the sort that we are discussing and that is referred to and defined in the legislation, it will not be my intention to call for the record to try to find an occasion when, one night, the authority let the dwelling to someone of 59 years and 364 days and to say "Look, I have got you. You cannot sell because you once let somebody under pensionable age into the house." That is not my intention. I can only assure the House that that is the position.</p>

<p>I give the House a specific example that cannot come within the assurance that the right hon. Gentleman has given the House. In a block of about a dozen specially designed houses built about six years ago, one house was allocated from new to a man with multiple sclerosis, under pensionable age. If a request came for that house to be sold and the authority told the Secretary of State "We do not wish to sell the property", it would be no use the right hon.

That is the assurance that we gave, and that is the basis on which welcome progress has been made. I cannot go back on those assurances, and I do not wish to do so.<br/>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
The statement made on behalf of the promoters of the Bill told us that the debate would take place at 7 o'clock yesterday. I am very grateful to my right hon. and hon. Friends who have so kindly come to show the importance that they attach, which is the same importance as I attach, to this Bill.<br/>
I want at the outset to deal with the point that was raised twice yesterday by the hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer). The House knows that the hon. Gentleman would never knowingly mislead it, but it may be that inadvertently he did so, for he raised two points of order when you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, were not in the Chair, saying that he had not had an opportunity to discuss with the promoters the issues raised in the Bill.<br/>
The Bill was introduced into another place on 21 February this year. It received its Third Reading in another place on 11 June. It was introduced into this House last month and was considered on 21 July. It was put down for Third Reading for the first time on 24 July, and the hon. Member for Keighley and others put down a blocking motion. On the following day, 25 July, the parliamentary agents acting for the promoters wrote to the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends asking whether they would like to have a meeting with the promoters to discuss the issues raised by the Bill.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman replied on 3 August to the parliamentary agents in these terms:
<q>I note from your letter of the 25 July that you"&#x2014;</q>
the parliamentary agents&#x2014;
<q>think that a meeting could be arranged. However, after receiving your letter, I see that the Bill is down for Third Reading next Wednesday.</q>
That, as we all know, has slipped to Thursday. The hon. Gentleman went on:
<q>I regarded as a grave breach of parliamentary convention that the Bill should be put down in


this manner without any discussion which I would have been happy to have entered into with yourselves.</q>
The hon. Gentleman made no attempt to approach the promoters of the Bill. When the parliamentary agents representing the promoters wrote to the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends offering a meeting, that was the hon. Gentleman's reply.<br/>
The Bill is promoted by the Eastbourne Harbour Co. Ltd, whose shares are held by the trustees of the Chatsworth Settlement.</p>

<p>Who are they?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1776559" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-08-06a.693.1" hansard_membership_id="4901" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11575" speakername="Mr. Gow" colnum="693" time="03:03:00">
<p>The hon. Gentleman asks "Who are they?", and I shall tell him. They are Lord Hartington, Mr. Wainwright and Mr. Burroughs. Those trustees own 380 acres of barren, featureless land three miles to the East of the centre of Eastbourne and in between the town of Eastbourne and Pevensey Bay. At present that land is used only for the extraction of gravel. The foreshore is largely shingle and is largely deserted, even in summer.<br/>
The promoters seek to build a harbour, most of which would be inland. The Bill is required because it will be necessary to build certain harbour works, including two breakwaters&#x2014;one to the West, which will be 540 metres in length, and the other to the East, which will be 300 metres in length.<br/>
Under clause 11, no works of any kind can be carried out to the harbour unless the plans have first been approved by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment. Further, under a later clause, any plans have to be approved by the Eastbourne borough council, which is the planning authority.<br/>
There will be moorings in the outer tidal harbour for 258 boats, including 30 moorings reserved specifically for fishermen. Ten moorings will be reserved for pleasure boats, to which the public will have access, and the remainder for sailing boats. There will also be an inner non-tidal harbour with berths for a further 1,560 boats. The non-tidal harbour will be connected to the tidal harbour, one may think appropriately, by two locks. Thus, the total moorings will be 1,818.<br/>
The estimate of expense was deposited in the Private Bill Office under Standing

Order No. 45. That estimate shows that the total cost of the harbour works is &#x00A3;24,263,000 at 1979 prices.<br/>
The scheme that the trustees and the company have in mind does not involve only the construction of a harbour, although this Bill is concerned with the harbour alone. The harbour is part only of a wider plan to utilise this barren strip of land. Under an agreement between the company, the trustees and the East Sussex county council which records the granting of outline planning permission by the borough council, the trustees have agreed to make available to the county council, free of charge, land for a primary school, a health clinic, a library and a community centre.<br/>
The benevolence of the family of my noble Friend the Duke of Devonshire, and the benefits that he and his family have already conferred upon my constituency, are being continued in this way.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</p>

<p>No. I shall not give way. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I hope to have the Opportunity to reply to the debate, and the hon. Gentleman will be able to make his contribution later.<br/>
This land, amounting to six acres, will be conveyed by the trustees to the East Sussex county council. The trustees have also agreed to pay &#x00A3;2 million to the East Sussex county council, index-linked to 1980 prices, in order to pay for improvements to the main road from Eastbourne to Pevensey Bay. The trustees have also agreed to sell to a profit-making housing association, at a price fixed by the district valuer, land on which it is planned to build 100 flats. A swimming pool, a children's playground, and a caravan site, will also be built, all of which will be open to the public. It is intended that the public will have access, free of charge, to the whole of this development which at present provides no facilities for the enjoyment of the public. In addition, there will be 2,400 dwellings, ranging from four-bedroomed houses to two-bedroomed flats and maisonettes.<br/>
This is a thoroughly imaginative project. The cost of the harbour will be just under &#x00A3;25 million. The cost of the remainder of the development will be approximately &#x00A3;55 million at today's


prices. This project will have an important effect on employment in my constituency and in the surrounding area. The harbour works are estimated to provide employment for between 2,000 and 3,000 people, which, together with the development of 2,400 houses, is expected to last for 15 years. I repeat that figure for the benefit of the Labour Deputy Chief Whip. Employment will be provided for between 2,000 and 3,000 people, extending over 15 years. There will also be permanent jobs for 900 people. Knowing the legitimate anxiety of the Labour Party about providing jobs, I should have thought that Labour Members could have given a small cheer.<br/>
This Bill will provide a harbour for 30 fishing boats which at present have to be dragged up and down the beach at Eastbourne. It will provide a marina with 1,778 berths for small boats and 10 berths for pleasure craft. It will provide&#x2014;I hope this will commend itself to the Labour Party&#x2014;a haven for seafarers off the treacherous coast of Beachy Head. Indeed, it will be a source of satisfaction to my right hon. and hon. Friends to know that any members of the Labour Party whose pastime is sailing will be able to take refuge in my constituency. All this will be done wholly from the private sector, and at no cost to the public sector.<br/>
The Bill is supported wholeheartedly by the Eastbourne borough council and by the East Sussex county council&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman should not be too scornful about that: they are a great deal better than the other sort.<br/>
The chief executive of the borough council writes:
<q>Obviously, the harbour facility is vitally important and will give local fishermen the shelter and facilities for which they have fought so long and hard.</q>
He goes on:
<q>The number of new jobs involved in this development is of considerable importance to the town and the new business opportunities created will be significant and affect an area much wider than Eastbourne.</q>
The chief executive of the county council wrote on 4 August:

<q>The County Council fully supports the Eastbourne Harbour Bill.</q>
The minutes of the policy and resources committee of the county council for 19 February 1980 record:
<q>A major development in this location can be regarded as a natural physical extension to the town and will provide considerable benefits to the community, both in the constructional phases and after completion. The marina, with its associated development, will make a substantial contribution to the economic development of the town in terms of both direct and indirect employment generated by the project.</q>
Whatever may be the views of hon. Members opposite, those views which I have just quoted were shared by the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore). In 1978, when he was Secretary of State for the Environment, he approved the East Sussex structure plan, from which I will quote two passages only. Page 41 says:
<q>The following specific proposals, which will bring jobs and environmental improvement or additional amenities to the area, are made:</q>
<q>A marine development at The Crumbles, Eastbourne.</q>
So whatever the view of the Labour Party now that it is in opposition, the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar, when Secretary of State, gave specific approval to the whole of the marine project.<br/>
I should like to read two letters that I have received from my constituents about the Bill. One, dated 1 August, reads:
<q>Dear Mr. Gow,</q>
<q>My husband and I were most gratified to read in the <i>Eastbourne Gazette</i> "&#x2014;</q>
an excellent newspaper, which also supports the Bill&#x2014;
<q>that you intend to do your utmost to get the Eastbourne Harbour Bill through Parliament and stop the defeat the town suffered five years ago.</q>
My constituent goes on:
<q>The bigoted, petty-minded Labour MPs who are opposing this Bill obviously appear to be doing so purely from spite and envy, as no public money is involved. If this Bill is approved, it will be marvellous for Eastbourne and the residents of the town. We await August 8th and the vote with renewed hope, knowing you are fighting to get the Bill through.</q>
There is one other letter I would like to read to the House&#x2014;[Hon. Members: "More."] My hon. Friends must not tempt me. I am no longer a frequent contributor to the business in this House&#x2014;[Hon. Members: "Shame."] This


correspondent writes, perhaps unusually nowadays when addressing a politician:
<q>Dear Sir, Wishing you all the mighty success on Wednesday. Plan big please. Marina. Rule Britannia.</q>
My constituent ends his letter, which was put through the letter box in our house in the constituency&#x2014;which is called "The Doghouse"&#x2014;on Monday morning. "Len the postman." Len the postman, because I think it is a closed shop, would be a member of the union of post office and telecommunications workers' union. The House will understand that it was particularly gratifying to me, having moved in the last Parliament a Bill to end the Post Office monopoly, that an employee of the Post Office should write in these terms in support of this free enterprise movement.<br/>
I have not exhausted the advantages of this Bill. My constituency has long been an attraction for former Members of this House. The noble lords Lord Shaw-cross and Lord George-Brown, dearly beloved by the opponents of this Bill, have come to live in my constituency. The Leader of the Opposition, who is not in his place&#x2014;[Hon. Members: "Where is he? "]&#x2014;has a small estate just outside my constituency. He is the Lord of the Manor of Ringmer. If, in the evening of his life, the right hon. Gentleman should seek to escape from the treadmill of leading the Labour Party, a berth could be made available for his yacht in the new Eastbourne harbour&#x2014;and not for him alone.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey) states in "Who's Who" that his recreation is travel. I gave notice to the right hon. Member that I would be referring to him during my remarks. It is true that I told him that I would be speaking yesterday and that may explain why the right hon. Gentleman is not present. The right hon. Gentleman's party&#x2014;certainly I do not claim to speak for the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;sought to prevent my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment from getting through this House a Bill which would give the right to council tenants to become owner-occupiers. The right hon. Gentleman is himself an owner-occupier of another property close to Eastbourne.<br/>
The Shadow Chancellor is the squire of Alfriston, and when he invites the

comrades trom Leeds, East to stay with him for a weekend in East Sussex, what better way of spreading brotherly love than by sailing his small boat from a berth in the new Eastbourne harbour and reflecting as he does so&#x2014;some of my hon. Friends will understand the importance of this&#x2014;on the lessons taught to him by our mutual friend Dr. Johannes Witteveen?<br/>
Those who oppose the Bill seek to deny a harbour for fishermen. They seek to block a project that will provide 15 years of employment for 2,000 to 3,000 people, and permanent employment for 900 people. Seeking, as ever, to abandon the magic of the market place, they would say to the growing number of their fellow citizens who like to sail in small boats "You may not do so; we "&#x2014;that is the Labour Party&#x2014;" seek to impose our prejudices on your freedom of choice".<br/>
Those who represent Keighley and Erith and Crayford, York and Darlington, Lambeth, Central and Bolsover&#x2014;all, save one, landlocked constituencies&#x2014;seek to prevent Eastbourne from remaining in the vanguard&#x2014;at the head of the vanguard&#x2014;in its primary industry, which is tourism. Theirs is a strange exercise in collective agonising about the undoubted capacity of free enterprise to create jobs and to meet the wishes of the people. They seem to forget that miners from Bolsover are more likely to be able to have a sailing holiday in Eastbourne than many of my constituents, who find it increasingly difficult to pay for coal.<br/>
We are a seafaring nation. Ours is an island race. Down the centuries we have built and improved harbours. Sailing, which used to be the privilege of the few, is now the free choice of many. I want to extend that choice, and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<p>I rise to speak because I have been elected to the House, and I am not indulging in a strange exercise. I am indulging in the right of elected Members of Parliament to scrutinise legislation that comes before us.<br/>
I remind the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow), who talks about the opportunities that we have had to discuss the Bill with the promoters, that I wrote back within six sitting days of Parliament


agreeing with the suggestion of a meeting, and at least one other member of the six signatories wrote back in considerably less than that time, and also personally contacted one of the representatives of the promoters, to say that they would be happy to have a meeting. That does not seem to me to be undue delay in any sense, and I think that it is wrong that the promoters, having written to myself and my hon. Friends seeking a meeting, should at the same time have arranged to place this motion on the Order Paper.<br/>
Therefore, it is not a strange exercise at all. It is an exercise in trying to obtain some element of democratic scrutiny&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] There are some hon. Members who are keen to exercise that scrutiny but who have worn the hours of the early morning rather less successfully than others. We are all keen to exercise that scrutiny which the hon. Member for Eastbourne would apparently deny to us.<br/>
I should like to go into some detail on the statement on behalf of the promoters in support of the Third Reading of the Bill. It was circulated following the blocking motion that was put down by myself and five of my hon. Friends. [Hon. Members: "Who are they?"]<br/>
Paragraph 3 says that:
<q>It is intended that the Scheme should comprise all types of dwelling from very small flats to four-bedroomed houses and that over a period of ten to fifteen years more than 2,400 dwellings will be built for a wide range of income groups.</q>
I had a brief meeting with a representative of the promoters earlier today, although I cannot speak for my hon. Friends. I wish that they had had the opportunity. It was quite clear that the cost of these dwellings, the detailed plans, the type, the sort of availability and the sort of people who are expected to occupy them have not yet been decided.<br/>
In view of that absence of certainty, it seems to me that it is reasonable that we should object to a scheme, one of the components of which is still reefed in ambiguity. It may well be that the promoters are seeking to shield the basic purpose of the scheme, which is to create a wealthy marina with high-priced flats and fourbedroomed houses for people who are in the class that the Prime Minister and her Cabinet seek to represent, and that this

has no relationship at all to the ordinary workers of Eastbourne who are seeking accommodation.<br/>
Secondly, paragraph 4 says:
<q>The whole Scheme, when completed, is expected to provide permanent employment for over 1,000 people.</q>
Presumably, some of those jobs involve maintaining the housing and the infrastructure which, as yet, has been undecided and unplanned, and for which no detailed provision has been made. Meanwhile, the development work itself could generate 2,000 to 3,000 jobs and thus benefit the construction industry.<br/>
However, at present part of the land is occupied by N. F. Newton-Smith, Metal Recoveries, Newhaven Ltd., according to the plans that have been deposited with the Bill. The second item on the plan is occupied by the Department of the Environment. The third area deposited on the plan is occupied by Hall Aggregates (South East) Ltd.<br/>
I assume that some activity is taking place, that some jobs are involved and that there will, therefore, be some loss of occupation. I should be interested to know the extent to which these works will have an effect on the occupations that are listed and deposited with the plans accompanying the Bill.<br/>
Paragraph 5 of the statement issued on behalf of the promoters states:
<q>An important part of the Scheme is the creation of a harbour for small boats, including fishing boats".</q>
I wonder why more commercial operations are not included in the plan if the promoters are interested in developing jobs in Eastbourne. Why is there not the planned promotion of wider commercial activities? Why is there no clear statement in the Bill, or in the statement accompanying it, that small boats up to a given length will be admitted free of charge? That would surely help those who live in Eastbourne and who recognise that there might be an opportunity for working class people on low incomes to have a dinghy in which they might gain some relaxation.<br/>
If the promoters are anxious to provide for all classes of person in Eastbourne, why do not they make some provision of that nature? However, with the present policies of the Prime Minister and her cronies in the Cabinet, the range


of choice is becoming increasingly limited for those in Eastbourne and elsewhere as the level of unemployment increases.<br/>
Paragraph 6 states:
<q>The intention behind the Scheme is to create a community at the Crumbles with a permanent resident population".</q>
What size of population have the promoters in mind? That is part of the proposal that is totally vague. We have been furnished with no detail. At least two of the 14 paragraphs&#x2014;of the statement&#x2014;most of them cover technical detail&#x2014;are about this vague area. It sounds attractive, but when we get down to detail there is virtually nothing there.<br/>
The estimated expense attached to the Bill is &#x00A3;24,263,000. That seems to be a great deal of money to expend on what might be described as the lesser order of priorities in a country that is currently facing a massive and savage diminution of its manufacturing industry. Is the Duke of Devonshire concerned about creating jobs, or is he concerned about creating a rich man's paradise in a marina very similar, perhaps, to a nearby example at Brighton? The House passed a similar Bill that enabled the marina development at Brighton to take place.<br/>
The promoters of the Brighton Bill indicated that there was to be a residential development. To this date no residential development has been made available, and there has been criticism of the access given to very small boats that are used for pleasure purposes.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that some of us were here in the late 1960s? We remember the promises that were made by the promoters of the previous Bill. I do not remember any promise to the effect that they would introduce housing plans in 13 years' time. They promised that houses would be built

alongside the marina immediately. It looks as if the promise made in the Prime Minister's Parliamentary Private Secretary's rehearsed speech will be worth as much as the promises made by the promoters of the other Bill.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has emphasised a point that I made earlier. There are so many Conservative Members in the House because this is a pay-roll vote.

<p>That Labour Member came in for a good deal of criticism. Indeed, there was a referendum in Brighton on the virtues of the marina. There was a vote in favour of the proposals.

<p>I am glad that my hon. Friend has made the position clear. I was not a Member of Parliament at the time, but I understood that that was the position. It demonstrates that the House would be in great danger if, as the hon. Member for Eastbourne suggested, we were to tremble at the knees and fail to exercise any scrutiny of such measures every time the names of the Duke of Devonshire and the Eastbourne Harbour Bill [<i>Lords</i>] are mentioned. That was the tenor of the hon. Gentleman's remarks.


[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] It was. In his opening remarks the hon. Gentleman suggested that it was wrong even to question the Bill. At the beginning of my speech, I had to make it clear that I was exercising my right, as a Back Bencher, to debate this issue on the Floor of the House. Had it not been for the efforts of Labour Back Benchers this debate would not have taken place.<br/>
Contrary to the wishes of the hon. Member for Eastbourne, a debate is taking place. There should be an interchange of ideas. It is only reasonable to examine the ideas put forward. The Brighton measure provides a basis of experience. Even those Conservative Members who wish to curry favour with the Prime Minister, with "oohs" and "ahs" in support of the hon. Member for Eastbourne, and who desperately hope that she will notice, must accept that the previous Bill is not the best star on the horizon.<br/>
This kind of project seems very low on our scale of priorities in this country. For example, manufacturing industry in many areas could do with an injection of private capital and it is not getting it. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Of course the Tories joke about injecting private money into manufacturing industry. They have to find some small grain of comfort from somewhere. Their constituents are pressing them about lost jobs which have resulted from firms closing down in their constituencies. The fact that they are enjoying a little entertainment at this early hour is no reason for not looking at the cold reality of life; and the cold reality is that one manufacturing company after another is closing down. That is not because we are not competitive, or because we lack investment. In the textile industry there has been co-operation with the trade unions, investment, the lot, and yet jobs are still being lost. I do not want to go too far down that path because I would probably he out of order.</p>

<p>This is the Eastbourne Harbour Bill, and if it provides even half

a job for a boat builder in the next five years I shall be very surprised. It will not do anything of the sort. We are talking about expenditure over 15 years just to get things sorted out and provide the basic marina. It is nonsense to suggest that the Bill will have any significant effect.<br/>
It is a sign of the times that people with influence and money should contribute to this sort of thing. Incidentally, the source of the money is not clear. Will the local authorities have some investment in this development, or will the Duke of Devonshire's well-lined pockets make the major contribution? Should not money go into more urgent priorities than a rich man's marina in a Victorian seaside resort?<br/>
The other items in the Bill that worry me are the number of clauses which would cause concern if they were in delegated legislation. I have no doubt that the Conservatives would be equally concerned in that case. Do they not think that it is wrong to have powers residing in various institutions which cannot be subject to some sort of control and application of justice? Clause 19 says:
<q>The Company may from time to time make, alter and repeal such byelaws as they think fit for all or any of the following purposes.</q>
About a dozen purposes are then listed. This is not a small matter because we are talking of byelaws which impose criminal penalties.<br/>
Is it right that Parliament should hand over the ability to make criminal law to a private company? Surely that cannot be reasonable without any redress, obligation to consult or right of appeal before the byelaws become law under which criminal penalties can be exerted.</p>

<p>Subsection (5) makes that clear. The Local Government Act 1972 was such a lousy Act that the local government reorganisation which it produced is a constant reminder of the


botched up activities of the last Conservative Government. I am talking about local topics and the lion. Member for Eastbourne should have the right to be involved in this type of decision making. Is the man in Whitehall supposed to know best about this elected dictatorship which we now have?<br/>
Clause 22 states:
<q>The company shall have power to levy such dues and charges for the use of the harbour and for the services and facilities provided thereat subject to such terms and conditions as they think fit and shall publish and prominently display a list of such dues and charges "and so on.</q>
There is no right of appeal and no requirement to publish these dues and charges. A meeting of local people might be called to give them the right of consultation or objection. But the Bill states:
<q>The Company shall have the power to levy such dues and charges for the use of the harbour &#x2026; provided thereat subject to such terms and conditions as they think fit.</q>
Why should Conservatives take such powers with such solid consciences, when a value added tax inspector who is able to impose such conditions as he thinks fit can enter property? Do Conservatives say that such powers are too wide? If that is true for one person, surely it must be true in private and industrial companies which see their advantage as private profit for the trustees of the Devonshire estate? That is the aim&#x2014;it is not for the benefit of the community. Conservatives might moan and groan, but I make the point because this is not the best way to take powers to make regulations as the Government think fit.<br/>
Even the Secretary of State for Industry, who as everybody knows is besotted by private enterprise and the profit motive, qualifies his remarks by saying that they must operate within a regulated framework. That is because we know that the profit motive can produce cruel, harsh and even corrupt results. That is why this House should hesitate at handing over, in effect, the powers to produce,
<q>such terms and conditions as they think fit".</q>
without the qualifying democratic accountability, which is at least a safeguard for the citizenry.<br/>
Clause 23 states:
<q>Dues and charges demanded at the harbour shall be payable subject to such conditions as

the Company may from time to time specify in their published list of charges.</q>
That brings me back to the question of free access for boats of less than 16 ft in length. It is clearly within the province of the Company to make charges and give exemptions.<br/>
Now that the Prime Minister is leaving, more Conservative Members will be able to leave their seats in the knowledge that they will not be in danger of hindering their careers.</p>

<p>The company is clearly able to give exemptions. Such exemptions may cost the company money. The marina is the first stage that we are concerned with, and it gives us the outline. The residential part and the gift of land for schools for the community are vagaries. We are dealing with the legal powers relating to the marina. Perhaps the hon. Member for Eastbourne can state that the company will under clause 23 be giving a concession so that the ordinary people of Eastbourne&#x2014;not those who will be able to afford either high dues or high-cost housing&#x2014;can enjoy the coastline that they live near.<br/>
Clause 24 states:
<q>The several dues and charges which the Company for the time being demand, take and recover in respect of vessels shall be payable before the removal from the harbour of any vessel in respect of which they are payable and may be demanded, taken and recovered by such persons, at such places at such times and under such regulations as the Company may from time to time appoint.</q>
I am not sure what the word "appoint" means. Does it mean that the company would have the power to make regulations? If that is so, it is a serious extension of the powers that Parliament normally grants on thankfully, relatively rare occasions to private organisations. We should guard such provisions jealously.<br/>
The House goes to the trouble of&#x2014;[Hon. Members: "The hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) is asleep."] Many hon.

<p>My hon. Friend is correct. He has raised a serious point to which I shall return in due course.<br/>
The House has established a Select Committee on Statutory Instruments and a Joint Committee with another place to scrutinise delegated legislation, because we regard it as so important. In the 1930s, Lord Chief Justice Hewart wrote a book called "The New Despotism" and centred his ideas on the fact that delegated powers handed over to Ministers were creating a new non-accountable framework of legislation which was not being treated in a sufficiently serious and, more important, democratically accountable way, and it was eroding the powers of the House.<br/>

<p>The Statutory Instruments Committee was established as a result of general concern about the growth of delegated legislation.

That is an element of double standards which the House should not tolerate.</p>

<p>I draw the hon. Gentleman's attention to the fact that we are dealing with clause 24, not clause 25. There are two differences. First, the powers of British Railways were often inherited from the old 19th century railway companies which were established in exactly the same way, and of which I would not approve. Secondly, British Railways' powers are, to some degree, accountable to the House because the Minister of Transport can answer from the Dispatch Box a range of questions which are not the responsibility of the relevant Minister, for example, the Secretary of State for the Environment.<br/>
If an hon. Member visited the Table Office and asked about the general position of British Railways, it is conceivable that he could table a question and raise the issue in the House. The accountability for British Railways&#x2014;and all publicly-owned industries&#x2014;on a day-to-day basis should be greater. That should apply also to private industry. We are discussing handing over powers to a private company. If an hon. Member went to the Table Office to table questions on the matter, he would be told firmly that it was not the Minister's responsibility. There is a marked difference between the powers that we are considering in the Bill and those of British Rail.</p>

<p>I take the hon. Gentleman's point about statutory instruments. Both he and I know that statutory instruments relate to the expenditure of public money and Public Bills. Surely the Bill is about establishing a company. The true comparison is between the rules set out in clauses 24 and 25 and the rules set out in the articles of association of a private company, and how they affect people both within and outside the company. His comparison is inappropriate.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1776592" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-08-06a.709.4" hansard_membership_id="3021" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11442" speakername="Mr. Cryer" colnum="709" time="03:28:00">
<p>That is not the case. Under their articles of association companies cannot produce rules and conditions that are binding on other people in such a fashion as that provided in the Bill. [<i>Interruption.</i>] A company cannot produce regulations, for example, as it may from time to time appoint. It certainly cannot produce regulations which have criminal penalties attached to them by the company and enforced in the courts, decided by the company, as it from time to time thinks fit.<br/>
I mentioned clause 19 earlier. I must answer this point by referring to clause 19(1), which says:

<q>The Company may from time to time make, alter and repeal such byelaws as they think fit for all or any of the following purposes".</q>
It gives quite a wide range of purposes. Subsection (4) says:
<q>The byelaws which may from time to time be made by the Company in exercise of the powers in that behalf conferred on them by section 83 of the Act of 1947 and by subsection (1) above may provide for the imposition on summary conviction for the breach or non-observance of any of the byelaws of a fine not exceeding &#x00A3;50 and of a daily fine not exceeding &#x00A3;5.</q>
I am not talking about clause 24 in isolation. I am asking for clarification of the words
<q>under such regulations as the Company may from time to time appoint.</q>
It is true that a company may lay down rules about "no smoking" in a particular area, and so on. But this is a very wide application. It covers all the people who use the harbour and come under clause 24, and
<q>The several dues and charges which the Company for the time being demand".</q>
A company that enters into contractual relationships is governed by the common law and statute law, as they from time to time apply. It is not able to make regulations which govern it is own contractual relationships. Therefore, that covers section 24.<br/>
Clause 19 makes clear&#x2014;beyond peradventure, I should have thought&#x2014;that it has criminal penalties attached to it for breach of the byelaws which the company can produce as it thinks fit. I should have thought that it was quite clear that almost no company was able to do that&#x2014;only a specialised company, which is why we are debating this issue tonight, why we are giving it this power&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] An hon. Members says "You are doing this." All right. I admit that Conservative Members, because of fear for their career prospects or whatever, will not be making a contribution. But that does not mean to say that there should not be this sort of scrutiny. If Conservative Members want to contribute, we shall look forward to listening to them with interest.<br/>
However, I want to come to clause 26 This says
<q>The Company may, if they think fit, require any person liable, or to become liable, to pay dues or charges to the Company to deposit with their collector, or to guarantee


such sums as, in the opinion of the Company, is reasonable having regard to the probable amount thereof.</q>
Here we are giving a power to a company to require any person
<q>to pay dues or charges &#x2026; to deposit with their collector</q>
or to make a guarantee to the company "if they think fit"&#x2014;in the opinion of the company.<br/>
If we are dealing with delegated legislation, we would have regard, for example, to the right of appeal against a particular body. It is very interesting that Conservative Members are gloating now at this private enterprise venture, and are apparently, with such carefree comments, consigning it, as they hope, to the statute book. If this matter was dealt with by value added tax collectors, for example, or by any of the employees of Customs and Excise, and the VAT collector were able, if he thought fit, to require any person liable, or to become liable, to pay dues or to guarantee such a sum, would not there be a song and dance about it? Would not the Conservatives be asking "What about the right of appeal? Is it not true that we have built into our system of tax collection, for example, a comprehensive system of appeals so that we may be seen to be dealing with people fairly when they disagree with a tax assessment, whether on a direct tax or a tax such as VAT?"</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has misunderstood the clause. It is clear that there is a right of appeal under clause 26, because if a person who is required to make a deposit says that he is not liable in respect of any debt, the only remedy to the company is to go to the court. If the court agrees with the person required to give the deposit, that is the end of the matter.</p>

<p>I can well understand a lawyer arguing in support of the courts, with a fee of &#x00A3;200-plus a day&#x2014;inconceivable though it is that anyone should pay anyone on the Conservative Benches for his legal expertise. The hon. Gentleman knows that the fees that lawyers earn in courts are astronomical compared with, for example, the money we pay a machine tool fitter or a labourer in a factory.<br/>
We have built into many of our tax laws a system of tribunals, a system of

appeal, that does not involve recourse to the courts. That is far better, because recourse to the courts is often punitively expensive for those involved. In effect, that acts as a bar to the ordinary person who is seeking justice. With his legal background, the hon. Gentleman should know that a person who goes for legal aid, unlike a person with money in his pocket, is subject to further scrutiny by the legal aid committee to see whether he has a case.<br/>
There are occasions&#x2014;even if rare&#x2014;when people gain support, perhaps because they are members of trade unions, go to court and win, contrary to the view of the legal aid committee. The need for legal aid is an additional bar and handicap.<br/>
We all agree that if there is one case of injustice it is a case that should be remedied. Therefore, we should look at clause 26 carefully before glibly saying "There is always recourse to the courts." It is not a matter that Parliament should have much regard to. I am not over looking the courts, because they act as a stopgap, a place of last resort. But when we are dealing with primary legislation we should seriously try to produce words and phrases that avoid the possibility of people going to the courts and having judges decide what we mean. It is far better to achieve clarity of words and lack of ambiguity here in the House than to say "We shall pass it and leave it to the judiciary to make a decision." A visit to the judiciary can result in deep unhappiness, because of the possible financial penalties.</p>

<p>I think that is right. That is an illustration of the kind of point that I am making. We are trying to clarify the position. Unfortunately, because of their doctrinaire view, Conservative Members voted down what many hon. Members felt would clarify the position and avoid local authorities having to make expensive recourse to the courts,


although the Government say that they want to save local authority expenditure.<br/>
I should like to summarise my conclusions on the Bill. First, we have every right to raise issues on Third Reading, although that was brought into question by the comments made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne, as the record will show. Subsequent to his remarks, Tory Members have been trying to ridicule every serious examination&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] Conservative Members, in the manner to which we have become accustomed, question the very nature of the debate.<br/>
We have raised some issues and had a debate. That is parliamentary scrutiny which we are elected to carry out. I have posed a number of detailed questions on the promoters' statement. I hope that the hon. Member for Eastbourne will answer the points that I made concerning residential development, types of houses, density, availability, price and rent. Will they be available to rent? If so, will the tenants have the right to purchase? The Government have gone to great lengths to give council tenants the right to purchase. Perhaps, significantly, they have not given private tenants the right to purchase. Is it because they wish private landlords to reap their profits unhindered? Do they wish to give advantage to private landlords and to deprive local authorities of the flexibility in the provision of housing that they have sought to maintain?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend seems to have misunderstood the point put to him by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow). Did not the hon.

<p>The hon. Member has confirmed my worst doubts and fears, and therefore, the reassurances that I seek are even more important. The sort of housing that the promoters have in mind for the marina development should be clearly set out.<br/>
On the question of employment, I remind the hon. Gentleman that I asked him how many jobs are likely to be lost. I should also like to know for how long the 2,000 to 3,000 people will be employed. Will there be 2,000 to 3,000 people in total employment over 15 years, or will 2,000 to 3,000 people be employed in each of those 15 years?<br/>
Finally, I covered the question of priorities. I urge the promoters to contact the originators of the scheme. I do not believe that providing a rich man's marina at Eastbourne is likely to be the best source of fruitful activity for the nation as a whole. A sum of money of this size&#x2014;approximately &#x00A3;50 million&#x2014;should be devoted more urgently to the process of getting manufacturing industry out of the mess in which the Government have placed it. It should be used to try to provide some of the much needed jobs, because, although this candy-floss project may have some superficial attraction to Conservatives, when North Sea oil runs out in 15 or 20 years we should have built up our manufacturing industry, using the abilities and skills of our population, rather than being left in a manufacturing desert, able only to import a few goods. If that happened there would be a low level of income for


the vast majority of the population, certainly not at such a level as to enable them to enjoy the facilities provided by this sort of marina. There would be no manufacturing skills, no job opportunities, no openings for apprentices, and so on.<br/>
That is the stark alternative that the Conservative Government are providing, and, in a microcosm, this Bill is a demonstration of their priorities. They are giving it their full-blooded and full-voiced support tonight, but it is a demonstration to the nation of the warped priorities that are plunging the nation deeper into economic gloom.</p>

<p>As is customary on an occasion such as this, intervene briefly to state the Government's position on the Bill. The Department of the Environment had a number of doubts that were resolved with the promoters of the Bill. If there had been any doubts left, my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow) has convinced us in his speech that he speaks for his constituents and what they want, and that all the local authorities concerned support the Bill. It is unthinkable that the House should not support a measure that provides employment not only in terms of bulk building but in terms of the construction industry also. In terms of the environment, we believe that this project will be of benefit not only to the people whom I have described, but to many people who simply want to enjoy themselves.

<p>I reject immediately the charge that hon. Members on this side are not interested in pleasure. One of the greatest pleasures I have had is to have a front seat at this show, with the massed ranks of reaction gathered to show proper deference to the Cavendish family and their lords and masters, the Duke of Devonshire and <i>his&#x2014;</i>[<i>Interruption.</i>] It really is a pleasure, especially after events

earlier this week, to see those Benches full and showing the deference that we expect of them.<br/>
I cannot hope to compete with my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer), who has studied the Bill with more care than I. The hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow) made great play of the claim that this was a private sector project. I never thought of the Duke of Devonshire as part of the private sector. Certainly Chatsworth benefits from a great deal of public money in one form and another.<br/>
However, although the Duke of Devonshire has been firmly planted in the private sector, I did not gather from the hon. Member for Eastbourne what his motives were. At first it seemed to be pure altruism, that the Duke, in a proper Whiggish way, was not interested in private profit but was just giving all this to the good citizens of Eastbourne out of the goodness of his heart. That is the impression that, in the early part of his speech, the hon. Member tried to convey&#x2014;of this grand gentleman taking pity on the town of Eastbourne.<br/>

<p>I bow to my hon. Friend's expertise on such matters relating to the Transport and General Workers Union, as I do to the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Cranborne) on Chatsworth.<br/>
I move quickly from Chatsworth and the Wimpy Bars of Eastbourne to the point I was making earlier. In his speech the hon. Member for Eastbourne spoke of the Duke of Devonshire&#x2014;who, we are pleased to know, is a Conservative, unlike the Duke of Norfolk who voted against all the Government's Bills in the House of Lords&#x2014;as some sort of altruistic gentleman, giving away his great wealth to this impoverished little town of Eastbourne out of the goodness of his heart. As the hon. Gentleman ended his speech with something of a paean of praise of the private sector, the

impression was given that the Duke of Devonshire, so far from being a rather Whiggish nobleman, was an entrepreneur, one of these people the Conservative Party is trying to encourage, someone who is to make a profit out of this marina and bring jobs to the area.</p>

<p>It is an interesting observation that, although this Government claim to encourage entrepreneurs, this entrepreneur decided in the first place to embark on this venture in June 1975, with a Labour Government.

Is my hon. Friend aware that Newham is urgently in need of finance of any sort to rebuild these tower blocks, which are dangerous and are having to be pulled down?

I was impressed by the care that the hon. Member for Eastbourne devoted to his speech. It was beautifully delivered&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] It is unfair of his hon. Friends to dispute that. I felt that it was quite beautifully delivered. However, it reminded me more than anything else of the speeches in favour of the Brighton marina in 1967, 1968 and 1969. On each of those occasions, the then Member for Brighton, Kemptown, Mr. Dennis Hobden, who perhaps did not have the turn of phrase of the hon. Member for Eastbourne, told the House with great eloquence of all the wonderful housing plans, roads and employment that the building of Brighton marina would instantly bring to Brighton. As we have seen, not one house for a whole decade appeared in that marina project. In other words, en that occasion the words presented to the House as to what would happen proved completely empty and quite worthless.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that when one builds houses on reclaimed land, which is what happened at Brighton marina, it is first necessary to enclose the harbour? That was not done until two years ago, because it was a major project. The reclamation of the land then started, which has now been completed. The land had to be allowed to settle, which has now happened, and the contract is now being placed for the building of the houses, which is precisely what the late Mr. Dennis Hobden said would happen.</p>

<p>I shall certainly relate my remarks to the Eastbourne marina, Mr. Deputy Speaker, although this debate is a little wider than the one we had on Monday, when we were on a very narrow point indeed. On that occasion, I made a short speech just to start things off.<br/>
I am relating my remarks to the speech made by the hon. Member for Eastbourne, who sounded like an advertising


agent making a presentation and producing a prospectus. As is inevitable in this Bill, and in all these private Bills, the promoter must say "If you vote for this Bill, the following things will happen. We will build this marina, these berths, these houses and these flats". It is seldom that those things happen. This is a small point and I do not want to place too much emphasis on it, but I think that the House should be aware that time and again promoters come here with Private Bills and plans, which are knocked away by the economic situation, but the difficulties they encounter over the land on which they want to build, by changes in fashion and a whole range of things. We must consider the hon. Gentleman's speech in that context.</p>

<p>I apologise and I withdraw that remark. However, certainly one Conservative Member has a relative who owns a silted harbour at Maryport. It is a town with 141 per cent. unemployment. It is crying out for development. Conservative Members say that the developers own the land at Eastbourne and that should be the criterion that governs where they lay their investment. If the moneys are to be made available, they should be made available


to those ports that lie in disrepair and disuse. Is not that in line with the remarks made by the hon. Member for Eatbourne (Mr. Gow)? He said that thousands of jobs would be created.</p>

<p>I wish to get on, and to confine my remarks to the Bill. However, my hon. Friend has made a helpful intervention, and has concentrated hon. Members' minds on the issue. We are being asked to pass a Bill under which the Chatsworth trustees and the Duke of Devonshire&#x2014;with all his money&#x2014;will put money into a scheme for building a marina and houses. It is only right that the House should weigh the issue in the balance and ask itself, "Why Eastbourne?".</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman suggesting that the Duke of Devonshire should build the marina in Sheffield? If so, is it not a curious suggestion? Is not the main reason for building the marina in Eastbourne that it is a seaside town, and that that makes it easier to build one?</p>

<p>If I were to follow the hon. Gentleman too far up that path, Mr. Deputy Speaker, you might rule that I was out of order. A marina in Sheffield is not such an absurd suggestion. Sailing is a popular sport in Sheffield. There are many reservoirs, rivers and canals. However, I do not wish to pursue that point.<br/>
If the Duke of Devonshire has the type of social conscience portrayed in the speech of the hon. Member for Eastbourne, he is applying it in a curious way. He intends to build houses in Eastbourne despite the fact that the dilapidation and shortage of houses in Eastbourne is not nearly as serious as the dilapidation and shortage in Newham and Lewisham.</p>

<p>Indeed, I have. I know the area well. In happier days that constituency was represented by a Labour Member of Parliament. I hope that those days will return. In 1944, just before the 1945 general election, that area had a

famous by-election, at which the Marquis of Hartington, the Conservative candidate, was defeated by an independent candidate, Charlie White. I assure the hon. Gentleman that I know his constituency well. If he should care to invite me there to show me around, I shall consider accepting the invitation. However, I should certainly stop at Clay Cross on the way.<br/>
We should decide whether the provisions allow for an appropriate expenditure of private funds, and whether the House should authorise such expenditure.<br/>
Conservative Members say that the Duke of Devonshire is willing to spend this money on housing in Eastbourne and, therefore, we should vote for the Third Reading of the Bill. The serious point that I am making is that in considering this sort of Private Bill, the House of Commons has a duty to order expenditure of this kind properly&#x2014;whether private or public because it is such a considerable amount. If that money is spent on housing it should be spent in areas where people need housing. A Select Committee of this House has just reported that in 10 or 15 years this country will be tragically and massively short of housing.<br/>
I oppose the Bill because it proposes to put new houses in a place where that need has a low priority. I believe that the Duke of Devonshire should be encouraged&#x2014;if he is such an altruistic chap and wants nothing more than the wellbeing of the people of England&#x2014;to concentrate on areas where housing and investment are needed. Hon. Members may ask why he should not develop a marina in Eastbourne. I say that he is doing so, not because he is altruistic, but because he thinks that he will make a lot of money out of a growing tourist industry in the South Coast. [HON. MEMBERS: "That is perfectly legitimate."] I did not say that it was not legitimate. But it is up to the promoter of the Bill to say that this Duke character is just another entrepreneur like anyone else.</p>

<p>Is it not curious that the hon. Member for Lewisham. West (Mr. Price) is so qualified to say where new housing should go? I am sure that much is needed in Sheffield. But equally there is a great need for housing


in my constituency&#x2014;particularly in Weymouth. Is it not curious that the hon. Member should feel himself so expert that he knows that Sheffield is more in need of housing than Weymouth?</p>

If the hon. Member had been rather more careful about giving his votes to the Housing Bill over the past weeks, he would not have half the council houses in his constituency being turned into second homes and holiday houses, which will be the result of that Bill. If there is a housing shortage in his constituency it will be due to the fact that his Government have refused to provide money for housing and instead have produced a ludicrous Housing Bill which will take desperately-needed houses from Weymouth and other places and turn them into secondary homes.

<p>Only last week the hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) suggested how Dorset county council might run its education policy. This evening he has spoken about the rising cost of housing and has said that houses built in Eastbourne should be built in

Sheffield. He illustrates that Socialists spend their time trying to run everyone's lives with little benefit to anybody, including themselves.<br/>
I have two reasons for intervening. My constituency is coastal. I shall seek to show how my constituents will seek to gain benefit from the Bill. I am a recent former commodore of the House of Commons yacht club and I have received representations from the Royal Yachting Association and the British boating industry which fully support the Bill's objectives. Unlike Opposition Members, Government Members feel no antipathy towards those who sail in boats. Certainly we have no antipathy towards those who sail in boats. I shall explain how the Bill will help my constituents who are involved in boating activities.<br/>
Boat builders need customers. Customers who buy boats urgently need berths, and I am told frequently that boat builders find it increasingly difficult to sell boats unless prospective customers can guarantee somewhere to keep their boats. The boat builders need customers; the boat owners need berths. There is an extreme shortage of berths and this scheme could provide facilities which in due course could help my constituents.<br/>
The director general of the Ship and Boat Builders National Federation has told me:
<q>The SBBNF is interested because any proposal to create a marina to provide more mooring spaces for boats is very much in the interests of the British Boating Industry, and will assist the sale of boats, and, therefore, encourage employment in the Boating Industry.</q>
Safety is an important topic. The Royal Yachting Association wrote to me to say:
<q>In the short time available to us all that we can do is to state that this project, a marina of considerable size, is to be situated on an area of the coastline which sadly needs such a facility even if it were <i>only</i> on grounds of safety and for use as a harbour of refuge.</q>
The hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) expresses concern about jobs. When he talks about jobs he refers to jobs only in industries of which he approves. He talks only of jobs which fit his private criteria. Life is not like that. Many people find satisfactory employment outside the fantasy world in which the hon. Gentleman believes that acceptable jobs exist.<br/>
If the scheme will provide permanent employment for a thousand people, and many others in the construction industry, I do not understand why Labour Members do not support it, unless their spite and hatred for dukes overshadows their wish to provide employment. Jobs for boat builders in my constituency are as important as jobs for coal miners in the constituency of the hon. Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) or in factories in the constituency of the hon. Member for Keighley.<br/>
There is no good reason to oppose the Bill. It is acceptable on planning and environmental grounds. As there is no financial burden on the public purse, I urge my hon. Friends to support the Bill enthusiastically.</p>

<p>I did not intend to speak, as I do not know a great deal about the coast near Eastbourne. However, we are in danger of overlooking a most important aspect&#x2014;our concern to protect our national heritage. It is important that we do not continue to build over good agricultural land or our coastline. It is well worth while trying to preserve as much of our countryside and coast as possible from building.<br/>
It will be argued that the site is not particularly attractive. As a shingle area it does not have many of the attractions that exist elsewhere. Reasons can always be found for taking away a little more of our countrside and coast for building, gradually eroding more and more of an attractive country. On each occasion we should try to prevent more of our coastline or countryside from being developed.<br/>
A large amount of money has already been made from the site by the extraction of gravel. A great deal of work would be involved to return it to attractive countryside or coast. However, it is the duty of those who exploit mineral workings to put the land back to an attractive state. Having made a profit from extracting shingle, developing it to make further profit will destroy our countryside and coast.</p>

<p>One reason why the site has not yet been developed is that it is at the extreme eastern end of

Eastbourne. It is as far out of Eastbourne as it can be. The people of Eastbourne never see the site. It is about five miles away.</p>

<p>I accept that. However, I believe that in order to preserve the coast and the countryside we must be firm and say that each bit is worth preserving. We should be doing more and more to restore it, instead of allowing it to be eroded.<br/>
Those who wish to use marinas also like to look at attractive countrside and coast. They do not want to look back at built-up coastlines. A tragedy of the 1920s and 1930s was the way that we allowed strip development along the coast and along our major motorways. On each occasion when we can say "No" to such development, we should do so.<br/>
I understand that it is possible to walk along the coast from Eastbourne to Pevensey Bay at any time other than high tide. Although the inland area is not particularly attractive, many people enjoy walking along that stretch of coast. I have studied the plans with care and it seems that if the development goes ahead it will no longer be possible to walk along the waterfront. That is another instance of the way in which traditional rights are taken way.<br/>
Many people enjoy walking along a beach looking for the odd bit of driftwood or other material that may have come ashore. It is a pleasure which costs nothing and which many people enjoy. Putting the works into the sea will ensure that, instead of being able to walk along the sea front, people will have to turn inland, round the marina and through an area that is to be developed for housing.<br/>
I hope that we shall be given an idea of what the promoters are doing to protect the right of free passage along the coast. The map also shows a series of tracks along the coast, which some walkers use. The promoters should have given us more information about the protection of rights of way.<br/>
We should not blame this development for the sins of many others, but often grandiose schemes that appear to meet all the interests involved end up with many sections being left out because they are uneconomic. We have not had assurances that we shall get the advantages of the


scheme, as well as the disadvantages. We need more evidence from the promoters that they will do the whole thing and will not give up halfway through.<br/>
I understand that there will have to be negotiations with the water authority about the marine implications of the works. I have scant knowledge of hydrography, but it would seem difficult to predict what will happen to one section of the coast if another section is altered.<br/>
We know the shingle was deposited in the area by coastal drift over the years. If the coast is slightly changed, there is a strong likelihood that the shingle will be deposited somewhere else. Can the promoters guarantee that the shingle will not end up on someone else's sandy beach?<br/>
There is considerable rivalry between resorts to ensure that they have sand rather than shingle. Many resorts spend vast sums to import sand to cover up the shingle during the summer season.</p>

<p>At the beginning of my speech I made the point that I did not know the coast especially well. I also said that I hoped that Conservative Members who knew the coast would make their points.

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman say what studies he has made of the effects on the coast of the proposed development? It is extremely difficult to predict coastal drift, deposition and erosion, even when sophisticated models are produced. If the hon.

<p>As the Member of Parliament for a constituency with a considerable coastline, I was making the point that if I made such ill-informed speeches about Stockport the hon. Gentleman would rightly object. One of the reasons why many of us feel that this is not a debate about the Bill but simply a means to keep everyone here for three hours while hon. Members make these comments is that the hon. Gentleman has admitted his scant knowledge, and has proved by his speech that he has no knowledge at all.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is making assertions, but he has not checked on the problems of coastal erosion and deposition. If Conservative Members are saying that there is no problem with coastal erosion and deposition, I suggest that they are wrong. I have spent a considerable time in the past studying various parts of the coast to see the way in which shingle silts develop and the problems of coastal erosion and deposition across river estuaries&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not wish the hon. Gentleman to mislead the House about the beach. I am interested in his views about the movement of shingle, which I have on my coastline. It needs the establishment of only one groyne to cause a different movement of shingle. The House may not know that during the war I lived on the beach that we are discussing. If I catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I might have something to say about that because of my considerable knowledge of what happens on the beach.</p>

<p>I accept that. I am suggesting that we must be satisfied that people know what is happening. Almost everyone is happy to say that he is an expert on his half mile of coast because he is confident about what happens there. But no one is confident enough to say what happens on the next three or four miles, or further along the coast, <i>as</i> a result of a single change in the coastal pattern.<br/>
A whole section in the Bill provides for negotiations between the promoters and the water authority about changes to ensure that they do not cause problems elsewhere along the coast. We should have assurances that those negotiations


will happen. The actual design of the works tries to minimise the problems of silting on this development They do not want to end up with a marina that silts up. I am concerned that, in designing carefully their proposed works, they have not simply solved their problems but have created problems for people further along the coast.</p>

I can tell him that I spoke to the parliamentary agents about this Bill&#x2014;which is more than the hon. Gentleman did&#x2014;and they told me that this matter was of great concern to the people living in the area. A great deal of work has been done by the Southern water authority and the promoters to ascertain the facts that my hon. Friend is trying to elicit tonight. Rather than that he should think that he is on a poor point, I can tell him that I was told by the parliamentary agents that the local people are very concerned about this point.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. But I would have hoped that it would be the promoters who would be giving the House the assurance that they have worked out what will happen to their bit of coast and the rest of the coast. Therefore, it seems that at this stage we should be ill-advised to approve the Bill. It increases the amount of coastal land that is being built on. There is no guarantee that people will continue to have the right to walk along the coast at that point. We have no guarantee from the developers that they will complete the whole scheme, both the advantageous and disadvantageous parts of it. Finally, we have no assurances as yet as to the effect of altering the coastline at this particular point on the rest of the coast in the area.<br/>
Therefore, I hope that many hon. Members will oppose the Bill on this occasion.</p>

<p>I am delighted to welcome the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) back from his quiet "zizz" below the bar earlier on, and to pick up the three points on which he touched.<br/>
I think that the hon. Member's first and second points can best be answered by reference to a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow). He made the point that the people in Eastbourne voted for this development. It is those people to whom the hon. Member is referring as having their walks or their facilities put in jeopardy. They have weighed the pros and cons of it and thought that with this new facility, when it is built&#x2014;as I am sure it will be built when we give permission for it&#x2014;they will have a better facility than they have had hitherto.<br/>
As regards the hon. Member's third point, the removal of shingle, while I cannot profess to be an expert, I should like to correct the impression of my hon. Friend the Member for Dorking (Mr. Wickenden), by saying that there is one patch of sandy beach well within the 20-mile area of Eastbourne&#x2014;and that is behind the breakwater at Newhaven. It is the very fact that the breakwater was built that has caused the sand to appear. So, contrary to the impression about the movement of shingle along the coast, the shingle builds up on the windward or tidal side of the breakwater, and the sand builds up on the leeward side or the inland side.<br/>
I hope, therefore, that after this magnificent marina is built, in years to come the hon. Member for Stockport, North will come down and be able to curl his toes in the newly appearing sand along the Sussex coast.<br/>
Having, I hope, saved my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne the need to pick up those points, I should like to add my congratulations to him on his emphatic, informed and most persuasive opening speech. It is yet another indication of the way in which he represents his constituents' interests in this House, and, where it is possible and politic, he is able also to embrace my constituents' interests as well, as he so graciously did in his speech tonight.<br/>
I have the great honour to represent in this House the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer. Very often they take an interest in local matters. They open local Labour Party fetes. They take part in local activities. Very welcome they are too, in their new roles as landlords of


considerable properties in my constituency.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Healey) has only recently bought his property, for a considerable sum. I would not wish to embarrass him by stating the sum, but the mortgage on it would certainly be well over the tax-allowable limit. I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman has managed somehow. I am also sure that both right hon. Gentlemen will make full use of the facility when it is built.<br/>
The facility is a remarkable example of free enterprise entrepreneurial provision of genuine jobs, both now, in the construction of the harbour, and into the future, in the servicing of all its requirements. As my hon. Friend pointed out&#x2014;but it can be pointed out over and over again&#x2014;not one penny of public money is going into it. Usually Labour hon. Members are very concerned about genuine jobs being created, but they seem to be paying little attention to that tonight. I repeat that such jobs are being created at no cost to the public purse.<br/>
I have one question about the building procedure. If it is not possible for my hon. Friend to answer it tonight, it may be wise to gain reassurance from the promoters about it. It has to do with clause 10, part II, about the use of sea water and the discharging of sea water, and whether the pollution requirements of the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971 are sufficient to protect the surrounding coastline from the omnipresent risk of pollution. I am sure that the construction engineers will take the greatest care. Does the rider in clause 32(6), part IV, also contribute sufficiently to this?<br/>
May I add to that question a commendation of clause 32(2)(<i>a</i>), part IV, which lays out clearly the complete protection that all of those living in the Eastbourne community will have through the requirement on the company to clear all plans through the borough council and to obtain the council's approval to all of the plans that are laid.<br/>
I have three further points. The great boon that the new harbour facility can give to sailors along the South Coast will be felt by all those sailing along the coast. That is particularly true of those sailing from one end of the coast to the

other. The House will remember the tragedy that only a few years ago befell the boat then owned by my right hon. Friend the Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath). It is conceivable that if the facility had existed then the boat would have made port, and that tragedy could have been averted.</p>

<p>I welcome that intervention. I am not a bit surprised by what my hon. Friend said, because the whole House knows of my right hon. Friend's prowess on the waters.<br/>
There is one point with regard to provision for small boats. The previous incumbent of the Chair, Mr. Deputy Speaker, warned about mention of the Brighton marina, but I should like to make a point of comparison. It is that at Brighton marina there are no facilities for launching sailing dinghies. I sincerely hope that in this new marina, although it is not necessary to put them in the plan now, there will be facilities for the launching of sailing dinghies, so that the many people who sail in those small boats can make use of it.<br/>
The next point also concerns a comparison with Brighton marina, because there have been difficulties for those who use it in not being able to sight land from far out at sea as a result of the inadequate lighting at the ends of the two groynes. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne will reassure me that the lighting at the end of each of the sea walls, which is touched on in clause 16, will be better than that which is provided at Brighton.<br/>
I believe that the new facilities of and around the harbour will be of immense benefit to the community: workers, retired people and visitors. Visitors are immensely important all along the South Coast. [An HON. MEMBER: "The miners."] And the miners who come to the community. I refer to all categories who participate in the activities which take place along the South Coast and bask in the sun, which can often be found only on the South Coast. That affects my constituents as much as the constituents of Eastbourne. It will also be of benefit to all who sail and, perhaps


most of all, work on and in the waters along the South Coast.<br/>
I believe that, contrary to the inclination of Opposition Members who preach that this or that route should be taken or that thing should not be done&#x2014;so often a negative approach&#x2014;those who know this area of land and sea will welcome this operation.</p>

<p>This has been a truly remarkable debate. It has been remarkable particularly for those of us who are new to the House, because we have seen a full turn-out of Conservative Members for this measure for reasons which I cannot understand. This is almost the last night of my first Session. I have attended more than 95 per cent. of Question Times and major debates in the House and, apart from Budget day, I have not seen as many Conservative Members in their places at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, let alone 3 o'clock in the morning.<br/>
What was so interesting about this debate was that, when the right hon. Lady the Prime Minister got up to go out of the Chamber. Conservative Members went out after her. But they waited until she had disappeared behind Mr. Speaker's chair to make her exit.<br/>
A little rumour has been floating round the Lobbies tonight. Why was there this sudden turn-out of Conservative Members on this occasion? According to rumour, it seems that at a meeting of the 1922 Committee tonight the right hon. Lady gave an undertaking to her right hon. and hon. Friends that she would make a point of supporting her satchel carrier, I think someone said, by attending throughout the proceedings on the Bill to ensure that it got a Third Reading. Indeed, it could be said that the right hon. Lady has let down her hon. Friend, because she disappeared some two hours ago. But we must assume that she will be back at 6 o'clock when the debate is supposed to terminate.<br/>
I was one of four Members, the other three being the hon. Member for Holland with Boston (Mr. Body), my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mr. Race) and another hon. Member whose constituency I cannot remember, who took

part in the proceedings on the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Bill. The reason why I raise the matter during this debate&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Order."]&#x2014;is that during the proceedings on that Bill we enjoyed a considerable amount of evidence from a barrister representing the company in that case&#x2014;and representing a company which hired the services of an hon. Member in this House. In putting his case, the barrister informed us about the details of the Bill and about the effect on Felixstowe of the introduction of the Bill. The people of Felixstowe had the right to object. [Hon.

The conduct of Conservative Members, who have been in a majority of 10 to one over Labour Members, has been thoroughly disgraceful during the night&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>]</p>

<p>The point that I was making was relevant. On this occasion, because of the procedures of the House, we do not have the opportunity of listening to the case that would be put by a barrister. But, more important, on behalf of the promoters of the Bill, we have not had the opportunity to hear the case of the objectors. During the last two and three-quarter hours of our proceedings no reference has been made to the position of the people in Eastbourne who object to the Bill. Listening to the contributions of Conservative Members, one


would think that no one lived in Eastbourne apart from the representatives of the company which seeks to promote this legislation.</p>

<p>That information is marginally incorrect. She was not head girl. [HON. MEMBERS: "Deputy head girl."]<br/>
I make my point because there has been no consultation. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) passed me some interesting cuttings from the <i>Eastbourne Herald</i> of 1 March 1975, when the original Bill was brought before the House and was rejected on Second Reading by my hon. Friends. Some interesting comments were made during the debate at that time. Here is one article:
<q>Mr. Daniel Sheldon (Tory) said that there was a danger that if the development other than that of the harbour itself went ahead first, then the developers might suddenly say that they could not finish the whole job. He also mentioned the possible effect of the harbour on shingle drift and the shape of the coastline. ' We need to tie all these matters up before we give approval,' he said. 'There is also the question of pollution which should be looked into in more detail. There are many aspects that we should be very careful about, especially financial ones, before committing ourselves to the project. The problems that arose over the Brighton marina might easily reappear.' Mr. Thorburn said that every aspect of the project had been fully investigated and regulations covering such things as pollution were included in the Act.</q></p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Surely, on Third Reading one can discuss only the contents of the Bill. The hon.

<p>I thank you for guiding me, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I would say that it was relevant in that I was drawing attention to the history of the Bill.<br/>
I should like now to quote an article from a newspaper that is particularly popular with hon. Members on the Government side, if not those on this side&#x2014;the newspaper of the Socialist Workers Party. The article, which was written some years ago and deals with the development of the harbour and the marina, was headed
<q>Messing About in Yachts (at &#x00A3;50 million)".</q>
It said:
<q>Deep in the gloom of the crisis, the Duke of Devonshire and his son the Marquess of Hartington are planning to build a pleasure port on the Sussex coast near Eastbourne. It will cost &#x00A3;50 million&#x2014;rather more than the Government's offer of wage increases for 250,000 miners. The Duke, a Tory Minister when his cousin Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister, has been scouting around the pleasure spots of the French Riviera for ideas for his new pleasurama &#x2026; The marina will cover 400 acres of coastline near Pevensey, and will include luxury hotels, luxury shops and luxury flats for yachtsmen from all over the world. Up to 200 rich men and women will be able to enjoy themselves there at any one time and there are 400 berths for yachts. The Duke of Devonshire, incidentally, owns half of Derbyshire "&#x2014;</q>
perhaps including the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner)&#x2014;
<q>a large portion of Yorkshire "&#x2014;</q>

<q>most of the county of Limerick in Ireland"&#x2014;</q></p>

<p>That may be so, Mr. Deputy Speaker, so perhaps I had better move on to the Bill.<br/>
I have within my constituency a development to which I wish to refer because there are parallels. When an assessment is made of the Bill, it should be done on the basis of the experience by hon. Members of the development of


ports, harbours and marinas in other parts of the country. I draw the attention of the House to the development of the marina in Maryport, in my constituency. I do so because it is relevant. It was you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, who so carefully reminded me earlier that when I speak in this Chamber on this subject I must ensure that my comments are relevant to the Bill. That is precisely what I am doing.<br/>
My remarks are relevant because there is a lot of feeling in Cumbria, certainly West Cumbria, to the effect that one of the problems with the development of the marina lies in the fact that it is owned by a privately owned company. As a result, the criteria governing the development of the harbour are not laid down by publicly accountable authorities, not by local authorities and not by elected representatives of the people, using social criteria. Instead, criteria are laid down by the developer, the private company, the intention of which is singularly to make a profit.<br/>
In such a debate hon. Members must balance the social criteria, determined by elected representatives of the people, against other criteria which must include profit, which will determine the view of a private developer of a harbour seeking to make a profit. That single factor has been the greatest impediment to the development of the harbour at Maryport. Despite the statement of the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Gow), the people of Eastbourne, quite rightly, say that in their view the future of the land comprising the projected marina development should be determined by the representatives of the local authority by way of ownership or of nationalisation of the piece of land. A social facility is being created, and it is objectionable to many hon. Members that that facility should be in the hands of private developers.<br/>
I move from the subject of the harbour to a matter raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley&#x2014;namely, housing. In the document introducing the Bill which is available at the Vote Office, there is a reference in paragraph 3 which says:
<q>It is intended that the Scheme should comprise all types of dwellings from very small flats to four-bedroom houses and that over a period of ten to fifteen years more than 2,400

dwellings will be built for a wide range of income groups.</q>
I have visited the constituency of the hon. Member for Eastbourne only rarely, to pick up my sister. I am sure that he would want me to make that point. He would be quick to tell us that a growing number of elderly people are retiring&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Lewisham, West (Mr. Price) asked why this harbour was proposed at Eastbourne. It is difficult to build a harbour save at a seaside place, and since the trustees of the Chatsworth settlement own land at Eastbourne it is hardly surprising that they chose that site.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) complained that the building of the harbour would interrupt the free passage of citizens along the foreshore. If that argument were to be deployed throughout the country, there would not be any harbours in the kingdom, so I think that that argument is not valid.</p>

<p>It has been a very long, hard day's night. I am appreciative of the fact that the Minister is in his place to deal with what he and I believe is an important subject. The hon. Gentleman had a professional interest in the aviation industry before he entered the House and he will know at first hand of the conditions about which I am concerned. He will accept that few, if any, of the thousands of charter flight holidaymakers, or any other air travellers, when responding to the announcement that the aircraft is ready for boarding, will give a second thought to the provisions of the Warsaw convention and the associated protocols which impose an arbitrary limit on the level of compensation which is available to dependants if some terrible tragedy befalls the aircraft.<br/>
That is understandable. The international aviation industry, and particularly British airlines, have an impressive and proud safety record. Precisely because the public are unaware that an arbitrary limit is imposed on the level of compensation to the dependants of those who lose their lives in aircraft crashes, I believe that Parliament should be ever vigilant to ensure that the dependants of people who lose their lives should receive adequate financial recompense. My contention is


that under the provisions of the Warsaw convention and the associated protocols the limit of liability and levels of compensation available are a shambles and reduce the question of compensation to a lottery.<br/>
It is wholly unjust that, for example, the dependants of a 30-year-old professional man earning &#x00A3;10,000 a year and with a wife and three children could expect to recover damages of about &#x00A3;100,000 if he were killed as a passenger on a bus, whereas if he lost his life in an air crash they would receive a maximum of only &#x00A3;9,600 under the provisions of the Warsaw-Hague limits and of &#x00A3;25,000 under the special contract arrangements for British airlines flying to destinations overseas. If he were travelling to and from the United States, the limit would be &#x00A3;34,000. Facts such as these demonstrate that a dependant of an air crash vicitim is likely to receive a mere fraction of the compensation of the dependant of a road accident victim.<br/>
To illustrate the complexities that result from the variations in the liability regimes, I shall quote from chapter 19, paragraph 1117, on page 236 of the Pearson report on civil liability. For the purposes of illustration, the commission assumed an air disaster at Heathrow on a Paris to London flight. It records:
<q>Liability in respect of a passenger on a British Airways flight from Paris to London might be up to &#x00A3;25,000 under that airline's special contract if the aircraft crashed on landing at Heathrow. Liability to another passenger in respect of a similar journey by an airline operating without a special contract and therefore governed by the Hague Protocol might be limited to &#x00A3;10,700. On another similar journey, liability to a further passenger who was booked through to New York could be up to &#x00A3;34,000 under the Montreal Agreement. If the aircraft had been flying from Ankara to London passengers ticketed only for that journey would not be covered by the Warsaw Convention and therefore liability might be up to &#x00A3;37,450 under the Carriage by Air Acts (Application of Provisions) Order 1967.</q>
It is situations such as that which demonstrate the variations in the liability regime.<br/>
My interest in the extent of liability accepted by individual airlines originated because two of my constituents were killed in the Dan-Air Boeing 727 air tragedy at Tenerife in April. If I may digress, I find it indefensible and sad that some of the relatives of those who lost their lives in that crash are likely to receive only

&#x00A3;1,250, because a high proportion of the passengers were elderly couples. The only claim that their relatives can make is for what is termed the loss of "life expectancy."<br/>
To justify the assertion that the Warsaw-Hague arrangements are a shambles, I need only record the details of the Warsaw convention and the associated protocols. The 1929 Warsaw convention introduced a liability limit of &#x00A3;5,350. The Hague protocol lifted that limit to &#x00A3;10,700. The International Air Transport Association in Montreal in 1966 introduced a limit of &#x00A3;34,000 for flights to and from the United States. The Guatemala protocol of 1971 introduced a limit of &#x00A3;64,200, but it is unlikely that that protocol will be ratified and it was superseded by the Montreal No. 3 protocol of 1975, which imposes a new effective limit of &#x00A3;56,000.<br/>
As I have indicated, all British airlines travelling to destinations overseas have special contract arrangements for flights to and from those destinations which effectively fix a compensation limit of &#x00A3;25,000. In fairness, I should also point out that the United Kingdom Government have legislated for further amendment to the Warsaw-Hague limits in the Carriage by Air and Road Act 1979, which enables Britain to ratify the Montreal No. 3 protocol, which provides the new limit of &#x00A3;56,000.<br/>
The point that I make in regard to the new limit of &#x00A3;56,000 is that the improvement is not likely to become effective until 1 April 1981, by which time the figure of &#x00A3;56,000, which was originally suggested in 1975, when the Montreal No. 3 protocol was introduced, will have been seriously eroded by inflation. It has been suggested to me that &#x00A3;56,000 in 1975 terms should be something approaching &#x00A3;100,000 in 1980 terms.<br/>
Another difficulty has been drawn to my attention. I am led to understand that the Montreal No. 3 protocol has not been ratified by a sufficient number of countries to make it effective, and rumour has it that the United States Government are not likely to ratify it either. I should like the Minister to comment on that point.<br/>
It is not surprising that the United States Government are not likely to ratify that protocol, because, although the


United States signed the Warsaw convention in 1929, the courts in the United States have awarded compensation substantially higher than any of the figures so far contemplated.<br/>
I need remind the Minister only of the DC10 crash on the Paris to London route and the resultant legal action taken by the dependants of those who lost their lives in that tragedy. They took action in the American courts and &#x00A3;30 million compensation was paid to them. I am conscious that there are those who will argue that air passengers have the right, and in some cases the obligation, to increase the level of insurance and compensation that they might receive and that they should do it on their own account.<br/>
The Minister said almost the very same thing in a letter that he wrote to my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Mr. Marks) on 31 July. In the penultimate paragraph he said:
<q>if a prospective airline passenger feels that his dependants will not be adequately compensated in the event of his death or serious injury in an airline accident it is always open to him to take out extra personal insurance cover which is readily available through brokers and other outlets, and at airport terminals. Such extra cover is not expensive.</q>
That is not an unreasonable view to take, until we put ourselves in the position of the charter flight air traveller or the air passenger generally. The charter flight traveller is encouraged by the travel agency to believe that the &#x00A3;3 or &#x00A3;4, in addition to the cost of the ticket, which he pays to cover the insurance for sickness and added death cover gives him additional substantial cover. In most cases it covers him only to the extent of a further &#x00A3;2,000 or &#x00A3;3,000 at the most.<br/>
Insurance cover is not the first thing about which an air passenger thinks. When he responds to the call "The aircraft is now ready for boarding", he does not think about that, although the business man might think about it. Having discussed this subject with a number of friends, I find that the business man has read the small print on the air ticket, which explains that liability and compensation are subject to the arbitrary limits laid down in the Warsaw-Hague-Montreal conventions and associated protocols. That is the reality.<br/>
Frankly, I subscribe to the view that either the Warsaw-Hague-Montreal system

of imposing arbitrary limits on liability and compensation&#x2014;with its outdated limits of compensation&#x2014;must be abolished, with a return to the ordinary law of negligence, or we must seek to build a wholly new Warsaw arrangement which establishes realistic levels of compensation. I believe that Britain owes that much, at least, to the dependants of those who have lost their lives in air crashes. I am bound to inform the Minister that it is my intention to persist in seeking justice for those who, I believe, have received so little so far.</p>

<p>I wish to express my thanks to the right hon. Member for Manchester, Openshaw (Mr. Morris) for providing the House with an opportunity&#x2014;although too short and at a not especially convenient moment&#x2014;to consider the complex subject of payment of compensation to the dependants of victims of aircraft accidents. I am grateful to him also for the tribute that he paid to the safety record of British airlines.<br/>
There is general agreement that there should be adequate and speedy compensation following air accidents&#x2014;and I emphasise "speedy". The emphasis and the interest are always heightened when accidents occur. I am aware of the tragic loss which came to the constituents of the right hon. Member in a recent accident.<br/>
None the less, I want to show that the Government are making some strenuous efforts, both nationally and internationally, to improve the present position, which is not in all respects quite as the right hon. Gentleman understood it. We are doing our best to improve matters on the international scene, but as ever, reaching international agreement is at times a tortuous and lengthy business.<br/>
The Warsaw-Hague provisions have been the subject of a good deal of criticism, much of which centres upon the level of compensation, but I think that there are advantages in having a system of uniformity of law under which the system of law to be applied in a given case is not in doubt, even if, as I readily concede, the limits of liability may vary according to the circumstances. The right


hon. Gentleman has made that point well enough.<br/>
The alternative in a field of activity involving foreign factors would involve the application of different legal systems in each case, and questions would arise then as to, in each case, which system would apply. Those questions would be answered by the very complex rules of private international law, and the application of those would be both time-consuming and costly.<br/>
It is worth making the point here that although the right hon. Gentleman referred to the awards of very heavy damages in the Californian courts arising out of a DC10 accident, I should emphasise that those were the product of actions against the manufacturers of the aircraft and would not be affected in any way by the Warsaw-Hague limits, since those awards arose from product liability law as opposed to airline liability.<br/>
The Warsaw convention, which puts the onus of disproving negligence on the carrier, established a regime under which in practice a person can recover damages, subject to proof of loss, up to a fixed limit. The system has the advantage that negligence does not need to be established by the passenger and carriers know with some certainty what the limit of their financial exposure is. That is important for the carriers when they take out third party liability insurance.<br/>
Therefore, although there are shortcomings, I do not think that we should lose sight of the benefits of the system. I know that it may be attractive to some lawyers to have the thought of frequent and contentious litigation, and I understand that in some cases recently in the United States the lawyers have been taking as much as 35 per cent. of the awards of the court for their expenses, but I do not think that necessarily that is in the best interest of the victims' dependants.<br/>
The United Kingdom is not in a position in any case to go it alone in this area. We are, of course, members of the European Community, but, even before that, for many years we have kept in close discussion with other European countries, particularly in order to reach areas of agreement from which we can all benefit.<br/>
It has been suggested that the advantage of not having to sue a foreign airline in a foreign court, which is a benefit conferred by the Warsaw convention, is not all that valuable since it is not difficult to bring an action in the United Kingdom courts against a foreign airline, provided that the airline has assets, even temporarily, in the United Kingdom. But I think that that is too simple a view of the problem, since issues of legal policy will arise as to which of a number of competing jurisdictions should hear a particular case. The Government's belief is that the Warsaw-Hague rules bring benefits which we ought not to surrender. We should not throw the baby out with the bathwater in trying to remedy the deficiencies which exist.<br/>
The main problem is the level of compensation which is payable. Here the Government are making every effort, both nationally and internationally, to raise the current levels to more realistic levels. Indeed, it was due to a United Kingdom initiative in 1974 that action was taken by means of the special contract limit to increase the amount applied by the airlines of more than 20 countries to the present limit in respect of international carriage to not less than &#x00A3;25,000.<br/>
The Montreal additional protocol No. 3 of 1975 proposes that the Warsaw-Hague limit should be increased to 100,000 special drawing rights&#x2014;about &#x00A3;57,000&#x2014;and the United Kingdom has already taken steps to ratify it.<br/>
I realise that progress generally is unlikely until the United States ratifies. Although we, too, have heard rumours that there are difficulties about this in the United States, we have no positive information that that is so. As the right hon. Gentleman said, the United States is not habitually quick to ratify these conventions.<br/>
There is not a great deal more that we on our own can do to bring that protocol into force. But, as we realise that the current limit of &#x00A3;25,000, or &#x0024;58,000, required of United Kingdom airlines by standard condition H in air transport licences has been eroded by inflation and the decline in the value of the United States dollar since it came into force in April 1978, on 28 May this year the Civil Aviation Authority published a proposal to revise the limit to 100,000 special


drawing rights&#x2014;about &#x00A3;57,000. The intention is that any new limit should come into effect from 1 April 1981, which gives the airlines time to make their arrangements. The change to special drawing rights is intended to prevent fluctuations in value which have resulted from the use of both the dollar and the pound sterling.<br/>
The limit of liability in respect of domestic as opposed to international flights is already fixed at 58,000 special drawing rights&#x2014;about &#x00A3;33,000&#x2014;by means of the Carriage by Air Act (Application of Provisions) Order 1967, as amended in 1969. Our intention is that this should be brought into line with the international limit at the same time as the new limit for international carriage.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman referred to the Pearson Commission. At the end of the day that Commission did not reject the principles of Warsaw-Hague and thought that limitation of liability might be regarded as a fair price to pay for the relative ease of recovery against airlines provided that the limit of liability was high enough. The Commission favoured a system of strict liability but thought that this should be achieved by international agreement, despite the practical difficulties. It concluded generally that air transport accidents were different if only because of international considerations. First-party insurance is by far the most efficient method of providing compensation to victims of accidents, for the obviuus reason that issues of liability which are expensive to resolve do not have to be considered.<br/>
Travelling on international air flights is not the same as travelling on trains, buses and coaches at home, and I think that it is sensible for people to take advantage of the inexpensive extra cover. I take the right hon. Gentleman's point about the awareness of the passenger of this cover. I have recently asked ABTA travel agents particularly to bring this

to the notice of their customers at the time a customer is buying his package holiday, and to remind him that it is possible to purchase extra cover, which would be in the interests of his dependants if there were to be an accident. The &#x00A3;1,250 payment for loss of expectancy of life, which seems brutally little when put in those terms, is the usual amount awarded by the United Kingdom courts in all cases and is not confined to air accidents. Therefore, it is in no way affected by the Warsaw-Hague conventions.<br/>
I should like to emphasise the value of these conventions with one other example that has come to my mind recently&#x2014;the recent case of an aircraft that disappeared on a flight over the sea. Some wreckage of it has been found, but there is little prospect that the cause of the accident will ever be established. Therefore, the prospect would be of lengthy litigation to decide at whose door the responsibility for the accident could be laid. It is in a case of that sort particularly that the Warsaw Hague conventions can be of such great benefit to the dependants of those who have lost their lives.<br/>
Of course, money can never recompense for the emotional losses that follow in the wake of an aircraft crash with injury and death, but adequate and prompt compensation&#x2014;again I emphasise "prompt"&#x2014;can enable one to cope better with the practical problems that are an inescapable part of such tragic events. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that it is the Government's intention to take whatever steps are practicable to see that compensation reflects so far as is possible the needs of the travelling public. I shall not resent at all any pressure that comes from him to see that that is done.</p>
