<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department if, after the coming into operation of the Children and Young Persons Act, he will issue a circular to local authorities giving advice to them on the use of the ward of court procedure for young persons in care who make undesirable associations as an alternative to committal to an approved school.</p>

<p>I do not think that this would be helpful. The local authority must judge, on all the facts of the individual case, what action is called for in the interests of the young person for whom it is responsible.</p>

<p>While I thank my hon. Friend for that reply, does he not agree that large numbers of people were horrified to find that many young people in approved schools had not committed any crime? In an instance of this nature, would it not be advisable to suggest that it would be much better to take action against the man involved in an undesirable association with a young girl who

has not committed any crime, or to make her a ward of court, rather than commit her to an approved school, which is likely to be a stigma in her future life?</p>
</speech>

<p>As I have explained many times, in these cases the local authority has to balance the question of seeking an approved school order against the possibility that the person concerned will be exposed to very great danger. The question of making such an order as that referred to by my hon. Friend depends also on the attitude of the girl herself. It may be that in certain cases such an order would be appropriate, whereas in others it would be inappropriate.</p>

<p>If the needs of a child or young person for care or protection appear to a juvenile court to call for residential treatment in an approved school, the courts may order accordingly, and have regularly done so for many years. Such treatment cannot be provided by making the child a ward of court.</p>

<p>Does not that answer reveal that very inadequate use is being made of the ward of court procedure by juvenile court magistrates? Es not that responsible for the fact that there are no fewer than 742 girls in approved schools who have committed no offence whatsoever?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1969-07-24a.2102.6" hansard_membership_id="9483" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29020" speakername="Mr. Morgan" colnum="2102" time="">
<p>It is not the juvenile court magistrates who decide whether


they shall follow this procedure but the local authorities. I understand that there are six or seven cases every year where such an order is made, but normally they are cases where there is the danger of a child or young person being taken out of the country or where, without an order having been made, there is a danger of the natural parents who are estranged actually taking the child back from the physical custody of the local authority.</p>

<p>While I thank my hon. Friend for that reply, may I remind him that it is 30 years since we had legislation on animal welfare and about 20 years since the Henderson Committee recommended the sort of proposals contained in the recent Bill presented by my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead (Mr. Whitaker)? Will my hon. Friend also bear in mind that the attitude of people towards hunting and many other activities in connection with animals which are called sports has changed enormously over the last few years and that some of us would like to see the Government take a lead in this direction?</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for the Home

Department (1) what steps are being taken to assist prisoners, while in prison, to undertake cultural activities such as writing books and for the Press and television, and to develop business activities and contacts in the outside world;<br/>

<p>Prisoners are encouraged to undertake literary and other cultural activities, but not allowed to pursue any form of business activity. The hostel scheme enables suitable prisoners to take outside employment towards the end of their sentences, and the steps my right hon.

<p>Does my hon. Friend not agree that since a vital part of this process is to rehabilitate and readjust prisoners to outside society, every possible contact should be achieved with that society? Does he accept that in some of the instances that I have brought to his attention prisoners have felt that these contacts and training opportunities are not always available?</p>

<p>The principle of prisons over many centuries is that a person should be withdrawn from society in the hope that he will ultimately be properly rehabilitated. The question of cultural activities is a matter for the governor, in his discretion; he is the one who decides exactly what shall be done in each case. Prisoners are not allowed to profit, save in the exceptional case of the Koestler Award.</p>

<p>No, sir. Statistics do not bear out that statement. I have the figures in front of me.

<p>I shall study the working party report with care but my present view is that, although there may be defects in the existing law, I shall need a great deal of convincing that repeal of the obscenity laws would be preferable, and I can see no prospect of time being made available for this purpose.</p>

<p>Whatever view one takes, would not my right hon. Friend agree that there is a good deal more emotional opinion on the subject than factual data?

<p>I should certainly be very happy to see further research carried out into the matter, because I have indicated that I see no prospect of legislation this Session.

<p>My right hon.

The chairman of the committee will be Sir William Houghton. I will, with permission, circulate a list of the members in the OFFICIAL REPORT.<br/>
It is our intention that the review should include such issues as whether relatives should be able to apply for guardianship instead of adoption, the relation between adoption law and that part of guardianship law which gives the natural father of an illegitimate child the right to apply for custody, and, in particular, the position of long-term foster parents who wish to keep a child permanently, by adoption or otherwise, against the wishes of the natural parents.</p>

Friend will be aware that the matter is kept continuously under review in each review of Government expenditure. I should have thought that he would feel that the fact that so many things had to be cut back last year while the aid programme was not cut back in sterling terms showed the high priority which we give to this programme.</p>

<p>I know that this is a matter to which a great deal of thought has been given in the past. There has been a quite welcome increase in private enterprise investment in some of the developing countries, though I think that the problem which successive Governments have had is that far more of it has gone to already developed countries rather than to those where the need for investment in world terms is greatest.</p>

<p>Now that the T.U.C. has decided to intervene in industrial disputes where trade unions are involved, could my right hon.

<p>When we met the C.B.I. just over a month ago, my right hon. Friend the First Secretary of State and I emphasised the need for the Confederation to take powers to intervene in cases of the kind my hon. Friend has in mind, just as the T.U.C. was taking powers itself to intervene. We encouraged the Confederation also to re-examine the proposals made to it by the T.U.C. for joint fire-fighting services for dealing with unofficial disputes.<br/>
As regards the second part of my hon. Friend's supplementary question, that must he a matter for the information media themselves, be they Press or tele-

vision. There have in the past, no doubt, been some cases of unfair reporting, but in cases where there has been a dispute which was quite unjustified it has not done any harm that this should be made generally known both nationally and in the area concerned.</p>

But, in addition to Mr. Gromyko's speech to the Supreme Soviet on 10th July, there was the basic speech by Mr. Brezhnev.

<p>That is a difficult matter to deal with at Question Time. It is more appropriate for debate. I remember some debates on this point

between the right hon. Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Sir Alec Douglas-Home) and myself several years ago.

If the Soviet Government have anything concrete to put forward which we could examine&#x2014;so far everything that they have said has been in general terms&#x2014;we shall be glad to examine it to see whether there is anything which can be done mutually to bring security in Africa and in Asia, just as we are ready to discuss with them their proposals for European security.</p>

<p>I did not use that phrase. I think that it came from the other side of the House. Mr. Brezhnev may or may not have used it. I am not answerable for Mr. Brezhnev. He cannot be questioned by hon.

<p>Yes, but I was dealing with a Question which referred


to an Asian security system, and, although it is certainly true that what we call the Middle East is known to India and other countries as West Asia, the context of the speeches by Mr. Gromyko and Mr. Brezhnev was in terms of South-East and Far East Asia, not the Middle East, which raises very different considerations, as my right hon.

The other was a problem about thee two Germanys, and I thought that Herr Willi Brandt in Harpsund was extremely helpful.

<p>Order. I would remind the hon. Gentleman that I ruled on this question&#x2014;the hon. Gentleman must have missed it&#x2014;10 to 14 days ago. It is possible for an hon. Member to do so.

If he does, he must let Mr. Speaker know before he proposes to do so, so that the appropriate form in which the notice is given may be followed.

<p>On a point of order, Your Ruling a fortnight ago to which you referred, Mr. Speaker, related to a time when Parliament is in Session,

The point raised by the hon. Member for Worcestershire, South had been dealt with by me in answer to the hon. Member for Peterborough (Sir Harmar Nicholls) some weeks ago. The hon. Member for Peterborough has now raised a new point which is quite an important one. According to the Statute, in times of Recess it is possible for any two hon.

<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I wish to make a statement.<br/>
Mr. Brooke, the British subject who was sentenced by a Soviet court in 1965 to five years' imprisonment for alleged anti-Soviet activity, has been released and has returned to this country today. Her Majesty's Government have undertaken that a recommendation will be made for the remission in three months' time of the remainder of the sentence of 20 years' imprisonment which was passed on Mr. and Mrs. Peter Kroger in 1961 in connection with the Portland spy case. Upon their release Mr. and Mrs. Kroger will be free to go to any destination of their choice. We have also agreed that Polish consular officials may visit them at monthly intervals until their release.<br/>
The Consular Convention between the United Kingdom and the U.S.S.R. provides that consular visits to British subjects in detention in the Soviet Union shall take place "on a recurrent basis". Under Soviet regulations such visits have been permitted not less frequently than once every four months; but the Soviet regulations also provide that offences against prison discipline may be punished by forfeiture of consular visits. At one time Mr. Brooke went for more than a year without a visit, and more recently Mr. Lorraine has been deprived of a consular visit. We have now been assured that even in cases where offences against prison discipline are alleged the Soviet authorities will favourably consider our request that the intervals between visits by British consular representatives should not exceed four months.<br/>
The Soviet authorities have undertaken that on the day after the departure of Mr. and Mrs. Kroger from this country Mr. Michael Parsons End Mr. Anthony Lorraine, the British subjects who in 1968 were sentenced by Soviet courts to four


and three years' detention, respectively, for smuggling drugs into the Soviet Union, will be released.<br/>
It has been arranged, as a separate matter, that three British subjects who have for some years been endeavouring without success to marry Soviet citizens will, not later than 24th October, be granted visas to enter the Soviet Union to register their marriages, and that thereafter their partners will be free to leave the Soviet Union should they so desire. We have been told that one other British subject in this category may have a Soviet visa at any time.<br/>
In deciding to make these arrangements, Her Majesty's Government have had three considerations in mind. The first is that of humanity towards Mr. Brooke. We were informed on 28th April that fresh charges, carrying very heavy penalties, were being prepared against him. His health has not been good throughout his imprisonment, and further years in prison might have had the most serious consequences.<br/>
Secondly, the Krogers will have served over 8&#x00BD; years in prison. They will have paid a substantial penalty for their offences.<br/>
Thirdly, the other arrangements which I have mentioned, affecting British subjects, and consular visits, are in themselves desirable and remove an obstacle for improvement in relations between this country and the U.S.S.R.<br/>
Taking these considerations into account, and recognising the counter-arguments which can be advanced, I believe that the decision which I have announced is right.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1969-07-24a.2147.0" hansard_membership_id="3564" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14214" speakername="Sir Alec Douglas-Home" colnum="2147" time="">
<p>Reaction to the Foreign Secretary's statement must be in two parts. The first is that Mr. Brooke ought never to have received such a savage sentence for a minor infringement of Soviet law and that this release is merely belated justice. It should have happened long ago. Therefore, for him and his wife, who has shown such courage, the House is unreservedly glad that his terrible ordeal is over. The second part concerns Mr. Brooke's exchange for the Krogers. They had engaged in an entirely different order and scale of espionage. This is bound to arouse public anxieties and reservations.<br/>
In the first place, the Foreign Secretary should understand that this is an encouragement to the Russians to believe that they can always squeeze Her Majesty's Government in this way. The Foreign Secretary understands, does he not, that they are not in the least inhibited from starving a man until he is ill so as to play on the feelings and humanity of the British people? Their cold and brutish behaviour is part of the Russian make-up in this matter.<br/>
Secondly, is there not a real danger that professional spies like the Krogers may not have told all that they know to Her Majesty's Government; that they may have knowledge which could still be of use to the Soviet Union concerning personnel or other matters. Does not the right hon. Gentleman agree that the first consideration must be the morale of our own services in a most hazardous occupation?<br/>
Having said that, I must point out that the Foreign Secretary and the Government have shouldered a very heavy responsibility. I have not&#x2014;and I do not think that any other hon. Member has&#x2014;sufficient knowledge or information to make a considered judgment on this case. That can be done only by the Government and the Foreign Secretary. Therefore, the right hon. Gentleman and the Government must bear responsibility for this matter. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to assure the House that he has taken all these very grave matters into full account in arriving at his decision.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1969-07-24a.2148.0" hansard_membership_id="12514" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30989" speakername="Mr. Stewart" colnum="2148" time="">
<p>I assure the right hon. Gentleman that we have taken very seriously into account all the arguments and counter-arguments that can be advanced. I accept that this is not a matter which any humane or sensible person would think could be decided casually or off the cuff. There are very grave considerations on both sides.<br/>
I entirely accept that although Mr. Brooke did, and this is not in dispute, something contrary to Soviet law, it was not something that we in this country would regard as an offence, and we always took the view that the penalty imposed upon him was on any judgment out of all proportion to what he had done.<br/>
I accept, too, that the position of the Krogers was very different indeed. The


right hon. Gentleman drew attention to the possible advantage there might be in that information could be obtained from the Krogers. I had to weigh this up, and it seemed to me that with every month that passed the weight of this argument became less and the weight of the argument of humanity for Mr. Brooke became greater.<br/>
I ask the right hon. Gentleman to believe that we have taken this decision very carefully, taking all the factors into account. I believe it to be the right decision both on humanitarian grounds and on the long-term judgment of relations between the Soviet Union and this country, and the security of this country.</p>

<p>One readily accepts the humanitarian motives of the Government's actions. Anyone who knows the position of Mr. Brooke and the position of his relatives will appreciate that action. At the same time, while accepting that my right hon. Friend must speak with the great reserve placed on him in his position, it should be made quite clear that here there is nothing but contempt and very grave concern for future relations with the Soviet Union as a result of this example of blackmail applied to a man who had obviously committed nothing that would be regarded as an offence in a democratic society; and that there is a very grave danger for future relations when we see the Soviet Union acting in this way. The Russians ought to be left in no doubt about the reactions of all democrats in this country, and in other countries, to the way in which they have acted.</p>

<p>I have two questions. First, what were the serious consequences to which the Foreign Secretary referred previously in regard to the threat to retry Brooke, and why were those not resorted to long ago to obtain his release instead of having this disgraceful and dangerous deal? Secondly, will the Foreign Secretary give an absolute assurance that no pressure has been or will be brought on Mr. Gerald Brooke by the Foreign Office to prevent him pub-

lishing, should he so wish, in due course a full and unrestricted account of the circumstances of his arrest and his treatment at Russian hands?</p>

<p>We should not dream of bringing any pressure to bear on Mr Brooke. This is a free country and he can say or write what he likes. I merely express the personal opinion that I think that Mr. Brooke, after what he has been through, will probably want to relax in family life and, if I tray say so, find his feet again in this country before he wants to express himself in public at all. But we certainly should not attempt to restrict him.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman used, as, I am afraid, he so often does, adjectives like "disgraceful", and so on, which do not really add anything to the serious problem we have to consider. I know the problems that are involved, but I am quite convinced, after looking at all the aspects and weighing them all up, that if we had pursued another course&#x2014;we could have pursued the course of retaliation and counter-retaliation&#x2014;this would in no way have helped Mr. Brooke. It would have inflicted such damage on relations between us and the Soviet Union as to serve no good purpose either to Mr. Brooke or to this country, or to mankind</p>

<p>Whilst I welcome the general details of the package deal, will my right hon.

<p>Frankly, I do not think that I can answer for that, but the position of those British subjects who desire to contract marriages with Soviet citizens&#x2014;and we know that there are three precise cases&#x2014;is that they will be able to go to the Soviet Union if they wish to register the marriage and, having done so, they and their partners will be free to reside in whichever country they wish. I think that that is the best one can expect.</p>

<p>Whilst I deplore the whole sordid deal, does not the Foreign Secretary agree that another embarrassing question arises? If the Krogers are to be released, what is the Government's


attitude towards the other Portland prisoners and, in particular, Ethel Gee, an ageing spinster of 55, now serving a 15-year sentence for a lesser part in that plot? Is it conceivable that the Government intend to release the master in treachery and maintain in prison one who was, in fact, his catspaw?</p>

<p>Will the Foreign Secretary accept that, while no one in his senses would envy him in the decision which he has had to make, all hon.

<p>I am obliged for what my hon. Friend the Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot) has said. We can say, without arrogance, that our country maintains a very high standard of regard for human rights and dignity, that we are not prepared to inflict injuries on human beings as a measure of retaliation, and that this sometimes makes it difficult when we have to make bargains with foreign governments. In the light of those considerations I have to make this kind of decision. Weighing everything up, I am firmly convinced that this was the right decision to take.</p>

<p>Would my right hon. Friend agree that the people who work for us in espionage are honourable people who serve their country, and that this is probably equally true of the Russians? Probably both are right, since the more we know about each other's specific intentions the better. Therefore, if we have an opportunity, without danger to our own country, to release people who have behaved in this way, it should be a matter for rejoicing, not a tragedy.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend in that question raises major philosophical issues to which I would not like to give an answer off the cuff. I would go thus far with him. I accept the proposition that somebody who carries out espionage on behalf of the country to which he has given his own loyalty is in one box, but somebody who has been born and brought up in one country and owes everything he has to that country and then engages in espionage against it is in quite another.</p>

<p>As for the last part of the question, I have already pointed out that they have served a substantial term of imprisonment. The first part of the question raises an important problem, but I would invite the House to notice that Mr. Brooke undoubtedly did commit, and knowingly committed, an offence against Soviet law. In view of what he has suffered I do not want to over-labour this point, but it is important for the House to notice that, so far as I can discover, there is no recent instance of any British subject who has gone to the Soviet Union and who has been careful to observe its laws who has got into any kind of trouble. I think that one can say with reasonable confidence that a British citizen who goes to the Soviet Union and is careful to observe its laws while he is there is not at risk for this reason.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in view of Mr. Brooke's experience in the Soviet union, and in view of the consequences of which we have heard today, is it not now incumbent of the Foreign Office to make quite certain that visitors from Great Britain to the Soviet Union are


informed of the very serious and severe penalties prescribed by Soviet law for quite trivial offences?</p>

<p>The Foreign Office is always very ready, and has been ready on a great many occasions, to provide visitors to any country with information which might be important to them. I agree that this is particularly true of people who visit countries whose whole concepts of human liberty are different from ours. I should have thought that it is now clear to British citizens who intend to visit the Soviet Union and certain other countries that it is important to carry out strict observance of their laws and that the risks in not so doing are very grave.</p>

<p>Of course, we considered that matter. When the hon. Member uses phrases like "surrender to blackmail", he must try in his own mind to answer the question whether he feels we ought not to have made this arrangement. If he thinks we ought not to have done so he must understand what that means in the consequences to Mr. Brooke, in the forfeiture of the humane arrangement which we have been able to make and in the permanent injury which this might do to relations between this country and the Soviet Union. That is the question which has got to be answered.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1969-07-24a.2156.6" hansard_membership_id="3004" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30872" speakername="The Secretary of State for Social Services (Mr. Richard Crossman)" colnum="2156" time="">
<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement.<br/>
I have today laid before Parliament a White Paper setting out the Government's proposals for social insurance benefits in the new scheme of earnings-related social security. The Government have already, in 1966, introduced a substantial measure of earnings relationship into the provision for short-term benefits for the early months of sickness, unemployment and widowhood. The changes now proposed for short-term benefits are thus limited to those required to adapt them to the new system of earnings-related contributions and long-term benefits. Stamped cards and flat-rate contributions will be abolished for all employees covered by P.A.Y.E. and the new contributions for them will be collected through the P.A.Y.E. system.


The proposals, with the financial implications, are set out in detail in the White Paper.<br/>
The White Paper also describes the new deal for the long-term sick. Short-term sickness benefit under the new scheme will be payable for up to six months. Those who are still sick at the end of this period will be able to receive a new earnings related long-term sickness benefit&#x2014;to be called invalidity pension. This benefit will replace the present flat-rate sickness benefit for those who are sick for more than six months. For those who are so severely handicapped that they need a great deal of help from other people there will also be available a new attendance allowance announced in the earlier White Paper.<br/>
As regards the industrial injuries scheme, the Government are still in consultation with both sides of industry on the consequential changes necessary in industrial injury benefit and industrial widows' pensions; no change is proposed in industrial disablement benefit. Subject to this, the proposals in today's White Paper, with those already ananounced in the earlier White Paper "National Superannuation and Social Insurance", complete the Government's plans for reconstructing the present national insurance scheme. The Government intend to introduce the necessary legislation in the next Session of Parliament.</p>

<p>We are glad that the White Paper on short-term benefits is now being published. But is the right hon. Gentleman aware that his statement would appear to indicate that it contains no proposals other than those which have already been outlined in the original White Paper? In particular, does the right hon. Gentleman accept that there will be disappointment that, apart from the attendance allowance, which will benefit only a limited number of severely disabled persons, there is no advance in the provision for the civilian disabled?<br/>
I have already welcomed the attendance allowance, but I should like to ask two specific questions. First, is there any reason why the attendance allowance should have to wait until 1972? Could it not be introduced straightaway?<br/>
Secondly, will severely disabled children, who have no contribution

record, also be eligible for this attendance allowance?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1969-07-24a.2158.0" hansard_membership_id="3004" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30872" speakername="Mr. Crossman" colnum="2158" time="">
<p>On the first point about there being nothing new here, the two paragraphs that we had in the original White Paper, as I promised, were expanded. I should think that the announcement of the invalidity allowance was, in a sense, new. We have now added to the short-term six months combination of flat rate arid graded benefit, the first long-term graded benefit for sickness, or, as we say, invalidity benefit. This is new. Though it does not altogether deal with the problem of disability&#x2014;and I frankly admit this&#x2014;it is a notable advance in an area where, for a long time before this Government came into office, there was no advance.<br/>
Concerning the attendance allowance, I will certainly consider the noble Lord's suggestion that this should be paid straightaway. I was thinking of including it all in the Bill and introducing the whole thing together in 1972. However, I will certainly consider the possibility of earlier introduction.<br/>
I should like notice of the special question about children. It is a difficult question and I do not want to answer it today.</p>

<p>First, I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his announcement today and, in particular, on his second thoughts, in response to the noble Lord's question, concerning the attendance allowance. This is a serious point. If my right hon. Friend would give the House an assurance that he will not wait until 1972, but give a reasonable promise that there will be some implementation along those lines within the next Session of Parliament, he would be making an even greater contribution than he has now, and many people would be grateful for it.</p>

<p>I cannot go further than I went in my previous answer. I am prepared to consider it. The attendance allowance is a new principle and needs a great deal of careful consideration. I am not going to rush it, because we are introducing a brand new principle into National Insurance. We are giving a small amount of it here. I think we would be wise to wait and do it all together in the big new Bill.</p>

<p>While welcoming the right hon. Gentleman's statement about the attendance allowance, I should like to echo what my noble Friend has said about it being brought into effect before 1972.<br/>
Will this attendance allowance be sufficient for a person who is severely handicapped and requires a full-time attendant at home to run to that sort of service?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1969-07-24a.2159.1" hansard_membership_id="3004" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30872" speakername="Mr. Crossman" colnum="2159" time="">
<p>I do not want to add to what I have already said. There will be a full statement about the detailed application of the scheme. Naturally, we have some experience of this with war pensions and industrial injuries pensions, because we have instances of constant attendance allowance in those cases. Exactly how we will apply the principle in this case will be announced in detail later.</p>

<p>Has my right hon. Friend been able to give any attention to the position of Members of Parliament concerning earnings-related contributions and benefits? In particular, has he given any thought to ending the fiction that Members of Parliament are self-employed and, therefore, disqualified from unemployment benefit when they lose their seats, which may be a relevant consideration to many hon. Members opposite at the next Election?</p>

<p>I admit that up till now it has been assumed&#x2014;perhaps wrongly&#x2014;that Members of Parliament are self-employed rather than employees. I gather that the matter is now under serious reconsideration.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that everybody will be delighted to see the end of stamps and cards? Would he care to give the House an estimate of the administrative cost saving which will result from their elimination and what the contribution conditions will be for the award of the invalidity pension?<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman says that it is earnings-related. Therefore, to qualify for the award, a person must presumably have been in employment at some time. Will this not increase still further the dis-

partity between those who fulfil contribution conditions and those who have been disabled all their lives and therefore unable to do so?</p>

<p>I should like to correct the hon. Gentleman on the second question. The whole innovation here is that in return for a contribution paid by an employee his wife, for example, can receive the pension although she has not been an employee. Because of this innovation we are being particularly careful in preparing for the scheme.<br/>
On the first question, there is no way of estimating the saving on stamps. We have to combine it with the much increased expenditure on the computerisation of the whole earnings-related contribution. I hope that the net result will be that we do not have to have an increase of staff in Newcastle.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. A number of backbenchers find themselves in a particularly difficult situation because of the management of Government business. We accept that in matters of emergency the Government have to move, and can move, with great speed, and that it is within their power so to do. I do not think anybody would claim that this Bill is an emergency. We therefore find ourselves in the position that most hon. Members, unless they bad been present in another place at 11 p.m. on Tuesday, would not have known whether the other place had put back into the Bill the whole of Clause 17 in Part III of the Bill. Reference to the minutes of the other place does not show this.<br/>
We have been asked to deal with the remaining stages of the Bill, but we found ourselves in the position of not knowing what Amendments we could or could not amend. The published list of Amendments was not made available at the Vote Office until about 6 o'clock yesterday. This puts the Opposition in a difficulty in trying to deal sensibly with the action that has been taken in another place.<br/>
I wonder whether you consider that the Government, in attempting to rush this legislation through, ought to pay greater attention to the rights of backbenchers, because if they do not, the whole proceedings become a nonsense.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for putting his point of view so clearly. The House, if it likes, could


proceed with what Francis Thompson called "deliberate speed". In this case it seems to have proceeded with what Francis Thompson called "majestic instancy". I cannot interfere with the arrangements of the Government. I had to study this morning, after a not inconsiderable amount of time in the Chair during the last 24 hours, starred Amendments made to the Lords Amendments to the Bill. I admit that it has been rather difficult, but it has not been impossible. I note that the hon. Member, or one of his colleagues, has starred Amendments to one of the Bills before us. It is difficult, but it is not a matter of order for the Chair. The hon. Member must make his protest to the Government, to the Leader of the House. It is not a matter for Mr. Speaker.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
The Amendment states a specific power for the Tourist Boards to establish committees to advise them in the performance of their functions. The Tourist Boards will have to maintain close links with many interests concerned with providing tourist facilities and amenities as well as with trade, travel and consumer interests. We discussed the matter at length in Committee. They will obviously have to establish appropriate consultative and advisory machinery, and their powers under the Bill as originally drafted were adequate for the purpose. While there is no need to provide a specific power for


them to establish committees, I do not suggest that we should disturb this provision which has been inserted in the Bill in another place.</p>

<p>I am glad that the Minister proposed that we should agree with this Amendment, which was put down by Opposition Members in another place and accepted by the Government spokesman in another place. The point has been in the minds of my hon. Friends and myself during the various stages of the Bill. The relations which will be established between the new Boards and the industry are of central importance, as we said from time to time. The matter is of particular importance because the British Travel Association is about to disappear. It is useful not only to have the powers in the Bill but to stress the importance of the committee system. For that reason, I welcome the Amendment.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop)&#x2014;my hon. and in many instances learned Friend&#x2014;for his suggestion. Even the Leader of the House cannot alter the selection of Amendments. I am aggrieved that we are not to be able to debate some of the new factors which have arisen and which were dependent on the action which another place took.<br/>
Their Lordships' Amendment permits the establishment of committees to advise the Tourist Boards. This is of major importance. On Report and Third Reading, we pressed the Government to do it. We had to accept that we were in difficulties in Committee because of the Government's reasonableness in accepting Amendments put down by the Opposition on the establishment of an English Tourist Board&#x2014;a proposal supported by some hon. Members opposite because of the logic of our case. It was agreed by both sides of the Committee that the type of advisory procedure which would be used in the Bill would not be debated in Committee. The difficulty then arose that many of the Amendments dealing with the advisory procedure were not selected on Report, so that even at this late stage it can be said that debate has not taken place on the establishment of the type of committee which ought to advise the Boards in the operation of their duty. This Amendment, therefore, takes on considerable importance, and the Minister of State has not given adequate information on the way in which he expects the Amendment to work.<br/>
I must refer to consultation with regional tourist committees, a point which I should not have mentioned had my Amendments been selected. In my area


of the South-West, there was a strong feeling that there ought to be a South-West Tourist Board with statutory authority. I could not support that proposal because I felt that if it were accepted, equally valid arguments could be advanced for statutory tourist boards in every region, and I am against statutory boards being proliferated like waste paper throughout the land. However, once we have an English Tourist Board, it is of the greatest importance to ensure that they consult tourist authorities or committees in regions to obtain regional advice. A number of us tried to have that put into the Bill. May I have an assurance from the Minister that the system envisaged in the Lords' Amendment will provide for a committee with responsibility to consult and co-ordinate the views of the regional tourist authorities or committees and of all the other regional tourist activities? The Minister himself referred to that&#x2014;many columns of HANSARD are devoted to his speeches&#x2014;as essential for the proper working of the Act. While we will not have been able to spell out in the Bill the need for consultation, and although assurances from the Despatch Box have not the power of the written word in a Bill, it would nevertheless be of help to have an assurance from the hon. Gentleman that he will do his best to ensure that, in the establishment of these committees, there is the type of regional grouping of which I have spoken.<br/>
5.0 p.m.<br/>
Committees have played a major part in the working of the B.T.A. I seek an assurance from the hon. Gentleman that the type of committee structure used by the Association is that which is envisaged in the Amendment. I remind the hon. Gentleman of the work done, for example, by my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Mr. Robert Cooke) on the Historic Buildings Committee of the Association, and of the work of a number of other people, well known in this House and elsewhere, on the publication Committee, the Historic Buildings Committee and other committees. They have been of immense assistance.<br/>
What we have never had from the Minister is an absolute assurance that he wishes this sort of committee structure to be carried on in the new set-up, because,

through it, we can draw upon the learned advice and considerable experience of so many people from different walks of life. It is essential to have such an assurance at this time because the new structure will entail small executive managements which will not have the wide experience in executive responsibility enjoyed by the whole Council of the B.T.A. It is specifically because of this factor that it is essential to ensure that this extra advice is available to the Authority and the boards through the type of committee structure I have been advocating. If that is what the Amendment is intended to do, the House will be more than pleased.</p>

<p>I had not intended to speak but my hon. Friend the Member for Honiton (Mr. Emery) made a kind reference to my membership of the Historic Buildings Committee of the British Travel Association. I believe that Committee be of such importance&#x2014;my membership of it is purely incidental&#x2014;that it must be fitted into the new structure, and I would like an assurance from the Minister of State on that point.<br/>
The Committee evolved because it was felt that the tremendous tourist potential of the historic buildings in various hands&#x2014;whether private, public or the National Trust and so forth&#x2014;was not being properly exploited. I use the word "exploited" advisedly because such houses are a great advantage in attracting visitors from abroad and providing enjoyment in this country. A number of people were called together and others were added later. They eventually became a formal committee of the Association. Under a distinguished independent chairman, all the interests were represented&#x2014;the owners, the National Trust, the Ministry of Public Building and Works and others who could be helpful with advice and in the co-ordination of the work.<br/>
Without the existence of the Committee, we should never have been able to attack&#x2014;I mean tackle&#x2014;various Ministries. I used the word "attack" inadvertently and so I may have given the impression that we have had trouble. We have had trouble occasionally with various Ministries, particularly the Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Transport with regard to signs and so forth. But all these things have been thrashed


out in the Committee with the Ministries concerned and reasonably satisfactory results obtained. It could not have been done without the assistance of the Committee. The B.T.A. could not have done it on its own because it would not have had the know-how to set about it.<br/>
I hope that the Lords Amendment means that the work of this Committee and others like it will be continued and that the fund of advice and knowledge built up will not be lost. We have had vague assurances but I hope that, following what my hon. Friend has said so powerfully and what I say more diffidently, we shall get an assurance from the Minister of State even at this late stage, because this is a vital matter.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Honiton (Mr. Emery) has given valid reasons why the Minister should give us an indication of the guide-lines on how this part of the Bill will be applied. Our fear about the Bill as it stands is that the small boards which are preferred by the Government will tend, by reason of their very smallness, to be bureaucratic and rather separate from the industry. By implementation of this addendum, by the use of committees, this danger could be overcome.<br/>
The existing set-up does not suffer in that way. It broadly expresses the views of this very big and diverse industry. If these committees are employed as we hope they will be, I should imagine that any dangers arising from the smallness of the boards and the fact that they will not be representative of the industry will be overcome. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will give us an assurance along these lines.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1969-07-24a.2169.1" hansard_membership_id="9052" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18079" speakername="Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop" colnum="2169" time="">
<p>I, too, want to know from the Minister of State what he has in mind as the functions of the committees proposed in the Amendment. Secondly, I am anxious to avoid unnecessary duplication. Everyone will be desirous of that. For instance, it would be a mistake to have a regional committee set up where there is already a regional body such as the South-West Travel Association, because this would mean an unnecessary expense and a duplication of functions. We would arrive at a slightly anomalous situation where there were regional committees for some areas and

not for others, this corresponding to the fact that some areas have regional travel associations of one kind or another and others do not. Therefore, I seek an assurance that, insofar as it is within his power to give advice, the hon. Gentleman will press the merits of using existing voluntary organisations where they exist. This would avoid the expense of a new secretariat for regional committees. It would avoid the possibility of conflicting advice from regional committees formed in one way and from regional travel associations formed in another way, a conflict which could only confound confusion.<br/>
Although I have the greatest desire to see specialist functional committees set up, I am not in favour of area committees. If an area wishes to be represented, if should do so via a voluntary travel association, tourist board, or whatever it may be called. If it has so little interest in its own tourist trade that it canont be bothered to put together such a local tourist body, I do not see why the English, Scottish or Wales Tourist Board should be bothered to do the job for it. In other words, the motive should be to help those who help themselves, not to provide an alternative for people who do not help themselves. That must be the rule right the way through. It is a rule for economy of administration as well as of finance, and it should be observed.<br/>
In local government there has been a tendency towards greater proliferation of committees which then become so diverse that co-ordinating committees have to be set up. There is a danger that that sort of thing can happen with other bodies with a large territorial focus, as, for instance, the British Tourist Board&#x2014;or British Tourist Authority as it now is. The name has been changed again and again, and I cannot imagine how anyone will remember the correct names of all these bodies. It would Lave been better if the Government had left well alone as the Bill came out of Committee, where it was so exhaustively discussed, instead of introducing the confusion which we now have.<br/>
At a later stage&#x2014;it would be out of order now&#x2014;I shall direct attention to a conflict between a provision which the Government propose to insert and one which they intend to leave in. But sufficient unto the day be the conflict thereof.


At this point, I want an assurance from the Minister that the giving of power to set up specialist committees, however well-intentioned, will not result eventually in the setting up of a large number of nonspecialist committees overlapping both with one another and with regional and local tourist bodies and travel associations which already exist or which will be set up in the future.</p>

<p>In my view, this Amendment from the other place is unnecessary because the Clause as it stands gives full powers to set up committees in any case. Obviously, the setting up of a new authority does not mean that we shall have an authority without committees. I believe that one of the reasons put forward by the present British Travel Association for changing its own structure was that it wished to improve its committee organisation it felt that it was somewhat hidebound in its committee structure and scope. I understand that it has about seven main committees and several others.<br/>
What concerns me is that by the Bill as amended in the other place we shall be inviting the Authority to set up committees. Authorities are very good at setting up committees without our invitation, and by inviting this Authority to do so we are likely to call forth a proliferation of committees and a growth in the structure around them, since more people will be required to service them and more expense will be entailed.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend challenges the idea of committees on the ground of cost. Does he realise that

under the present committee system of the British Travel Association&#x2014;the committees we are talking about&#x2014;all is adequately paid for by the subscriptions of the members whose interests are involved?

<p>We are near the holiday period. Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I allowed myself to be led astray by my hon. Friends. I was answering my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, West (Mr. Robert Cooke). The present committee structure needs a good deal of improvement. But, apart from the possibility of increased cost, I wonder whether my hon. Friends in the regions have considered that the invitation extended by the new subsection to set up committees may lead to a situation in which the new central powerful authorities set up committees and inflict those committees on them in their regions, where they greatly value the independence of their own committees. Those committees are desirable links with the major authorities, but they may find that there is inflicted upon them a central authority committee which is unrepresentative of their area and which does not provide the sort of publicity services and the like which they want to maximise the number of tourists coming to their area.<br/>
The invitation to set up committees is such that one might almost suggest to the new Authority that there was every justification for having a committee to push the attractions of Rutland as a tourist area. We already have many tourists coming to visit us, but we might well feel that there was need to promote our tourist interest further, and for that purpose there might be a committee. Admittedly, that is not a serious comment, but it highlights the point which


I am making. My fear is that we shall have too many of these committees as a result of the invitation which it is proposed to extend.<br/>
I hope that, when the new Authority is set up, it will conform pretty nearly to the kind of committee structure which I envisage, though with certain changes which will probably be an advantage, and that there will he no temptation to overdo the number of committees. The board can work much better if it does not blow itself up with an over-organised structure. I hope that my hon. Friends will recognise that.</p>

<p>The Minister of State in another place appeared to believe that this proposed Amendment was unnecessary and that it added nothing to the Bill. Yet the Government, through the Minister of State in this House, has thought fit to advise this House to agree with the Amendment. From that I must conclude that the Government have had second thoughts and decided that there is some valid reason for incorporating the Amendment in the Bill. They must therefore have some valid idea of the function of these committees. I should like to have more elucidation on that from the point of view of hoteliers in my constituency, many if not all of whom are throughly disgruntled about many of the requirements of the Bill and want to have as much clarification as possible of its provisions.<br/>
Is it in the mind of the hon. Gentleman that these committees should be set up to advise the board in carrying out any functions that may be given it under the new Clause which now forms part of the Bill in connection with registration of tourist accommodation? Should the Board seek advice on such matters as annual fees for registration or the display of signs? The whole idea of compulsory registration is absolutely abhorrent to hoteliers. It is nonsensical that they are to be required to pay a fee and to be subjected to penalties of up to &#x00A3;200 if they fail to accord with these provisions. Would advice be sought on this from outside bodies such as motoring organisations, food guides, and regional authorities which are already in existence? If that is the type of advice the board would seek, the establishment of these committees would be wholly acceptable because it could avoid further

trampling on the rights of hoteliers and not be subject to the threat of having to pay fees.</p>

<p>I shall not respond to those rather provoking strictures made by the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Sir J. Eden). It is not a case of having had second thoughts but of showing generosity. As I tried to suggest earlier, my instinct is not to show generosity to Amendments made in another place, but, that having been said, let us all get together and make as reasonable a structure as we can.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Member for Rutland and Stamford (Mr. Kenneth Lewis) that this Amendment is rather unnecessary. I would have said so had it been moved in Standing Committee. It does not give us further powers, but, if it makes men happy, on this occasion I am prepared to accept it and recommend it to the House. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Mr. Robert Cooke) is an admirable member of an admirable committee. Perhaps that is the committee which sits under the chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Wontner, and I have no doubt that it does excellent work. Although we may have different views about the new structure, I think it right to set up the Boards and let them get on with the job. I hope that they will not duplicate work properly done on a voluntary basis. I said that in Committee and on Report. These are new statutory bodies which will rely to a substantial extent on voluntary contributions in the industry and on a regional basis.</p>

<p>I take the point and I hope that now we have decided on three boards that will not preclude co-operation by which the purpose will be best served.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) and the hon. Member for Honiton (Mr. Emery) said, we have established compact, functional boards. They will succeed and tourism will prosper in


direct proportion to the way in which all those who are authoritative and play their part in this matter are consulted. In reply to the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West, I see no reason why the boards should not find it desirable to consult on matters which he had in mind.<br/>
I cannot see why there should be a separate committee to consult with regional bodies. I cannot give the absolute assurance asked by the hon. Member for Honiton. I do not think he would expect the old B.T.A. structure to be envisaged. We are anxious to get the best structure. I hope that the board will note what has been said today and what was said in Committee, on which there is a large measure of agreement.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This Amendment was proposed by the Government in another place following some detailed discussion. I think it has presentational advantages although I cannot say that it adds substantially to the Bill. There has never been in our minds

any question that the three country boards would be unable to prepare publicity material, not only for use in this country motion missions organised by the British Tourist Authority. We have envisages them being able to join in overseas promotion missions organised by the British Tourist Authority. The three country boards could play a part in overseas promotion activities as agents of the new B.T.A.<br/>
I make that point because there is a question of delicate balance here. After considerable discussion, it was agreed that it was the r&#x00F4;le of the British Tourist Authority to promote Britain as a whole and there would be a danger if separate boards adopted a fragmented approach. By accepting this Amendment we would show clearly the r&#x00F4;le of the British Tourist Authority while not excluding a r&#x00F4;le for the boards of the kind I have described.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Minister for what he has said. He has pointed out that the Amendment makes the general statement that only the British Tourist Authority shall have power to carry on activities outside the United Kingdom. As a general statement, I do not object to that. On the other hand, it is deemed desirable in certain conditions that the tourist boards should have the power to do some of this work on behalf of the Authority. Does the Amendment mean that they will be able to do such work only by direction of or with the permission of the Authority?<br/>
5.30 p.m.<br/>
This could lead to difficulties. The Scottish Council (Development and Industry) or the Welsh industrial development body might contemplate a major trade exhibition in the United States or elsewhere overseas. Surely it would be advantageous if the appropriate Tourist Board were able to co-operate with the trade or industrial undertaking. If a trade or industrial exhibition were held in New York or elsewhere in the United States, it might be of the greatest benefit to tourism if the appropriate board had a hand in it. In such a case, would it be necestary for the board to obtain the permission or approval of the Authority? If so, would it readily be given?<br/>
It would be most unfortunate if the boards were not able to co-operate at an opportune moment in an industrial or


trade exhibition overseas. I want an assurance either that it will not be necessary for them to get the permission of the Authority or that the Authority will readily give permission.</p>

<p>I must make one reservation about handing over power to the Welsh Tourist Board. We do not know who will be on the board. Before giving greater powers to the board and expecting it to carry out advertising abroad, we wish to be sure that there are on it people who are capable of presenting the tourist industry as members of the industry in Wales want it to be presented.<br/>
In the past, the Welsh Tourist Board has, with the exception of one or two names, been totally unrepresentative of the tourist industry. There have been far too many nominees from local government and by the Government on the basis of political and other allegiances and not on the basis of expertise in the industry which they are supposed to administer. If the make-up of the board which we are to have in Wales is the same as the make-up of the board which we have had in the past, I assure the Welsh Office that the people in the tourist industry will not want their industry to be promoted abroad by it.</p>

<p>I should like to say a few words about the clumsy way in which the Bill has been drafted and in which it is being amended. There is a conflict between the part of Clause 2 which appears on page 2 of the Bill and the part which appear at the top of page 3. It is always undesirable to have conflicts in Clauses.<br/>
Clause 2(2) provides that one of the functions of each Tourist Board shall be
<q>to promote or undertake publicity in any form".</q>
That is an all-embracing function. On the next page, the Bill provides that
<q>only the British Tourist Authority shall have power by virtue of</q>
subsection (2)
<q>to carry on any activities outside the United Kingdom for the purpose of encouraging people to visit Great Britain or any part of it &#x2026;</q>
There is an obvious conflict between the two parts of the same Clause.<br/>
As originally drafted, there were paragraphs (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>), (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) in subsection

(2). It is now proposed to insert subsection (2A), which modifies subsection (2) (<i>a</i>). We can imagine the fun which somebody will have in referring to this provision in court. It is an absolute drafting nonsense.<br/>
The Government should have put the proposed restriction after subsection (2) (<i>a</i>) in line 42. It is wrong to lay a statutory duty on the three Boards
<q>to promote or undertake publicity in any form",</q>
which is a clear, all-embracing statutory duty, and to provide that
<q>each Tourist Board shall have power to do anything for the purpose of discharging the functions conferred on it by this section</q>
and then to say, in this strange restriction, that the Clause does not mean what it says because
<q>only the British Tourist Authority shall have power</q>
to do this outside the United Kingdom, although it goes on to say in what will be subsection (2B) that it can do it if it acts as agent for the Authority.<br/>
There is a good living for lawyers here; there is no doubt about that. But this is not the way in which we should legislate. We should legislate clearly and explicitly. But to get involved in this sort of dog's breakfast whereby we put forward an all-embracing proposition and then on the next page proceed to knock it down is not the way to pass legislation which is likely to be with us for some time, because in the queue for legislation tourism will not come up again for several, if not many, years.<br/>
This is my protest against shoddy and confusing drafting. I do not say that if someone is learned enough and is paid enough to spend long enough studying the Bill enough he cannot eventually work out what it means. But the Bill could have been drafted in a much clearer and more specific way. I do not believe that any hon. Member, reading Clause 2 as it will be if we accept the Amendment, can believe that it is other than a piece of drafting which we should be ashamed to pass into statute law.</p>

<p>This Government Amendment illustrates the force of the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Honiton (Mr. Emery) in an earlier debate about the difficulties which are caused to hon. Members by the speed with which


we have been compelled to take the Lords Amendments. This is due solely to the mismanagement by the Government of their programme. I hope that the industry will take note that once again, while the Opposition Members commend but criticise the provisions of the Bill, we are, nevertheless, facilitating its progress in the interest of the industry.<br/>
The Minister says that the Amendment does not change or add to the position under the Bill. That is not my impression. Owing, however, to the timetable, I have not had time to check back on all our debates which are relevant to the subject. Hon. Members who have been following the Bill in the course of its debates will know that this has been one of the most important provisions which we have debated at all stages and that it was debated also in considerable depth in another place. It is a surprise to me to hear the Ministry say that the Amendment does not change the position under the Bill or add to it.</p>

<p>My hon.

<p>I heartily endorse what my hon. Friend has said. The remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) about the drafting of the Bill simply confirm that it would have been valuable, in the interests or the industry and of good legislation, had we had reasonable time to consider these Amendments.<br/>
Hon. Members know that in Committee we put down and carried an Amendment, which was relevant to the point we are now considering, regarding the promotion overseas of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom. In another place, noble Lords on the Opposition side put down an Amendment which went less far than the Amendment which we in this House carried but which, nevertheless, went

further than the Amendment with which we are now faced. However, I take the view that this is a step forward. It recognises that there will be occasions when the attractions of the constituent parts of Britain should be presented in their own right. Therefore, so far as it goes, I welcome the Amendment.<br/>
My final question to the Minister is to ask who will pay when the tourist boards engage in these overseas promotion activities on behalf of the Authority. Will the cost have to come out of their budgets or will it be the responsibility of the B.T.A.?</p>

<p>I am sorry that everybody is upset about the speed with which the Bill is making progress. It is an important Bill. I understand that the industry wants it. We wanted to get it on the Statute Book by the time the House rose for the Summer Recess. Judging by the number of inquiries which we have had under Part II of the Bill, anybody would believe that in seeking to get it on the Statute Book we were acting in the interest of the industry.<br/>
We have had 70 hours of discussion of the Bill. Its passage through the other place might have taken longer than some people expected. In view of my sentiments about the other place, it is for me to complain about that. It is not for hon. Members opposite to regret that the Lords have done what they believed to be their duty.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is being less than fair, but this is uncharacteristic of him. He should not go into the question of who is filibustering at any stage of the Bill, because the only filibustering has come from his own side. Perhaps the Minister will concede that it is for the Opposition to criticise a Bill and make sure that it is a good one. When it becomes law, the industry may feel that it might have been better drafted. Nevertheless, we are doing our utmost to see that it becomes law as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I have complaints about no one. I thought that others had complaints about me. If they have, it is reasonable that I should seek to reply. I am not complaining at our discussion today or in Committee. The Bill is making progress, it is getting better all the time and it will be valuable for the inustry.<br/>
I think that there is a large measure of agreement on the Amendment. The position as the hon. Member for Barry (Mr. Gower) saw it was broadly correct. The Boards will act as agents for the British Tourist Authority. I certainly hope that there will not be sharp relations between the boards and the Authority in pulling different ways, nor do I believe that there will be difficulties with finance.<br/>
5.45 p.m.<br/>
To the extent that the boards act for the Authority, one would expect it to be on the basis of finance provided by the Authority. On the other hand, if there is action by the boards which the Authority is prepared to see but is not necessarily very enthusiastic about, it may be that the budgetary provision will be made elsewhere. This can be sorted out to the general satisfaction. Certainly, there will be no impediment of the kind mentioned by the hon. Member for Barry about co-operation with industrial and trade exhibitions overseas. This is important and worthwhile and I would hope to see it extended.<br/>
The hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) made a point with which, he may he surprised to know, I agree. Legislation as a whole is incomprehensible to the layman and I am sorry. I do not, however, think that the Bill is more incomprehensible than other Measures. On the contrary, it is rather easier to understand. The first of the Lords Amendments, which I accepted and referred to as a drafting Amendment, was designed to meet the point raised by the hon. Member, although I cannot claim that it necessarily met his full satisfaction.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
The House will recall that the present subsection (4) of Clause 2 was inserted on Report in this House on 23rd June because we felt it important to draw the attention of all four tourist boards to the importance of consultation with the many interests and organisations concerned

with tourism, an aspect on which we have commented earlier this afternoon.<br/>
To work successfully, all four boards will rely to a large extent on establishing close links with the tourist industry and other bodies concerned in every way with tourism, including the regional bodies. We expect the boards to consult one another. This is a matter of common sense, because they will have a great deal of common interest and concern of national importance and they can do so to each other's benefit. The fact that the chairmen of the English, Scottish and Wales Boards will he <i>ex officio</i> members of the B.T.A. will provide an obvious avenue for consultation and exchanges of experience, but this will not be the only way in which consultations take place between the boards. I hope that consultation will be frequent and continuous at all levels, not only at chairman and board level, but at chief officer level, too. As I have said before, harmonious relations of this kind, pulling together rather than apart, will produce the result which we all want to see.<br/>
It was, however, felt in another place that as subsection (4) points to the desirabilty of consultation wit h other organisations and interests, it should also refer to consultation being desirable between the boards. This I regard as an obvious point. As it is obvious, I see no reason in present circumstances to do other than suggest that we agree with the Amendment.</p>

<p>The insertion of these few words makes it clear that it will be possible to obtain consultation in this matter, not only to deal with the functions dealt with in the Clause but, because part of the Clause covers also Part III and Clause 17 of the Bill, it will also be possible for consultation to take place between the boards and the British Tourist Authority on the matter of registration and compulsory grading.<br/>
It is to me an extreme pity that their Lordships, who, in Committee, took out the whole of Clause 17, were persuaded to restore it on recommittal. This was their decision. I am sorry that we have not been able to debate that matter now because many of us feel that the compulsory aspect is one of considerable concern and much against the wishes of


hoteliers and the restaurateurs. Therefore, it seems worth while making the point now that the discharging of the functions under this part of the Bill will allow consultations by the boards and the Authority with everybody on the matter of registration and grading. The Minister has himself said that, while he wishes these to be stand-by powers, they are not to be brought in unless on the advice of the new B.T.A. He will realise that the subjective judgment on the grading of hotels or the starring of hotels is open to considerable criticism if this is to be done by a nationalised Government agency.<br/>
Therefore, I hope it will be made quite clear that consultation can take place under Part III about the powers given in Clause 2 to ensure that the tourist boards will consult with the new B.T.A. on this matter. I feel very strongly that they will not only want to but will have to before any action can be taken on either registration or grading.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
The ability to acquire shares to aid a particular tourist project under Clause 4 is seen as a means by which, in appropriate cases, the tourist boards could assist such a project by taking an equity interest rather than by making a grant

or loan. One would expect this ability to be very rarely used. We had in Committee some discussion of the circumstances in which it might be desirable or at least acceptable.<br/>
In the rare case of a tourist board taking an equity interest in a company the board would, obviously, keep in touch with the company about the progress and success of the project. Since a tourist board will be concerned to help get a tourist project off the ground and to see it successful, obviously no board will act precipitately thereafter to harm the enterprise which it has helped. Common sense suggests that, should a tourist board wish to dispose of any holding, it would be likely to discuss the possibility with the company concerned. If a board has a holding in a private company, then there is bound to be some restriction on disposal and transfer of shares written into the company's articles of association.<br/>
This Amendment will require a tourist board to consult the company concerned before disposing of any shareholding in it, and though I doubt whether, on the face of it, such a provision is necessary, I cannot see any objection to it.</p>

The requirements in Clause 7(2) amount to a definition of the kind of hotel which is to be eligible for assistance


under Part II of the Bill. These requirements are to apply in the case of grants for new hotels under Clause 7 and for extension and improvements to existing hotels under Clauses 8 and 9.<br/>
The requirement in Clause 7(2)(<i>b</i>) is that breakfast and an evening meal are provided on the premises for guests staying at the hotel. Thus, the hotel must have facilities and equipment for this purpose on the premises, which may embrace more than one building. The requirement is intended to exclude from eligibility establishments which only provide bed and breakfast or self-catering facilities or which merely make arrangements for guests to eat at a nearby caf&#x00E9; or restaurant which is not part of the hotel premises. This is something we argued about in Committee and I am sure that we do not wish to pursue it further now.<br/>
The Amendment makes explicit that the provision of meals is only required to be "at reasonable times", and its purpose is to allay any fears which paragraph (<i>b</i>) might otherwise mean that an hotelier could be required to serve breakfast and evening meals at unreasonable hours. Although we do not consider that any such construction could be put on paragraph (<i>b</i>) as it stands, this Amendment was proposed by the Government in another place to remove any further concern on the point, and I would ask the House to endorse it.</p>

<p>I never really know what "reasonable times" means. I feel that this needs some further elucidation by the Minister either by an Order or otherwise. What are "reasonable times" for breakfast or an evening meal? Some people would think that it would be reasonable to have breakfast at 6 o'clock in the morning. Other people would think 9 or 9.30 would be reasonable. There could be disputes between hoteliers and their customers about what are "reasonable times" for breakfast or what are "reasonable times" for an evening meal, which some people would think it reasonable to have at 5.30 or 6 o'clock, though some other people would think 10 o'clock in the evening an even more reasonable time. So I do feel that there has to be some elucidation of what are "reasonable times".<br/>
I dislike the word "reasonable" because the interpretation of "reasonable" is always unreasonable.</p>

<p>The Minister has referred specifically to the self-catering unit being excluded. I am sorry that an Amendment of mine was not selected, because then the House could have considered this matter more advantageously. The reason why the Minister is in difficulty in this matter is that today the tourist is a person who travels by car and travels by car at many different and varying hours.<br/>
A tourist will very likely have young children with him, very likely with a baby asleep at the back of the car. He frequently travels at times when the traffic is least heavy. So by one reason or another he arrives for an enjoyable holiday in the West Country at possibly a late hour at night, or, alternatively at an early hour of the morning, and, of course, he requires either a late evening meal or an early breakfast, as the case may be.<br/>
It seems that by inserting the words "at reasonable times" we are doing exactly what my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Sir C. Taylor) said&#x2014;putting in a limitation which is bound to give rise to widely varying interpretations.<br/>
Much of the new tourism which is growing up is represented by the person who uses his car to take his family away where previously he has taken his holidays at home. That is the kind of person who wants the self-catering facilities which are the most modern aspect of hotel improvement. It is a considerable weakness in the Bill that the Government have turned their faces against giving grant assistance for improvements or rebuilding to deal with what is the biggest single new factor affecting the tourist industry. I am more than sorry that we shall not be able to have this properly dealt with by the Government.</p>

<p>The points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Eastbourne (Sir C. Taylor) and my hon. Friend for Honiton (Mr. Emery) illustrate the disadvantages of the system of so-called hotel incentives which the Government


have adopted, and we have criticised the system in depth in our past debates.<br/>
Assuming that the system is to be adopted, we thought that the Amendments to the Clause should go a good deal further than this one does. We did not think that it was necessary for a hotel to provide an evening meal before it qualified for aid. However, as clearly we have been unsuccessful in convincing the Government of that, this small Amendment is in the right direction, and I welcome it.</p>

<p>I agree with much that has been said by the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Sir C. Taylor) and the hon. Member for Honiton (Mr. Emery). I would like all establishments to provide meals at unreasonable times. We all dislike arriving late at an hotel and being told that we cannot even have a sandwich. We hope that a generous welcome will be given to travellers at all times, because real hospitality will make tourism grow.<br/>
That having been said, and conceding that the success of tourism depends on the initiative and astuteness of those running our hotels, I believe that the tourist boards will interpret this provision wisely and that it is to be welcomed. The hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Blaker) said that it illustrated the disadvantages of the system. I do not say that the system is not one that cannot be improved at some time. There is always the element of experiment in any scheme. However, I am sure that the House wishes it all success.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
The requirement in paragraph (<i>d</i>) of Subsection (2) was designed to exclude establishments where guests have to look after themselves. The requirement for normal hotel services with room cleaning and bed making given by way of illustration was not intended to be exhaustive. Nor was it intended to describe or enforce

qualitative standards of hotel services. For example, it is not intended that a modest hotel in a rural area should be denied a grant because it does not provide all the services which are normal to a "four star" hotel.<br/>
I recall that some concern was expressed when we discussed the Bill in Committee in this House that the reference to normal hotel services might be construed too rigidly by the tourist boards. The effect of this amendment is to refer to appropriate services, making quite clear that the cleaning of rooms and the making of beds are essential services which must be provided in every case. It is a necessary part of the requirements about which tourist boards are to be satisfied so that assistance is confined to the kind of hotel for which the hotel incentives scheme is designed, whatever other reflections there may have been on the point.<br/>
I recommend the House to agree to the revised wording of paragraph (<i>d</i>).</p>

<p>Once again, I take the view that the Amendment represents a modest improvement on the previous position. We have said in our previous debates that we think that "normal" is the wrong word to use about hotel services. It ignores the fact that there is a great variety of establishments which can be called hotels, and the variety is increasing constantly. We would have been content simply to have the words
<q>hotel services appropriate to the establishment",</q>

<p>May I ask the Minister a question? There are some hotels, especially in ski-ing areas, where the accommodation might be described as fairly rough in comparison with a four star hotel. Bunks are provided without bedding, and a visitor is meant to bring a sleeping bag. However, such an establishment is still described as an hotel. If the Minister wanted examples, I would give him two references to this type of accommodation. Does not the Amendment mean that an establishment providing that type of accommodation will not qualify for grant?</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
Subsection (3) of Clause 8 provides the tourist boards with a necessary discretionary power as a precaution against abuse of the provisions of Clause 8, and we discussed this in Committee.<br/>
In the generality of cases, expenditure eligible for Clause 8 grants will include all expenditure which the tourist boards consider to be of a capital nature. Thus capital expenditure can cover only constructional and fixed equipment costs of the actual bedrooms but also expenditure on extending or improving other facilities such as bathrooms, lavatories. lounge, dining and recreation areas, and kitchens.<br/>
It is necessary to guard against the provisions of Clause 8 being abused in order to obtain more grant for the mere improvement of hotel facilities than could be secured under Clause 9. A simple example would be the case of someone merely designating "staff bedrooms" as additional letting bedrooms in order to obtain grant.<br/>
Subsection (3) provides the tourist hoards with discretion to exclude expenditure not attributable to the provision of additional bedrooms in cases where they are partly provided by the alteration of existing accommodation. It is a necessary power but the tourist boards will obviously want to see additional bedrooms provided freely since this is the main purpose of this hotel incentives scheme.<br/>
Concern has been expressed lest this essential discretionary power might be applied too rigidly as regards bathroom facilities provided in conjunction with extra letting bedrooms. I understand that the other place was much concerned with adequate bathroom accommodation. Following discussion in another place, the Government proposed this Amendment to cover the bathroom point, without detracting from the essential purpose of the discretionary power in subsection (3) I commend it to the House.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
The effect of this Amendment and Lords Amendment No. 2, in page 6, line 35, leave out "or (<i>b</i>)" and insert "(<i>b</i>) or (<i>bb</i>)", carried on a Division by the Opposition in another place is to alter completely the arrangements proposed in the Bill for the operation of bus services by the new London Transport Executive. Under the terms of subsection (1)(<i>a</i>), as originally drafted, the Executive will have a capacity power to carry passengers by
<q>any form of land or water transport</q>
within, to or from Greater London, and under subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), as originally drafted, it will be able in certain limited cases to carry passengers to points outside Greater London. The Amendment leaves the provisions relating to railways and water transport virtually untouched, but would limit the carriage of passengers by bus very substantially.<br/>
In relation to regular bus services, the power to carry would be tied to Greater London itself, with the consent of the Minister required for operation on any road outside Greater London&#x2014;with the proviso that the consent should be given only if there are exceptional circumstances which make operation on a particular route desirable. In relation to contract carriage services, the power to carry would again be tied to Greater London, with an exception for parties of the G.L.C.'s employees, who could be carried within a radius of 100 miles from Charing Cross. In general, the carrying powers of the Executive would be tied to Greater London in rather the same way that, at the moment, under provisions deriving from the 1933 Act, they are tied to the London Passenger Transport area.<br/>
This limitation is quite unacceptable. Its effect would be to place on the L.T.E. restrictions that at the moment apply neither to the P.T.E.s nor to local authority operators under the terms of the 1968 Act. As a matter of basic principle it must be resisted on the ground that the L.T.E. has a duty, in the light of the policy guidelines laid down by the G.L.C., to provide such services as are required

to meet the needs of Greater London, and this cannot be discharged by an unrealistic limitation on its commercial and operating freedom. As the White Paper made clear, there should be no formal or geographical limits to its powers of operation.<br/>
Greater London certainly has transport needs outside its own area. The catchment area for commuter travel is wide, and the L.T.E. should have freedom to develop its services to meet these needs. No one intends that it should run all over the country. But Ministerial consent for running on any route outside Greater London would be a massive limitation upon it. The issue of what services the Executive should seek to develop is one for the Council and the Executive to work out, and not one on which the Minister should intervene in the way proposed.</p>

The effect of the Amendment is to place upon the London Transport Executive an obligation, in exercising its manufacturing powers conveyed under the Bill, to act as if it were a company engaged in a commercial enterprise. Without going into the details of the proceedings in another place I can say that the situation that has now arisen is that the


Government, while accepting that some further safeguards should be applied to ensure that the Executive does not compete unfairly, are not prepared for this to be achieved by way of the application of the commercial obligation contained in the Amendment. The Government feel that the right course is to taken action on Clause 12 to require the publication of financial results of this sort of trading by the Executive and also to lay this activity open to the possibility of Ministerial intervention.</p>

This Amendment was made in another place to meet a point raised by the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands (Mr. Wylie) during our discussion on Report. He was concerned that the Clause as originally drafted would require the sheriff to be satisfied as to the state of the dwelling at the time both of the local authority's decision and of the hearing of the appeal. The Amendment makes it clear that he need only consider any changes in the state of the dwelling between the two dates.<br/>
If there has been no change the sheriff has only to consider the facts which led the local authority to grant or refuse the certificate. If there has been a change&#x2014;for example, if in the interim the landlord has carried out repairs or the dwelling has deteriorated&#x2014;the sheriff can take into account the new circumstances, but new evidence need only relate to the change in circumstances. I am obliged to the hon. and learned Member for Edinburgh, Pentlands, for pointing out this defect.</p>

I suggest that with this Amendment we take Amendment No. 11.<br/>
This Amendment seeks to make a change of procedure regarding the calculation and application of the representative rate of interest. Local authorities have been content to keep to the financial year as presently prescribed, but the suggestion is that matters should be put in order in this regard, and that we should not have the old swings and roundabouts position.

primary concern is that local authorities which have been content to accept the balance of the gain on one year with the loss in another, which I have referred to as the swings and roundabouts position, now feel that six weeks is rather long for them to be affected by the lower or higher rates of interest prevailing in one particular year. They wish this change, and the Government think it only fair to make it. The influence on housing associations is important, but marginal. I will later seek to give the hon.

<p>This matter has been fully discussed on Second Reading, in Committee and on Report in this House and there is no doubt that there is a strong divergence of view. The Government&#x2014;and, I hope and believe, the majority of the House&#x2014;take the view that the arrangements we reached under the Bill were the fairest arrangements as between the two different points of view, the two views being that represented by some of my hon. Friends who thought that this whole procedure of bringing property in good condition into regulation was completely misconceived, and that represented by those who thought that we ought to make it easier and move more speedily.<br/>
Principally, it is a question not of policy but of administration. The main purpose of the Bill&#x2014;one keeps repeating this&#x2014;is to bring property into improved condition. It is a Housing Bill for that purpose. Therefore, that should be the first call on the time of rent officers, and they should not find themselves with a back-log of cases of dwellings already in the required state which floods them so much that they have no time to do the work which is intended under the Bill.<br/>
The other place has not challenged the principle of postponement; it has sought only to reduce the periods of time, inserting April, 1970, instead of January, 1971, October, 1970, instead of July, 1971, and April, 1971, instead of January, 1972.<br/>
The effect of trying to speed matters up in that way would not be wise. It would mean that, comparatively soon after the passing of the Bill, which we are anxious to see, there would be opportunity for these dwellings to be subject to application for registration. My advice is that we go back to the original view, which was no snap judgment but was the result of discussion, argument and vote at every stage. It was a considered view taken after a great deal of earnest discussion on both sides.<br/>
I invite the House to disagree with these three Amendments.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1969-07-24a.2202.0" hansard_membership_id="7490" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32711" speakername="Mr. Graham Page" colnum="2202" time="">
<p>The principle of the part of the Bill in which Clause 50 falls is to give fair rents for fit premises. That principle was breached when the Government introduced the delaying Clause. We fought the whole proposal to delay conversion from controlled to regulated property when property had been improved, that is, when improvements had been installed before the commencement of the Bill. This delay is contrary to the principles of Part III, fair rents for well kept property. At this stage, unfortunately, we must with reluctance accept the proposal in general and try to bring some sort of justice and fairness into its application.<br/>
When I watch television plays and thriller serials, I always have difficulty in distinguishing between the "goodies" and the "baddies". I find myself cheering "baddies" and booing "goodies". The Government have fallen into the same error. Here, the "goodies" are the landlords who have put improvements into their properties, when they were receiving only controlled rents and only the low level of grants. The "baddies" are those who have waited for the Bill to become law, who receive the increased grants, and who allowed their property to go unimproved up to the present.<br/>
It is right, perhaps, that the Government should be a sort of father of the prodigal son and encourage what I call the "baddies", but they need not do it at the expense of the "goodies". They are doing it at the expense of landlords who have improved their properties, because they say that there are not enough rent officers to make the decisions and the rent officers must be reserved for those who will improve their properties in future. But, while saying that, they take full-page advertisements in national newspapers, telling people to go to their rent officers, with pictures of rent officers across the top of the advertisements, and so on.<br/>
According to Government figures, the estimate is that 200,000 houses are affected by the Clause, that is to say, 200,000 applicants for a fair rent. I do not think that they will all need very much time with the rent officers, but even if they take up the same time as the present cases before the rent officers


the figures show that the rent officers can take on that number of cases.<br/>
There are at present 263 rent officers doing 44,000 cases a year. If my arithmetic is correct, that means that every rent officer does only three or four cases a week. I believe that they could deal with four or five times that number and cope with the 200,000 applicants over a shorter period of time.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary nearly "came clean" over this. It is not the fear of a revolt by rent officers that worries the Government, it is this extra-</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an Amendment to Lords Amendment, in line 5, leave out 'and 54'and insert '54 and 55'.<br/>
The new subsection to Clause 56 gives the Lord Chancellor power to make rules in connection with Clauses 49, 54 and 55. In Committee we raised the matter of rules under Clause 49. Clause 54 deals with the application to county courts if a tenant refuses to consent to improvements. Clause 55 was a modification of that introduced on Report. It deals with the production of a certificate by the rating authority to the county court in the course of proceedings requiring the tenant to give his consent to improvements being carried out. It provides for a certificate to be deemed to be such a certificate unless the contrary is proved.<br/>
It may well be necessary for some procedure to be prescribed to notify a tenant of his rights to produce such a certificate to the court and in relation to the way in which it should be pleaded as a defence. Unless there are some rules in this matter, there will be a serious gap in procedure. The Government may be advised that it is unlikely that rules will be unnecssary under the Clause, but it is possible that they may be necessary. There is no harm in the Lord Chancellor having power to makes those rules should the occasion arise.</p>

<p>I regret that I must advise the House not to accept this Amendment to the Lords Amendment. I do so not for any doctrinal reason, but simply for the reason that it is not necessary&#x2014;in fact, it cannot be done.<br/>
Lords Amendment No. 13 prescribes the rules in specific cases in relation to Section 106 of the Rent Act, 1968, in the making of regulations. This is proper in regard to Clause 54, because these are matters which may come before the court; but Clause 55 deals with the procedures in the rating office and I am advised that the Lord Chancellor cannot make rules to deal with that.<br/>
I have had the point carefully checked. There is a general power in any event for the Lord Chancellor to make rules. We thought it advisable to have the Amendment in relation to Section 106 since that deals with specific matters. There is a general power. The lawyers

have looked at the matter carefully and they are of the opinion that the Lord Chancellor is not in a position to make these rules. For that reason, rather than any doctrinal reason, I must ask the House not to accept the Amendment.</p>

This Amendment is designed to increase the penalty of &#x00A3;5, which has remained unchanged since 1930.

<p>I beg to move, That the House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This is in the form of new Clause B, and deals with a matter which was discussed both on the Housing (Subsidies) Bill in 1967 and on this Bill. The House will remember that on Report we introduced a new Clause which provided power for my right hon. Friend to make Orders to extend the option mortgage scheme. Both Front Benches thought it desirable to have some degree of contracting-out.<br/>
The difficulty was that the lending agencies found great trouble in doing so. Originally, in 1967, they agreed to contract in in cases of hardship, but it was not possible to reach agreement about contracting out. We promised that we would continue our discussions, and I am happy to say that we were able to reach agreement to have a five-year period at the end of which a borrower may contract out of the scheme. It is a once-and-for-all choice. He does not get a period of grace every five years on his mortgage. We feel that this is a desirable addition to make to the Bill.</p>

<p>I can understand the halting and hesitant voice with which the Minister proposed the new Clause. If ever there was a case of a Government constantly saying that in their view something was impossible and the Opposition saying that it was not and that it could be done, it is mortgage options.<br/>
Last October we stated in a policy statement that this would be our policy. There was an immediate reaction from the Government saying that it was absurd and could not be done.<br/>
In a censure debate in January the Minister of Housing and Local Government&#x2014;we are all sorry to hear that he is ill in hospital, and I am sure that both

sides of the House wish him a speedy recovery&#x2014;waved a paper at me and said that it was impossible and how wrong were my promises to the electors in this sphere.<br/>
On Report, we were again told that it was impossible. Finally, due to the constant efforts of the Opposition, the Government gave way. We are delighted that they have given way, but we do not think much of the way that they have done it. Many people with mortgage options feel that they have been swindled by the scheme. I believe that 1973 is not soon enough. When we are returned to office in the near future, we will allow those who have already taken out mortgage options to exercise an option before 1973 and thereafter, if considered right and appropriate, we will keep the five-year timetable.<br/>
As this is an improvement and an acceptance of the principle of the Opposition's policy, we welcome the new Clause.</p>

<p>A strong Government does not need to be worried about being ragged over a matter like this. We have always said that we were not against it in principle. We had a diplomatic undertanding about getting the lending agencies to agree, which was not helped by the demagogic activities of hon. Gentlemen opposite. But by good humour and calmness, we reached agreement. The hon. Gentleman can have his crow, but we are interested in getting on with the job that we want to do.</p>

<p>These two Amendments deal with the conditions under which Clause 79, dealing with premiums. operates.<br/>
The first has the effect that this condition will be imposed only for leases granted from now on. This is because of the difficulty which has arisen over leases already in existence and the great variety of terms which the fertile brains

of conveyances in different parts of the country have produced to get over various problems. We decided that the way to do it was to apply Clause 79 to future leases, not to those already in existence. By a strange coincidence another place came to the same conclusion.</p>

I undertook to consider the representations made from both sides of the House. As a result, these Amendments provide for members of the family of the enfranchisee who reside in the house The definition is in relation to family as it appears in Section 7(7) of the 1967 Act.

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This new Clause deals with one of the old thorny problems of Rent Act legis-

lation, namely, the distinction between improvements and repairs.<br/>
Section 46(3) of the Rent Act, 1968, requires rent officers and rent assessment committees, when determining the fair rent, to disregard improvements carried out by tenants otherwise than in pursuance of the terms of the tenancy. Although it is not expected that in the majority of cases the Amendment will make any appreciable difference to the amount of the rent, it is considered fair and just that a tenant who pays for work which adds to the comfort and convenience of his house should not have to pay additional rent as a result of it, and that the landlord who does improvements can get increased rents. In the case of repairs the landlord is assumed to fulfil his obligations and therefore they are not separately treated.<br/>
It was found, when the Housing (Scotland) Bill was going through, that a Government Amendment was made to deal with replacement. It seemed sensible to have the same provisions in this Bill as in the Scottish Bill.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
The Amendment applies to three important Clauses, Clauses 78, 79, and 80, which deal with various aspects of long leases. It provides for all three Clauses to come into operation immediately the Bill receives the Royal Assent, and not, as is the case with the rest of the Bill, one month later. I do not think that it is necessary to make the case for saying that it is desirable to bring them into operation as quickly as possible, because they are holding up agreements and it is desirable that people should be able to operate quickly on them. They do not involve, as most of the Bill does, some fairly complicated paper work in the way of forms, and so on, and therefore there seems no reason why we should not accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment.<br/>
This, again, is a matter which has been discussed at all stages of the Bill. Unlike the previous case on which we invited the House to disagree with the other place, the Amendment deals, not with postponement, but with the phasing of rent increases which have been registered. The point is common in relation to council rents. Where there is a sudden

sharp increase in rents, even if the original rent was not high, this could lead to the dislocation of the arrangements of the household, and it is desirable to phase the increase over a period so that people can get used to it and adjust to it.<br/>
That principle is not challenged in the Amendment, but what is proposed is that the period of the phasing should be reduced. This was debated in Committee and defeated on a Division. It was debated again in the House, and again defeated on a Division. I think that the House indicated that we had got the phasing right, and, therefore I invite the House to assert again that it wants to keep the original proposal.</p>

<p>It is true, as the hon. Gentleman said, that for the purpose of debating the Amendment we are accepting a phasing, but not a different phasing for different landlords. What we object to is the distinction between the landlord who has improved his property in the past, and the landlord who will improve his property in the future.<br/>
The landlord who has improved his property in the past will not get his full fair rent for five years. The landlord who improves his property in the future, on the basis of the increased grant, will get his fair rent phased over a period of only three years. Their Lordships endeavoured to bring some sense and justice into this by reducing the period from four years to two years, and to apply the same rule to both kinds of landlord. This surely is the sensible way to do it. There cannot be any logic or moral in making this distinction between two different kinds of landlord.<br/>
7.15 p.m.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said that the increase would be too sharp on the tenants. Would it be too sharp if it was spread over two years? Why should the tenant of a landlord who improves his property in the future be less able to bear the increase than the tenant of a landlord who has improved his property in the past? This sharp phasing over two years will apply to tenants who have their property


improved in the future. Why should the landlord who has improved his property in the past have to wait five years? What encouragement is there in this?<br/>
The Minister has said that it is impossible to maintain property on controlled rents, and yet he is arguing that landlords who have improved their property on controlled rents in the past should maintain them on controlled rents for a further period. This is illogical, unfair, and unjust.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, perhaps I might say that the hon. Gentleman has misinstructed himself. The distinction is not between controlled property brought into improvement, and controlled property already in improvement. This applies to registered regulated rents where the increases are less and they have been brought up before. It is not a distinction between two types of control.</p>

<p>I feel that I should start this short debate by an apology to you, Mr. Speaker, to the staff of the House and to the HANSARD reporters for keeping all of you here even for a few minutes more after so many middle watches were kept last night. I will in the circumstances be very brief indeed. Of course, it lies within the Joint Parliamentary Secretary's power to bring the proceedings to a halt within a moment by saying, "O.K. you can have your railway".<br/>
There is great concern about the future of the mid-Hants railway running from Alton to Winchester. Many people fear that the line is doomed anyway. There was a notice of closure in November, 1967, and they fear, from the run&#x2014;down state of the railway and the way in which the line is run&#x2014;I am not criticising the local staff&#x2014;that the decision seems already to have been taken. I wrote


recently to the Chairman of Southern Region&#x2014;
<q>&#x2026;the suspicion is voiced by many of my constituents that a decision in principle has already been taken and that the services have 'purposely' been badly run in order to produce bad statistics and to prove that the line is not a paying proposition &#x2026;I am not myself suggesting this machiavellian intent but &#x2026;I do feel that a fresh appreciation of the whole problem should be made &#x2026;</q>
Another factor which causes suspicion arises from a recent reply by the Minister to a Question from me: I asked him what estimate of the additional revenue he took into account in reaching his decision that a halt at Kings Worthy would not be a significant factor for the future of this railway line. The right hon. Gentleman replied:
<q>No detailed estimate is necessary to show that revenue from a halt at Kings Worthy could not he a significant factor in reaching a decision on the future of the line."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 24th March, 1969; Vol. 780, c. 212.]</q>
This is an extraordinary reply in the case of a suggested halt in a district whose population is growing much more quickly than in any other part of the area used by the railway. My first question to the hon. Gentleman, therefore, is whether he will look again with a completely fresh mind at this question of a new halt at Kings Worthy.<br/>
I am not urging the Minister to keep open a railway which is definitely substantially uneconomical in the long run. I am too good a Conservative to suggest any such thing. But my case is that the railway is viable and if run properly could be a profitable little line. In deploying a case of this sort, one has to produce some statistics. It is difficult to bring them into a short debate like this so I shall produce the minimum of figures to support my case.<br/>
The latest figures for this line, given to the Ministry by British Rail, are that the total running costs annually are &#x00A3;125,000, less an earnings figure of &#x00A3;29,000. British Rail deduces a deficit of &#x00A3;96,000&#x2014;a tremendous figure for a small line like this. But these figures are contested, both as to total costs and earnings, by the local authorities, headed by the Winchester Rural District Council, which has done some very useful and detailed research. I will give one or two quick examples of why the figures produced by British Rail are suspect.<br/>
British Rail has admitted that the figures are unduly high for some of the costs. The earnings figure is given as &#x00A3;29,000. This is very suspect&#x2014;indeed it appears to be outrageously wrong. British Rail claims that passenger traffic has reduced since the main Winchester line was electrified, but a local census taken by a rural district council official shows that passenger traffic on the small line has actually increased.<br/>
The number of passengers on this small line has increased since the much more convenient revised time-table has been introduced, and commuters can make the connection which suits them at Alton when outward bound or inward bound.<br/>
In arriving at the figures for earnings it seems almost incredible that British Railways have not included the proportion of income from through tickets bought further up or down the line. The R.D.C. believes that 60 per cent. of the total passenger traffic is through traffic and should therefore be included as contributory income.<br/>
To sum up the statistics, it seems that the figures on earnings should be much more like &#x00A3;36,000 of direct income and &#x00A3;50,000 is direct contributory income, making a total of &#x00A3;86,000, which is much more like a viable railway. There is in existence a copy of a confidential memorandum, for the railway staff, which gives the figure of &#x00A3;85,000 for contributory income alone, excluding direct income. Has the Minister seen that memorandum? It has been forwarded to his Ministry.<br/>
My third specific plea to the Minister is that, as the Ministry is responsible for providing accurate figures in deciding a case like this, the railway should not be closed down for financial reasons except on figures agreed by the local authorities. The local authorities are very much taken up with this problem.<br/>
I turn to a couple of much broader aspects of the future of the line which I hope the Minister will consider when making his decision. The area served by this railway has a population which is growing very rapidly. Many categories of travellers will be affected, not only in villages where there are stops or halts on the railway, but in the whole agricultural community spread over the large area served by the railway. Not only are stops


and halts in my constituency affected but also stations in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Petersfield (Miss Quennell) and Alton and Winchester itself.<br/>
There are some special features about the type of passengers who use this railway. In a letter which the county education officer wrote to the Ministry of Transport it was stated:
<q>The public transport situation has changed considerably since the proposed rail closure was brought forward for reconsideration about two years ago.</q>
<q>Throughout the county there are increasing difficulties in arranging for the conveyance of children to and from school. The bus companies are unable to maintain their full staffs for a variety of reasons of which no doubt the Minister is well aware. One local bus company near Winchester has recently been discontinued and the services which the company provided have not been taken over by the major public bus company &#x2026; whose resources are already fully extended. The education committee have with considerable difficulty been able to make alternative contract arrangements but the cost has been more than doubled.</q>
<q>The road transport industry is unable to convey at appropriate times the passengers who would be displaced if the rail services are withdrawn. It is believed that owing to the labour situation the education authority could provide special transport for these scholars only at a very high cost and additional public expenditure and not benefit other rail passengers who would be displaced.</q>
This is a very strong case, in broad and general terms, that the total cost to the public funds will be greater in respect of serving these schools.<br/>
On the subject of hardship, an inquiry was held by the transport users consultative committee. It was held in April this year in Alresford and the committee
<q>expressed the opinion that the closure would cause considerable hardship to travellers from in the period 1st April to 31st October, 1968. journeys over the line to Eastleigh or Southampton by reason of additional travelling time. They considered that the incidence of delays to buses arising from traffic congestion in the Winchester area would often aggravate this hardship, as well as causing inconvenience to local passengers to and from Winchester &#x2026;They also expressed the view that the developments envisaged in the South Hampshire Study, coupled with the need for road improvements in the Winchester area, made the closure proposal premature, and that based on such financial information as they had any financial gain would be outweighed by the hardship caused.</q>
Does the Minister recognise the hardship referred to in this report from which I have read extracts?<br/>
Alternative road communications are inadequate and are getting worse. A comparison of the bus timings shows that anyone wishing to travel from Alresford to Eastleigh can do so in 23 minutes by rail on the present timetable but it would take 102 minutes by two buses even if the buses were not delayed in Winchester traffic as they almost always are.<br/>
The fifth point which has a direct bearing on the future of the railway is that the congestion in Winchester, the natural capital of the area, where people who live beside this railway have to go for shopping and so forth is very bad indeed. I had a letter from the city clerk which emphasises how extremely serious this problem is and how much worse it is likely to become every year. Will the Minister write to the town clerk of Winchester and ask his views on the effect of the closure of this railway on parking, road access to and from Winchester and traffic congestion within Winchester? It would be right for the Minister to have a report from the city council about how this would affect the city.<br/>
There is a wider issue for the future. "Strategy for the South-East" the Government's overall plan, which is the latest of many plans for orderly development of the south-east of England, speaks of a huge so-called "Solent City" and envisages many growth points to the south of the countryside served by this railway. The map on page 36 of this Green Book, "Strategy for the South-East", shows the railway quite clearly as one of the transport arteries which served this vast conurbation we are expecting to see in the future. I feel strongly that people from the hinterland will want to get into this enormous Solent City daily for employment. That is inevitable. Equally important people will want to escape at weekends to country places to keep themselves healthy and sane.<br/>
It is not too much to say that if public expenditure must be made on maintaining this railway, it would be better spent on that than in providing additional new mental hospitals in the Solent City! I urge the Minister to take a long-term strategic view and not to be fobbed off in his Ministry by short-term financial considerations. This is a brief summary of what I feel about the future of this railway. I end with a quotation made


by the town clerk in a recent letter he sent to me:
<q>Anybody who signs away any item of public transport in this area will qualify for a grave in the close of Winchester Cathedral &#x2014;beside that of Ethelred the Unready.</q></p>

<p>I support most warmly everything that my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Winchester (Rear-Admiral Morgan Giles) has said. I will not recapitulate on his arguments, which were excellent. However, there is a certain oddity about this issue which has given rise to considerable public disquiet. If there was a case of the handling of an issue lending it a certain oddity, this must be a prime example.<br/>
When the Minister considers the application of British Railways, may I point out to him that there is one group of railway users which my hon. and gallant Friend did not mention. This group of people need the railway to get to their institutions of advanced education in Southampton. There is no other way in which they can get to Southampton from the Alton area in my constituency, Many scholars need the railway in order to undertake their daily schooling. Should the line be closed there would be no alternative means of transport for them. They would not be able to continue in the institutions in which they are studying.<br/>
It is not my intention to prolong the debate unnecessarily, although I believe that it is possible to go on until 10.30. Therefore, the Minister is fortunate that all the Hampshire Members have not seen fit to attend the debate. I urge the hon. Gentleman to take a very long look at the application of British Railways in respect of this line. I urge him to consider the figures which my hon. and gallant Friend advanced. I urge him to consider the various reports including "Strategy for the South-East", and the future development of this area and then consider what would be the consequences of the closure of this line.</p>

<p>I, too, am grateful that other Hampshire Members are perhaps

as tired as I am. Last evening I had to deal with two items under the Consolidated Fund Bill which were separated by eight hours. I am therefore grateful that not all the Hampshire Members are present.<br/>
I need hardly say that I have been aware for some time of the great interest which the hon. and gallant Member for Winchester (Rear-Admiral Morgan-Giles) has expressed in the proposal to withdraw all passenger services from the railway line between Alton and Winchester. That interest has been shared by several other Members and the speeches we have heard tonight cannot have failed to impress by their genuine and reasoned concern.<br/>
Under the relevant provisions of the Transport Act, 1962, it is the Minister who is responsible for deciding whether or not to give his consent to this closure proposal. As in all cases of this kind, the process of consultation and consideration is extremely lengthy and detailed and I should like to take this opportunity of emphasising the care which is devoted to the examination of these proposals and which accounts, in large measure for the time which has elapsed between publication and decision. I assure hon. Members that a decision has not yet been taken.<br/>
Apart from the voluminous information provided by the Railways Board at every stage of the inquiry, the Minister receives the advice of the Transport Users Consultative Committee on hardship matters, of the Regional Economic Planning Council on planning and development considerations, of other Departments of Government which have a special interest and of his own Divisional Road Engineer on road traffic and congestion. He also takes into account the views expressed by local authorities and other organisations and I would like to pay a special tribute, in this case, to the efforts made on behalf of present and potential users by the Winchester Rural District Council, representing the local authorities concerned in the case, to ensure that no relevant consideration is overlooked. All the information assembled in this way is subjected to the most careful analysis by the Department's administrators and economists before the decision is taken.<br/>
The Mid-Hants railway is a single track line about 17 miles long. It was shown as a "grey line", that is one not selected


for development as part of the basic system, in the Railways Network for Development Map which, it will be remembered, was published jointly by the Minister and the Railways in March, 1967. The closure proposal was published in December, 1967, and the Minister received the Transport Users Consultative Committee's report in August last year. The report concluded that closure would give rise to hardship due mainly to increased journey times and difficulties caused by road traffic congestion in the Winchester area if buses had to be used instead of trains. Five weekly counts of rail passenger usage had been taken between April, 1967, and June, 1968, at different seasons of the year, but at the Minister's request a further census was taken in October, 1968. These counts showed a general decline in usage after April, 1967. However, the latest tendency shown by single day counts in April this year is towards a return to April, 1967, levels.<br/>
We have given a good deal of thought to the question of whether buses would provide a satisfactory alternative to rail services. We are particularly aware of the problem posed by road congestion at peak hours in Winchester. We know, too, that routeing between Alresford and Winchester presents some difficulties. We have been told of recent changes in existing bus services in the Winchester area. We have discussed with the Department of Education and Science how schoolchildren, who account for about half of the regular daily users, could be catered for, possibly by contract bus services. Our conclusions on these matters will strongly influence the Minister's final decision and if he were to decide to give his consent to closure he would ensure that the necessary conditions were attached to his consent which would have to be complied with before the train service could be discontinued.<br/>
As announced last January, the Minister is paying an interim social grant for the maintenance of the present service on this line under Section 39(4) of the Transport Act, 1968. If the Minister were to decide that the service should be retained a grant of the order of about &#x00A3;90,000 a year would have to be paid under Section 39(1) of the Act. This would amount to a deficit of over 6d. a passenger mile. This figure is cal-

culated in accordance with the recommendations of the Joint Steering Group on the assumption that the line would be maintained in perpetuity, that full provision would be made for depreciation and renewals on a replacement cost basis and that provision would also be made for administration and interest. The estimated deficit is based on a revenue of about &#x00A3;30,000 which accords with the railways latest traffic figures, but is a good deal lower than figures of earnings quoted in the past.<br/>
The Minister cannot ignore the fact that this service is losing a considerable sum of money annually, that the deficit has to be met by the taxpayers and that because this 17 miles long track is already singled there is little scope for major economies.</p>

<p>Would the hon. Gentleman say whether the grant which is paid takes into account the contributory income to which I referred? The figure of about &#x00A3;30,000 for income which he has given obviously does not include the contributory income by "through" passengers.</p>

<p>We have some difficulty in convincing people about certain figures, but the fact is that on the figures of which I have spoken, the Government already pay the railways &#x00A3;90,000 a year.<br/>
I was discussing the question of providing alternative public transport, the extent to which road congestion in Winchester and Alton can be relieved by new roads and the possibility of some growth in the number of potential regular rail users in the area. These are all matters which in the last resort must be analysed and assessed by the Minister. But he is most anxious that the factual evidence on which his decision will be based is reliable and is seen to be reliable.<br/>
We have paid special attention to the information and the arguments brought to our attention by the local authorities acting on behalf of the users of this line. We are by no means convinced that they have made out a case for the retention of a passenger service on the basis of the facts which have so far been assembled. But we think that they have argued sufficiently strongly to justify our asking the Railways Board to carry


out new counts of users during typical summer and winter weeks. The Minister has also decided that when this new information is available he will ask the transport users' consultative committee for the South-Eastern area to make a further report to him on the proposal. The committee will, moreover, be able to take into account any revised proposals for alternative bus services and any change in circumstances such as the effect of new road improvements on the problem of traffic congestion in and around Winchester when compiling their report to the Minister.<br/>
I know that claims have been made that the census figures previously provided by the Railways Board are unreliable. I do not accept this, but I am most anxious that those concerned should have no cause for complaint even if their suspicions are unfounded. I intend therefore to ask the Board, when they carry out the new census this summer and during the winter, to invite the local authority to be associated with the passenger counts. I hope that this will make sure that whatever is the Minister's final decision there can be no dispute about the traffic figures on which it is based.<br/>
Since the Minister has decided to ask the T.U.C.C. for a fresh report, he also intends to ask the Board to review all the financial information which they have previously provided, taking into account whatever estimates of future usage may seem reasonable as a result of these further traffic counts.</p>

<p>When the Minister asks the Railways Board to provide further financial information will they do

so on the basis of Report No. 72 of the National Board for Prices and Incomes?</p>

<p>There is some confusion. The Railways Board were given authority under another report by the National Board for Prices and Incomes to charge commercially for their services &#x2014;in other words, to charge market prices for the services. Of course, they are looking to the future, not simply looking at a static position. They are looking at the question of increased traffic. If the loss-making is relatively small and a reasonable increase in fares is likely to counteract this loss or to bring it within a reasonable figure, then obviously, not only in this case but in all cases, that is considered. Hon. Members frequently say to me, "Will it not help if fares are increased?" Unfortunately, in a large number of cases&#x2014;I am not commenting on this case&#x2014;the increase in fares would need to be astronomical to make the service a going concern.<br/>
To sum up, we shall not reach a final decision until the Minister is entirely satisfied that he has full and accurate information on all aspects of the case. I hope that what I have said will assure the hon. and gallant Gentleman and his hon. Friend that all this information is being assembled and analysed, even at the cost of prolonging the time before a final decision can be reached. I am sure that that is the right thing to do and that, although perhaps it will take longer, we shall ultimately reach a decision of which we can say that at least everyone will be clear about the basis on which it has been reached.</p>
