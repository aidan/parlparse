<p>As I explained in the Debate on the Air Estimates on 17th March, and again in answer to a Question by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cardiff (Mr. Callaghan) on 24th April, there are two members of the Manpower Economy Committee who have first-hand experience in industry of personnel organisation and control&#x2014;Mr. A. A. M. Durrant, the Chief Mechanical Engineer of the London Passenger Transport Board, and Mr. E. W. Bussey, who represents the Trades Union Congress. The Committee was set up at the beginning of

<p>asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Aviation if he is aware that a Scottish Airlines Dakota aircraft, carrying 11 passengers, circled Prestwick airport 16 times before landing on Wednesday, 14th May, and that this was primarily due to the development of an oil-leak in the hydraulic pipeline system; if he has made an inquiry into the matter; and if he will make a statement.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. This incident was the result of a mechanical defect, which unfortunately occurred despite the rigid inspections and safety rules to which aircraft are subjected. The circuits of the airfield were necessary, in order that a visual check could be made from the ground to ensure that the undercarriage was safely down before the aircraft landed. I am satisfied that everything possible was done to safeguard both passengers and aircraft; and that all the necessary action was carried out in an exemplary fashion, with the result that the aircraft made a successful landing.</p>

<p>While I thank my hon. Friend for that answer, may I ask if he is fully aware that this danger always exists; and could he say what crash survivability there is in the air frame of the machine to prevent disaster in the event of forced landing in cases like this?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.167.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Lindgien" colnum="167" time="">
<p>So far as the last part of the question, is concerned, I doubt whether there is any question of crash survivability in the frame of an aircraft. What can be done is to reduce the possibility of accident as far as is possible. In so far as the actual incident is concerned, in this case it was a leak in the hydraulic system and it is one which is likely to occur, but which inspection generally shows up.</p>

<p>asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Aviation if he has analysed the first six accident reports issued since arrangements were made to make the reports available quickly to the public and listed as B.E.A.C., near Oslo, 7th August, 1946; Scottish Airways, at Northolt, 19th December, 1946; B.S.A.A., at Bathurst, 7th September, 1946; A.A. J.C., at Speke, 16th August, 1946; Scottish Airways, near Renfrew, 27th September, 1946; B.O.A.C., near Stowting, 11th January, 1947; and what action has been taken by his Department or the corporations concerned to eliminate the causes leading to these accidents, as these inquiries have established that in each case the airline organisations themselves were fundamentally responsible for the errors and omissions established in these reports.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. Reports on accidents naturally receive full and careful consideration as soon as they are received. As regards the second part of the Question, I must not be taken as

accepting the implication in the last sentence. In most accidents there are a great many contributory factors, and it is not possible within the limits of a Parliamentary reply to analyse the causes in these six cases or to give details of the action taken by the corporations and Ministry. It is, of course, the regular custom of the corporations and this Ministry immediately after the occurrence of any accident, or, I may add, any incident which might have been dangerous, to make a preliminary inquiry at once and any action which appears necessary to prevent a recurrence is taken without delay. Further action is, of course, taken as may be necessary as soon as the cause is determined.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend realise that in these accidents 43 people were killed, apart from those who were injured, and in one case, that of B.S.A.A. at Bathurst, the pilot was found to be inexperienced in the type of aircraft he was flying, having had only 3 hours, 52 minutes in command by day and r hour, 3 minutes by night, and had never done a full load take off in similar conditions? In another case, B.O.A.C. were blamed for bad crewing&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. My noble Friend took steps soon after he took office to have accident inquiries in public, and to have the reports published.

Claims must be lodged with the burgomaster of the community where the alleged irregular action occurred within three months of the incident, or before 1st October, 1947, whichever is the later. Except for certain minor cases which will be sent direct to the appropriate German authorities, all admissible claims will be forwarded by the burgomaster to the claims panel for determination of all questions of responsibility in accordance with German law.

<p>I assume that my hon. Friend is referring to a letter from Sir Alexander Cadogan, as Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, to Monsieur Romer, Foreign Minister in the Polish Government in London, dated 2nd November, 1944. This letter stated as regards Poland's western frontier that His Majesty's Government considered that Poland should have the right to extend her territory up to the line of the Oder, to include the port of Stettin. This letter, which was confidential, formed part of lengthy diplomatic discussions with the Soviet, Polish and United States Governments subsequently continued at the Crimea Conference and concluded in the Potsdam Agreement, by which the Polish Government undertook, pending the final delimitation of Poland's western frontier, the administration of territory beyond the Oder as far as the Western Neisse.

<p>The constitution of Fiji was amended in 1937 so as to increase Fijian and Indian representation and to give equal representation to the three communities while retaining an official majority of one. The overriding consideration must remain the obligation of His Majesty's Government to the Fijians. I cannot accept the suggestion that this change was or is contrary to the wishes of the majority of the people, particularly when much responsible European opinion and Fijian opinion is opposed now to any change in the constitution. I am aware that representations were made by the European Electors' Association in 1945 and again last year advocating measures for constitutional reform, including the creation of an unofficial majority in the Legislative Council, and the introduction of universal adult suffrage on a common roll, but these and other proposals were not accepted because neither my predecessor nor I considered that such changes would at present be of advantage to the community at large or would receive the general support of the Fijians. I have received a letter from the President of the Association reiterating their proposals and pressing for a plebiscite. I have invited the Acting Governor's comments on the letter. But in any case I must have regard to the special nature of Fijian society and the importance of securing political co-operation between the respective communities in Fiji. Local government changes are under consideration and the basis of qualification for representation in the respective communities will in due course receive attention. I am naturally anxious to promote the development of


democratic institutions in Fiji and only recently made a number of changes which I announced to the House on 2nd April, but in existing conditions I do not think that a plebiscite would provide a satisfactory method of ascertaining popular opinion on constitutional changes.</p>

<p>The Navy, like the other services, has now only one civilian clothing centre, that at Portsmouth.

<p>Yes, Sir. Sales of surplus Government small craft by the Admiralty were begun shortly after the war ended, and the conversion to houseboats was one of the uses suggested for minor landing craft. No direct undertaking was given that materials for conversion would be made available, but, until the beginning of this year, the Admiralty authorised the issue of timber for this purpose from the quantities allocated for merchant shipbuilding and ship repair. I regret, however, that recent reductions in the amount of timber available for shipbuilding and ship repair has since compelled the Admiralty to withhold

further issues for houseboats. Minor landing craft are still sold to individual applicants, but although no restriction is placed by the Admiralty on the use to which they are put, it is made clear to such purchasers that no supplies of timber or other materials for conversion can be made by the Admiralty.</p>

<p>The three steam reciprocating sets are uneconomical in steam consumption, and, in view of this, combined with their considerable age, they are retained only as a standby plant for use in an emergency when the turbo alternators are out of action. The boiler capacity does not permit of their concurrent use. In these circumstances, the total nominal output of the generating sets is restricted to the output available from the turbo alternators. The nominal maximum output for the station as a whole is, therefore, 14,550 kilowatts. The maximum effective output at the present time is less than this on account of the age of most of the plant and the lower grades of coal which have to be used. Allowance must also be made for plant undergoing repairs or overhaul. In addition to the above, there are two connections, one of 10,000 K.V.A. and the other of 5,000 K.V.A. between the electricity supply systems of the Plymouth Corporation and the Dockyard.</p>

<p>In Colonial territories United Kingdom Service personnel confined in civil prisons are, generally speaking, subject to the normal prison regulations which provide for periodical visits of inspection by the civil authorities. In India, the only Servicemen in civil prisons are those sentenced for certain major crimes; the conditions in these prisons are regularly inspected by the civil authorities and, from time to time, Servicemen serving sentences are recommended for transfer to this country to complete their sentences and are so transferred.

Prices for celery, whether it is grown here or imported, are not controlled.

<p>The postage rates on letters from the Forces in Singapore are fixed by the local administration which is now responsible for the postal service from the Forces in its territory. I understand that letters from the Forces in Singapore not exceeding one ounce in weight are despatched to the United Kingdom by air for 1&#x00BD;d. This is the air postage rate for letters of this weight from the Forces now in force in most areas overseas, and is much cheaper that the rates charged on similar letters from civilians. The Singapore administration requires payment at the ordinary postage rates on all letters dispatched by surface means.</p>

<p>asked the Postmaster-General whether he is aware that the sending of food parcels to individuals from Australia is being discouraged by the high postage charges which often exceed the value of the contents, and by the delay in their distribution after arrival; and if he will consider taking steps to remedy this state of affairs.</p>

<p>I am aware that the justification for the present postage rates on gift food parcels sent from Australia to this country has been questioned in Australia. I can assure the hon. and gallant Member that that portion of the postage paid in Australia which, by agreement between the two administrations, is credited to the United Kingdom for conveyance, handling and delivery in this country, does not fully cover the costs incurred by the British Post Office. The possibility of making a concession by the British Post Office foregoing some part of its share of the postage has recently been reviewed, and I am satisfied that I should not be justified in making any concession for this section of the traffic. I am not aware that any undue delay in delivery occurs after receipt in the United Kingdom, but it is inevitable that some

few days must be occupied in passing this very heavy volume of traffic, which arrives at irregular intervals, through the Postal Customs depots. I should be happy to investigate any specific case of delay if the hon. and gallant Member will let me have full particulars.</p>

<p>At the request of the New Zealand Government, negotiations have recently taken place on this subject. The original basis of the negotiations was the conclusion of agreements similar to those made with Australia whereby the United Kingdom Government would provide free passages for former members of the United Kingdom Forces and would share with the Dominion Government the cost of passages for other categories of migrants, less a proportion to be borne by the migrants themselves. In the course of the discussions, however, the New Zealand Government intimated that, in present conditions, they were willing to find all governmental contributions in respect of passages for both categories. They accordingly offered to meet the full cost of passages in the case of ex-Service migrants and the full cost less &#x00A3;10 to be paid by the migrants themselves in other cases. The United Kingdom Government gratefully accepted this generous offer.<br/>
The New Zealand Government have now announced their intention of opening schemes on the above basis. For the time


being, the schemes will generally be limited to men and women between the ages of 20 and 35 who are either single or widowed and without dependent children and are willing to engage for a period of two years in certain selected occupations. Full particulars as to the schemes, including the date of their opening and the types of migrants desired, will be announced in due course by the New Zealand authorities. The House will, I am sure, be glad to know that these arrangements have been made, and will welcome the very liberal attitude

which the New Zealand Government have adopted.</p>

<p>I am rather surprised at that, if I may respectfully say so, Mr. Speaker, because I thought it was the normal course, when one is advised, as we were, that an Amendment put down on Report stage would require a recommittal if it was to be discussed. For that reason we had to put down this Amendment last night, for which I apologise to the House. It was purely technical advice which we received only at the last moment.

<p>I have told the right hon. and gallant Gentleman that I have given the matter considerable thought. The plain fact of the matter is, if I selected this Amendment to the recommittal Motion it would be, to some extent, giving the Amendments there referred to, my approval, and it would be very harsh to


the Chairman of Ways and Means, because it would mean I had already said to the House: "These are Amendments which can be selected." I did not think that would be fair on him. I tell the House quite frankly, had they been normal Amendments on Report I should not have selected them in any case. The Amendment in Clause 1, page 1, line 7, would not have been taken anyhow; the Amendment in Clause 1, page 1, line 10, had a whole day in Committee; the Amendment in Clause 12, page 9, line 37, is exactly the same, and was disposed of in Committee after some debate; the Amendment in Clause 15, page 12, line 39, is partly met by a Government Amendment; the Amendment in Clause 23, page 24, line 3, is exactly the same as an Amendment put down and disposed of in Committee; the Amendment in Clause 81, page 65, line 29, was also dealt with in Committee; the last Amendment, in Clause 100, page 81, line 13, is, I am sorry to say, out of Order on Report of the Committee in any case, because it deals with matters outside the Money Resolution. As I say, I gave the matter a lot of thought, and came to the conclusion that I had better not select the Amendment about which the right hon. and gallant Gentleman has asked me.</p>

<p>I am very much obliged to you, Mr. Speaker, for your kindness in giving us these reasons. I appreciate the point you make, that if the House accepted this Amendment to the recommittal Motion, then in your view the Chairman of Ways and Means in Committee would be more or less morally bound to select the Amendments to which you have referred. Of course, that is not a matter upon which I can make any comment because obviously I do not know what would be in the mind of the Chairman, or whether he would or would not take that view. I do, however, appreciate the point. On the other hand, when you kindly pointed out that you would not yourself have selected any of these Amendments&#x2014;had they been in Order on Report, without a recommittal Motion&#x2014;largely, unless I misheard you, on the ground that they had been discussed considerably in Standing Committee, then I respectfully put to you that the whole object of the Report stage, surely, is that major points of importance, even if they

had been discussed in Standing. Committee for three or four days, should have the opportunity of coming before the whole House, whereby 640 Members will have a chance of expressing their views as opposed to such of the 50 Members as are able to attend the Standing Committee from time to time.<br/>
I do not know whether we are to deduce from that, that if any matter is discussed at any length in Standing Committee&#x2014;however important the matter may be&#x2014;it will not be rediscussed in the House on reconsideration. If that line is to be taken in future, it seems to me that we must consider whether we ought ever to put down any important Amendment in Standing Committee at all, but should not rather reserve our attack on the Government on major issues until the Report stage, when we can at least appeal to the larger body of Members. I put it to you, Sir, as the defender of the privileges of the minority, it would be a very difficult Ruling for us to accept for all time, that because matters have been discussed at length in Standing Committee&#x2014;even if they are important, and even if, as in the case of one of these Amendments, they come before the House at this stage, as the Minister knows, with the full support of two, if not three, partners in the industry&#x2014;they are not to be discussed at this stage. We are very disappointed.</p>

<p>It does not necessarily follow, because an Amendment has been debated at length in Standing Committee, that I will or will not select it.

<p>I beg to move, in page 12, line 44, at the end, to insert:
<q>The references in this and the next following Subsection to the provision of fixed equipment include references to any improvement of fixed equipment by the enlargement of buildings.</q>
This Amendment is one of very many, indicating that we were not only willing to listen, but, when we found that an improvement could be made, were ready and willing to make that improvement. The purpose of this Amendment is to extend the class of cases in which landowners may appeal to the land tribunal against a direction under Subsection (2). At present the owner is given a right of appeal in cases of directions to provide fixed equipment. Hon. Members will recall that a good deal of discussion took place in Committee on the question of improvements to fixed equipment. It was argued lengthily, and sometimes learnedly, that it was difficult to decide between the provision of new equipment and the improvement of existing equipment. The effect of this Amendment is to confer the right of appeal on an owner against a direction requiring the improvement of fixed equipment which involves the enlargement of

buildings. I think that this Amendment covers one of the more important Amendments which the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Gainsborough (Captain Crookshank) was unable to move, and I hope that it will satisfy his needs. A good deal of discussion took place in Committee on an Amendment to provide an appeal in all cases of directions in respect of improvements to fixed equipment. The Amendment was lost on a Division because it obviously went too far. Hon. Members will appreciate that many improvements are a very minor matter, and that a good number of improvements consist of modernising existing fixed equipment, which should clearly be financed by landowners in the same way as maintenance and repair. In the light of the arguments advanced in Committee, I feel that the enlargement of buildings is equivalent to the provision of fixed equipment, and it would be reasonable to allow an owner a right of appeal in such cases.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.212.0" hansard_membership_id="3630" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31268" speakername="Major Sir Thomas Dugdale" colnum="212" time="">
<p>This Amendment is certainly an advance on what we had in Committee, and my hon. Friends are grateful to the Minister for it. It does not go the whole way as far as we are concerned, because it leaves out two very important points. Money spent on improvements of any sort is capital as distinct from revenue expenditure. This money has often to be borrowed, and it may entail a mortgage on the property. The Minister will appreciate that in that case it is capital expenditure. In the case of maintenance an owner assumes a certain responsibility towards the tenant, but he rarely assumes or is expected to assume any contractual responsibility to finance capital expenditure on improvements. In our view, all forms of capital expenditure should be subject to special treatment. The Amendment should go further than dealing merely with the enlargement of buildings. The most common form of improvement consists, not in enlargement, but in conversion. For instance, it may be the conversion of coverage for feeding cattle to the use of milk production. In other words, it is a question of a change of use in respect of farm buildings already in existence.<br/>
As I understand it, this class of improvement is excluded from the provisions


of this Clause. These improvements involve a very large cost to the owner anxious to improve his buildings, but in some cases he may be unable to do it, owing to the financial position. It is in these cases that we feel there should be an appeal to the tribunal. We cannot expect the Government to go the whole way in this matter, and we are grateful to the Minister for what he has seen fit to do. We hope that, before the Bill reaches the Statute Book, he will consider the points I have made in regard to major improvements to buildings, and will not restrict the Clause to the buildings themselves.</p>

<p>As the mover of the Amendment in Committee, I add my word of thanks to the Minister for having gone so far towards meeting us in this matter. Having said so much, may I add that I do not think he has gone quite as far as he seems to indicate by his hope that all large works are included in the words "enlargement of buildings." If a farmer is expected to add a small dairy to an existing set of buildings, then that will come within the scope of the Amendment. On the other hand, if it is a question of rebuilding or reconstructing a range of existing cowsheds, which may cost infinitely more, that will not come within the purview of this Amendment. Since the Minister has said that large works shall be included and trivial works shall be excluded, I should like to say that I am disappointed that he did not find a better form of worth for what I deem to be his intentions.</p>

<p>I appreciate the purpose of this Amendment, but perhaps the Solicitor-General can say something in regard to the wording. It seems to me that under this wording an improvement cannot be considered an improvement unless it means an enlargement. In other words, something must be made bigger, before it can be considered as an improvement. It often happens that improvements in the accepted sense, can be achieved by making something smaller, or by using a building for two or three purposes where formerly it was used only for one. Am I to understand that whatever is done will not be an improvement unless, simultaneously, there is enlargement? If that is what is meant, although we are glad to see the Minister moving in the direction we urged during Committee, this does not

seem a very happy solution to the problem.</p>

<p>The right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Gains-borough (Captain Crookshank) is missing the point. A direction is given by a county executive committee for the provision of new fixed equipment, or for the improvement of existing fixed equipment. I cannot conceive a county executive committee giving a direction to a landowner to reduce a building&#x2014;that is almost incredible. So long as we cover enlargement of buildings with the provision of new equipment, hon. Members are bound to agree that we shall cover most cases of heavy expenditure. It is simply a question of whether or not an owner who has been given a direction by a county executive committee shall be allowed an appeal to the tribunal. I think, therefore, that I have gone reasonably well along the way to meet as much as hon. Members opposite expected. I hope they will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>Am I right in understanding that buildings, in this sense, include farmhouses as well as agricultural buildings? It is not clear whether fixed equipment means a dwelling house as well as a farm building, and it is important that we should know whether that is so, because in many cases it is desirable that farmhouses should be included.</p>

<p>The definition of "fixed equipment" includes any building or structure affixed on the land. I should have thought that a farmhouse was a building or structure affixed on the land. The Clause defines an agricultural unit as a unit together with any dwelling house. A farmhouse is part of the agricultural unit, but is not fixed equipment although it is a building.</p>

<p>Then the point raised by the right hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Gainsborougb (Captain Crookshank), about improvements being

<p>Does the Minister not think that this Amendment will get us into some trouble? I can visualise a case in which a direction is given for the building of 30 new cow-stalls. Ten may be built from completely new material; 10 may be added as an extension to the existing cowhouses, but the other 10 may be made out of improvements to the old cowhouses. Those to be built separately, and those made by the extension, will be included, but those coming from the improvements to the old cowhouses will not be included. It would be better if the Minister included all expenditure which is not allowed under the ordinary maintenance claim.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 31, line 30, at the end, to insert:
<q>(<i>e</i>) for excluding the application of Subsection (1) of this Section in relation to sub-tenancies in such cases as may be prescribed, and for making such provision as appears to the Minister expedient for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of sub-tenants, including provision enabling the Minister or the Agricultural Land Tribunal, where the interest of a tenant is terminated by notice to quit, to secure that a sub-tenant will hold from the landlord on the like terms as he held from the tenant.</q>
This Clause provides that notices to quit, given in respect of agricultural holdings, shall not have effect, except in certain cases, where they are disputed by the tenant. As the Clause is at present drafted, it does not contain very adequate provision as to what is to happen to the sub-tenant. The Clause deals with the position where the freeholder gives notice to his tenant, and the tenant disputes it. In the event of a dispute the Minister, or the tribunal, will have to decide between them. That is in the case of all notices to quit, except in the exempted cases referred to in Subsection (2). On further examination of the Clause, it has become apparent that there may be curious

anomalies arising out of the position of sub-tenants.<br/>
I will give the Committee some examples. Supposing the landlord, the freeholder, gives a notice to a tenant having himself obtained planning permission to use the holding for non-agricultural work, with the result that his notice to quit would be excluded from the operation of the Clause by virtue of Subsection (2, <i>c</i>). The notice, in those circumstances, would be effective against the tenant. But supposing the tenant had let to a sub-tenant who was in occupation of the holding, the question would arise whether the subtenant could be given notice, and compelled to leave the holding. As the Clause is at present drafted, this situation might well arise. The tenant, having been given notice by the landlord, when he in turn came to give notice to his sub-tenant, the sub-tenant would be entitled to dispute the notice under the terms of Clause 30, and the tenant could not possibly get the sub-tenant out, because the tenant could not say that he himself came within the provisions of Subsection (2, <i>c</i>). He would not be able to show that he wanted to use the agricultural holding for the non-agricultural purposes for which planning permission had been granted. The position would result that notice against the tenant would be effective, but notice against the subtenant would be ineffective.<br/>
A similar situation might arise in a hardship case. The freeholder with a strong hardship case might give notice to the tenant. The tenant might dispute it, but not have hardship grounds himself to dispute it successfully. But when that tenant, having let to a sub-tenant, came to give notice to the sub-tenant in order to get him out, he would not be able to do so because the sub-tenant might be able to say, against the tenant, that it would involve greater hardship to him if he were evicted, than it would to the tenant. There, again, you would have a case where the notice would be good against the tenant, but not against the sub-tenant.<br/>
In order to protect the interest of the sub-tenant this situation should be considered. The landlord, the freeholder, gives notice to the tenant. The tenant disputes the notice. Justice would seem to require that inasmuch as the notice might result in the sub-tenant having to


go, the sub-tenant should be given a voice on whether the freeholders' notice to the tenant was good or bad. There is another case which requires some provision and that is where a freeholder gives notice to the tenant, but the tenant is not interested, is not concerned to dispute that notice, and does not take any of the necessary steps. It might well be that the subtenant would be very anxious indeed to dispute that notice. In those circumstances, it would be unfair to compel the tenant to dispute it, because the tenant might be content to leave the holding. Justice seems to require, in that case, that the sub-tenant should be entitled to say to the Minister or the tribunal, "Put me in the shoes of the tenant, and let me dispute.the notice which has been served on the tenant."<br/>
Those are several alternative sets of circumstances which I give as examples to satisfy the Committee that some sort of further provision is necessary for, the purpose of protecting, in one case, the landlord and, in another case, the tenant. I hope that from what I have said it will be apparent that the circumstances which may arise would be of extreme complication. The way in which we have sought to deal with this is to ask for powers to make regulations. We could, of course, have sought to introduce into the Bill a Clause which would have been extraordinarily long and elaborate. I would add in support of that assertion that the question of deliberate evasion also arises. To frame a Clause which would not only deal with the circumstances which I have adumbrated, but also be effective against any possible attempt at evasion would result in one of those extremely long Clauses which one sometimes sees in the Income Tax Acts, running into several pages. I hope that the Committee will think that we have taken the proper course in asking for powers to make regulations to deal with these circumstances. I would remind the Committee that the regulation-making power is limited to the case of sub-tenants, and as time goes on, if we do not want the regulations which we first thought would be required, we shall be able to modify, abandon or cancel them. In order to meet the needs which I have described, we are asking for powers to make the regulations with the object set out in the Amendment, and I hope that the Committee will think that is the proper course.</p>

<p>I did not fully comprehend how far this Amendment takes us. I should like to be assured by the learned Solicitor-General that the making of regulations will not include the regularisation of irregular sub-tenants. As the Minister is aware, a large number of tenancy agreements contain clauses prohibiting sub-tenants without the approval of the landlord, and it may be that regulations made under this Amendment would have the effect of regularising any subtenancy.</p>

<p>While I think we agree that on the whole, this proposal improves the Clause, I do not think the statement of the learned Solicitor-General should be allowed to pass unchallenged, that a Clause to deal on this matter effectively would have been of inordinate length. This Clause, as it stands covers two and a half pages of the Bill. I think that it is hardly open to question that when we are legislating, as we are here, for a considerable period of time, the length of the Clause scarcely matters at all, provided the object is achieved. The Government when they first drafted the Bill should have drawn the Clause, whatever its length, so as to meet the purposes they had in mind. This is my main point. They failed to do that, because the burden on Parliamentary draftsmen at this time has become quite intolerable, and the surfeit of legislation, which we in this House find hard enough, bears even more hardly on those servants of the State whose task it is to draft these Parliamentary Bills. Had they a lesser burden, they would have done their job properly, and the excuse of the hon. and learned Gentleman would not have been necessary. I think that I express the view of all on these benches in saying that this Amendment is a slight improvement, and that we are prepared to accept it for what it is worth.</p>

<p>The learned Solicitor-General has explained the complicated nature of this Amendment. We all desire to see the position of subtenants and tenants and the position of landlords amply safeguarded, but I think


that the question which the hon. Member for Ripon (Mr. York) has put, regarding the possible regularisation of the irregular sub-tenant by the insertion of these words, deserves an answer from the hon. and learned Gentleman. I do not think that there are many cases&#x2014;I speak with knowledge of Scottish agriculture only&#x2014;in which sub-tenants are very much in vogue, but no doubt the hon. Member for Ripon, who represents an important agricultural area in Yorkshire has some special cases in mind. Speaking for Scotland may I say there are cases where arrangements of an irregular character have been entered into in the past between Owners and tenants-in-chief regarding leases or tenancies, and there have as a result been serious disputes, often involving litigation. I am speaking only of leases between landlords and what I describe for want of a better definition as tenants-in-chief. How much more desirable it would be that there should be no element of doubt whatever as between tenants and sub-tenants whom have&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is clearly laid down that the part of the Bill under consideration shall apply to Scotland and Northern Ireland, otherwise I should not have intervened. I want to impress on the Solicitor-General that he should try to give a fairly detailed answer to the question which has been put. I am against sub-tenants in agriculture, as I am against sub-tenants of most kinds, but we all know that sometimes there is inserted a clause in an original lease which says that the landlord's assent should not be unreasonably withheld, and the question of the acceptance of sub-tenants may arise.

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
Yesterday, on the Industrial Organisation Bill, I did what I believe the baseball players call a piece of "pinch hitting" for my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade, who was regrettably absent through indisposition. I should like to say how much I regret that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture is also unable to be here this afternoon owing to a serious illness, and, if I may be allowed to continue my metaphor for a moment without any disrespect for the Committee, I hope that in this game my amateur status may give me a little indulgence.<br/>
The purpose of this new Clause is to deal with a point arising out of the discussion in Committee on the certificate of bad husbandry

procedure contained in the Fifth Schedule. The Schedule provides that where a tenant farmer has been placed under supervision, the landlord should not be able to apply for a certificate of bad husbandry. The reason for this is, of course, that if an application for a certificate of bad husbandry were to be allowed in respect of a tenant under supervision, it would automatically have to be granted, as a farmer can be placed under supervision only if he is not farming in accordance with the rules of good husbandry. It would however be a mistake to grant a certificate of bad husbandry while a farmer was under supervision; the purpose of supervision, after all, is to give a man a helping hand so as to enable him to improve his standard of farming. However, while a tenant is still under supervision, it is perfectly open to the landlord to go to the committee and make representations to them to the effect that the tenant has not shown satisfactory improvement in his standard of farming, and therefore ought to be dispossessed. If the committee agree with that view and dispossess the tenant, he will quit the holding without compensation for disturbance in exactly the same way as he would have done if a certificate of bad husbandry had been applied for and granted. Moreover, the time will be the same in each case, since the notice to quit with a certificate of bad husbandry must run for at least 12 months, while a supervision order must equally run for a period of 12 months before a tenant can be dispossessed.<br/>
As the Bill is drafted however there is one material difference between the two procedures. Under the certificate of bad husbandry procedure, if a landlord's application for a certificate is refused he can appeal to the agricultural land tribunal. Under the supervision procedure, if the landlord's request that his tenant should be dispossessed is refused, he has no right of appeal to the tribunal. The purpose of this Clause, therefore, is to eliminate this difference between the two procedures and provide that where a tenant is under supervision and the landlord makes a request that he should be dispossessed on the ground that he has not shown satisfactory improvement, and this request is not accepted by the committee, the landlord should have a right of appeal to the agricultural land tribunal. The question which the tribunal will have


to consider will be whether, during the period of supervision, the tenant has not shown satisfactory improvement and whether, in all the circumstances of the case, he ought to be dispossessed.<br/>
Clearly, the landlord cannot be allowed to ask for a tenant's dispossession except at periodical intervals, and the Clause, therefore, provides that the landlord may only make such a request on the occasion of each annual review of a supervision order. The result of this change in procedure will be that the landlord will have exactly the same right to get rid of a tenant under supervision without the payment of compensation for disturbance as he would,have had under the certificate of bad husbandry procedure in respect of a tenant not under supervision. The only difference will be a matter of the machinery which the landlord will use. Therefore, we feel that we have definitely met the criticism that the result of placing the tenant under supervision is to take the whole question of getting rid of him completely out of the landlord's hand. The landlord will have his remedy of requesting dispossession in exactly the same way as he would have had the remedy under the certificate of bad husbandry procedure if a tenant was not under supervision.<br/>
If the landlord is given the right to ask for the dispossession of a tenant under supervision, it is clearly necessary, and only logical, that a tenant whose landlord is under supervision ought to have the same right. The Clause, therefore, provides that where an owner of land is under supervision his tenant has the right to request the committee to dispossess the owner on the ground that he has not shown satisfactory improvement in his management during the period of supervision. If the committee do not accept the request, the tenant is given a right of appeal to the agricultural land tribunal in the same way as the landlord has been given a right of appeal. I hope that with this brief explanation the Committee will feel that the point raised in the previous discussion has been adequately met, and will agree to insert this new Clause in the Bill.</p>

<p>I wanted to mention one point which I made on the Fifth Schedule, of which this new Clause has largely taken the place and which the Minister said he would look at again. The Minister does not seem to have done so. I am concerned about Subsections (3) and (4) of this new Clause. I feel it is a mistake to put into legislation this form of procedure. Subsection (3) says:
<q>If the Minister proposes to refuse such a request he shall give notice in writing of his proposal to the owner and to the occupier.</q>
That is all right, but Subsection (4) says:
<q>If &#x2026; no notice has been given &#x2026; of a proposal to refuse the request &#x2026; the Minister shall be deemed to have given notice of his proposal to refuse the request.</q>
I do not see why he should be deemed to have done it. He should either do it or not do it, and we ought not to give this slipshod sort of power to the Minister, so that if the time expires and nothing has been done, he shall be deemed to have taken action which he could have taken and ought to have taken if he had acted up to the earlier part of the Clause. The Minister said he did not like that kind of thing and would look at it again, but he has not made the necessary correction.</p>

<p>I think that my right hon. Friend, in saying that he would look at this again, also said that he had every intention of doing what is suggested here, namely notifying the occupier in writing.

<p>Yes, but not by being deemed to have done something which he has not done. If he has to safeguard his position in respect of a mistake made by an official of his Department or by himself, there ought to be a regular procedure under the law as to what happens when people do not carry out their jobs. Certainly they should not be deemed to have carried them out if they have not done so.</p>

<p>Under Subsection (2) of this new Clause:
<q>Where such a request is made the Minister shall not comply therewith unless he is


satisfied that the management or farming, as the case may be, has not shown satisfactory improvement while the supervision order has been in force,</q>
&#x2014;so that a satisfactory improvement has to be made before the Minister entertains a request. It goes on:
<q>but save as aforesaid may, subject to the provisions of this section, either comply with or refuse the request.</q>
If there has been improvement during the period, such a request cannot then be entertained by the Minister. There is the situation where a notice is in force and no improvement has taken place. In those circumstances it can be entertained by the Minister, and under the Subsection if the Minister proposes to refuse such a request it shall be done in writing. It is an odd position if where it is established that there is no improvement at all during the tenure of the notice it is still permissible for the Minister to refuse the notice. Where there is no improvement and there is negligence during the period, why not enforce the order at once?</p>

<p>I think the hon. and learned Member has got this all wrong. If a tenant farmer be under a supervision order and if he has made no progress or improvement, clearly the Minister would be justified in receiving representations from the landowner, but if the person under supervision is making some improvement and is responding to the advice, guidance and leadership, then clearly a certificate of bad husbandry ought not to be granted. It seems on the face of it that it is contradictory, but, in fact, it is not so.</p>

<p>I see one small difficulty at which I wish the Minister would look. Where there is a notice of a proposal to refuse such a request, it follows automatically that the proposal shall be referred to the agricultural land tribunal.

<p>Is not this new Clause, in fact, an intermediary stage between Clause 12, which is supervision, and Clauses 16 and 17 which deal with dispossession? In other words, is it not going half way towards an appeal to the agricultural land tribunal so much desired

by Members on this side of the Committee? The point I want to make is, if a man is put under supervision under Clause 12, then if either the landlord or the tenant feel that their opposite number is not making sufficient progress, he should be dispossessed. In other words, either can apply to the Minister, and if the Minister takes the same view and agrees, the landlord or the tenant can apply to the agricultural land tribunal to have the matter finally settled. That takes place before Clauses 16 and 17 operate.</p>

<p>I am rather sorry for this confusion, because I thought my hon. Friend the Paymaster-General was clarity personified in his explanation, despite the remarks of the hon. Member for Denbigh (Sir H. Morris-Jones). In Committee it was suggested by hon. Members opposite that a person under supervision has apparently not farmed up to a reasonable standard, otherwise he could not be under supervision. It was urged, therefore, that the landowner ought to be allowed to apply for a certificate of bad husbandry and get rid of his tenant without compensation. Our submission was, of course, that a person was under supervision because the county executive committee were trying to help him to improve his standard, and it would, therefore, be unreasonable to allow a certificate of bad husbandry to be granted at that time. However, as a result of consultations since the Committee stage, we have devised ways and means of doing what we regard as justice both to the landlord and the tenant. We have completely conceded the point made by hon. Members opposite who now seem to be engaged in the difficulty of explaining away the concession we have actually made.</p>

<p>Can the right hon. Gentleman explain the implications of Subsection (4) of the new Clause? I understand Subsection (3) which lays down that if the Minister proposes to refuse a request a notice in writing will have to be given, but I am still not at all clear as to the object of this extraordinary phrase in Subsection (4) that in default of any decision either way:
<q>the Minister shall be deemed to have given notice of his proposal to refuse the request.</q></p>

<p>Before the Minister answers that point, might I take it a little-further and ask him


to include in his reply some reference to the first line of Subsection (4) of the proposed Clause, where it says:
<q>If before the expiration of the prescribed period from the making of such a request &#x2026;</q>
I have not had the advantage of participating in these proceedings upstairs and I would be grateful if the Minister would say a word on the prescribed period as envisaged in this Subsection. The interpretation Clause refers to the prescribed period and says:
<q>'Prescribed' has are meaning assigned to it by the last foregoing Sections.</q>
The last foregoing Section is Clause 106, and Subsection (2) says:
<q>In this Act the expression 'prescribed' means prescribed by regulations made by the Minister.</q>
Might I ask the Minister about the regulations which are to be made in regard to the fixing of the prescribed period? Will the prescribed period be the standard prescribed period in all cases, or will it be a variable prescribed period? Further, if there is to be a prescribed period in this way, then surely it adds force to the contention already made by my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Captain Crookshank) in regard to the unsatisfactory provision as to the notice being deemed to have been given. Surely the Minister will agree that if he is making the regulation to prescribe a period, the matter must be present within the minds of his Department, and it should not be necessary to incorporate this astonishing phraseology into an Act of Parliament to cover possible slips in a Government Department. I will put one further point, which is in regard to Sub section (3) of the new Clause as to the notice in writing of the Minister's proposal to refuse. Is that notice of refusal a formal thing, or will it be accompanied by a reasoned statement as to why he has come to this decision?</p>

<p>The notice, I understand, will be merely a notice that the Minister has either refused the request or otherwise. I do not see why there should be any lengthy and detailed explanation as to why the Minister has reached that decision. With regard to the other point, about the expiration of the prescribed period, it seems to me quite dear that the hon. Member for Hertford (Mr. Walker-

Smith) destroyed his own case because if a period is prescribed under Clause 106&#x2014;it may be a month or two months or a week or two weeks&#x2014;it will be prescribed, but the time period will vary according to the circumstances in differing cases. If, therefore, a prescribed period is known and the Minister by that time has not given his assent, the last two lines of Subsection (4) indicate that he shall be deemed to have given notice of his proposal to refuse the request. At the end of the prescribed period&#x2014;say a month&#x2014;if the Minister has not accepted or has, in fact, done nothing, it is made clear that he has refused, and therefore there cannot be any doubt about the matter.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
In Committee there was a good deal of criticism of the inclusion of county boroughs as smallholding authorities under Clause 45. It was pointed out that many county boroughs, although primarily urban, had really no agricultural land within their boundaries, and following the discussion at that time I promised to look into the matter between then and the Report stage. The purpose of this new Clause is to deal with that point. Its effect will be that county boroughs will not automatically become smallholding authorities for the purposes of Part IV of this Bill. Any county borough will, however, be able to apply to the Minister to become a smallholding authority, and the Minister will have power on such application to direct that a county borough council shall become a smallholding authority for the purposes of Part IV. When such a direction is given, the county borough council will have exactly the same powers as any county council under the terms of the Bill. The Minister can also revoke such a direction, either on his own initiative or on that of the county borough council concerned.<br/>
In view of this change it is clearly necessary to deal with the case of county borough councils which already hold land for smallholding purposes, or which be-tome smallholding authorities and acquire land, and subsequently, as the result of a revocation of a direction, cease to be a smallholding authority. Arrangements must be made to meet that situation. The

effect of Subsections (3) and (4) of the new Clause is that where a county borough council hold land for smallholding purposes they will continue to have all the necessary functions, powers and duties under Part IV of the Bill in relation to that particular land. They will not, however, have power to acquire additional land except after a direction made by the Minister. This new Clause, I repeat, is intended to meet the point raised by hon. Members in Committee. Also for their satisfaction I would say that it has been discussed and agreed by the Association of Municipal Corporations and the County Councils Association. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will accept it.</p>

<p>I think the Minister has gone a long way towards meeting the objections we raised from this side, but the point we made in Committee, and which should be made again here, is that the amount of land available in the whole country is limited, and that any allocation of smallholdings in county areas will cause a good deal of trouble. If the allocation is in any way overweighted by the demands of borough councils to whom the Minister gives permission, that will inevitably take away from the total area available in those parts of the country where agricultural workers are far more numerous. I want to enter that caveat because I feel that large-scale demands will upset the balance of the whole scheme, making land available for agricultural workers in county areas and, to that extent, making fewer smallholdings available for agricultural workers outside the county boroughs.</p>

<p>I am certain that hon. Members on this side of the Committee will be grateful to the Minister for having introduced this new Clause because we do not want to upset any existing arrangement where the county councils have smallholdings. On the other hand we do not wait to enforce them to provide them where that is impracticable. There are some words in Subsection (5, <i>a</i>) which I do not quite understand, and I should be grateful if the Minister will explain them. It is quite obvious today that allotments are a very important factor in producing food, and allotment holders are crying out for security of tenure. They also need loans to help produce the food, and protection against the Town and Country Planning Bill. Subsection (5, <i>a</i>) says that


agricultural matters may be referred to the Smallholdings Committee. It goes on to say that in connection with allotments:
<q>those matters shall not be referred to the smallholdings committee unless a sub-committee of the smallholdings committee is constituted.</q>
It appears to me, therefore, that matters concerning allotments may not be referred to this sub-committee unless there is a special sub-committee of the sub-committee itself to deal with allotments. Surely, allotment problems must come under discussion from time to time by county councils, and it seems that they should be allowed to put their problems before the sub-committee irrespective of whether or not there is a special subcommittee to deal with allotments. I would ask the Minister for some explanation on this point.</p>

<p>I beg to move "That the Clause be read a Second time."<br/>
Its object, roughly speaking, is as follows. Hon. Members will remember that Clauses 36 and 37 of the Bill have the effect that in certain circumstances the liability to repair and maintain fixed equipment can be transferred from the landlord to the tenant or vice versa from the tenant to the landlord. During the discussion of these two Clauses in Committee it was pointed out that apparently the effect of that would be that in the event of such a transfer, and of the landlord or the tenant, as the case might be, committing a breach of his obligations before the transfer, the parties would have to wait until the termination of the tenancy before damages could be claimed


for that breach. It was further pointed out that that was unsatisfactory, and the argument was adduced that supposing, in the event of such a transfer taking place, it became apparent that the landlord or the tenant had committed a breach of his obligation to repaid and maintain fixed equipment, it should be possible there and then for the wronged party to claim damages or compensation for that breach.<br/>
What this new Clause seeks to do is to bring that about. If they will look at it more closely, hon. Members will see that Subsection (1) provides that in the event of there being a transfer of liability the landlord may ask that the arbitrator should determine his claim for compensation. Subsection (2) is machinery, intricate and complicated, and I think the House would not want me to go into much detail about it. It impinges upon Clause 28, and is necessary in order to prevent certain results from ensuing under that Clause. Subsection (3) enables a tenant to have his claim adjudicated upon by arbitration under the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923. The tenant's normal remedy in regard to a breach of obligation would be to sue for damages under his contract, and he will still be able to take this course if he wishes. The advantage of Subsection (3) will be that he can adopt a more convenient procedure by having his claim dealt with by arbitration under the Act of 1923 if he wishes. Subsections (4) and (5) are only drafting and machinery provisions. If hon. Members will look at Clauses 36 and 37 they will see that Subsections (4) and (5) of Clause 36, and Subsections (4) and (5) of Clause 37 are identical in wording. The proposed new Clause gathers these parts of those two Clauses together, for the sake of brevity. Later Amendments will deal with other aspects of the same matter.<br/>
I should point out something which was referred to during the Committee stage. If hon. Members will look at the last line of the proposed new Clause, they will see that it brings about the result that the award is to operate with effect from the date of the order, or from such later date as may be specified. In other words, it cannot be made to operate retrospectively. In Clauses 36 and 37, orders can be made to operate retrospectively, but now they have to start at the date of the award. I hope that the House will think that the

new Clause is satisfactory and meets the objects for which it was designed.</p>

<p>We had a discussion in Committee on the points raised in the Amendment which I have moved, but for the benefit of hon. Members who were not members of the Standing Committee I should mention that the "appropriate" Minister whom we wish to see removed from Clause 3 and from subsequent Clauses is either the Minister of Agriculture, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Home Secretary in relation to Northern Ireland, or the Minister of Food. Those who have studied the Bill will realise that in these Clauses very wide powers are given to the person described "the appropriate Minister", who I take it will be either the Minister of Agriculture or the Minister of Food. That Minister will have power, when it appears to him expedient or in the public interest, to vary the guaranteed price for any particular agricultural commodity He can also limit the quantity to which the price is applied and can vary the methods by which the price is paid. I think hon. Members will agree that questions of price and method of payment are essentially agricultural matters, and


should be the responsibility of the Minister of Agriculture.<br/>
In the Committee, the Minister answered the case which we put forward with a very plausible, and in some ways a reasonable argument. He said that in the conditions we have in the country today, rationing being in force, many questions as to price had been settled by order or by regulation under the authority of the Minister of Food. That Minister had power to do it, and it was administratively convenient that he should do so. The Minister of Agriculture went on to say that he, as Minister of Agriculture, took full responsibility although he may not have made the orders himself. On this side of the House we hope that existing conditions will not prevail for very much longer, and that we shall soon see the end of the present system of rationing. We feel that it should somehow be made clear in the Bill whether the Minister of Agriculture or the Minister of Food is responsible on these vital questions affecting the agricultural industry. If the Minister cannot accept this Amendment and the consequential Amendments, we hope that he will give us some firmer assurances than we have had so far that this procedure will not be extended indefinitely. We hope that he will take the earliest opportunity to get back for the Minister of Agriculture those powers which, in the opinion of hon. Members on this side of the House, should be vested in him, and in him only.</p>

<p>This Amendment brings up the very important question of the power of the Minister in relation to other Ministers. The essential thing is co-operation. I had down a new Clause relating to co-operation among, smallholders which was not called. Here I am talking about the co-operation of the Minister. All will agree that Ministers working separately will not do so effective a job as Ministers working in close co-operation with one another. If the Ministers are co-operating they will be anxious to see that the smallholders are co-operating. I hope the Minister will accept this suggestion and see that a great deal of co-operation takes place. We are often told that those en-

gaged in agriculture work "from see to can't see," from early dawn till the last hour of night. They have to exploit their own living to make a livelihood, and it is hard work. I have had some experience of this. I remember on a hot summer's day standing with the sweat running down my forehead watching the wife cultivating the garden. Recently she has revolted and she now does the watching and I do the groaning. The smallholder can only hope to make a success of his smallholding if we have co-operation between the Ministries and co-operation to the utmost among the smallholders.</p>

<p>I know from the Debate we had in Committee that hon. Members opposite do not like the Ministry of Food. They made that very plain, but their reasons, I thought, were very thin. The effect of this and other Amendments on the Order Paper is to preclude the Ministry of Food from taking any action under the Bill. It is clear to me that hon. Members are not quite seized of how the Clause will work. Certain actions under the Bill which are of vital importance are reserved exclusively for the agricultural Ministries, and there is co-operation between those three Ministries. The three agricultural Ministries are responsible for conducting the annual price reviews and for extending the powers under Clause 4, should that be necessary to give effect to their reviews. They are also responsible for fixing the periods during which minimum prices for livestock shall apply. The remaining functions and duties are concerned with the carrying out of the decisions taken by the three agricultural Ministries following upon these price reviews. Those functions may devolve upon any one or all three of the agricultural Ministers, or upon the Minister of Food. It is right that it should be so. I must repeat my statement in Committee that while food rationing remains, it is absolutely necessary that the Minister of Food should make the appropriate orders when prices have been fixed for various commodities. It is necessary for the Minister of Food to continue to purchase or control practically all rationed foodstuffs but he only makes an order following a price review. The Minister of Food purchases practically the whole of our meat. Therefore, once a price has been fixed for meat it is for the Minister of Food to make an Order giving effect to


that decision. Similar considerations apply to milk and cereals.<br/>
This Amendment would, quite unnecessarily, complicate food administration in this country. This Amendment and the 13 or 14 Other Amendments on the same subject are therefore pointless. It is true that if at a later date it became necessary for the agricultural Ministers to make arrangements for the payment of guaranteed prices, it would still be inconvenient if they had in all cases to act jointly. Methods sometimes differ between England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Therefore, the Bill distinguishes between those functions which are part of the determination of guaranteed prices which are a joint responsibility of the three agricultural Ministers and those other functions which are concerned with carrying out the various decisions taken. I could not possibly accept this Amendment. While the Minister of Food is responsible for purchasing and controlling all rationed foodstuffs he is the right and proper person to take action under Clause 3 following upon the price reviews. I hope hon. Members will see the wisdom of not pressing this Amendment, since it would completely upset the rationing system of this country.</p>

This short Debate has been well worth while in that it has drawn from the Minister an assurance that there will be no statement with regard to prices made by the Minister of Food without prior consultation with the Minister of Agriculture. That, of course, is what the farmers throughout the country want to know. If they were under the impression, as a result of reading the Bill and not knowing Parliamentary procedure too well, that the Minister of Food could one day make an announcement without having previously consulted his colleagues in the Government, they might feel unhappy about their future. It is clear from what the Minister has said that that is not likely to happen, and I hope that will reassure the farmers that their position will be safeguarded by the Ministers in conference, and that the appropriate Ministers will invariably consult with the Minister of Food before any announcements are made.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 3, lint 13, to leave out "as nearly as may be."<br/>
The purpose of this Amendment is to ensure that in fixing or varying prices and quantities, all the factors shall be taken into account by the Minister at the time. We are anxious that the Minister in using the machinery of price fixing, should make a clean job of it once a year, and not have it at the back of his mind that he can fiddle about with one or other of the factors in the price structure and

thereby alter the effects of the price settlement which in future years, we hope, will have won the approval of the farming and consuming community. We want to make sure that the Minister will make a clear job of price fixing once a year. It is very necessary that the farmers should be able to look ahead with confidence to definite guaranteed prices and markets. In the past it has been the curse of the agricultural industry that it was so often left open to the whims of imports, and that the farmers never knew how the market would settle down six, 12 or 18 months ahead. One of the virtues of the Bill is that it puts stability into the market for the British farmers and, therefore, for the British farm workers, so that they will know where they will stand 12 or 18 months ahead. I hope the Minister will accept the Amendment. In Committee he went a good deal of the way to meet us and expressed a good deal of sympathy with us, and, therefore, I have some confidence that he will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I cannot see why the words "as nearly as may be" are necessary in the Clause. I should have thought it would have been quite possible in the price review to fix the quantity as well. Personally, I hope it will never be necessary for quantities to be specified. It has always been the contention of hon. Members on this side that there should be no limitation of quantity as long as the farmers are able to produce at a reasonable price. I would like to point out a difficulty that might arise if prices and quantities are not fixed at the same time. For instance, would it be possible for the Minister to fix the price of, say, sugar beet in a February price review, and then at some later date before the beet was harvested to limit the quantity of beet that was to be accepted for sale?</p>

<p>If the Minister says it would be impossible, that helps, but I still think that the words "as nearly as may be" are unnecessary, and I hope the Minister will agree that, when fixing prices, he should fix the quantity at the same time.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture said in Committee that he viewed a similar Amendment with sympathy, and would consider whether it might be administratively possible to agree to the exclusion of these words without causing administrative inconvenience. My right hon. Friend has considered the matter again with great sympathy. I think hon. Members recognise my right hon. Friend's desire to do his best at all times in price fixing, to safeguard the interests of the producers, but he finds that it would be administratively inconvenient to remove these words. The effect of the Amendment would be that, if the appropriate Minister found it necessary to limit the assured market quantitatively, he would not only have to announce his decision on this point at the same time as he announced the prices and other factors, but would have to include it in the same order as that relating to prices and other factors. It is here that the point of administrative inconvenience arises. My right hon. Friend does not feel certain that it would at all times be possible for him to do this, and if it were difficult for him to do it, surely the effect would be that when he was ready to announce a price he might have to hold up the announcement of the price until the other Minister engaged in the consultation was fully ready to make an order concerning quantity. Surely that would be a disadvantage to the producers? Surely they would like to know as early as possible what the price is to be, instead of having to wait for some short interval to see if there is to be any change of quantity? My right hon. Friend has already given an assurance that he will, wherever possible, do this at the same time or make the interval as short as possible, and therefore we feel unable to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I do not think my hon. Friends on this side of the House are at all satisfied with that reply. The Minister must make up his mind what quantities of any commodity he wants and, having decided on the amounts, he fixes a price</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.242.0" colnum="242" time="">
<p>upon which he hopes he will get that quantity. If he does not adopt such a policy, I am quite certain we shall be in a serious state before many years have passed. The whole basis of Part I of this Bill is the price structure and the Government policy of giving the agriculturist a guaranteed price and a guaranteed market. Unless the Government know what quantity they require produced, it is impossible for them to decide what price should be given to the farmer, because upon the price will depend the quantity produced. For that reason I shall ask my hon. Friends to divide the House on this Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.242.1" colnum="242" time="">
<p>There is another point. In Committee the Minister made sympathetic reference to this subject, and so did the hon. Gentleman just now, but they were not able to accept the Amendment because it is said to be administratively inconvenient. All farmers will be affected tremendously by the question of whether the Amendment is carried or rejected. If it were carried, the farmers would know that when a price was fixed; a quantity limitation would be fixed at the same time, and therefore they would know how to plan. It is not good enough to say that these words cannot be deleted, because it is not administratively convenient to do so. The Minister went so far to say previously that he was in sympathy with the proposal, and although it was inconvenient administratively, yet it was not impossible.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.245.2" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Vane" colnum="245" time="">
<p>I beg to move, in page 7, line 5, to leave out from "land," to "is," in line 7, and to insert:
<q>whether treated by itself, or as affecting other land.</q>
We have left chapter 1 of this Bill, with its limited blessings, and have arrived at the longer chapters, with their almost unlimited sanctions. Clause 10 attempts to define the rules of good estate management. That has not previously been attempted in any Statute. As at present drafted, Subsection (1) makes rather heavy weather of the definition.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.245.3" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Deputy-Speaker" colnum="245" time="">
<p>I think it might be an advantage if we discussed at the same time the next two Amendments together&#x2014;in page 7, line 10, after "husbandry" to insert:
<q>or such an occupier of other land affected by the adequate management of the first mentioned land.</q>
and, in line 16, after "owner" to insert "has been and."</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.245.4" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Vane" colnum="245" time="">
<p>Subsection (1) as I say, attempts to define what is and what is not good estate management, and the Amendment which I move is purely administrative. It attempts to improve the definition, but not to undermine the 'principle which is in this Clause, and more particularly in this Subsection. As the Subsection is at present drafted, an owner
<q>shall be deemed to fulfil his responsibilities to manage it in accordance with the rules of good estate management in so far as his management of the land and (so far as it affects the management of that land) of other land managed by him is such as to be reasonably adequate.</q>

That means that if a man owns two farms, one slightly further up the valley than the other, and allows the drainage from the slightly higher farm to flood the slightly lower farm, then in considering the management of the lower farm acts of neglect which are presumed to have taken place in respect of the higher farm are likely to be taken into account. We consider that that is the wrong way round. If any complaint is to be made about the management of the higher farm, the whole question of whether or not that land is being managed according to the rules of good estate management should be limited to the top farm, and not approached by the very devious and intricate means of going into the management of the farm lower down the valley. This view was put forward by my hon. Friends in Committee, and commanded a certain amount of sympathy from the Minister. On a previous Amendment this afternoon, the Solicitor-General suggested that it was necessary to avoid inordinately long Clauses. I am sure it -is also necessary to avoid inordinately confusing definitions. The difficulties which will arise in assessing whether or not land is managed according to the rules of good estate management, unless these words, or something similar to them, are accepted, will be extreme, and will give rise to an enormous amount of dispute.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I wish also particularly to support the second Amendment which has been referred to. These two Amendments would


work together. We shall find great difficulty in deciding these matters if we have to take into consideration more than one particular piece of land. I hope the two Amendments will be inserted in the Bill.</p>

<p>Both the mover and seconder have sought to justify this group of Amendments on the ground that they clarify the definition contained in Clause to (1). That is a laudable motive, but I must ask the House to reject the Amendment now before us, because as I see the position, the words which it is sought to substitute for those which at present appear in the Bill not only do not clarify the position, but, on the contrary, introduce a great deal of obscurity. I know hon. Members will say "If it is only a matter of drafting, surely you can improve the words and to that extent assist us?" I would if I could, but there is a fundamental vice underlying the Amendments&#x2014;that if an owner manages land in such a way that it affects any other land, whether in his ownership or not, then he is guilty of bad management, if that effect is injurious. That is obviously much too wide.<br/>
What the Clause seeks to do is this: Supposing there is an owner who own plot A and also owns or manages plot B, and his management of plot A adversely affects the management of plot B, he comes within the terms of the Subsection. The Amendment would result in a much more indefinite position. Its result would be that, supposing the owner of plot A so manages it that it injuriously affects, in the wide sense of that word, any other land, say plot X, Y or Z, in which he has no interest, which is owned and managed by completely different people, and which may be at a distance from plot A, he comes within the scope of the Subsection. I am sure that hon Gentlemen do not wish to bring about that position. It would impose an intolerable burden upon the landowner, and greatly multiply the responsibilities placed upon him by Clause to. In contradistinction to that, we say that we are only concerned, in Clause 10 (1) with holdings or areas of ground which can fairly be said to be managed by the landowner, that is to say plot A, which he owns, and plot B, which he manages, in the sense that he may have let it out to a tenant. Therefore, in considering whether he is within the purview

of the Clause we simply say that consideration must be limited to those two plots. The Amendment would require that the area all round, which could in no sense be said to be under that person's ownership or management or under his responsibility, would have to be considered. I ask the House to say that the Amendment not only does not improve the Clause but that in so tar as it is easily intelligible&#x2014;I do not mean that in any depreciatory sense&#x2014;it would impose an intolerable burden on the landowner. Indeed, the word "affect" being of such general significance in the context of the actual Amendment, in which it is used, it is impossible to see how far its extent would go.</p>

<p>Having heard the explanation of the Solicitor-General, I am not yet satisfied that the original terms of the Bill really meet the point, though I am prepared to admit that the Amendment, as drafted, may not be in the appropriate words to effect what we desire. The point we want to make clear is whether when this Bill becomes an Act it will be right to bring in the management of other land when deciding whether an owner is fulfilling his responsibilities of management in accordance with the rules of good husbandry. We do not like the wording of the Clause as it stands. We appreciate the point made by the Solicitor-General and on behalf of my hon. Friends, I would ask whether the Government, appreciating our point, with which I believe the Minister is much in agreement, will look at these words again before this Bill becomes an Act. We ask them to see if the words can be made clearer than they are at present, and at the same time to bring out the point about considering the effect on other land, when deciding whether an owner is fulfilling his responsibilities to manage land in accordance with good husbandry. Could the Solicitor-General give an undertaking that he will look at these words, and see whether they meet the point which my hon. Friends have made?</p>

<p>I confess I am rather muddled as to exactly what these words mean. From what the Solicitor-General said and from my reading of this Clause, it would appear that if an owner owns land in one county, and also owns land in another county or


another part of England, it is possible to consider these two separate pieces of land in conjunction when deciding whether he is carrying out his responsibility for good estate management. The Solicitor-General said that the words we desire to have included in the Bill would make the Clause far too wide, and would involve consideration of how the management of one piece of land affected neighbouring farms. It seems to me reasonable that that should be taken into account&#x2014;far more reasonable than to take into account how the owner concerned was managing another piece of land, very widely separated from the land in question.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 7, line 16, after "owner," to insert, "has been and."<br/>
Subsection (2) of Clause 10 is important because it lays down the rules of good estate management by which owners will be judged. We are a little afraid that if the words in that Subsection are not altered a rather too narrow construction may be placed upon them. As now drafted the Subsection reads:
<q>In determining whether the management of land is such as aforesaid regard shall be had, but without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of the last foregoing Subsection, to the extent to which the owner is providing, improving, maintaining and repairing fixed equipment &#x2026;</q>
If a too narrow interpretation is placed upon those words, it might apply only to actual current expenditure. That would be an unfair yardstick because, first, on a great many estates it has been the custom to do repairs on farms in rotation and, second, the actual current expenditure on fixed equipment is no criterion of whether a landowner is able or willing to do his job properly. Owing to the extreme difficulty of getting licences and permits to do essential work, landowners who may be anxious to get the work done are sometimes unable to do it in terms of current expenditure. We feel that if a man's future tenure of land is to be judged in the narrow sense of this Subsection, it would be fair to take into account past expenditure in addition to current expenditure.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
Whereas maintenance and repair are primarily matters of small outlay to meet

current deterioration, provision and improvement constitute large outlay. That is what we are thinking about. Often such improvement cannot be arranged on every holding on an estate except at an interval of so many years. Normal standards of good estate management in this country allow for major expenditure to be carried out on holdings in rotation. It might very easily be argued that if the Clause is left as at present drafted, considerable expenditure which took place when a tenant came in&#x2014;and one is glad to say that tenancies are, on the whole, of very long standing&#x2014;would be ruled out completely from consideration when a dispute arises. If these words, "has been and" are inserted, then where previous expenditure is relevant it will not be excluded from consideration. At the same time, it does not compel undue consideration of that expenditure, because it is always possible to argue that it was reasonable at the time but that it has no particular relevance to the present. The acceptance of these words would not weaken the case at all. I feel that it would be a great deal stronger in some instances and a great deal fairer.</p>

<p>I follow the motives behind the Amendment, but I must advise the House that the fears expressed are not well founded. If I can summarise them, it is feared that the word "is" is too narrow. It was argued that it would shut out anything that had gone before and anything that came after, and would involve simply looking at me actual state of affairs at the moment by reference to which one is judging. The advice I give to the House is that the word "is" in this context permits and indeed requires a general circumspective view. It requires the consideration of a trend: not only the state of fact at the moment. If the words which are sought to be introduced, "has been and," were in the Clause, the position would be very much more difficult and it might be unfair to the landowner.<br/>
Suppose there was a case of a landowner who in the past had done very little in the way of good estate management. There may have been a great deal of complaint and it may be that latterly he had entirely changed the position and put in a good deal of work, greatly improving the position of the holding. The result of introducinc, the words of the Amendment would introducing that in a case of


that sort one would not only have to say to oneself, "At present the estate management on this farm is excellent," but one would have to discount that by reference to the fact that by looking back two or three or five or six years, one found that under the management of the same landowner the farm was in a very bad state. It would be very bad luck for the landowner if he had done a great deal to improve the farm and had brought it up to the requisite standard, that one should have to say, "Because in the past you have neglected this estate, we shall write you down and we shall, condemn you for your past record. We shall not allow you to gain the credit of having effaced that, and having brought your estate up to a very good pitch of management." That would be the effect of these words.<br/>
As the Clause stands, anybody considering the position must look at it generally and consider what has gone before, what exists at present and what is likely to be the trend in future, to see whether it can fairly be said to be in a state of good management. One is not tied down to discounting a good present record by a bad past record. If one were tied down to that&#x2014;and one would be if the Amendment was accepted&#x2014;it would be very bad luck on a landowner in some cases, and in others it might advantage him. It would impose an entirely unnecessary and unfortunate restriction. It would work very unfairly in many cases. The Clause is sufficiently widely worded to enable a general view to be taken, making due allowance for all the relevant considerations which one would consider in asking whether an estate is properly managed.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Solicitor-General's argument is satisfactory. If the landowner in the past has not been doing well, there is no reason why that fact should not come out. If he is now doing the work in a proper manner, it shows that he has improved and is getting on with the job. There is no reason why his past record should not be known. If it happens that a man has had a good past record, the words, "is providing," do not mean that one can consider that past. There are many great estates in this country where the work cannot be done in one year or two years. What has been done on farm A last year, is done this year on

farm B, and perhaps next year on farm C, before it is done again on farm A. That cannot be taken into account under the words "is providing." "Is" denotes the present; "has been" the past. If a man did work two years ago and he intends to do it again in the cycle, that can be considered under the words "has been" It will be very hard on the man who has done good work if it is not recognised because the word "is" is in the Subsection.</p>

<p>The argument put forward by the Solicitor-General was quite extraordinary. He said that if these words were accepted it would be bad luck on the landowner. It would be bad luck only on the man who is a bad landowner. There is the case of the man who had ignored his land for years, and I think that the Solicitor-General or the Minister should give a rather better explanation than that to which we have listened. My hon. Friend pointed out that it has been impossible for the last few years to do these repairs, had the landlord wished to do so, and, therefore, landowners who spent large sums of money in keeping their holdings up to date before the war are not going to get any benefit at all when their cases are considered. I hope we shall have a more helpful explanation in answer to the arguments put by my hon. Friends.</p>

<p>The term "is providing" cannot possibly be strictly interpreted as meaning what the landlord provided before the war. That is seven years ago, and, grammatically, it does not seem to me that, if a landlord provided certain improvements seven years ago, we can say that he is providing them now. That was seven years ago, and the term "is providing" cannot mean what was done seven years ago.</p>

<p>We certainly cannot say that a landlord "is improving" if the last improvement which he carried out on his


land was done before the war, and it seems to me to be very hard indeed that somebody who is interpreting this Bill strictly at a later date may be able to argue that these improvements which were carried out before the war should not be taken into account. Very little was done during the war, and it is exceedingly difficult to do anything now. I suggest that there is another form of words which might appeal to the Minister, and it is this: "The extent to which the owner provides, improves, maintains and repairs fixed equipment on the land." I think that would convey the sense which we all intend to be conveyed, and that is that, over a period, the owner does provide these things, and not that he provided them seven years ago and is not providing them now, or that he is not providing them now when he did so seven years ago. It would convey, generally speaking, that he does provide what is required for the working of the farm.</p>

<p>It would be very unfortunate if the idea got abroad that the past record of an owner may not be taken into account. The learned Solicitor-General, I think, gave a very cogent and clear explanation. It is perfectly clear from the language of the Clause that the past record is to be taken into account. What this Clause does is to say that, without prejudice to the generality of the provisions in Subsection (1), nevertheless, in order to get a balanced view of the contributions which the owner has made in the way of maintaining and repairing machinery and so forth, we are to take account of what is being done at the moment. That seems to me to be very sensible and fair. Supposing the' owner's previous record has not been so good, but that he is trying to make up for past faults by doing more at the present time. It is provided that all that shall be taken into account, in order to give him an opportunity to satisfy the test whether there is an attempt at good management or not. That does not mean that the past is to be cut out. Supposing, on the other hand, his past record has been good. That will be taken into account with what he is doing now. His general record will be taken into account, and this Clause is intended to be the means of getting a balanced view of the whole situation. It takes the past completely into account with the present in order to get that balanced view, and, in my submission, the

argument of the Opposition on this point is misconceived.</p>

<p>I think the syntax of this Clause is perfectly good, and that what Opposition hon. Members are seeking to do is to make the Clause very much worse for themselves than it is now. If we say that a farmer is providing certain things, it must be, by and large, everything on the farm in the way of buildings and so on. He is providing and continuing to provide them at the time. If a barn was built 100 years ago, and it is still in use, the owner is still providing it, and, in. fact, everything which is provided and which is continuing to be used he is providing at the moment. If the owner knocks down that barn, or it is destroyed and he does not put it up again, he would not be providing it, but, if it is still there, he is providing it. Hon. Members opposite are trying to make the Minister look back into the past, when he will find out something which I think will make this an infinitely worse Clause from their point of view.</p>

<p>I think it is obvious that this Clause requires reconsideration. The hon. and learned Solicitor-General, the hon. and learned Member for Gloucester (Mr. Turner-Samuels) and the hon. Member for Epping (Mrs. Manning) have all spoken of this Clause in three different senses. Surely, there must be some very good reason for this confusion? The hon. and learned Member for Gloucester said that the Solicitor-General gave a cogent and fair answer. It may have been cogent, but it was not fair, according to the hon. and learned Member, because the two arguments were entirely contradictory one with the other. The learned Solicitor-General argues that it would be extremely bad luck if the past record is taken into account. The hon. and learned Member for Gloucester says that the past record would be taken into account, and if it is bad luck that the past record should be taken into account, and, at the same time, it will be taken into account by this Clause, then, surely, it follows that there must be something wrong with the Clause? The hon. Member for Epping says that if a farm building was built 100 years ago and is still being used, the owner is providing it. No doubt, that is true, but what we are concerned with at the moment is the fact that where, owing to an act of God,


an act of the Government, or an act of somebody else, the barn or fence has fallen down, in present circumstances it is not possible to carry out repairs, not for any lack of good will on the part of the person concerned, but because one cannot get repairs done. I agree with the argument of the hon. Lady that, when the building is not usable, then we cannot say that the owner is providing it. That is a very cogent argument, but it surely follows that this Amendment should be accepted and not rejected, or, at least, if the Amendment is not accepted, that the Clause should be looked at again and redrafted. I would appeal to hon. Members opposite to recognise that they have demonstrated the cogency of this Amendment even more convincingly than have my hon. Friends on this side of the House.</p>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, for letting me get so far. Then we heard from the hon. Member for Epping (Mrs. Manning) what appeared to be the only logical and commonsense defence of the Government's point of view. If her reading of the present position is that what grandfather provided should be maintained for the use by a tenant, then there would be reason to think that there was some sense in it. But even on that reading, owing to the difficulty of maintaining in proper repair what grandfather provided, one might well find oneself legally

compelled not to provide something which one is only too anxious to provide. Taking all these things together, surely, in fairness to the Committee and to the House, the Government should withdraw this Clause and think again.</p>

<q>and to the rental value of the land having regard to the economic condition of that section of the agricultural industry which comprises produce of the kind produced by the occupier of that land.</q>
The object of this Amendment is to protect the landlord, which I know is something not very popular in this country at the present time. But landlords are a long-suffering race, and, therefore, I think it is our duty to be reasonable towards them. The Amendments seeks to protect the owner of a farm from having to erect or provide some fixed equipment for which the farm is not suitable. As far as I can see, there is nothing in this Clause to protect the landlord by way of appeal if the executive officer or the sub-committee appointed decide whether fixed equipment shall be provided or not. As an instance of what might happen, I would point out that, at the present time, grass drying is a very popular job and plants for this purpose are being erected at considerable expense all over the country. It may well be that the executive officer for a district is a grass-drying maniac and that there may be some tenant in the area who is also a grass-drying maniac. He may decide that the landlord should erect grass-drying equipment which might be wholly unsuitable for the land on which it is erected. I know it may be argued that if such equipment is erected, the landlord can get a re-assessment for rent, and that he is protected in that way. But that is no protection at all, because the tenant, after carrying on for one or two years, may find that grass drying on that particular farm is not an economic proposition, and may then give notice to quit, and the landlord would then be left with the uneconomic equipment, which may have cost him several thousands of pounds to provide, and which another tenant may not be willing to take over. I feel that there should be some protection for the landlord from


anything which is not fair, and, therefore, I would ask the Minister to accept this Amendment, or to insert some words on the lines of this Amendment.</p>

<p>In considering this Clause, we must remember the background of the whole Bill, which is intended to give stability to the agricultural industry by means of guaranteed prices and assured markets. In return for this guarantee of stability, the State very reasonably imposes certain requirements of good management which are set out in the Bill. The hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Baldwin) and the hon. and gallant Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Lieut.-Colonel Clifton-Brown) seem to fear that, somehow, the Bill is going to be 'administered by maniacs. I agree, of course, that if the Bill is so administered it will not work. It may be, of course, that in the neighbourhood of their own constituencies there are some maniacs in the employ of county agricultural committees. I can see that my right hon. Friend will have to look into that possibility, but, as regards the rest of the country, there is no reason to fear on that score. I feel that to suggest that the criteria of good management as set out in this Bill, which are criteria of the equipment and the provision of adequate facilities on estates, should be extended to include monetary gains which may be made, is quite unacceptable. Therefore, we could not agree to this Amendment. It is perhaps remarkable that the mover and seconder of this Amendment have not suggested that any similar provision should be inserted in the rules of good husbandy. They are seeking to differentiate between the owner and the occupier, a differentiation which we have been careful to exclude from the Bill. For these reasons, I must ask the House to reject the Amendment.</p>

<p>I was unable to follow the remarks of the hon. Gentleman opposite. If I understood him

aright, he said it would be wrong to take into consideration the economic position of the farm, the money which can be made out of it, when telling the landlord to provide certain equipment. If that is what the hon. Gentleman meant, it is quite wrong, and this Amendment should be accepted. In order to illustrate his point, my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Baldwin) gave what was obviously an extreme illustration. But the fact that an extreme illustration was made, should not make it possible to say that there is a much narower margin between what can be provided on a farm and what cannot be provided. It is obvious that on a small farm a certain amount of profitability can be taken out; it is equally true that if a certain amount of equipment is put in and capital spent on it, the output and the consequent profitability of the farm is increased. But there comes a moment when any more equipment that is put on the farm becomes an uneconomic proposition, and, as my lion. Friend the Member for Leominster said, it is no good increasing the rent, because if the point is reached where the tenant cannot pay the rent, it is obviously unsatisfactory for everybody.<br/>
The object of this Amendment is to give a direction as to what equipment can be put on a farm, and to guide people so that the economic position and the increased profitability of a farm should be assessed in conjunction with the equipment that is put on it. If the case of the Government is that such matters should be taken into consideration, I do not quarrel very much with the Minister, but, if I understood the Paymaster-General aright, he said that the question of how much money is made on a farm should not be taken into account, and if he means that, I for one am prepared to support the Amendment in the Lobby.</p>

<p>Everybody sympathises with and appreciates the difficulties of the Paymaster-General in assisting the Minister of Agriculture in this Debate because, through no fault of his own, he was not a member of the Standing Committee. Nevertheless, I was surprised that he advanced the argument that the economic aspect of a farm in relation to repairs and fixed equipment should not be taken into consideration. Does he follow the logical implication of that argument?


Supposing a landowner is ultimately dispossessed for being unwilling or unable to provide fixed equipment, the Land Commission will take over. Will the Land Commission carry out to the farm buildings improvements which, owing to the nature of the farm, are entirely uneconomic? If so, the uneconomic expenditure will be at the expense of the taxpayer. I was surprised that the Paymaster-General should argue that there was no need to protect a landowner from being asked to provide fixed equipment for a farm which he knew to be uneconomic, because the farm in question was unable to carry the extra rent which that capital expenditure would involve.</p>

<p>I was surprised at the speech of the Paymaster-General. He began by pleading amateur status, and I think he gave us a demonstration of the little connection he has had with the practical side of agricultural management when he asked the House to reject this Amendment. He said, quite rightly, that stability is one of the things we want in agriculture, and then he discounted instability which resulted from over-capitalisation. He then apparently forgot that the history of agriculture, which is repeating itself today, is a history of the advice of faddists; and if one reads books of the 17th and 18th centuries one finds an immense amount of advice put forward by faddists, much of which has been forgotten and only about 5 or 10 per cent. of which is bound up with our agricultural progress. Therefore, it is as well to bear in mind that in a few years' time, something between 5 and 10 per cent. of present advice will have passed the test of time. Another point is that at the moment in this country there is a great dearth of professional men whom one can call consultants in farm buildings. I know the right hon. Gentleman is hoping to appoint a certain number of people to such positions, but the professions as such have among their ranks very few architects or surveyors with a specialist knowledge of agriculture and of farm buildings. I do not refer to people who can put up buildings, because anyone can do that. I refer to people with the knowledge to advise in a consultative capacity in relation to what is right and wrong.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman said he was surprised that we had not tried to insert

similar words affecting the farm tenant. I do not think the situation is exactly parallel, but if it were, I for one, and, no doubt, my hon. Friends, would immediately accept any form of words which would put the farm tenant in the same position. The illustration of my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Baldwin) was ridiculed on the grounds that it was exaggerated. No one can say it is, exaggerated when one remembers that in this country there are at least a million acres of marginal land, and that every day a great number of occupiers of that land suggest to land agents, owners and others how much better it would be if this, that or the other could be done on their farms, but that when it is explained that the economic return for such an improvement will add so much to the rent they think again and say it is not worth while. That is because Part I of the Bill, which is intended to be so strong, has a number of inherent weaknesses. So long as we have limitations on the production from marginal and other land, so long will those weaknesses remain when one tries to expend capital in a big way economically on marginal land. Therefore, the House would be right in rejecting the argument of the Paymaster-General and in accepting this Amendment.</p>

<p>I intervene in this Debate with diffidence. I do a little farming myself, but I had not the advantage of being on the Committee. I fail to understand the arguments which have been put forward, particularly those put forward by the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Vane). This Subsection specifies one consideration that is to be borne in mind, but it follows a Subsection which contains the main points which have to be considered. Those main points are:
<q>the character and situation of the land and other relevant circumstances.</q>
I find it impossible to see how anybody, having looked at those points, should omit to consider the marginal character of the land or, having to consider other circumstances, should fail to consider the rental value. Therefore, it seems unnecessary to add the proposed words to Subsection (2). Moreover, I find the greatest difficulty in understanding what the Amendment means. If it said,
<q>and to the rental value of the land,</q>


and stopped there, I should have had some idea, but the remainder of the Amendment seems to me, with all respect to those who moved it, to be bad grammar and extremely bad sense. After the words,
<q>and to the rental value of the land,</q>
it goes on to say:
<q>having regard to the economic condition of that section of the agricultural industry which comprises produce of the kind produced by the occupier of that land.</q>
That, I think, is rather horrible English, anyway. We were given the case of the grass-drying maniac. I assume that a farm would, at any rate, produce grass, since otherwise the maniac would have no room in which to exercise all his frenzied activity. Therefore, we have to look at
<q>the economic condition of that section of the agricultural industry which comprises produce of the kind produced by the occupier of that land.</q>
What do we have to look at? Mixed farming, grass, arable, or what? I would have thought that the acceptance of this Amendment would produce a state of affairs which the ordinary landlord or farmer would find extraordinarily difficult to understand. I would like hon. Members opposite, since this is their Amendment, to tell us what they suppose it really means, because so far I am quite unable to understand it. Let them give us concrete cases, and. explain the application of these words, for example, to the case of an ordinary mixed farm.</p>

<p>I understand the feelings of those who put down this Amendment. It is simply to ensure that landlords should not be expected to provide more fixed equipment than is economically reasonable. There are always a certain number of tenants who desire to have all kinds of improvements, which may not be economically sound. I understand that point of view. However, I do not think this Amendment achieves the object which they have in mind. I follow the lion and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) in saying that this is covered in Subsection (1). The relevant part of that Subsection is in the last few lines which, paraphrasing them, state that a landlord will be doing his job if he provides the sort of equipment which is necessary to enable a farmer to farm properly. Now, farming properly is not grass-drying. I

approve of grass-drying, and do it myself, but it is not the sort of farming which any war agricultural executive committee could expect the landlord to provide.<br/>
There are difficult marginal cases. There is no limit to the amount of fixed equipment that the tenant farmer can use. He can always use more hay boxes; he can always use more covered yards. But that, I think, is covered by Subsection (1). I do not think that the war agricultural executive committees, composed of farmers and landlords, will expect a landlord to provide an unreasonable amount of equipment. That is the second safeguard. Therefore, I do not think that this rather complicated addition would add clarity to the definition of the good management of land.</p>

<p>The real danger in this Amendment lies in the fact that it is, so far as one can understand it, a very muddled Amendment. It appears to be designed to ensure that the farmer will not get necessary improvements, or will find it difficult, if not impossible, to get them. Therefore, it is something of which we should be very wary. Surely, the really operative words in Subsection (2) are:
<q>to enable an occupier of the land reasonably skilled in husbandry to maintain efficient production.&#x2026;</q>
If he is to maintain efficient production all the extravagant and extreme cases which have been suggested are quite unnecessary. I am sure hon. Members opposite would find it impossible to indicate any part of the Bill which would compel landlords to put in the different kinds of equipment such as they have suggested might be found necessary under the Clause as it stands. Marginal land was mentioned, and the new improvements needed to bring it up to a certain state of efficiency. Surely, the point is that husbandry on marginal land must be related to that land, and efficient husbandry on that land must have regard to the condition of the land? I suggest that this Amendment, so far as I can understand it, would be detrimental to the tenant.</p>

<p>Having been caught out once this afternoon, I did not intend to be caught out a second time. What we are nervous about is, who will decide the revelant circumstances. The hon. and learned Member for Kettering and the hon. Member for North Cumberland thought the wording of the Clause protected a landlord from having to do something which was not economical. I contend that it does nothing of the sort. The word "maniac" has been used. There are extremists, shall I say, who, as my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Vane) said, have appeared throughout the centuries, who have insisted on a particular line. At one time it is all silage, and the next time all grass drying. There may be an executive officer in the county who is all for one particular form of farming, yet that particular form will not last. The executive officer may force a landlord to put up some building &#x2014;and I will stick to grass-drying&#x2014;which will not prove economical to that farm. Who is to decide&#x2014;and I hope the Minister will think this is sufficiently important to tell us&#x2014;whether that fixed equipment is necessary, or is an economic proposition?<br/>
The Paymaster-General said that I was visualising these executive officers as maniacs. I did not quite mean that, but I will say there are extremists. If he thinks they do not exist I will give him a concrete instance, not from my own county&#x2014;where he thought we had maniacs&#x2014;but from an adjacent county. The executive officer for that county was what I call a "ploughing-up maniac." A client of mine had an order to plough up 202 acres of a 240 acre farm; he knew

it was not ploughing-up land, and had not been ploughed up during the previous war, and he refused to do it. Consequently, he was dispossessed, and he is still out of that farm today.<br/>
We must protect farmers from those executive officers who get a bee in their bonnet, and who compel landlords to do something which is not economical. That is all we are asking. We are not retrograde; we want to see proper equipment put on the farms, but we also want to see that it is proper equipment and not merely something which is not worth while being forced on a landlord. We want to see that the equipment is necessary. The hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Collins) said they would provide the necessary equipment. But the landlord is not protected; there is nothing to say what is necessary and what is not necessary. We say the landlord should be protected from extremists; that is all.</p>

<p>Perhaps I might be allowed to speak again, with the leave of the House. I may have replied a little shortly and cavalierly to the remarks of the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Baldwin). The arguments which he and his hon. Friend advanced were so thin that I felt they could not mean them sincerely, and I answered in a rather flippant way. I do not wish it to be thought for a moment that we do not attach importance to the general economcis of the situation. I do not wish it to be thought we do not recognise that a reasonable return on capital has to be earned, or that it is possible to over-capitalise. I thought that


all these matters were adequately covered in Subsection (1) by the words "other relevant circumstances," and, therefore, I was addressing myself to the Subsection to which the Amendment relates Subsection (2) has to be read in relation to Subsection (1). All that is at issue is whether these Subsections will be reasonably and sensibly administered, and whether there will be regard to economic circumstances. I would point out to the hon. Member for Leominster that the authority to determine these matters will be the county executive committee. They must have regard to the relevant circumstances, and it will not be one of their officers exercising dictatorial powers. As he knows, the county executive committees consist of practical agriculturists.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 8, line 28, after "satisfied," to insert:
<q>on representations by the appropriate County Agricultural Executive Committee appointed under Part V of this Act.</q>
We are now moving from the stage where one is expected to be a good boy in farming and. coming to the stage where the big stick is appearing. According to the Minister, supervision is better than lifting up the big stick. We think that

this Amendment should appear at this stage in the Bill, to make quite clear who it is that will advise the Minister in future. We all agree that this will be done by the county executive committees, but that is only for the moment, and this Bill will last a long time. It should be stated that the people who are to advise the Minister are the committees, so that there is no chance of it being said that the Minister did not take the advice of a committee but did something off his own bat. I am not saying that this will be done now, but it is a possibility which may occur in the future. During the war we found that certain committees were not doing all that the Minister or the farmers thought they should do, and there will be a chance in a few years that a Minister may be tempted to say that he could not go to a committee because he knew it was not doing its job properly. We do not want to see that happening. We want it to be clear that the committees are the people to advise the Minister and we want to see it laid down in black and white.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
Ministers occassionally have representations made to them by individuals who may have a particular axe to grind. There are such things as anonymous letters and signed letters which are written out of spite to a Minister and serve no good cause. It is most desirable, therefore, that the Minister, in his own interest, should safeguard himself by acting only on the advice of the county executive committees. By doing that he will reinforce the good relations between the committees and the Ministers, because nothing' is more injurious to good relations than for the committees to feel that someone is going behind their backs and getting some action taken by the Minister If this part of the. Bill is to work at all, it will be dependent on the fullest confidence between the Minister and the executive committees. We do not want to see Ministers acting on a few private words, but on the recommendations of the committees.</p>

<p>I am rather surprised that the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Hurd) should have associated himself with this Amendment. I am sure he knows that the county executive committees are


the only bodies from which the Minister would expect to receive representations and advice. The insertion of these words is both unnecessary and undesirable. The hon. and gallant Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Lieut.-Colonel Clifton-Brown) cannot get out of his mind that Part II of this Bill is a big stick. He is willing to accept Part I, but is very reluctant to accept Part II. We have witnessed this on a fairly wide scale from the Opposition Benches. We made rapid progress on Part I, but the moment we came to deal with Part which introduces a <i>quid fro quo</i> in the form of control, our progress was very different. The Bill has been drafted on the basis that the Minister will be delegating his functions under Clause 69, subject to such conditions or restrictions as he may consider desirable, to the county executive committees. The county executive committees should be made absolutely and entirely responsible for day-to-day administration. It would be entirely wrong to attempt to circumscribe the Minister's powers of delegation in the way suggested. Nothing could then be done until after representation by the Minister's own agents to the Minister, which would be an absurdity, and no one knows that better than the hon. Member for Newbury.<br/>
If a county executive committee, responsible for day-to-day administration, is not to be able to place a person under supervision, or to give a direction until it has, first of all, made representations to the Minister, for him to say, "Yes, go ahead," then the whole business will be held up. The Government's intention, in producing this Bill, has been to set up county executive committees consisting of practical agriculturalists, men who have the confidence of their counties and the agricultural industry. They are to become the Minister's agents, under Clause 69, when power is delegated. Therefore,it is absurd that, having been appointed agents they can do nothing without first of all making representations to the Minister, and getting his word to go ahead. That is the object of the Amendment.<br/>
While the county executive committees are responsible to the Minister for day-to-day administration, the Minister is responsible to Parliament for all their actions, and it is constitutionally undesirable to insert a provision in the Bill

requiring the Minister to be satisfied, after representations have been made to him by his own agents, before they can do anything. That seems absurd, and could only retard and delay the county executive committees in doing their work. Further, if these words were inserted here, they would have to be repeated throughout the Bill. I hope hon. Members opposite will take it from me that there is nothing sinister in this form of administration. It has been going on for seven years; it was very effective during the war. I hope my predecessor did not act on the basis of an anonymous letter, or because someone whispered in his ear. I hope he acted, through his county executive committees, on the basis of their practical knowledge and good sense. Unless those committees carry with them the goodwill of the industry, administration will suffer. I hope the House will not accept this Amendment.</p>

<p>I do not like this Amendment, and I did not like the remark made by the Minister, that it would only be from the county agricultural executive committees that he would take advice: They are not elected to be the sole parties who can give the Minister advice. It may be that a Member of Parliament, carrying out his job, will discover a situation which requires attention. He should be able to give the Minister advice. During the war, I had to raise, with the then Minister of Agriculture, questions about the bad advice and attitude of certain county agricultural committees. I had to fight against some of them occasionally. It is possible to have a county committee in one area which has a bias for grass. That would be dangerous. The decline of agriculture in this country, before the war, was due to the neglect of millions of acres of land. Special inducements had to be given to plough up that land. We have to see that the correct balance is maintained. As things are going at present, we are drifting back to where we were before the war.</p>

<p>I would not wish to do that, Sir. I only want to draw attention to the fact that it would be a bad thing for the Minister to leave these matters


entirely to the county agricultural committees. A committee in the north of England may adopt quite a different attitude from a committee in the south. There may be bias in favour of a particular form of management that would unbalance agriculture as a whole. I therefore ask the Minister to make the fullest possible use of the advice given by the county committees, but always to be prepared to take advice from Members of this House. We must ensure that an effective and efficient balance is kept between the county agricultural committees and the land that is under their consideration, so that our agriculture can prosper and not decline as it did before the war.</p>

<p>Splendid. Then the right hon. Gentleman had much better do what we say and put these words into the Bill. The right hon. Gentleman also said that it was the intention that agricultural executive committees should be absolutely and entirely responsible in these cases. If that is so&#x2014;I do not quarrel with the decision that it should be so because that is what we are trying to put in as an Amendment&#x2014;it is much better to put it in. We have heard, time and time again throughout this Bill, that the Minister is to do something about which we all agree but, unfortunately, it does not appear in black and white in the Bill. Here is a sample case. He says that he will take the advice of the county agricultural executive committees because that is the only way the Minister can be satisfied on a matter of this kind. If he says that he is to take that advice, I cannot see why that should not be put in the Bill. He said something to the effect that it would be unconstitutional. I do not know from where he got that. Is it unconstitutional to put in the fact that the Minister will take advice from his own servants? I do not know whether "unconstitutional" is the right word, but in a Bill we do not say that the Minister shall be guided by any servants in his own Department. Obviously, that is why they are there &#x2014; to advise, guide and help. I did not think, until the Minister used that argument in that context, that anyone in the world thought that the county agricultural executive committees were servants of the Minister in that sense. He does not mean that these gentlemen, or ladies, who are to sit on these committees are to be held in the same position as the ordinary civil servants in Government Departments from the point of view of giving advice. Surely not; but that is what he implied in using that argument. If he likes to withdraw that&#x2014;</p>

<p>The position then becomes more confounded. Are these committees to be considered as civil servants giving advice in the Civil Service sense of the word, or are they not? We say, "No." We agree that they are there to give advice. The Minister also agrees that they are to give advice, and


he would not dream of acting in cases of this kind without their advice. Having agreed to that, the obvious thing to do is to put the words in the Bill I cannot see that there is any argument which the Minister has given against it, and unless he changes his mind, I would advise my hon. Friends to divide the House.</p>

<p>In view of the right hon. and gallant Gentleman's determined effort to confuse the issue, I think that I should say a further word, with the leave of the House. That is, to remind the right hon. and gallant Gentleman that if he will read the first few words of Clause 12 he will see that where the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries is satisfied, he may do certain things. Clause 69 states that the Minister may make regulations providing for the delegation to a county agricultural executive committee of certain powers. The county executive committee, therefore, will be an executive body&#x2014;an executive body acting for the Minister which need not tell the Minister every little thing they do during their day to day administration. That is why we call them county agricultural executive committees. There is no reason, therefore, to have these words in the Bill.</p>

<p>The Minister's further remarks have done nothing to close the dangerous door left open by the Minister in Clause 12. I do not think that the Minister can, deny that under Clause 12, as it stands, it would be legally possible for him or one of his successors to act independently of representations and advice of the executive committees. I he fact that under Clause 69 the Minister may delegate such of his functions as he cares to specify does not mean that the danger will be removed. The Minister may so frame his regulations delegating powers to the executive committees as still to leave it open to him to carry on independently of them. That being so, and in view of the Minister's</p>

<p>previous remarks&#x2014;for, as has been pointed out, there is not a great deal of disagreement as to the wishes to be fulfilled in this matter&#x2014;I should have thought that the Minister would have been well advised to accept the Amendment. He is establishing a system&#x2014;a hierarchy within the Civil Service. One will only have a successfully working Civil Service if there is no short-circuiting. That has always been the experience of the Services, whether Army, Navy or Civil Service. To leave this loophole open shows the lack of faith of the Minister, and he would do better to close it by accepting this simple Amendment.</p>

<p>It seems that the Amendment which the Opposition are proposing to press is at complete variance with everything that they have said so far as the application of this Bill is concerned. They have always argued that they do not want farming from Whitehall, but the implication of this Amendment is that every supervisory order that is issued should come from Whitehall, after they have received the advice of the county agricultural executive committee.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Dye) has put forward an argument which is equally incomprehensible. There is nothing in this Amendment which suggests that supervisory orders should be issued. The question of the extent to which supervisory orders should be issued is not touched by the Amendment. It is simply whether the Minister should have power to issue them uncontrollably or under certain circumstances, and the hon. Gentleman's argument, therefore, seems to be completely nonsensical.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.275.1" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Baldwin" colnum="275" time="">
<p>I beg to move, in page 8, line 36, to leave out "appointed by the Minister," and to insert:
<q>to be selected from the panel of persons appointed under paragraph 5 of the Second Schedule of the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1923.</q>
In moving this Amendment may I first call attention to a printer's error on the Amendment paper. Reference is made to paragraph 6 of the Second Schedule, and it should be paragraph 5. We are now coming to a Clause which is causing more heartburning in the agricultural world than any other in the Bill. The Minister rather taunted us on this side of the House with having accepted Part I very quickly and making a considerable amount of fuss about Part II. May I remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the reason why Part I was passed through so quickly was that you decided that the first Amendment on the Order Paper should not be called. If that Amendment had been called, I can assure the Minister that he would not yet have arrived at Part II.<br/>
This is the Clause which forms the chains in which the industry has agreed to bind itself in return for what it is promised in Part I, and it is to see that justice is accorded to the landlord or the tenant if either is aggrieved that I am moving this Amendment. I should declare that I have some interest in this matter, and that I am, or rather was, on the panel of arbitrators. I have not acted for the last two years, and I do not intend to act&#x2014;in fact, the Minister said upstairs that there were

some names on the panel that he would like to remove, and it is possible that by this time he has put his pencil through my name. The argument the Minister uses with regard to the arbitration Clause is that a tenant or a landlord is protected because he has to have a decision made by the county executive committee. May I call attention to the wording of this Clause where it says that the Minister must be
<q>satisfied that the owner of agricultural land is not fulfilling his responsibilities to manage &#x2026;</q>
He has to be satisfied by going down one step in the ladder to the county executive committees, and the county executive committees accept advice from the district committees, while the district committees accept advice from some smaller committee. The danger that the agricultural industry sees is that this decision of the Minister's should be influenced through the various stages by a small committee who may not be practical agriculturists and who may not be the right sort of persons to deal with such a question.<br/>
I can assure the Minister that in spite of all the glowing words he used about the executive and district committees, they were not all angels, and it is in order to protect any aggrieved persons from a decision which is wrong that I hope the Minister will accept this Amendment. He knows full well that bad decisions were come to by executive committees during the war. I know that he will reply that it was the decision of the right hon. Member for Woodford (Mr. Churchill) that


there should be no appeal from dispossession cases. I do not defend that. I always condemned the fact that there was no right of appeal, and I am condemning it today. It is the inherent right of every Englishman to have the right of appeal to another tribunal if he is dissatisfied with a decision which has been given against him. That is all I am asking for, and the reason why I want the decision to be made by someone from the panel of arbitrators is that they are independent, and the industry would feel that a decision given by one of the members will not be affected by Ministerial influence. I hope to get the support of the leader of the Communist Party, the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher), for this Amendment. I am sorry that he is not here. He supported this appeal on the Hill Farming Bill and it was carried, much to the annoyance, I believe, of the Minister. I hope the right hon. Gentleman will not feel annoyed with hon. Members on both sides of the House who fall in with the suggestion which I have put forward.<br/>
The names on the panel of arbitrators are the names of those sent forward to the Lord Chief Justice, and they are drawn, from various professional bodies, having been selected for their practical knowledge and integrity. They are men who are familiar with the whole industry, and in my opinion they are men who will give a fair decision whether it is for or against the Minister. During the war we had decisions brought to light on several occasions which were bad decisions. There was no right of appeal from a dispossession order though there was the right of appeal when a landlord gave his tenant notice to quit and asked the county executive committee for a certificate that the tenant was not farming according to the rules of good husbandry. The decision of the county executive was upset on many occasions, and quite rightly too.<br/>
I was interested in one case where the owner of a farm was himself farming as a tenant. As a member of a district committee I helped to dispossess him of his farm. He owned a farm himself, and he said, "It I am farming badly, my tenant is farming worse and I will get rid of him." He applied to the county committee for a certificate of bad farming and we as a small committee advised the county executive of Worcester that the certificate should Lot be issued. There was a right of appeal

to the committee and both sides attended. At once the chairman of the executive committee, by his opening statement, showed that he was not there to decide whether the tenant was farming according to the rules of good husbandry, but he was going to make a decision on the fact that the landlord was a bad landlord. We felt at the very outset that we were up against a brick wail, and the decision was that the man was not farming according to good husbandry although we showed that he had never reaped the work that he had done in three years. That shows that an executive committee is not infallible. We appealed to the arbitrator of the same county in which this decision was made, and without any hesitation he upset the decision of the county executive committee. That illustrates what will happen under the new set-up if there is not some form of appeal. I know that the Minister has said that the county executive committees will be composed of practical men. No doubt some of them will be, but some of them will not be. What I want to point out is that of the set-up of 12 members it is proposed to include only three farmers, two landlords&#x2014;</p>

<p>And two labourers. If there was an appeal from the decision of the executive committee on the question of labourers I should be very interested to know what it would be. The hon. Member for Northern Norfolk (Mr. Gooch) has got this particular grievance in his mind. If the agricultural labourers were interested in this Bill I should be willing that they be given equal representation. The landowners are interested in this Bill and they are only a small minority on the executive committee. It is for that reason that I and my hon. Friends maintian that an aggrieved person should have the right of appeal, and I hope that the Minister will see his way to give it. Let us realise what the absence of such an appeal during the war really meant. At the present time there is a Motion before the House signed by some 37 Members asking for a Royal Commission to be set up to deal with cases of dispossessed farmers during the war. I did not put my name to that, because I do not agree with many of the cases quoted, but it is to avoid grievances of that kind that I ask for the right of appeal to be included in the Bill.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I want to deal with it in rather wider terms than those used by my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Baldwin). This is the first occasion on which this expression "representation to the Minister" occurs in the Bill, though it is there later on and it is also used in a number of cases, the most of which vary according to circumstances. The Solicitor-General on the Committee stage attempted to make it clear that this was an appeal. He said, in effect, that this was an appeal because the farmers concerned could make their case after it was considered by the full committee and in that sense it was an appeal; I wonder whether any rational man really considers that it is an appeal to take a case to a body, a considerable proportion of which has already judged the issue.<br/>
I am bound to say that I think that the great majority of people would reject that as any kind of appeal at all. I suggested to the Parliamentary Secretary on that occasion that at any rate the Minister's Land Commissioner might be a suitable person to bring a fresh mind to bear on the subject. I am afraid that owing to the fact that the Solicitor-General was unaware that there was such a person as a Land Commissioner&#x2014;he took it to mean a member of the Land Commission, which is something quite different&#x2014; that question was never taken up. The point we are making is that in an appeal against the decision of the committee a fresh mind should be brought to bear. My hon. Friend suggests that the single arbitrator should be the man to apply a fresh mind to the question, and that is reasonable because it has been the case to such an extent under the old powers. The Solicitor-General rejected our similar demands in Standing Committee because, he said, the Government did not want the whole matter to be re-opened. That in itself implies that the case has already been judged. If you refuse to accept the principle that a new mind should be brought in to consider the subject then surely you are also admitting that the case, on re-presentation to the Committee, has been prejudged.<br/>
I consider that the single arbitrator is a very reasonable compromise between

the two points of view. I know that some of my hon. Friends would like to see this particular provision that where supervision&#x2014;a very heavy penalty&#x2014;is to be inflicted on a man, the case should go to the land tribunal. I can see that there is some force in the argument of the Minister that that would add excessively to the work of the land tribunal, but here there are single arbitrators. They are all practical men who know their job and have had practice in this difficult matter of deciding points of fact. They have been used throughout the industry, they are trusted, and it seems to me that there would be no delay and complete fairness. On the one side, the man about to be placed under supervision would receive fair treatment and, on the other side, the Minister and his agents, the committees, would be quite certain that their case also would have adequate weight given to it. For these and other reasons which I will not develop now, I urge upon the Minister that this is a reasonable Amendment, and one which should be accepted.</p>

<p>I am rather surprised that the hon. Gentleman who moved this Amendment should have concentrated so much upon appeal tribunals and dispossessions&#x2014;as if dispossession had anything to do with this Clause. All the hon. Member's wartime experience is apparently vitiating his point of view at the moment, and because of that I do not think he sees the thing quite as clearly as might be the.case. It is true that in Committee hon. Members opposite tried to provide for appeal to the land tribunal before a person could be placed under supervision. That Amendment was rejected by the Standing Committee, and the present Amendment is designed to ignore the Committee once again and to- allow an arbitrator to decide whether a person should or should not be placed under supervision. That is contrary to the whole spirit of this Bill, which is designed on the basis of the control of the industry from within. Hon. Members opposite want it to be controlled from without. Indeed, this Amendment means control of the industry by an arbitrator, and not by a county agricultural committee.<br/>
The hon. Member for Ripon (Mr. York) referred to the heavy penalty imposed upon a person who is placed under supervision. What sort of heavy penalty, and


for what? After all, no person can be placed under supervision except for bad farming or bad estate management. Therefore, it cannot be described as a heavy penalty and, in any case it is only after a person has been receiving the advice, guidance, and help of a county agricultural committee for a considerable period and has, perhaps, had many warnings that a decision is finally taken to place him under a supervision order. Subsection (1) provides that before making a supervision order the Minister must afford the owner or occupier an opportunity to make representations to the county executive committee in writing, or by being heard by a person appointed by the Minister. That provision runs throughout the Bill, and the county agricultural committees are the persons who would hear the representations of the person concerned. After all, despite what the hon. Gentleman said about his particular county, I think that county executive committees throughout the country have been composed of reasonable men. When he refers to there being only three farmers on one particular committee I can only say that I do not know it. Throughout the period from 1939 to 1947 there have been, on the average, nearer nine than three farmers on each of these Committees.</p>

<p>The hon. Member speaks of the past when he refers to what happened during the war, then tries to relate that to the future, and the result is that no one knows just where he is at any given moment. If he will stand by his wartime experience when there were approximately nine farmers on every county executive committee, instead of thinking in terms of the possibility of a minimum of three in future, we shall understand what he is talking about. I do not accept the theory that either landowners or farmers, or technical agriculturists or agricultural scientists, are not able to decide whether or not a person should be placed under supervision. I feel that it is the county executive committees, which are responsible to the Minister&#x2014;who is in turn responsible to Parliament&#x2014;who should decide whether or not a person should be placed under supervision.</p>

<p>Is the Minister saying that the appeal of the individual in such a case is to be made to the county agricultural committee, and that the same committee are responsible for issuing the order or recommending it to the Minister? In other words, is he saying that the appeal is to the same people who have in fact issued the Order through the Minister? The right hon. Gentleman knows, from his experience during the whole of the war, the number of times when the Minister did not exercise his power, which was the main cause for hundreds of injustices.</p>

<p>I do not accept the statement of the hon. Member. He suggests that there were hundreds of instances throughout the war, but so far as I have been able to ascertain there were very few instances indeed. Of course, during the war, there was no such body as the agricultural land tribunal. For every case where dispossession is proposed, as distinct from supervision, there is an appeal to the agricultural land tribunal. I could give the hon. Member figures for this year of the number of appeals that have been heard by the appeal tribunals. However, we are speaking now not about dispossessing a landowner but merely of placing a person under supervision in order to help him to improve his farming, and to reach a high standard of efficiency. It is not a proposal to "down" the person, as is frequently thought by some hon. Members opposite.<br/>
Who is more capable of deciding the issue whether a person should be put under supervision or not than the county executive committee? They have had the case of the particular farm under review for perhaps 12 months or 18 months before they reached that point. It is not a matter for an arbitrator but for the county executive committee, who know all the facts and the farmer, and know what they have done to try to help and advise him, and the warnings which they have given him. Before placing a person under supervision they will listen to any representations he may care to make. They will say, "You may bring along a friend, if you wish, a practical farmer or otherwise, to show cause why you should not be placed under supervision."<br/>
It seems to me that there could not be anything more democratic and more calculated to provide the atmosphere of


control of the industry from within than the policy that we are pursuing. It would clearly be wrong if the county executive committee&#x2014;the appropriate body to which representations should be made&#x2014;were sidestepped and the case submitted to an arbitrator. What would happen in the last analysis would be that the committee would learn only at second-hand, of the proceedings before the arbitrator and of the evidence submitted to him. We think that they must hear the views of the parties themselves and not learn them at second-hand. What is more, the party concerned would have no right of access to the county executive committee, if the Amendment now proposed were accepted. I do not know whether the mover and seconder of the Amendment appreciate that the landowner or tenant involved would have no right of access to the committee.</p>

<p>It would destroy the very basis of co-operation on which the Bill has been built up. The committees consist of practical agriculturists, whether they be landowners, farmers or agricultural workers. They are the persons who can best weigh all the evidence when representations are made. The Amendment would undermine completely the authority of the committees and divest them of the responsibility they carry. Despite the plea made by the mover and seconder, I ask the House without hesitation to reject the Amendment.</p>

<p>From the speech of the Minister of Agriculture one might not have thought that this matter had been discussed before at all, or that the Amendment which we have moved, was defeated only by a majority of one in the Standing Committees. One would not have thought, for example, that two members of the right hon. Gentleman's own party opposite expressed views strongly in favour of the line we are taking. That is all left to me to bring to the attention of the House. I am very glad to do it. The object of the Report stage is that everybody should know all the facts. I would recall that the hon. and gallant Member for King's Lynn (Major Wise) said he hoped that the Minister would have another look at this

point. The hon. and learned Member for Gloucester (Mr. Turner-Samuels) who always had a great deal to say in the Committee, was in support of our view. It all arose because not until we reached Clause 101&#x2014;as it now is&#x2014;did it really come out what "making representations" in this case meant. The Minister quite rightly said that that was a thing which runs as a sort of thread right through the Bill. It was discovered that making representations "to a person appointed by the Minister" meant making them to the people who had taken the decision in the first place.<br/>
If the Minister will not accept our Amendment I beg him to redraft the words round about lines 32 to 34 so that anyone reading the Bill for the first time will understand what it means. In simple language, the effect of the Bill at the moment is, as it has now been discovered, that the Minister has to afford to the person an opportunity
<q>of making representations to the Minister, whether in writing or on being heard by a person appointed by the Minister.</q>
That is what the Bill says. The Minister may first offer an opportunity to people to make representations to himself, but in both cases "himself" means not the Minister as a physical entity, but the county agricultural executive committee. Therefore, we ought to write into the Bill that when there is a question of a supervision order the county executive committee shall afford the owner or occupier an opportunity of making representations to the county agricultural executive committee, whether in writing or on being heard by a person selected by the county executive committee. In fact, it is the committee themselves, in three different roles. The Minister's answer is that they are the right people all the time. If we accept that, let the right hon. Gentleman say so, so that any one reading Clause 12 will recognise that that is what it means. Ordinary people reading Clause 12 at present will think that the Minister will arrange that a person will have his case brought before a person appointed by the Minister and will never believe that the Minister is really going round and round in circles, and that it is the county executive committee acting for the Minister all the time.<br/>
The Minister charged us with wanting to get an appeal against orders of the


land tribunal, and said we were now trying to get a form of appeal before an arbitrator. As a matter of fact, that is not so. It is not surprising that he misunderstood, since our Amendment which deals with that matter was not called. If the Amendment which we had down for the recommittal stage had been called, the right hon. Gentle- man would have seen that it is still our desire to have an eventual appeal to the land tribunal. That is another matter. We are now talking about an earlier stage, where the Minister says, "You have a perfect right to go and make representations." The whole point at issue between us is: To whom are those representations to be made, before the supervision order is made? The right hon. Gentleman always comes back to the same point of playing down the effect of supervision orders. He says that, as a matter of fact, this is machinery which is meant to be very helpful. One would almost conceive that every farmer would go to his executive committee and ask, "Let me have a supervision order. It is such a delightful thing and is going to do me such a lot of good."</p>

<p>I am learning some of the ideas at the back of the minds of hon. Members opposite. The Minister certainly gives us the impression that so far from being harmful it is something very helpful, and that everything will be very good when there is a supervision order. I do not think that the bulk of people look upon any form of disciplining, even the highest form which you in the Chair, Mr. Speaker, exercise over us, as any fun at all. The Home Secretary, as an old school-teacher, will know. One may realise in after years that it was very good. I do not suppose that at the time any of his victims thought it was such fun.<br/>
It may be that in the long run people who have been under supervision orders may think that that form of discipline was a good thing, but it does not follow that the Minister is correct in his bland assumption that everyone will enjoy themselves under a supervision order, and enjoy themselves particularly, because the county committees are such an agreeable body of men. It does not follow that they all feel that way, because they do not. They feel that they ought to be heard and

that they should be able to make representations to someone. Because of that we do not think it is right that the Bill should remain as drafted. In defending the general outline the Solicitor-General went so far as to say that the result of this was that the person affected is given the right of insisting on having his case known. That, I am sorry to say, was met by laughter by the Committee because it did not seem to be a very big concession. The Solicitor-General said&#x2014;and indeed the Minister said it too:
<q>If you are to hinder and fetter agricultural committees by saying that they cannot arrive at any decision without knowing that it will be reviewed by somebody who is altogether independent it will be quite impossible for them to carry on and operate this Bill."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL, REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A,</i> 17th April, 1947, C. 974.]</q>
There was no laughter after that statement. It was a very strange one coming from one of our legal advisers. To say that anybody's actions are going, to be fettered by the mere knowledge that some decision they make may be taken to appeal&#x2014;even the most wrongful decision&#x2014;was rather shocking.<br/>
I ask the Minister to consider this again. There is a case here which was supported by some of his own hon. Friends, and if the Liberal Party had been present on that morning&#x2014;I do not know where they were&#x2014;we should have carried this Amendment at an earlier stage. No doubt the Liberal Party went to a party meeting and were not able to give us the support in the Lobby which they are morally giving us today. They agree with us on this issue, as many other people do. I ask the Minister to accede to the very wise alternative suggestion put forward by my hon. Friend or else let him redraft the words of the Bill and make it quite clear so that everybody really understands that making representations is a completely futile thing to do.</p>

<p>I join with the right hon. and gallant Member for Gainsborough (Captain Crookshank) in his appeal to the Minister. I doubt whether I can make such a good speech in support of this Amendment as the Minister did. It was only his strong dogged Yorkshire tenacity which prevented him seeing the strength of his own argument. May I remind the House of the position. The Minister's words are very well worth reproduction. When dealing with this


Clause in Committee he expressed a view which did not go quite so far as the view he expressed today. He did not indicate at that time that a supervision order was something quite so desirable as he rather gave the House to understand this afternoon. The words he then used did not indicate that farmers were likely to jump at the opportunity of being placed under a supervision order. He said:
<q>&#x2026; let me at once make it perfectly clear that a supervision order is not necessarily a disciplinary measure."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A,</i> 25th February, 1947; c. 208.]</q>
I emphasise the words "not necessarily." It is perfectly true that it is not necessarily a disciplinary measure, but the probability is that it is the first step towards a disciplinary measure. Therefore it is only right and fair that at that stage when the supervision order is first brought into action, the facts of the case should be ascertained where they are in dispute between the two parties concerned, on the one hand the county agricultural committee and on the other hand the farmer, whether he be the landlord or the tenant farmer. That is undoubtedly an issue, and in fact the Minister recognised it later on when he said:
<q>There is one thing that I should like to point out. He"&#x2014;</q>
that is to say, the person who is likely to be put under the supervision order&#x2014;
<q>will be tried"&#x2014;</q>
I emphasise the words "be tried"&#x2014;
<q>not by officials but by his own peers."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A,</i> 25th February, 1947; c. 209.]</q>
&#x2014;referring to the members of the county agricultural committee. When one uses the expression of a person being tried, surely it presupposes an entirely different attitude and atmosphere to someone who is gladly yielding to a suggestion that he should be put under a supervision order. In what he has said today the Minister has put an entirely different complexion on what supervision orders are and what they are going to mean to farmers than he did when he was discussing the matter upstairs. With regard to the actual procedure, let me again quote the Minister's words. He said:
<q>What will actually happen in practice"&#x2014;</q>
I quite agree that it is what will actually happen in practice&#x2014;

<q>is that members of a district committee will, perhaps, declare that a person's farm is not what it ought to be. They will have watched the farm over a long period of time"&#x2014;</q>
I emphasise that expression to the House:
<q>They will have watched the farm over a long period of time"&#x2014;</q>
that must mean that they have for a long time been in contact with the person whom it is proposed to put under a supervision order. They know one another's case. If one likes to use the analogy of a trial, they know one another's case from beginning to end. The Minister went on to say that they:
<q>&#x2026; will have spoken to the farmer at the beginning, not in unpleasant terms, but in the terms of the old school tie.</q>
The Minister knows what representatives he is going to appoint to the Committees and so we must accept that they will speak in the terms of the old school tie, whatever that may mean. The Minister went on:
<q>They will say to him that things are not looking too good on field No. 444 or field No. 443, and they will do their best to advise him &#x2026;</q>
and so on&#x2014;
<q>It after all this advice, he still fails, then, finally, he is warned that he is likely to be put under a supervision order."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee A,</i> 25th February, 1947; c. 208.]</q>
The sole point we make in support of this Amendment is what is the advantage&#x2014;what difference can it make&#x2014;in giving to a person who is being served with a supervision order the right to make representations to the very people who have been looking over his farm, who have been in contact with him, who have been talking to him in terms of the "old school tie," who have then been talking to him in, apparently, somewhat different terms, and who, finally, have been suggesting to him that they are warning him he is to be put under a supervision order? What difference will it make to him, and what good will it be to him, to have the right to go back to those people and make representations, with or without a friend? I feel that the Minister is putting into the Bill a provision&#x2014;perhaps unintentionally&#x2014;the only result of which can be to mislead the farmer, or the person who is to be put under a supervision order, that he has some right of appeal against an order which will affect him, his farm and his career, whether as


a farmer or a landlord, for a considerable period of time.<br/>
It is all very well to say that there may be opportunities of appeal later on, but it cannot but be derogatory to his reputation, in whatever branch of the profession he may be practicing, to be put under a supervision order, and it is at the time he is put under that order that the matter should be independently assessed to see whether or not the facts justify the supervision order being made. It is utterly impossible for those facts to be assessed in an unbiased and independent way by the committee which has, through all that period of time, been working up to the point where finally it has come to the conclusion that a supervision order is necessary. I appeal to the House on grounds of fairness, honesty, straight dealing and common sense, to agree that the Amendment is right and proper, and to accept it.</p>

We are now finding it extremely difficult to find fitting machinery whereby the small farmer&#x2014;because it is the small farmer who has to fight for his independence here&#x2014;can have a proper right of appeal in regard to supervision.

good committees in some counties and bad committees in other counties. What guarantee is there under the provisions of this Bill that the small farmer, who may have been struggling for 20 years in conditions for which he was not entirely responsible&#x2014;</p>

<p>No, I am not dealing with dispossession, but with supervision. I happen to have represented an agricultural constituency for a good many years and this is not the first time we have had to discuss this problem. Will the Minister guarantee that all the things which he now promises are within the terms of the Bill? Will he guarantee that the committees are really going to assist the farmer to run the farm? Will he guarantee that the farmer's credit will not be damaged? Will he give an assurance that the farmer's standing and status in the local agricultural community will not be damaged? The right hon.

Gentleman find some appropriate form of words so that he can honestly say that he is finding an independent form of appeal for the small farmer when he is being subjected to supervision? Considering the experience we had with the war agricultural executive committees and the number of injustices and hardships that were caused, I am amazed that the best that a Labour Minister of Agriculture can do to safeguard the independence of small farmers is to provide this inadequate machinery. When this is known even to the right hon. Gentleman's own supporters in the country, it will be said that, whereas he had a great opportunity he has lost that opportunity by not giving the proper machinery.</p>

<p>I am very depressed by the Debate that has taken place. It has destroyed another one of my illusions. I was always under the impression that hon. Gentlemen opposite had the greatest interest in seeing that there was the very best husbandry of the land. I had always believed that they had some trust in the judgment of their peers on the county executive committees. I had always felt that with regard to this Bill, a great deal of which they support, they would not,


as they are doing tonight, play down the question of supervision. I do not know whether it is a question of playing up or playing down. I think hon. Gentlemen opposite said that the Minister was playing down the question of supervision, so perhaps it would be right to say that they are playing up the difficulties of supervision when they ought really to be doing propaganda in favour of it, if they believe in good husbandry. What we want to get out of this Bill, in return for what we are giving in Part I, which hon. Members opposite accept with the greatest alacrity, is the very best that can be got out of the land. Surely, it is a fact that all farmers are to some extent under supervision all the time by the executive committees? The executive committees are watching to see whether the land is being cultivated, whether it is in good heart, and whether there is good husbandry by the farmers. If not, how is it that any farm at any one time comes under the suspicion of the county committees? There is some watching going on all the time, and we feel that is right, if we are to get out of the Bill what we hope to get from it. There comes a point at which the watching which the executive committee must do becomes so positive that they have to tell the farmer, "We are going to watch your land for a year or i8 months in order to get to know what is happening on your farm, and if at the end of that time we feel that you really need help, we hope you will take the help that supervision gives.</p>

<p>It is right both in theory and in practice, and if it is not, it is up to hon. Gentlemen because they have representation in those areas. They know the farmers on the executive committees, and it is part of their job, as it is of ours, to see that the executive committees do their work properly. I hope we shall have the co-operation of all hon. Members opposite in trying to get farmers to co-operate with the executive committees. I hope they will not think them all unworthy and not to be trusted. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] But hon. Gentlemen opposite have been

talking tonight in that very strain&#x2014;that the executive committees are there to "do down" their friends. What we want is that you should try to get co-operation. You should be out in your areas doing propaganda to show how important these executive committees are, showing that you do trust them, that they are to do a job of work in co-operation with this House&#x2014;</p>

<p>I apologise, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. Hon. Members should be doing propaganda to get farmers to accept the importance and the standing of these executive committees as bodies who are engaged, with them, in getting the very best out of the land in their areas. If that is so, and if the members of the executive committees have been running the farms until the time they have been put under supervision, how ridiculous it is that we should ask for some independent person, with no knowledge of the situation, to come in and act as judge in the case of an appeal. Hon. Members opposite say that somebody should come with a fresh mind; but it is not a fresh mind that is needed, it is somebody with full knowledge of what is going on in the farms. What is wanted is an impartial tribunal&#x2014;impartial in the sense that they want the best out of the land, but with full knowledge of what is going on in the farms. Those are the people who, in the opinion of the Minister and most of us on this side, are best capable of judging whether the farms should be put under supervision.</p>

<p>At the moment I am talking about this Amendment and its relation to this Clause. This Amendment suggests that there should be an appeal to some persons selected from this panel who would not know the facts of the case but would come, as has been said, with a fresh mind&#x2014;in this case with an uninformed mind. I say it is much better that the people to whom the appeal is


made should be people who know something about the situation. Therefore I appeal to the Minister to reject this Amendment, and I appeal to hon. Members opposite not to be led away by carping criticism, but to go to their constituencies and do propaganda as we on our side are doing propaganda.</p>

<p>The real difference between hon. Members on this side and hon. Members opposite is in regard to what we think of a supervision order, and the stage at which an appeal to an independent person should be possible. There is a view held by many hon. Members opposite that a supervision order is a friendly act; that the recipient of a supervision order will welcome it with both hands and, if it comes at Christmas time, will put it on his mantelpiece with such Christmas cards as he may get. There is the other point of view, which we hold, that a supervision order will not be widely welcomed. The intention of the county committee may be all right, but a supervision order casts a slur on the man who receives it because, as the Minister said, it means that he is suspected of being a bad farmer or a bad landlord, and it may be the first step to something much more serious, namely, ultimate dispossession. We believe, therefore, that is only fair there should be an appeal to an independent source.<br/>
I agree that to attempt to ask the agricultural tribunal to listen to appeals against every supervision order would be to overload grossly that body. That is why we suggested that the appeal against a supervision order should go to an independent arbitrator from the panel under the 1923 Act. As a matter of fact, the right hon. Gentleman knows that there are several references in the Bill already to such an arbitrator. In Clauses 36 and 38 there is reference to an arbitrator from the panel laid down under the 1923 Act. It seems to us to be a curious form of appeal&#x2014;though I do not think "appeal" is the right word to use&#x2014;which is now suggested, namely, that a man appeals against a supervision order to the body of men who are issuing that order. Actually the word is "representations" but the average landowner or farmer reading the Bill, and not acquainted with the niceties of Parliamentary language,

seeing the word "representations" will take it to mean "appeal."<br/>
It would be better, if the right hon. Gentleman will not accept this, to cut out the phrase altogether and make it clear that the only form of representation which the recipient of a supervision order can make is to those who serve the order on him. Nobody suggests that every county committee is infallible. I know hon. Members opposite referred to them in Committee as "all-wise bodies of men," but "all-wise bodies of men," some of whom may be appointed by the Minister, are occasionally fallible. My hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Baldwin) quoted in a different context cases where war agricultural executive committees had made unwise decisions and where appeals against those decisions had been upheld. The Minister said there was not injustice generally. I do not think we ought to be concerned with the question of whether injustice is done, or is likely to be done, in 50 or 100 cases. What we should be concerned with is to see, as far as is humanly possible, that no injustice is done in one single case because if this Parliament means anything, it means that the right of even one individual should be assured. That is why I beg the right hon. Gentleman to think about this Amendment again and, in order to gain the confidence of the farming community, to agree with us that an appeal against a supervision order should be made, not to those who serve it but to an independent arbitrator from the panel laid down under the 1923 Act.</p>

<p>When the right hon. Gentleman, in chiding us for having failed in our attempt to get an appeal to the land tribunal, said that we were now seeking to set up a panel to which an appeal could be made, he was slightly unfair. My right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Captain Crookshank) said that a great many of us did not realise until the later stages of the Bill in the Committee&#x2014;until what is now Clause 101 was reached&#x2014;that in point of fact the opportunity of making representations to the Minister only meant making representations to the agricultural executive committee which had already considered and decided upon the case. That knowledge came as a real shock, not


only to us but also, I think to hon. Members opposite on the Committee. As far as I remember, when we asked why the right hon. Gentleman took the trouble to provide an opportunity for making representations to the Minister, he said it was in case some new fact had come to light, which was not in the possession of the executive committee when they arrived at their decision. Tonight he told us that in point of fact the executive committee are the right people to deal with these questions, because they are the people in possession of all the facts. There is a psychological question involved here. It is important when a supervision notice is served, whether on a landlord or a farmer, that he should feel not only that justice is done, but that he has received justice from the Minister.<br/>
I can understand the arguments of the hon. Lady the Member for Epping (Mrs. Manning), from her point of view. But, as has been pointed out, some of us take a slightly different view of a supervision order. If one feels there is no particular slur in receiving a supervision order, it is difficult to see why we should go to such pains to put into the Bill an opportunity for representations to be made to the Minister. If we took the point of view of the hon. Lady we should let the executive committee consider the case and decide on it. But, it would appear from the wording of the Clause that the Minister wants to give some opportunity for an appeal for further consideration of the case. In point of fact we have now found that any further consideration is to be by the people who have already taken a decision. It is leading the farmer or landlord "up the garden path," to leave words in the Bill which would lead to the belief that there is an appeal, but which would not be considered by any legal authority as giving a right of appeal.</p>

<p>Probably I am the only hon. Member who was not a member of the Standing Committee who has spoken in the Debate. Having listened to the arguments, I am convinced that my hon. Friends have put forward a case which has not been answered by the Minister. We have been taunted by the hon. Lady the Member for Epping (Mrs. Manning) who suggested that, presumably, we did not wish to get the best out of the land. We do not believe we can get the best out of the land, if at the same time perpetrate an injustice. We feel that a grave injustice is being done to the small farmer by not allowing him a proper right of appeal. The right hon. Gentleman is underestimating the opposition which his attitude this evening will create in the farming industry. Is his Bill designed to assist the farmers? Has he consulted the farmers? Do the farmers consider the attitude he is taking up will be helpful to them?&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Yes."]&#x2014; I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman is not going the right way about getting the good will of the industry first by trying to mislead farmers into thinking they have a right of appeal, and then when the cat is let out of the bag, saying that it is merely a question of putting people under supervision; that it is not so bad really and that they can be dealt with quite fairly. Those arguments will fool no one, and the Minister would be wise in his own interests, let alone those of farming, to give the farmer a proper opportunity for appeal, which is the normal right any Englishman would expect under those circumstances.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 9, line 15, to leave out from "Subsection," to the end of line 16, and to insert:
<q>as soon as may be after the expiration 01 twelve months from the coming into operation of the order, and, where one or more reviews have already been held under this Subsection in relation to the order, such a review shall be held as soon as may be after the expiration of twelve months from the previous or last such review.</q>
This Amendment and the subsequent Amendment in my name in page 9, to leave out lines 22 to 24, go together. They are necessary in view of the new Clause, which provides that in the case of each annual review, when either the owner or occupier is under supervision, either party may request the committee to dispossess the owner or occupier as the case may be. If the committee refuse, then one or the other may appeal to the land tribunal. In view of this new right which is attached to the annual review, it is clearly desirable that the first review should take place after the Minister's power of dispossession has arrived, namely, after the first 12 months of supervision. Under Clause 12 (2) as at present drafted, the first review would have to be held during the first 12 months' supervision, before the Minister has any power of dispossession at all. The effect of these two Amendments is to make sure that the first review shall take place as soon as possible after the first year of supervision has elapsed. Subsequent reviews would, of course, be approximately at annual

intervals. Hon. Members will appreciate the need for these two Amendments.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 9, line 16, at the end, to insert:
<q>and upon any change taking place in the ownership or occupation of the land or agricultural unit.</q>
There were certain complaints earlier today from the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison) and other hon. Members opposite that they had not been able to master the meaning and intention of some of cur Amendments. This one will be well within the comprehension of all. Clause 12, as we all now know, is the Clause, which enables the Minister to place art owner or occupier under a supervision order. Subsection (2) lays down that when a supervision order is in force it must be reviewed from time to time, and paragraph (2, <i>a</i>) lays down that it shall be reviewed once every 12 months. We want to extend that provision so that the order will also be reviewed whenever the land or farm changes ownership. This is necessary and desirable. When a new farmer takes over a farm which is under a supervision order, there should be some form of valuation or assessment so that the Minister can see later what improvements have taken place during the 12 months, and so that possibly he may remove the supervision order. When a new tenant comes in, we think he should


have 12 clear months in which to reorganise the farm before it is again inspected with a view to seeing whether the supervision order can be removed. As the Minister no doubt is aware, we have several Amendments on the Order Paper which seek to ensure that when a new tenant or farmer comes in he is no longer subject to a supervision order. Whether or not those Amendments are accepted, the matter should be reviewed when a new tenant takes over, and he should have 12 clear months before it is reviewed again so that he can have a proper opportunity to improve the condition of the farm.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
What we are suggesting is in accordance with the best traditions of good estate management. It is exactly what any owner or his agent, or both, would do if they could. When a new tenant came in, they would look at the holding as he took it over so that they would know later whether or not he had improved it or whether he had let it down. It is in accordance with the custom of taking a schedule of condition. I hope the Amendment will be favourably received.</p>

<p>We have every sympathy with the arguments put forward, and I do not think there is any difference between us. I suggest that the Amendment is really unnecessary. Clause 13 provides that:
<q>where a supervision order is in force in respect of an owner or occupier, any disposition of land to which the order relates &#x2026; whereby some other person becomes the owner or occupier of that land shall not, unless approved by the Minister either before or after the disposition is completed, affect the continued operation of the supervision order.</q>
The saving words there to ensure the purpose expressed by hon. Members opposite are, "unless approved by the Minister." The Clause provides that where there is a change of ownership or occupation, any supervision order in relation to the land shall continue unless the new owner or occupier is approved by the Minister. Therefore, it will be open to the parties concerned to ask the Minister for his approval and, in that way, for the lifting of the supervision order. This will mean automatically that the question of the continuation of the supervision order will have to be reviewed. If the new owner is satisfactory, it will be possible

for the Minister to remove the order and let the new owner go in and continue to manage the property.</p>

<p>I do not think anybody on this side of the House and, I suspect, this applies also to quite a number of hon. Members opposite could accept such an easy and fallacious way out of the difficulties propounded by my hon. Friends. If the argument is carried to its logical conclusion it means that the Government propose that the disposition of all land, whether in ownership or by tenure, if the land has once been subjected to a supervision order, should be at the disposal and in the hands of the Government of the day. There was no such intention when this Bill was first drafted. These supervision orders are personal orders against an inefficient landlord or tenant. We in the Conservative Party wholly agree with His Majesty's Government that bad landlords and bad tenants should have some sanction against them if they are to get the advantages which some parts of this Bill confer.<br/>
8.45 p.m.<br/>
These are personal disabilities under which only an incompetent landlord or tenant should labour. There comes a change and a new man comes along. Surely he should not be subjected to the disability which his predecessor suffered. Now the Paymaster-General is suggesting that the incoming landlord or tenant, if he wants to avoid the penalties of his predecessor, must get the Minister's sanction before he buys the land or becomes the tenant of it. Since when has one been obliged to go to a Government Department and ask permission to buy a piece of British land, which, after all, is the common heritage of all of us. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] Most certainly. The eager anxiety with which the Co-operative movement in this country is trying to buy up the land of England&#x2014;</p>

<p>With all respect, I think I am in Order in pointing out that there is a natural anxiety among all sections of the community, not limited to those who historically are regarded as the landowners of Great Britain, to own and cultivate the land of this country. We


welcome this interest which the Government of the day are showing in it. What we very much object to is the assumption that an incoming landowner or tenant, if he Wants to avoid the sanction of Clause 12, must get the Minister's permission before he buys the land or becomes the tenant, even though there has never been the slightest suggestion that he would be an incompetent landowner or tenant. We agree that if, after coming into such a place, a man continues the bad practices of the previous owner or tenant, he should himself be subject to a supervision order in his own turn, but he should wait until it has been proved that he is the sort of person who deserves that sort of sanction. The hon. Gentleman would not, I think, claim that he has ever himself either lived on the land, earned his living by it or been deeply concerned in the welfare of the people who do, and for him so easily to dismiss this as if all a man has to do is to ask the Minister's permission to become the landlord or tenant, is straining the credulity of this House a little far.<br/>
We believe that this Amendment should be carried and that, on any change taking place in the ownership or occupation of the land or of the agricultural unit concerned, the supervision order should lapse automatically, and that the incoming owner or tenant should be given a chance to prove that, as a free man in what we are always told is a free State, he can do his job properly. If he then fails to do it, we are at one with the Government in saying that sanctions should be imposed against him. This Amendment has the further effect that it will give a new owner or tenant a clear 12 months to put the old property in order and to show that he can so conduct himself that the penalties of this Clause need not be imposed against him. We look to the day&#x2014;and I think we, almost alone in the State, believe in private ownership&#x2014;when an ever increasing number of people will be able to own the soil of Britain. We are not in the least frightened of that development. We would like to ensure that the people who come along to establish their own stake in the country should not be penalised by the faults of their predecessors.</p>

<p>If the. Paymaster-General really has this sympathy, I wish he would

accept our method of giving expression to it. It would be very much better to accept our Amendment, and then perhaps he would be able to find it possible to omit Clause 13 from the Bill completely. If that could be done, the end would be served and the Bill would be simplified. There is a certain difference of opinion between us on this matter of supervision orders. We have always maintained that this supervision is really a personal matter, and it is utterly wrong that the stigma of supervision should be transferred from the person to the land. By this method, we are going to create in the countryside two different kind of markets for land&#x2014;one for land where there is a supervision order in force, and another for land where there is not. I think the Minister will find that there is the greatest reluctance among farm tenants to take land where a supervision order is in force. The hon. Lady the Member for Epping (Mrs. Manning) rather talked as if she was coaching backward children for examination, and she seemed to think that the average farmer would be only too glad to welcome this supervision as being some form of assistance. I can assure her that the truth is the very opposite of that, and that there will be a great feeling of shame among farmers when the county agricultural committee does put a man under supervision, and that they will be extremely reluctant to take such a farm. I hope the Minister will change his mind, because it is not too much to ask that he should accept this Amendment and agree with our objective.</p>

<p>The Minister of Agriculture is usually a very logical man, and argues in a logical manner, but, as the Bill now stands, it does not really make sense, because it suggests that the man should be supposed to be guilty before he is proved so. If the police go looking round public houses to find landlords who sell drink after hours, they are perfectly justified in doing so, but if the ownership or tenancy should change, the police are surely not justified in snooping round to see that drinks are not being sold after hours. Similarly, because the owners of land have been bad farmers in the past, why should a new tenant be considered to be a bad farmer before he starts? In this way, the Bill almost savours of persecution. The Amendment should not have been necessary at all, because the Clause itself should have been omitted.<br/>
As the Bill stands, the new tenant coming in may well be the best farmer in the country, but if he has to take over a farm which is under a supervision order, he may be as shy as some of us on this side of the House are of red tape and refuse to take it over. The Minister will thereby be defeating his own object of bringing a good farmer to that farm to get the land back into good heart again. Equally, the landlord who owns the farm will also be losing a good farmer, simply because he will not face taking on a farm which is under a supervision order. I believe that what is really at the back of the Minister's mind in this matter is the idea that a change of ownership may be brought about by starting a bogus company, so that a man who is placed under a supervision order may form a new company and start up again. If the Minister wants to legislate against that sort of thing, he ought to be able to do so, and I am sure that if he takes the advice of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he will receive a few tips on the way in which he should do it.</p>

<p>I hope the Minister will not accept this Amendment. I think that the way in which he proposes to deal with this problem is the better way. I hope it will not be necessary in very many cases to carry on a supervision order from one tenant to another or from one owner to another, but I think it is quite right that the Minister should have the opportunity of doing so if necessary. In the past, it has far too often been the case that land which had gone down remained down, and that a farm which had been badly farmed by one tenant was taken over again by another bad tenant. It was often a cheap farm, on which the buildings were bad, and which only a bad tenant would take over. This is the sort of thing which Clause 13 will prevent. If it is not bad enough to be taken over completely, the fact that the Minister's approval to the new tenant is required will mean that the land would be put in order, so that a tenant who is reasonably likely to farm well will be selected. I think it is much the better way of bringing a farm up to the condition in which it was kept under previous tenants or owners, rather than assuming that, once the ownership or tenancy is changed, the supervision order will be immediately released. I hope it will not, in fact, be necessary in changes of that sort to carry

on the supervision order, but I think it is necessary and that the best way of handling the matter is by giving the Minister the power to continue the order. The hon. Member for Mid-Bedford (Mr. Lennox-Boyd) never was in favour of any sort of sanctions, but&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am sorry, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, and I will not pursue the matter further. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Mid-Bedford set me a bad example in this matter. I think that this provision should be applied as a means of improving the farming or management of land. It is one that the Minister should preserve and I hope that he will not give way.</p>

<p>I am sorry to speak again, but, before we take a decision on this matter, I would like to bring the House back to the Amendment and what it seeks to do. The hon. Member for North Cumberland (Mr. W. Roberts) was very far removed from the Amendment in his speech, and I am afraid the Minister when he replied appeared to be replying to other Amendments which we have put down to Clause 13, and especially when he said that we wished to revoke a supervision order. That is not what this Amendment seeks to do at all. All it does ask is that there shall be a review when a new owner or occupier comes in, so that no new man takes over a farm unless there is some basis by which his work can be judged in the future.<br/>
If a review takes place when he takes over the farm, another review will have to take place in 12 months' time, when the Minister might possibly see that a great improvement has taken place and might be able to revoke the supervision order which, if he had nothing by which to judge the amount of improvement, he might not be able to do. I think that this is a most reasonable Amendment, and I am sorry that the Minister did not address


his remarks to it. As I say, this Amendment does not revoke a supervision order; all it says is that it shall be reviewed when a new tenant or a new occupier comes in.</p>

<p>Quite a lot has been said by hon. Members opposite to the effect that this particular Subsection is unfair. In my view, it is as reasonable as anything could be. First of all, if this Amendment had been properly worded, the effect would have been that, as soon as there was a change of ownership, there would no longer be a question of whether the Minister should review it or not; the review would be automatic, and the supervision order would cease. Suppose the change of ownership is built upon an attempt by the old owner, who is under a supervision order, to avoid the effect of that order by getting somebody else in in his place. What is going to happen? Is he to be allowed to defeat both the order and the Minister? This Clause does not say "at the end of 12 months"; it says "during each year." In other words, as soon as the new owner comes on to the scene, the Minister may, and naturally would, look into the matter at once, and, if he finds everything in order he can remove the supervision order. I cannot understand what complaint there can be against that.</p>

Therefore, there are two things before the review takes place. That defeats the whole idea behind this Amendment, and it should be rejected.</p>

If, on review, it is proved that there has been some collusive action whereby the old owner or tenant remains in charge, although legally he should not, then we would have no objection to the order being continued.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 11, line 40 after "Part I," to insert:
<q>or Part II in so far as such an improvement would if carried out alter the character of the holding.</q>
Subsection (1, <i>b</i>) lays down that where a supervision order is in force for the farming of an agricultural unit, the Minister may give such directions as he thinks necessary to secure that the unit is farmed in accordance with the rules of good husbandry. The Clause provides that such directions as are made do not entail making improvements falling within Part I of the Third Schedule, unless, whether on application of tenant or Minister the landlord has consented to the improvement, or in accordance with certain provisions of the 1923 Act, which relate to market gardens, compensation for the carrying out of improvements does not depend on the landlord's consent. Part I of the Third Schedule deals with the making of water meadows, or works of irrigation, the planting of orchards or fruit bushes, and so on. We want to add these words so as to include certain changes which the tenant might have performed under Part II of the Schedule, which includes the erection, alteration and enlargement of buildings, and the making or improvement of permanent yards. We believe that under that head might be comprised such things as the erection of a Danish piggery or the removal of permanent fences. These might make a complete change in the way in which the farm is being run. There might be an alteration from dairy farming to arable.

Our Amendment is designed to make the Clause consistent, both as regards Part I and Part II of the Schedule.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may briefly state the reply I was going to give. One has to try to draw a distinction between the improvements referred to in Part I and those referred to in Part II of the Schedule. It is not within the purview of this Debate to discuss their nature and why they have each been put in the Parts in which they appear, and why it has been necessary in regard to Part I, that the landlord's consent must be obtained before compensation is paid if an improvement is carried out, and why, in respect of those in Part II, they can be carried out, and compensation can be obtained, despite the landlord. There has been that radical distinction before. For the purpose of Clause 14 we have selected those that appear in Part I, those which require the landlord's consent as an indispensable necessity before compensation can be claimed for carrying out an improvement. The differences in character in the improvements set out in Part I and Part II are comparatively


clear and we do not feel that we can accept the Amendment. It is reasonable, in our view, to say that where an improvement cannot be carried out by the tenant without getting the landlord's consent&#x2014;if he is to get compensation&#x2014;a direction should not be given to the tenant to carry out those same improvements unless the landlord has consented. When we come to the other category of improvements under Part II of the Schedule which can be carried out by the tenant, despite the landlord, compensation being payable notwithstanding the fact that the landlord has refused his consent&#x2014;provided the Minister gives his consent&#x2014;we are on entirely different ground. It is reasonable, in that case, that the Minister under Clause 14, should be entitled to direct the tenant when a supervision order has been made, to carry out those improvements. He could give his consent if he were asked, and it is reasonable that he should have power to give necessary directions. The two categories of improvements are in no sense analogous. A reasonable dividing line is being drawn between the two, and I ask the House to follow us in adhering to that dividing line.<br/>
There is a further point. The wording of the Amendment would lead to a great deal of difficulty. The Amendment qualifies improvements which may not be subject to direction by tying it to those which alter the nature of the holding. Even an improvement of a minor character might be said to alter the character of the holding. Alteration of a building in a very small degree might alter the character of the holding. Therefore, we feel that the introduction of these words would give rise to a great deal of uncertainty and obscurity. What would be meant by an improvement which was an improvement which did not alter the holding? We feel that almost every improvement does alter the holding. If we admitted the Amendment it would mean that a direction could not be given under Clause 14 in respect of even a trifling improvement since it could be said that, to a certain extent, the improvement would alter the character of the holding.<br/>
The hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for East Grinstead (Colonel Clarke) said that a tenant may be given directions to carry out an extensive alteration to the building. If he does, he is entitled to compensation, but he is only

entitled to compensation equivalent to the increase in value to the landlord of his holding by reason of the carrying out of the improvement. Even ii the landlord has to pay that compensation the landlord does get an equivalent increase of value in his holding. When he re-lets to another tenant he can charge an increased rent in proportion to the increased value of the holding. We have drawn the line carefully between those improvements which should and should not be subject to direction, in limiting the ones which cannot be subject to direction to those for which it is indispensable to get the landlord's consent for compensation to become payable.<br/>
I put that to the House as a fundamental answer to what has been said. Secondly, I say that the wording of the alteration is bound to occasion difficulty and obscurity and probably rule out any improvement, even the smallest. If the tenant carries out extensive improvements of the type contemplated in Part II of the Schedule, he gets compensation equivalent to the increased value of the landlord's holding, but the landlord when he relets can charge an extra rent equivalent to the increase in that value. The landlord gets a holding which is more valuable than it was before, exclusively by reference to the increase in the value due to the carrying out of the improvement. For those reasons I must oppose the Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.314.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Vane" colnum="314" time="">
<p>It is very much within the purview of this Amendment to know what is the principle underlying the division in the Third Schedule of Parts I and II, and why one part is included in this Clause and the other half is not. It was explained to us in Committee upstairs that the improvements in Part I of the Third Schedule were improvements which were expected to change the character of the holding as distinct from those in Part II which are improvements not expected to change the character of the holding. I do not think that distinction has been entirely successful. In Part II will be found a number of items which I think no practical man would dispute are likely to change the character of the holding. If this Amendment is accepted, I do not anticipate the difficulties which the learned Solicitor-General seemed to think would arise in a great many cases. In fact, if one looks at several of the improvements listed in Part II of the


Schedule, such as the erection of buildings, the making of roads, and the provision of embankments or sluices apart from their repair and maintenance, I think one must agree that it would be very hard to carry out work under those headings without altering the character of the holding. I wish that the Government would think again before they exclude our suggestion that works under Part II of the Third Schedule which change the character of the holding should be treated as in the same class as those in Part I. We are not bringing forward this Amendment because we anticipate hardship, but because we consider that the Clause as at present drafted is likely to achieve bad administration which could be easily improved by its acceptance.</p>

<p>I wish to support the Amendment. The reference of the learned Solicitor-General to the use of the word "alteration" seemed to me to be a little short of a complete description because it is not alteration that we are protesting against, but the alteration of the character of the holding. I would give a simple example of what might alter the character of a holding very considerably: Supposing that a tenant of an arable farm&#x2014;very likely a good arable farm&#x2014;wished to change the character of the holding and make it a dairy farm. It surely would not be reasonable to ask for compensation for the very considerable extra buildings which would be necessary for the purpose of a dairy farm. That would alter the character of the holding, and I do not think that would be a reasonable excuse to make. The Solicitor-General also referred to the possible loss or gain to the landlord in consequence of any such alteration. I suggest that the average landlord is perfectly well aware of the factors that may affect the value of the holding which belongs to him, and he would be very unlikely to object to anything which would enhance its value and make it a better holding. I do not think any objection would be raised on those grounds, and I suggest therefore that the Government might think again. This is a very simple Amendment which makes a very small alteration; it would not alter the strength of the Bill in any way, and would certainly make the Clause fairer in

its operation, and I hope the Government will think again and accept it</p>

<p>The learned Solicitor-General has over-simplified the object of this Amendment. It is not quite as simple a proposition as he tried to convey to the House. What we think is undesirable is that a tenant should be directed to carry out an improvement on a holding which in fact would completely alter the character of that holding. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Petersfield (Sir G. Jeffreys) gave the obvious example of a farm being changed from an arable farm into a dairy farm. That is the most obvious example one could give, because the actual cost of such a conversion would be very high indeed. The learned Solicitor-General said that in such an event it was all right, because the landlord could perfectly well charge extra rent in relation to the improved value of the holding. It is not, however, only a question of whether or not the landlord can charge extra rent; the really important question is whether, in view of the new use to which the farm is to be put because of the alteration of its character, the economic level of the new type of farming will enable that particular farm to carry the extra rent to pay the interest on the capital expenditure. That involves the whole issue of whether or not, by altering the type of a farm, one is running into the very great danger that in a few years' time the new type of farming which will be carried on on that farm may well be entirely uneconomic, and therefore quite unable to carry the interest on the capital expenditure.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 13, line 31, after "him," to insert:
<q>within twenty-one days from the service of the notice.</q>
This is the Clause which deals with the giving of directions to provide fixed equipment. Under Subsection (3) of the Clause the Minister has power to require information as to the obligations subsisting in the tenancy with regard to the provision of fixed equipment, and he can serve a


notice requiring that those concerned shall give him the information. During the Committee stage of the discussions the argument was advanced that the person on whom that notice was served should be given at any rate some minimum time in which he could furnish the information. The time proposed in Committee was 28 days. My right hon. Friend, having promised that he would consider the matter, feels that 28 days would be rather too long and would lead to unnecessary delay, but he thinks that 21 days would be reasonable. Therefore, I am moving this Amendment, which provides that when such a requirement has been made the person who has been asked to furnish the information shall have 21 days in which to do it. That I think would substantially meet the arguments adduced by hon. Gentlemen opposite, with the difference that we say 21 days instead of 28, and I hope the House will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 15, line 6, after "show," to insert "reasonably."<br/>
I believe it will be found very difficult to find a really adequate definition for measuring the failure or success of an owner or farmer under supervision. This Amendment is put down to improve the drafting, and from the point of view of what I feel that the Minister's real intentions are. In moving the Amendment I want to put myself in the position of a county executive committee or a tribunal which has got to make a decision on dispossession. In reading the terms of the Clause, I see that the Minister has to be satisfied. As one of his servants or officers, I know the Minister has a very high standard and that he is not easily satisfied. At the same time I know he is a reasonable man who appreciates that, particularly with work done out of doors, it is very difficult to get the high standard that one wants. I think that anybody

who has to do with out-of-door work, either agriculture or soldiering, knows there are two characteristics of which note has to be taken: first, such work always takes longer than one expected, and, secondly, one seldom gets exactly the standard that is wanted and very very often it turns out differently from what is wanted. I believe that the Minister appreciates the difficulty of getting real perfection and when he is dissatisfied he would take reasonable notice of the many circumstances that stop him getting perfection. If these words were added to the Bill it would make it possible for his officers to interpret the Bill as I believe he would wish it to be interpreted.</p>

<p>I am afraid that I have rather a short reply to the argument that has been advanced, and that is that I cannot for the life of me see why the words "reasonably satisfactory" are more satisfactory than the word "satisfactory" itself. "Satisfactory" is an ordinary, intelligible English term, and if people were asked to consider satisfactory improvements they would know exactly what it was they were asked to consider. On the other hand, I think they would have some difficulty in doing so when we get the word "reasonably" qualifying the word "satisfactory." It could lead to interminable tangles and instead of improving the Clause the word "reasonably" would make the position much worse, because people would really begin to wonder what it was they were asked to decide. It would lead to confusion and in my view the word "satisfactory" is perfectly satisfactory as it is.</p>

<p>I regret that I failed to convince the hon. and learned Gentleman of what I was trying to say. "Satisfactory" in the eyes of the Minister must be perfect, but it is almost impossible to get perfection in anything of this sort within a short time, and, therefore, he might have to be content with second best. I do not want a provision inserted in the Bill which it is really impossible to implement truthfully. The Minister may obtain reasonable satisfaction, but if he has the standards which I believe him to have, he will never obtain satisfaction in the legal sense of the term.</p>

<p>I intervene in this matter only because of the somewhat plausible and unsatisfactory explanation given by the hon. and learned Gentleman. He wants to tell the House that the word "satisfactory" and the words "reasonably satisfactory" mean one and the same thing. I suggest to him that if I drink a glass of water it is satisfactory in so far as it quenches my thirst, but if I dilute it with my national beverage&#x2014;a little Scotch whisky&#x2014;it is reasonably satisfactory. I agree with my hon. Friend that the interpretation of this word, far from obscuring or confusing the Clause, gives it a clarity which the ordinary man, at any rate, will appreciate. I speak with some knowledge of agriculture because, I am proud to boast, I manage and farm some 300 acres on the borders of Scotland. If my speech has no other justification it has that of inducing the Joint Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who is somewhat too modest and timid in this House, to come to his feet and speak on behalf of this Bill. I am confining myself now most strictly to the Clause whatever my temptations may be, and I address myself to the Clause&#x2014;</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 15, line 8, to leave out from "to," to the end of line 10, and to insert:
<q>order the sale thereof within three months from the date of so certifying and in the event of a sale not being effected by the owner within the said period the Minister shall have power to sell the same on behalf of the owner and shall account to the owner for the proceeds of such sale.</q>
The effect of this Amendment is to deprive the Minister of power automatically to purchase land compulsorily where an owner is being dispossessed on grounds of bad husbandry, and to insert instead a requirement that the Minister shall order the sale of the land within three months. If the owner who is being dispossessed on grounds of bad estate management fails to sell the land within three months then the Minister shall have power to sell it, and shall account to the owner for the proceeds of the sale. We feel that it will not really be helpful to the smooth working of this Bill or, indeed, to economy in public affairs, if the Minister, through the Land Commission, is to own odd patches of land all over the country which he has acquired under this Bill because they were being badly managed by their owners.<br/>
On this side of the House, we do not find any particular magic in the public ownership of land&#x2014;even by a Land Commission as proposed under this Bill. Ownership of land by the Minister and its management by the Land Commission may prove a very great embarrassment to the proper working of the Bill. We fear that it will slur over what we hope may be good features of the Bill by some of its very bad features. Moreover, Parliament will want to know year by year, the results of these activities of acquiring land and managing it under the Clause. Rather than cumbering himself with the ownership of patches of unsatisfactorily managed land it would be better if the Minister required the owner who had fallen down on the job, to sell his land within three months. If the owner did not do so, if he were a difficult man, the Minister should then have power to sell the land in the open market, so that somebody else could take it on and manage it properly. There are many people who


would be only too ready to put their money and their skill into the ownership of land. We believe that that is for the good of the country. We do not believe in the State putting its dead hand on patches of land throughout the country.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I do so on three grounds. The first is that, as the Clause stands there is no option for the Minister to do anything but to purchase the land. The test which we should apply in deciding where land should go and how it should be managed is the efficiency with which that land can be managed. In a large number of cases where an owner-occupier is dispossessed, and the management is taken away from him, that small plot of land will be like an island, and will probably be a long way from other pieces of land of a similar sort. In order to manage those pieces of land in the proper way, the agent will have to make long journeys. There will be no possibility of carrying out the duties of ownership, repair and maintenance properly. In general, those pieces of land will be divorced from the main activities of the Land Commission. Surely, the efficient management of these odd pieces of land would be far more easily attained if the land was sold to an owner occupier approved by the Minister. A landowner might be at an Oxford college and might not be able to carry out the maintenance and repair jobs.<br/>
It would be far better, instead of giving the Minister no latitude at all if the owner who is not carrying out the job properly could sell the land to a purchaser who would be a better and keener owner. The Minister will know that the land will be under supervision and therefore subject to the ordinary provisions of Part II. It is far better that it should go to a man like that, than that it should pass into the hands of a commission which, at best, could only give it, a cursory inspection from time to time if it is an isolated site, and in any case will not of itself necessarily, or even probably, increase the efficiency with which that land is managed. Quite apart from the fact that we see no great advantage, to put it very mildly, in the State owning this land, reasons of good management and efficiency in the running of the land demand that it should be sold to another

private owner, be it a corporate body or a private neighbouring land owner or owner-occupier. Without a great deal of hope, I admit, we recommend this to the Committee as a far better alternative to ownership by a Land Commission.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Amendment is to provide that where an owner is being dispossessed on the grounds of bad estate management the Minister should not have power to buy the land compulsorily. He would have to order the landlord to sell within three months, and if the landlord failed to do so, then the Amendment turns the Minister into an estate agent. The Minister would have to sell the land and account to the landowner for the proceeds. The hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Hurd) and the hon. Member for Ripon (Mr. York) never even suggested that the Minister should get a commission out of the sale. I am rather amused at the solicitude for the State of those two hon. Members. They think it would be intolerable for the State to have to buy little bits of land here and there and that it would impose an intolerable burden on the poor wretched Land Commission. I quite appreciate the Opposition's objection to State acquisition of land. It is a good old Tory prejudice. It dies very hard indeed.</p>

<p>It is true that the Tories die hard too, but long before that they do on occasions become utterly ineffective and this appears to be one of those moments. There seems to be no need for this Amendment. The owner can sell his land at any moment during the course of the supervision order. If he is placed under supervision, which must run 12 months before the Minister can do anything about dispossession, down to the 29th day of the eleventh month he has power to sell if he wishes to. There is, therefore, no necessity for the Minister to give him three months more, in which to sell land which he could have sold at any time during the previous 12 months. If at a later stage, however, after being given an opportunity to sell, he fails to improve his management, then it is right and proper that the State should have the right to purchase that property. If he were allowed to sell at that stage, after the expiry of 12 months during which he had been under supervision, the State


would have absolutely no guarantee that the estate would be better managed in future than it had been in the past. It could be sold to anybody with or without cash or capital, and to that extent we should have no power. The Bill is designed to produce agricultural efficiency, and agricultural efficiency carries with it good estate management.<br/>
Therefore, it seems to me that in a case such as we have in mind, once the State has had a person under supervision for 12 months, once it has prevailed upon the estate owner to improve his management and he has failed to do so, the State is at least entitled, from that moment onwards, to say that the estate in future is to be better managed than it has been in the past. In any case, the estate must <i>prima facie</i> have been badly managed or the estate owner would not have been dispossessed. That implies, therefore, that probably a good deal of money will require to be spent to bring the farm back to a decent state of management. I submit that, despite the fact that there is a genuinely prosperous agriculture, due to this Bill, during the period of this Government, and that there are plenty of would-be buyers of agricultural land, that is no reason why the State should not take possession and exercise control over the future management. This Amendment seems to me to have no merit&#x2014;not even political merit&#x2014;and I hope the House will reject it.</p>

<p>The logical outcome of the right hon. Gentleman's argument would be to put a stop to all sales of all agricultural property, because he said that if one puts up property for sale, one does not know who will buy it, whether it will be a bad farmer or a person who has insufficient capital. That applies to anybody who sells a farm on the open market. Wiley should it apply any more when a farm is put on to the open market because of a compulsory order for possession. I do not think there is anything that can be accepted in the Minister's argument. Everybody will know, when he goes into the market to buy a farm in respect of which an order has been made, that it is likely to require a substantial amount of capital to be put into it to bring it up to a standard of efficiency, and a person will buy it with that knowledge in view, and the

further knowledge that if he does not bring the farm up to a proper standard of efficiency he, too, in turn, will first of all have a supervision order made against him, and subsequently, if he fails to comply therewith, he will be subject to a compulsory order for acquisition. I cannot see that there is any merit in the right hon. Gentleman's argument.<br/>
Perhaps I may again refer to a statement on somewhat similar lines that was made by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary in the Standing Committee. First of all, the Parliamentary Secretary said that it was common ground that estate owners were trustees for the nation. I am not sure what he meant by that, but the phrase was again used by him very shortly afterwards, when he said that he did not think that it would be contended that the State was less able to put an estate in good condition in conformity with the minimum standards of good estate management than a private owner. I would not dissent from that view, but even the Government spokesman on that occasion did not claim that the State would be able to put an estate into a better condition or into better conformity with the rules of good estate management than a private owner, and when not even the Government claim that, it is difficult to see why they should now be arguing that it is right and proper, in the interests of good estate management and good agriculture, that, rather than give the opportunity to another individual to enter into the agricultural world, as an estate owner or an estate manager, the State itself should take over the property by compulsory acquisition.<br/>
10.0 p.m.<br/>
May I refer again to the point made by the right hon. Gentleman. I think it is a most specious point. For once, that deep fund of psychology from which the right hon. Gentleman is generally able to advise the House is wanting. He pointed out that for II months and 29 days, the owner of the property will have the opportunity of selling it himself. I quite agree with him, but not even the right hon. Gentleman can claim to have all his arguments both ways. We have just been hearing from him that a supervision order which in certain circumstances leads up to a dispossession order, is a happy state of affairs which will be welcomed by the majority of farmers throughout the country. If that be so, then no farmer


or estate manager or owner will, during that happy time, say, "The outlook is so black that I have to sell." He will hang on to his farm or to his estate, working in co-operation with the friendly advisers who are all out to help him, in the belief for 11 months and 29 days that he will be able to pull the farm round and bring it into a satisfactory condition. Two days later the right hon. Gentleman changes his mind and says, "Ah, that is all wrong. You have been under a supervision order which was a warning that unless you mended your ways, unless you brought your estate into good and proper repair, a penalty would be inflicted and your estate or farm would be acquired compulsorily."<br/>
I maintain that the right hon. Gentleman cannot have it both ways. Even if he argues, as I do not think he is entitled to do, that compulsory acquisition is a proper penalty upon a farmer or an estate owner for having failed, with the assistance of the county committee, to bring the farm or estate into a satisfactory condition&#x2014;even then I put it to him that it is not in the interests of the agricultural industry as a whole. It is arguable, as the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) would argue frequently, that it is best in the interests of the industry for the whole of the agricultural community to be nationalised and managed by the State. It is equally arguable that it is in the best interests of the industry for it to be under private enterprise, but one thing which is not arguable is that it is in the best interests of the industry to go half and half. We cannot possibly have a free system such as the Government are conceding generally, and to inject into that system a partial percentage of State ownership and State management of farms without killing the initiative and efficiency of the industry.<br/>
I ask the right hon. Gentleman to look at it from this point of view. If you stultify the free market in farms; if you prevent people coming into the industry from buying land for agricultural purposes, from taking up farms and bringing new blood and new money into the industry, by this system of compulsory purchase and the handing over of the property to a Land Commission, you will do far more harm to the agricultural community and industry than you ever would by the one chance in 10,000 of getting into the ownership of the property, a

person who is not able to carry out the business of farming or estate management as well as the Agricultural Land Commission. Therefore I ask the House to support this Amendment so as to give an opportunity to the owner or the farmer to effect a sale in the open market on the orders of the Ministry of Agriculture. It is no more than that, and I cannot see why the Minister should not give the person who is under the supervision order, an opportunity to dispose of his own property.</p>

<p>Speaking as one who did not take part in proceedings upstairs, I will be very brief. I was very disappointed with the speech of the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Hurd), who I thought would make a substantial case. I suggest that we should look a little deeper into this matter. Is this going to be a fair deal for the State and for the owner? I think that what is proposed in the Bill is fair to both. As the Minister has pointed out, there is nothing whatever to prevent the owner selling up to the last moment. If it is a decent property, it will be in his interest to sell, and he will sell. But, if it is badly neglected&#x2014;and very likely it will be seeing that it is badly farmed&#x2014;he might not be able to sell. The Amendment requires the Minister to make a forced sale of that property to an unwilling buyer. The owner, in other words, would get a miserable price. It is in the public interest that the property should come into the hands of the State, because the State would be more likely to be willing to put up capital to put the place in order, and to have it properly farmed. I imagine, and no doubt my right hon. Friend will correct me if I am wrong, that instead of getting the 1939 price, as the owner would have obtained some time ago, he would get the up-to-date price, and at the same time would be putting the land into the hands of the State.</p>

<p>I take very strong objection to compulsory purchase, and I think the Minister has put up a very poor case in rejecting the Amendment. He gave no indication as to how he could economically administer a great number of widely dispersed units.

whether they will get a better price from the Minister than in the open market.</p>

<p>I am coming to that, and it is another great weakness about compulsory purchase. The Minister should say how he proposes to reckon the value of the land. The hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Scott-Elliot) said that if the property were put for sale the owner would get a miserable price because it was in poor shape. But in actual fact the value of agricultural land does not depend very greatly on the condition of the buildings. It depends on the district in which it is situated, and on the value of the soil. Any good farmer or landowner is prepared to buy land at a fair price, provided the land is basically sound, and in a good district. The Minister has not told us whether there is any alternative to compulsory purchase, and I think he should have told us something about that. In an interjection, he said that an owner had an opportunity of selling during the time in which he was under supervision. That is one of the worst features of this compulsory purchase. Every landowner under supervision will have to gamble as to whether it is going to pay him to try to improve his land while under supervision or to sell in the open market and to get the best price he can while he still has the power to sell. That is a very bad feature.<br/>
The whole object of the Bill as the Minister frequently tells us is to create confidence and to help people who are not doing well to improve their land and to give them an opportunity of putting it into good shape. The position as it stands means, as I have already stated, that the owner has to make up his mind whether it will pay him best to sell and get out, or to try to improve the estate. I hope that under these circumstances the Minister will consider accepting this Amendment. Another point to be considered is that if the Minister is to take compulsorily all this land which has come under supervision he will tend to drive up the prices of that amount of land which remains for sale in the open market. Will the Minister follow the rise in prices in his compulsory purchases of land from which he has dis-

possessed the owner? I hope that he will answer some of these points, and accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House see two evils, that of the forced sale and that of the forced purchaser, which must be the State. The State will be forced to purchase these estates or plots of ground which, through inefficient management, are compulsorily sold. If these estates are in a poor condition the ideal person to manage them is some individual who is prepared to buy them out and make a really good job of putting them on a paying basis, not some large body like the Land Commission. It is certain that some of the estates will be in poor condition, and that the labyrinthine working of the Land Commission will not prove anything like as effective as the drive of someone who puts up the money himself with the intention of making a good show of the venture.<br/>
The second point is the question of resale. Supposing there is the compulsory sale of an estate which is not suitable for the Land Commission to run; it well may be the type of estate which the Land Commission is not prepared to manage. Whose duty is it to make a decision? The Minister will have to decide then whether there is to be a re-sale of such estates. To turn to the point of the forced sale, it is manifest that the effect which the Minister has pointed out through all the stages of the Bill, the beneficial effect of supervision, will be reduced, to nil. As my right hon. Friend has said, any owner, once under supervision, will be forced to become a gambler&#x2014;to decide whether to push on with the help of the Agricultural Committee, which has been promised, to make a going concern of the estate and pull himself out of the rut of supervision, or to gamble for a forced sale, and depart from the spirit of the Measure by letting the land decline. That is what this unpleasant Clause does. It is a Clause which, I agree, must exist in some form, but I suggest that it is here in a bad form in that it compels not only the forced sale but also a forced purchaser, which is the State.</p>

<p>Two matters of principle occur to me. The first is the question of whether it is better to farm land under State ownership or under


private ownership. These are the fundamental differences between this side of the House and hon. Members on the Government benches. The Minister of Agriculture said that this Bill is designed to improve the efficiency of agriculture. I am afraid that it may be designed as a first stepping stone to the nationalisation of the land.</p>

<p>This Amendment merely deals with ordering the sale within three months. Already this discussion is getting very wide.</p>

<p>The Amendment raises two questions of principle. The hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Scott-Elliot) has said that the State is more likely to pay a fair price and put up proper buildings, and so on, when they have acquired the land, than a private individual. That brings up the question of the spending of public money which an ordinary private individual cannot&#x2014;</p>

<p>That again is quite outside the scope of this Amendment. The hon. and gallant Member really must confine himself to the Amendment.</p>

<p>I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter which is one upon which everybody in the farming community feels very keenly. It has caused quite a stir in my part of the country. I resent the State being allowed to purchase land compulsorily.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.329.4" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. Baldwin" colnum="329" time="">
<p>I want to address a few remarks from the point of view of the owner-occupier. I think the Minister is well aware that more owner-occupiers were dispossessed during the war than any other class of owner. The Minister is not being hard on the owners of the large estates The hardship will fall on the smallholder. The smallholder occupier is an optimist, or he would never be a farmer. During the 11 months and 29 days while he is under supervision, he will be optimistic enough to think that he will be allowed to carry on at the end of the 30th day. It will be somewhat of a shock to him when he wakes up to find that the State have decided that he is not to carry on and that they are to take his farm from him.<br/>
I ask the Minister to consider the arguments. If he does not agree with the Amendment as it is worded, can he not

think of some other method by which he can give the owner under supervision a fair crack of the whip? If he thinks three months is too much, I suggest that two months would be sufficient for the owner to dispose of his farm. If the Minister is not prepared to go as far as that, I suggest that before the 12 months is up&#x2014;at the end of 10 months&#x2014;the Minister should intimate to the owner under supervision whether or not he will be able to carry on. That would give him an opportunity of selling the farm within two months. If the man is stupid enough not to take the opportunity of selling, then he will not get much sympathy. If the Minister cannot agree to the Amendment, I ask him to consider whether he can find a way in which to give fair play to the smallholder occupier who will be the man most likely to be dispossessed.</p>

<p>When the hon. Member for Accrington (Mr. Scott-Elliot) was examining this Amendment, he did so from the point of view of the owner and of the State. He forgot someone who is very important. I refer to the new owner who wants to come into the industry. This country alone, of all the countries of Western Europe, has for years had a free market in land. Land is very much cheaper and more easy to buy in this country than in any other country in Western Europe. I should be surprised if any hon. Member could suggest any country where the market in good land is wider or cheaper. Since, under this Bill, the Minister's powers over land are so restrictive, it is likely that, in the near future, that particular privilege of the natives of this country will be taken away from them. The market in land will be restricted, and the prices of land will rise enormously. I think that, perhaps, the Minister's reputation in years to come will rest, not so much upon having stabilised prices as on having removed the free market in land.</p>

<p>I am glad we have had some discussion on this question, but I am rather surprised that no one has spoken from the Liberal Benches, because hon. Members there were interested in this matter at an earlier stage. It was worth having this Debate, if for no other reason than that of calling the attention of hon. Members here, and the public outside who are interested in our proceedings, to the speeches of the Minis-


ter to be found in columns 319 and 320, and those of his Parliamentary Secretary in columns 316 and 317, in the OFFICIAL REPORT of the Committee's proceedings on a similar Amendment. They will find it laid down there as a pure doctrine of Socialist procedure, that if a case has been expounded by one speech from the Government, and one from the Opposition, there is no point in having any further Debate. It is a most astonishing theory, and it is only the fact of our having this Amendment discussed which enables me to call attention to it.<br/>
Of course, there is a difference of opinion between the two sides of the House on this issue, but I do not Understand why the right hon. Gentleman should end his speech by saying that this is a poor Amendment and that it has no political merit. We do not look for political&#x2014;reasons&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] We realise, from the applause which that remark occasioned from hon. Members opposite, that they put forward everything on purely political grounds, but we do not. We have been trying all through the progress of this Bill, to help the right hon. Gentleman, and he has been good enough on many occasions to acknowledge the help we have given.<br/>
On this Amendment, it scans to me that there is really one test, the test which the Minister himself wants to apply all through this Bill, the test of efficiency. Which is going to be the most efficient way of handling this problem in the long run? The right hon. Gentleman did lead us astray&#x2014;I do not think he meant to do this with those of us who are not very expert in the finer points of this Bill, but he did rather lead us astray when he said that there was nothing to prevent the owner, during the 11 months and 29 days in which he was under supervision, from selling out. Of course there is not, but that is not the point. The point is what happens, when is the Minister going to say that there is to be a certificate of dispossession? How is the man to know that there is going to be a certificate of dispossession? Then, what becomes of the argument advanced by the hon. Lady and others earlier? The, whole point of supervision was to clear the ground nicely and help people to carry on with good husbandry and good manage-

ment. We are now told that we knew all along what was to be the case. That is the conclusion to which we are driven&#x2014;that dispossession will automatically follow, and I do not think the right hon. Gentleman really means that&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not think the right hon. and gallant Gentleman can take it that I meant that at all. He knows that I meant that the State will know in the case of the supervision order whether the owner is trying to improve or not.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.332.1" hansard_membership_id="2977" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/13795" speakername="Capt. Crookshank" colnum="332" time="">
<p>But that is not the test. The test which the Minister has to apply when he gives the certificate is not whether the owner is trying, but whether or not certain fairly satisfactory improvements are being made&#x2014;quite a different thing. After that rather unfortunate interjection of the Minister's may I come back to the point which I was trying to make. His argument is that under this Bill we have to try to see how we are going to get the greatest efficiency. Very well. We say that the greatest efficiency does not automatically follow the Minister purchasing compulsorily. He claims that it does. We say&#x2014;and several of my hon. Friends have said it with greater strength than I can&#x2014;that somebody coming in and buying this property, which the Minister under this Amendment will have to sell, will be just as likely to put it in good order as is the Minister through his Commission, but with the difference that the private purchaser will be doing it at his own risk and with his own money, and the Commission will be doing it with the money of the taxpayers. [An HON. MEMBER: "That will be much better."] I do not know that taxpayers will agree about that. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman is in such a high grade of Surtax that the little 6d., one way or the other, does not matter.<br/>
As I say, on the point of efficiency, that is the difference of opinion between us. I dare say we may never agree on that point. The Minister thinks it will be more efficient for the State to do it at public expense. We say that that is not proven, and that it would be much better to do it in the way we suggest, and that there should be a compulsory sale in the open market when the private purchaser could


come into play and the place could be put in good order. There is no reason in the world why it should not.<br/>
I wish to end on this point of efficiency. The Minister, of course, knows, although some hon. Members do not, that Clause 13 is still there, and that any dispossession of land will not affect the position. Therefore, he will be able to keep up all his ordinary efficiency, in spite of the fact, as the result of accepting this Amendment, that a private person has bought the</p>

<p>property. We are quite convinced of the rightness of our point of view. I have no doubt that the Minister, who has repeated the line he adopted on the Committee stage, is also convinced of the rightness of his point of view. For our part we would like to put our view on record by going into the Division Lobby.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 15, line 10, at the end, to insert:
<q>(2) Where it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister in relation to any land to which the foregoing Subsection applies or to the owner thereof that the circumstance hereinafter set out prevail, the Minister shall, before exercising the powers conferred by the last foregoing Subsection, afford to the persons hereinafter described in relation to each of the said circumstances, the opportunity, if they so elect, of assuming the management of the said land, and if they do so elect, the Minister shall entrust the management thereof to them.</q>
<q>The circumstances and persons hereinbefore referred to are:&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) where the land is settled land within the meaning of the Settled Land Act, 5925, the trustees of the settlement;</li>

<li>(<i>b</i>) where any child of the owner of the age of twenty-one years or over notifies the Minister of his desire to avail himself of the provisions of this subsection such child, or, if more than one, children, or, where there is no child surviving, to such grandchild or grandchildren being of the age of twenty-one years or over, as shall notify the Minister aforesaid;</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) where there is no child of the age of twenty-one years or over or, there being no child whether of that age or less, there is no grandchild of the age of twenty-one years or over, to such person as may on application to the Minister for the purpose satisfy the Minister that they are fit and proper persons to be entrusted with the management of the said land for and on behalf of any child who has not obtained the age of twenty-one years, or, if there is no such child, of any grand-child who has not attained the age of twenty-one years.</li></ol></q>
<q>For the purposes of this Subsection a person's stepchild, adopted child (whether


adopted in pursuance of any enactment or otherwise) or illegitimate child shall be treated as a child of his.</q>
This is rather a long Amendment but it is self-explanatory and I do not intend to take up much time because I am hopeful that the Minister may accept it. I base that hope on the grounds that, first of all, when the Clause was under discussion upstairs the Debate was concluded by the right hon. Gentleman saying that if there was a real point of substance&#x2014;and I think there is such a point&#x2014;he would look at it.<br/>
He said that if something was put forward which did not open the gate too wide he would look at the matter on the Report stage, but he added the cryptic remark that hon. Members must not hold him down on that promise. I hope that, as a result of his having looked at it again, he will accept the Amendment. It turns very largely on the same general point as the last Amendment. It is designed to make more workable, and to facilitate generally, the very difficult and awkward situation bound to arise when a dispossession order is made in respect of land. It does not carry out any new intention not already included in the Bill.<br/>
The object of the Amendment is to enable the Minister, instead of carrying out compulsory purchase where dispossession is necessary, to allow the property to continue to be managed on behalf of minors who would in the normal course of events inherit the property or by or on behalf of trustees for those minors, and generally speaking where there is an inheritance point to enable the property to be carried on until the minors or trustees are in a position to take it over themselves. Curiously enough, this is a point which affects principally small rather than large landlords, and it is the multiplicity of small landlords who for one reason or another are most likely to suffer and be caught badly if some such provision as this is not included in the Bill. The Minister has already stated that he has power under Clause 14 to carry out the general intention which we have in mind in this Amendment, but I think it would be carrying out that intention by rather backdoor methods. Under Clause 14 (2, <i>a</i>) the Minister has power to make a direction as to the carrying out of work and may require that the management to which the direction relates shall be entrusted to a person appointed by the owner to whom the direction relates and

approved by the Minister. The right hon. Gentleman has quoted that power to justify the fact that he can already do what is intended by this Amendment. But I think it is agreed that it is not really a very open-handed way of doing it, and it would be very much better to have direct power in the Bill. I think the House generally would be sympathetic towards the provisions of this Amendment, and I trust that it will be accepted.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that the Minister said he would consider this matter further, and he has considered it further. The result of his further deliberations, I am afraid, is that this Amendment would not in any way improve the Bill. After all, what is the situation? On the discussion of the last Amendment, the general principle was again gone over as to whether there should be a compulsory power of purchase, and the House again, by the Division which has just taken place, affirmed its, view that, when there has been no satisfactory improvement, the compulsory power of purchase should exist and be exercised. What does this Amendment seek to add? It proposes, in the event of land being settled land within the Settled Land Act and there is no satisfactory improvement, that the trustee should be given a further chance to do what the owner or tenant for life had failed to do. Is there any guarantee, so far as the Minister and the country generally are concerned, that the trustee would be able to manage the land any better than the owner?<br/>
As the whole object of compulsory purchase of land is for the land to be used efficiently in the interests of the nation, what really is to be gained by transferring land from an inefficient owner to persons as to whose efficiency there is no kind of guarantee? In the case of settled land managed by a tenant for life, what would happen would probably be this. The trustee would be a solicitor who, having an office in some town and knowing absolutely nothing about agriculture, would be quite unsuitable as a manager; and the land instead of being improved and brought back to efficient production and made to work really efficiently in the interest of the nation, would be allowed to continue to go downhill and get worse and worse.<br/>
Precisely the same consideration applies in the event of land being handed over to children or grandchildren or anybody else appointed to act on their behalf. There is absolutely no guarantee that there will be any improvement. It might be a complete and absolute waste of time. There might be an estate which is badly managed by the owner and it might be taken out of his possession and passed to people who would manage it as badly as it had been managed or even worse. Indeed, in the case of trustees or solicitors they would probably manage it worse, because they will not know anything about agriculture. I would advise the House that the Amendment does not in any way improve the Bill, and might simply result in a waste of time, with a badly managed estate being even worse managed, and going so far downhill that it would be difficult to reclaim it.<br/>
10.45 p.m.<br/>
The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Joynson-Hicks) said that there was an analogous power in the Bill. That power is exercised by the Minister and the arrangement is subject, of course, to the Minister's supervision. Under Clause 14 (2, <i>a</i>) the Minister can direct that the management of the land must be handed over to a person designated by the owner, but that person must be approved by the Minister. That was described by the hon. Member for Chichester as a backdoor way of dealing with it. I do not think that that makes it any worse, even if that is an appropirate description. What would happen would be that an owner of land would be managing it badly but would not want to lose possession of it. While he felt that personally he could not bring it up to the required state of efficiency, he would have an opportunity of designating somebody who would thus manage the land. That person could manage the land if he were approved by the Minister as a person with the necessary qualifications who would not let it go further down the hill. In point of fact, he might begin to improve it, and such a person could be approved by the Minister and could be entrusted with the land. The object of the Amendment can therefore be covered by powers at present contained in the Bill. I would ask the House to say that this Amendment should not be adopted because it would only result in a further waste of time and would not con-

duce to efficiency. Insofar as a suggestion of this sort would conduce to efficiency it can be done by the Minister exercising the powers conferred upon him under Clause 14 (2, <i>a</i>) of the Bill.</p>

<p>I have not taken part in the previous discussions on this Measure and I only rise to comment upon the spectacle of Satan rebuking sin. [An HON. MEMBER: "Who is Satan?"] I think it would be unfortunate if anyone suggested that the learned Solicitor-General has any intentions which could be called Satanic.</p>

<p>I would not say that, but when the hon. and learned Gentleman deplored the possibility of lawyers acting as trustees and taking over these duties, undoubtedly he was a little unjust to the learned profession of which he is so great an ornament. There have been many occasions in the past when this sort of thing has happened and when property has fallen into the hands of trustees. Such property was quite often agricultural land. The hon. and learned Gentleman himself will, probably have many cases in mind. Of course, a firm of solicitors did not proceed to carry out the work; they put in someone who was efficient to manage it. When the hon. and learned Gentleman adduced that objection to this Amendment it was a little unkind to solicitors in general. Often they have carried out these trustee duties with the greatest possible efficiency. I think that there is something to be said for the attempt made in this Amendment to make it possible to maintain the hereditary succession. After all, the hereditary system is very dear to many hearts. Even the dockers the other day were planning a system by which their sons could-go into the docks. They almost stopped work as a result. In the farming community this principle probably goes far deeper, and while it may be the Government's view that this Amendment is unworkable, I do not think that the views put forward by the learned Solicitor-General should weigh with us at all.</p>

<p>The learned Solicitor-General said there could be no guarantee that the trustees will manage the show better than the owner. He has no reason to think they will do any worse. In any


case, they will probably not do worse than the Land Commission which is to take over in certain circumstances. We must consider this matter from a human and ordinary every-day point of view. For instance, there may be a son who has lived on an estate all his life and has great sentiment for that estate He is a thoroughly good fellow&#x2014;he may be so thoroughly good that he would even satisfy the Minister that he would make a satisfactory tenant. He knows the tenants of the land well, and he has his heart in the estate. Why should that man lose his hereditary right to take on that estate just because his father has been a thoroughly bad farmer? His father may have been a hopeless man in more ways than one. He may be aged and infirm and incapable of carrying on his farming management properly. He may be bordering on lunacy; he may be a drunkard. But because his father is a thoroughly bad old man and has let the estate down, why should the son be persecuted under this Bill? There is no doubt that the trustees should be given a chance to put the place in order and to try to get the man who is entitled to succeed the renegade father into his proper position.<br/>
The trustees would not ask for the chance of running the estate unless they thought they could do it properly. If solicitors are the trustees, no doubt, as the hon. and gallant Member who has just spoken said, they will get efficient managers to do it for them. In some cases the heir to the estate may well be an enemy of the person who is running the estate at the present time. The latter may deliberately let down the estate because he does not want his heir to succeed. He can in that way very easily hand it over to the Minister instead of to the heir. I do think that in this country we still should give some credit to the right of heredity, and I hope that the Minister will change his mind once more and agree to this Amendment.</p>

<p>I would like to comment on the extraordinary principle upon which the learned Solicitor-General has based his argument. It is a principle which seems to me to strike far deeper than this Amendment. The principle which he laid down is that there would be no guarantee that the trustee would manage the estate better than the owner. Surely, the whole basis of English law is that people are considered innocent until they are proved

guilty. In discussing this Amendment, and every Amendment which comes before us, that is the assumption&#x2014;that a man is a good citizen.<br/>
It is quite exceptional that a person is not a good citizen and that special measures have to be taken against him. If we cannot accept that principle the whole basis of the democratic system goes to the ground, and upon what the Solicitor-General has laid down it does go to the ground. In exceptional circumstances we would have people who are actually performing the functions doing so badly, but how can we possibly give a guarantee beforehand that they will perform them satisfactorily? As a proposition it is entirely without meaning and strikes not merely at the root of the Clause but at the whole Bill.</p>

<p>The speech of the learned Solicitor-General is just another revelation that the Government's attitude is a prelude to dispossession. He pooh-poohed the idea that any help should be given to ensure that a farm which may have been hundreds of years in a family's possession should remain in the family. What rests in the minds of hon. Members opposite and in the mind of the hon. Member for Thornbury (Mr. Alpass) is that all owners of land are men in a big way, and he makes a sort of connection with those in another place. The very opposite is likely to take place. It is the small owners of land who are likely to get into the bad books of the war agricultural committees. It is the small man owning, say, one small marginal farm in the North of England whose land the Minister will be taking possession of; not all those thousands of broad acres over which the hon. Member for Thornbury can lick his lips, but small plots of land in all parts of the country. It has been said by the Front Bench that efficiency is the great motive behind the Clause. If they persist in rejecting the Amendment they will be prosecuting a large number of small owners without adding to the efficiency of the industry.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will at any rate say he will look at this again. He has said it once already, but it has not been a useful look,


and he should particularly look now at the speech of the learned Solicitor-General. I do not think he was here when the Solicitor-General was speaking, but the Solicitor-General should be more careful than anyone else in speaking about solicitors. One of the reasons he gave for rejecting the Amendment was that one of the trustees who would have to look after the land might be a solicitor, but the Amendment does not make it compulsory for "inefficient" solicitors, as the hon. and learned Gentleman says, to do anything at all. The Minister affords opportunity to certain categories of people to assume management. In that case I should imagine they would be less inclined to rush. They would not say, "At all costs, we must manage this affair." They would recognise their own limitations.<br/>
What I want the Minister to look at is what my hon. and learned Friend said about Clause 14 (2, <i>a</i>). It refers to a case where, in the event of direction, it is possible for someone to be appointed to carry out the work. The Minister may require management to which the direction relates "to be entrusted to a person appointed by the owner to whom the direction relates and approved by the Minister." In the case of direction it is possible for a directed person to suggest someone else. We are now dealing with a case where a Minister has certified that there should be dispossession. It is a sort of half attempt to fob us off because there is something like this in the Bill. I hope the Minister will look at this again. The Solicitor-General in his unfortunate speech said that if you have trustees and somebody acting for the children, what guarantee is there that the trustees will deal with property better than the owner and will be acting in the interests of the nation? Even if you do not accept the assumption that the trustees will be efficient, what guarantee has the Minister that the Land Commission will he any better? It by no means follows that because it is a public body it will be frightfully efficient. We shall be a little more</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-06-04a.344.0" colnum="344" time="">
<p>experienced a year or so from now when we shall see the results of every commission the House has set up with such rapidity. Anyhow there is obviously a need for guaranteeing efficiency. It is something which counts in this country from the point on view of sentiment that people like sons and children and trustees within the meaning of the Settled Land Act should be afforded an opportunity. The Amendment says that in these categories the Minister should afford them such an opportunity. All the time there is the shadow of Clause 13 under which he can see that efficiency is continued.</p>

<p>I do not think the right hon. and gallant Gentleman really appreciates what Clause 13 deals with. It has no relation to Clause 16. I suggest that he looks at Clause 13 again. Although the right hon. and gallant Member can look at Mr. Deputy-Speaker and feel satisfied that solicitors can always do their job, I am quite sure when it is a question of looking after agricultural land that my hon. and learned Friend was right in the submission he made. I therefore want to give the right hon. and gallant Gentleman no sort of hope that there is any likelihood of a change of mind on this subject. We have looked at this thing very carefully, and with a will to do what we consider best in the interests of the industry, and we are satisfied that if we are to keep efficiency in front of our minds all the time we are bound to resist the Amendment.</p>

<p>The Budget Resolutions, which this Committee agreed to earlier on, imposed the Income Tax for 1947/1948, and also provided that
<q>All such enactments as had effect with respect to the Income Tax for the year 1946/1947, other than such enactments as by their terms relate only to tax for that year, shall have effect for the year 1947/1948.</q>
These words mean that the Resolution should include provisions in any other Act of Parliament in so far as they refer to the collection of Income Tax for the current year. That included the P.A.Y.E. arrangements embodied and given legislative sanction in the Income Tax (Employments) Act, 1943. But the P.A.Y.E. arrangements in the 1943 Act

did not apply to the Armed Forces of the Crown, and the Resolution on Income Tax moved at the end of the Chancellor's statement on Budget day, should therefore have included a reference to Section 30 of the Finance Act, 1946. That would have enabled the Finance Bill, which will be before the House shortly, to include a provision to apply P.A.Y.E. to the Armed Forces of the Crown as from 6th April this year. The omission was a mistake, but, I hope, not a heinous one. This Resolution, which I ask the Committee to approve tonight, does not increase or diminish the liability of any member of the Armed Forces to Income Tax. It simply extends the method of assessment and collection as applied to all those who pay Income Tax under Schedule "E".</p>

<p>I am sorry to detain the House, but these opportunities are few and far between, and I want to direct the attention of hon. Members to an aspect of the manpower problem which I believe to be of serious importance. It concerns the fact that there are a million men of working age in this country who are missing from the official records of the Ministry of Labour. Before analysing the problem, I want to remind hon. Members of the general line of discussion in the House on the shortage and maldistribution of manpower and, in particular, of two statements in the Economic Survey for 1947; namely, the statement that the potential labour force of 18,300,000 men and women at the end of December, 1947, falls substantially short of what is needed to reach the national objectives, and later


on in the same paragraph 124 of the Economic Report, the statement that the need to increase the working population is not temporary, but is a permanent feature of our national life.<br/>
The Ministry of Labour are today proceeding with, or planning, a campaign to recruit more women into industry in particular districts, to persuade those due to retire to stay on at work, and to put a number of foreign immigrants into selected industries, public services and domestic service in order to increase, by December, 1947, by the number of 100,000, the size of the working population of the country. I agree entirely with these objectives and the methods being used by the Minister of Labour, yet it seems to me to be of great importance that there are, in fact, in the country, according to what we know, some one million men of working age who are not gainfully employed, in addition to those who register as unemployed. How do we know that this is a fact? I do not want to give too many statistics to the House, but it is necessary to give some in order to establish the case. In Table IV of the Monthly Digest of Statistics, we have the analysis of the Ministry of Labour of the distribution of the total manpower in Great Britain. This analysis purports to be a complete analysis of the working population, including employers, self-employed, and employees and professional people, and it includes all males of working age from 14 to 64 years, except the one category of private domestic service.<br/>
If the figures in this analysis of the total number of men in the working population are compared with the actual number of men of working age in the total population for the whole country, it will be found that there is a discrepancy of some one and a half million men. Actually taking the population figures given every six months, on 30th June last there was a difference of 1,647,000, and on 31st December last year there was a difference of 1,781,000 in the number of men in the total male population of working age as against the number accounted for in the Ministry of Labour analysis of the total working population. Between one and a half million and one and three quarter million of men of working age are missing from the analysis which is called "Distribution of the total manpower in Great Britain." Some of these can be accounted for, although they are not given in this

particular analysis in the Monthly Digest. Those boys and men in a variety of cases are accounted for in other categories, and I propose to give those whom I have been able to account for myself. Here I would like to thank the Minister of Labour and his experts for the assistance they have given me over a period of time in order to enable me to give this analysis.<br/>
Taking the period twelve months ago, in June, 1946, the categories that can be excluded in this 1,647,000 men who are missing from the analysis of working population are as follow. There were schoolboys of 14 years of age or over in all kinds of State and private schools who totalled 395,000. University students or students at technical colleges or Government training centres totalled 85,500. Then there were pensioners totally incapacitated as a result of two world wars, who numbered some 54,000. There were the men who were in mental institutions of varying types who numbered 72,000. There was the prison population which, at that date, came to the astounding total of 15,000 with 5,400 in approved schools and 480 in remand homes, making a total of 20,840. Finally, there were the deserters from the Armed Forces who officially in June, 1946, were given as 20,800. That gives a grand total of 648,140 men and boys.<br/>
We are still left with a total of 998,000 men of the working population who cannot be accounted for in any way in this analysis of the total manpower of the country and who cannot be included in the working population. As far as the Ministry of Labour know, they are not gainfully employed. Who are these 998,000 men? They fall roughly into four categories. In the first place, there is the category specifically excluded from the analysis of the working population, mainly the private domestic servants. According to the Minister of Labour&#x2014;and undoubtedly he is correct&#x2014;the estimated number of domestic male servants in Britain is fewer than 25,000. That accounts for a very small proportion, not even 3 per cent. of this 998,000 who are unaccounted for in the working population. In the second place, there are those who are totally incapacitated as a result of industrial accidents. There is no record and no accurate estimate that can be made of the number of men in the country permanently sick or permanently invalided as a result of what might well be


called industrial warfare. Anybody can make a simple, rough estimate of their number, but until the National Insurance Act and the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act come into force, the exact number will not be known. However, in computing this figure we have to take these people into account. In the third place, there are the men who have retired from work before 65 years of, age. No actual estimate can be given of the number of those men, but undoubtedly they make up some proportion of this 998,000 who cannot be accounted for.<br/>
Finally, there are what one might call, and what the Lord President of the Council, in another place, called, parasites and drones. They are those who are definitely not gainfully employed, a large number of whom may be both idle and rich. The latest figure for this class is, unfortunately, not very recent, but in the financial year immediately prior to the second world war&#x2014;and this figure was given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Upton (Mr. A. Lewis) in March of this year&#x2014;a quarter of a million taxpayers made returns solely of unearned income, the total of which was &#x00A3;220 millions. This gives an average income of &#x00A3;760 per annum to these persons who are professional rentiers. They contributed nothing in the way of work, but took quite a considerable amount of unearned income. Furthermore, there are the men who are professional gamblers and drones on the community in other ways. During the fuel crisis, a weekly magazine in this country took some statements from various men in the street regarding the way in which the fuel crisis had affected them. The first man whom the reporter of this magazine met in the street was an ablebodied man of 32 years of age, who gave this statement:
<q>Ever since I left the Services, 18 months ago, I have lived entirely by gambling, old have kept my head well above water, and the wife and kids in comfort. I am a keen student of form, and have systems worked out both on the dogs and the football pools. I do not know what I shall do if the dog tracks do not open again soon.</q>
How many men in the country are living without working in that way&#x2014;ablebodied men who are not recorded in any form whatever, and who could be recruited into useful work? Yet we have decided to institute campaigns to ask for married

women to go into industry; to bring into the country foreign emigr&#x00E9;s, and to ask men of 65 years of age to stay on at work. But there is an indefinite number of, men&#x2014;it may be anything within this number of 998,000&#x2014;who are not recorded in the analysis of working population, men of working age and men capable of work about whom nothing is known by the Minister of Labour. One can make what guess one likes as to how many men of that type there are.<br/>
I believe this demonstrates, in the first place, the urgent need for a national census in order that more can be discovered about the situation. In the second place, I think it demonstrates that the Minister of Labour should seriously consider taking a sample census&#x2014;though I realise the difficulties of this&#x2014;in a particular area of the country, based upon national registration, in order to be able to get some estimate of the numbers in the particular categories I have mentioned who must make up this unrecorded million men of the population who are not officially at work. Finally, I would like to know what proposals the Ministry of Labour have to bring into effective employment those men in this country who, at the moment, neither work nor want.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford (Mr. Swingler) for having raised this matter in so helpful a manner. In order that there shall be no misapprehension, about the size of the problem, I think it is necessary that I should briefly run over the figures. In this matter I am not greatly in conflict with my hon. Friend. The total male civilian population in Great Britain in mid-1946, taking men aged 14 to 64, was 14,390,000. There were in the Armed Forces at that date 1,895,000, making a total of 16,285,000. At that date, there were recorded as members of the working population, including members of the Armed Forces, 14,638,000, leaving a figure of 1,647,000 who are not recorded as members of the working population. To that extent, my hon. Friend and I are in complete agreement. In order that the other figures may be placed on the record, perhaps I had better give them also. With regard to schoolboys over the age of 14, there were at that date 245,000. In the


universities there were 47,000; among trainees under the Ministry of Labour and Ministry of Education, 25,000; and in mental institutions, 72,000. As to male domestics, I give an estimate of 30,000 in mid-1946. The figure mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford, was 25,000, which was for a much earlier period. I agree that it is an estimate&#x2014;it may be a shot in the dark&#x2014;but it is reasonable, I think, for male domestics. With regard to the prisons and similar institutions, the figure of 20,000 is correct.<br/>
Roughly, in mid-1946, 1,208,000 male members of the population were not in the working population, and that is the figure that one has to explain in the light of the facts. I regard this category as a category of unrecorded persons, and in that category there are a number of types who are legitimately not in the gainfully occupied population, but I would like to make the point that at the time we were "scraping the bucket" in 1943, when every male could be put to use in this country, we had a figure of 1,127,000 not in the working population at a time when every man who was available was used, if he could be used, and at a time when hardly anyone was allowed to escape national obligations. At that time, too, the Government had authority to direct every available man into effective and useful employment.<br/>
This is no new problem. It is largely a statistical problem, but I am not denying the fact that there is a residue of people of the type referred to by the hon. Member for Stafford of whom one must take account. In 1939, there were 1,414,000 people whose function in life was not provided for in the statistics collected by the Ministry of Labour. Who are these 1,208,000 people? First of all, there are the deserters. It is not safe to take the figure of 20,800 in mid-June as being wholly accounted for in the working population. Actually, that makes my case worse and not better. Then, there are those men who are in receipt of 100 per cent. disability pension. There are 54,000 in that category, and a large number of them are in the gainfully employed category. Many of them are at work. It is equally true that very many men getting only 70 per cent. disability pension are not at work; they are not fully employed. And there are

those men who have proved that they are unemployable and who are not getting 100 per cent. disability pension, and thus the picture is even more confused. Then there are those men on long-term workmen's compensation who are not provided for as part of the working population. What proportion they represent is anybody's guess. I have in mind the silicotic cases in South Wales, men waiting for medical boards, and who, after waiting for more than 6 months, automatically disappear from the statistics of the Ministry of Labour.<br/>
Then there are the men permanently sick industrially, waiting to get compensation, who are industrially disabled, but who are not included. In addition, there is the very large category of men who have inherited, or who were born with, certain physical deficiencies which exclude them from the working population altogether. The number is, indeed, a very substantial one. Then I come to the category of the permanently sick, men who have lost their rights under National Insurance, who are on public assistance, and men in public institutions; the male population who have no relatives, but are in the sick wards of our public institutions. Then there are the persons who have retired, and equally there is a substantial number of men who have exhausted their paid leave, but are having a good time on their gratuity. This is a section that is worrying us, because there has in the last six months been a remarkable increase in the number of people who have not come into the working population, although we were entitled to expect them to do so, having regard to the rate of demobilization. When we take all these categories into consideration, we are left with persons living on unearned incomes, and on top of that we have to take account of those who are obtaining a livelihood in devious ways; but we have no means of estimating the size of this problem.</p>

<p>That refers to the men on paid leave, but it does not refer to men who have exhausted their paid leave and have not yet taken up gainful employment. There is a statistical basis for that figure, but there is no statistical figure for the men who have exhausted their paid leave and are continuing to enjoy themselves on their gratuities. As to the nature of the age groups of this category of 1,208,000, our best estimate is that 20 per cent. are under 21; 20 per cent. between 21 and 35; 26 per cent. between 35 and 50, and 34 per cent. over 50. I thought perhaps that information would be useful.<br/>
Now, I come to the nature of the men who are in these unrecorded categories. It will be of some information to the House if I indicate that during the war, when these men were being called up for examination by medical boards, we found that in the younger age groups 10 per cent. were rejected completely for service in the Armed Forces; and that for the older men going up to 40 years of age, the percentage of rejection was over 35. That leads to the conclusion that there is a very large number of men who are not fit for ordinary employment, having regard to the fact that at the time when we had control over every person in the country we had more than one million men whom we could not bring into gainful employment.<br/>
There is a second point, and that is that the type of person to whom my hon. Friend has referred will be found not in the industrial areas, but probably in the large cities. I am referring to the "spiv" categories. What the size of that problem is, no one knows. The question is whether or not it would pay a dividend, in terms of increased manpower, to erect a large machine in the cities for the purpose of finding out who are in those categories,

and having done that to get the House to decide the steps that should be taken to make these men perform a socially useful task. That raises the whole question of the direction of labour. It also raises the question of what is useful employment in our society; and further, the question of how many of these men would really be of use in the under-manned industries where physically ablebodied men are required.<br/>
We are asked what the Ministry of Labour are doing. The Ministry have no powers of direction. The question whether direction over this type of person is desirable is a matter for wider discussion than can take place now. With regard to inducements, the inducements to normal citizens to go into employment today are probably higher&#x2014;except for one period during the war&#x2014;than ever in our history. The inducements are good, and we are doing all that is in our power, by means of advertisements and appeals, by Debates in this House, and by the description of our economic position, to try to rouse the social conscience of these men and to get them to give their aid in our present situation.<br/>
That is the general position as we see it. It is our view that the number of people who are not doing socially useful work in this country is extremely small. If we are to make them work, it means that we must have a return to the powers of control over labour. About that there will be bitter controversy. But even if we got those powers of control, the question we would have to decide is whether the machinery to pull these people out and drive them into industry can pay sufficient dividends in terms of additional manpower to justify its introduction. There is a third point: it is whether many of these men&#x2014;and this is a free country&#x2014;who are performing what, in their opinion, is a right sort of task to get a livelihood, should be described by some tribunal as parasites. In the present economic position of this country no man worth his salt can blind himself to the necessity for every useful bit of effort we can get from every useful citizen.</p>
