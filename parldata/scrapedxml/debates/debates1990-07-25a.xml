There is no basis for those estimates and I believe that the figure will be much more modest.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman will have taken note of the fact that I carefully did not join in the remonstration by the hon. Member for Caithness and Sutherland (Mr. Maclennan) in the earlier part of his question, nor should I wish to. I am sure that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) would not wish to be associated with that. I met Sir William Wilkinson last week and we discussed the figure that has just been mentioned. There was a clear conflict between his understanding and the understanding of Mr. Timothy Hornsby, who also attended the meeting. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that a much more realistic figure was agreed between Mr. Timothy Hornsby and my officials at the Department of the Environment. I have never sought to deny in any way, shape or form that reorganisation will cost more money. If we are to deliver the policy to which I referred earlier, it will cost more money. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I are clear about the matter. We are under the microscope. We know that we have to deliver improved conservation. That we have already shown in the 11 years that we have been in office. During that period we have increased expenditure on nature conservation by 160 per cent. in real terms. The previous Labour Government cut it. Labour Members just talk about conservation; they do absolutely nothing about it.</p>

<p>I know of the Havering situation because my hon. Friend has led a number of delegations to Ministers in that regard.

<p>Wandsworth's standard spending assessment was set on exactly the same basis as that used for every other authority.

I shall consider any new evidence relating to Wandsworth, as I shall in respect of other boroughs, but the spending decisions taken by local authorities are for them.

<p>My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The twin evils of the rating system were that only about half the population paid for local authority spending, which was grossly unfair&#x2014;particularly given how that sample was selected&#x2014;and that with such a small proportion of the population paying, some local authorities felt that because there were so many freeloaders in the system they could spend very high amounts of money.

<p>The hon. Gentleman has considerable experience of local authorities. He should know that the community charge provides only a minority proportion of the total spending of local authorities.

Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment announce that the external finance to local authorities next year is to increase by 12&#x00B7;8 per cent.

<p>I believe that I saw it reported that the Leader of the Opposition had described the rates as a leap into the frying pan. I do not pretend entirely to understand what he meant by that, but I think that it must mean that at one time the Labour party thought that the rates were a very bad idea.

all the problems of those people clustered in households who may have high incomes but participate in only one rates bill. I know of no way in which the Labour party could get out of that problem.

<p>Yes, indeed. On previous occasions we have carried out exemplifications of that scheme, and the SLD party did not like the results. Of course, people on low incomes were treated worse under the old rating system because now, for every pound of income that a person on a low income may have, a 15p deduction is made from their benefit, whereas under the old rating system a 20p per pound deduction was made.</p>

<p>I reject what the hon. Gentleman says about suffering. The needs of people on low income are assessed to see whether they qualify for community charge benefit. A couple's needs are assessed together. Obviously, the system takes into account that a couple has higher needs than a single person and that if it is a pensioner couple, if one of the couple is disabled or if the couple has


children, the needs are higher again. The needs of a couple are fully assessed within the system. The provision of joint and several liability is there to ensure that where one of the partners is not earning, the debt can be recovered from the earning partner, who has liability for the couple as a whole.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware, or may I remind him, that millions of women stay at home to look after a family consisting of children or elderly relatives and thus do not earn any money or have any income or their own? Those women did not pay rates under the previous system, as the Minister pointed out. Is there any valid reason why they should not receive transitional relief, as they qualify in every way for it?

<p>We believe in treating couples as couples. A couple may decide that one of the partners will not earn and that the partner who earns will bear the responsibilities of the entire family. That decision is made by couples. If the amount that the partner who is earning receives is so little that the couple qualifies for relief, they will be assessed as a couple and their needs taken into account. As I have explained, if a couple has children, is elderly or disabled, the assessment of their needs will be higher. That is appropriate. The provision of joint and several liability exists to protect the non-earning partner.</p>

Two Shell search-and-rescue helicopters based in the Brent field were on the scene within minutes of the accident. They were joined by a coastguard helicopter based at Sumburgh and an RAF Nimrod.<br/>
The rescue operations are being co-ordinated by the Aberdeen coastguards, assisted by the rescue co-ordination centre at Edinburgh. The wreckage of the aircraft has been located on the sea bed, in 400 ft of water. Specialist diving craft are on the scene.<br/>

This is just another example of how risky a business it is to win oil from the North sea and of how thousands of people every day are putting their lives at risk on behalf of the whole community. We should be grateful to them for that.<br/>
I have a few specific questions for the Secretary of State relating to the incident. Does he acknowledge that a similar helicopter, a Sikorsky S-61, burst into flames and crashed into the North sea&#x2014;fortunately, without loss of life&#x2014;on 13 July 1988 and that we have not yet received the accident investigation report? It has apparently been delayed for administrative reasons. Does the Secretary of State accept that we should not have to wait so long? In the case of this incident, will he ensure that a report is prepared more speedily? Will he also ensure that a fatal accident inquiry is set in motion as quickly as possible? I understand that an inquiry has been called for by British International Helicopters. I believe that an inquiry will be welcomed by the whole community. Does he accept that

such incidents show how important offshore safety must be in all operations in the North sea? Once again, we are extremely grateful to those who put their lives at risk.</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman knows, in my former job I went offshore to various platforms and rigs. I confirm what he says. We take for granted the work of people who produce great wealth for the country at some risk to themselves.<br/>
I shall look into the question about the air accident investigation branch report on the fatal accident two years ago. As the hon. Gentleman knows, the AAIB is a highly regarded body and it has been very busy recently. In particular, the Lockerbie investigation has taken up a tremendous amount of its time. However, I shall make sure that that report is issued as soon as possible.<br/>
The fatal accident inquiry is a matter not for me but for the Scottish legal authorities. I am sure that they will get on with making the necessary arrangements.<br/>
I entirely agree with what the hon. Gentleman said about the importance of safety in the North sea. The Department of Transport uniquely funds research into helicopter operations and safety in conjuction with the Department of Energy, the Civil Aviation Authority and the United Kingdom offshore operators.

<p>May I, too, extend my sympathy to the families and friends of those involved in the incident? Since I heard about the incident, I have spent a great deal of time on the telephone talking to people from my constituency who work offshore or represent those who work offshore. There is a genuine sense of anger today about the incident. It is the latest in a long line of such incidents. We have had 250 deaths in the North sea on offshore installations and vessels alone. There have been 74 deaths in helicopters, not counting any deaths arising out of today's incident. That is a shocking total.<br/>
I wish to raise one important specific point with the Secretary of State. I understand that a survey was carried out recently on the Kittiwake platform, which is going through the hook-up process. In that survey, 36 people were found not to have offshore survival certificates, which hitherto were regarded as mandatory. The Secretary of State will be aware from his experience that helicopter evacuation is an essential part of that training process. If the survey results are correct&#x2014;again, it is a shocking indictment of the attitude of the oil companies to safety in the North sea&#x2014;will the right hon. Gentleman ensure that the question of offshore survival certificates is investigated as part of the process of investigating this incident?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman strikes a wrong note when he talks about increased helicopter accidents. There is no discernible trend of increase in the number of


accidents in helicopters. I am sure that he is as pleased as I am that for the past three years there have been no fatal accidents. There were two bad tragedies in the mid-1980s, but the record has not worsened. It is misleading for the hon. Gentleman to suggest that it has.<br/>
I shall look into the hon. Gentleman's point about Kittiwake. I cannot confirm what the hon. Gentleman said, but I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy will look into the matter.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend will be aware that all hon. Members whose Scottish constituencies have offshore workers will be saddened by today's accident. Does he agree that the investigation branch always does its work splendidly and thoroughly after such accidents, and that if anything is found during the investigation that requires immediate action it is dealt with immediately and all operators are instructed to implement the requirements? Does he agree that we should not require the full report before taking any necessary action to ensure that operations are safe?</p>

Will the Secretary of State elaborate on the time scale that he invisages for the report's production? We all wish to see it undertaken quickly because of its implications.

<p>My hon. Friend is correct in saying that the S-61 has a good safety record on the whole: there has been one fatal accident in S-61 operations in the past 10 years. We should not draw up a league table in the North

<p>On behalf of myself and others, may I join in the expressions of sympathy for those who have suffered loss and serious injury in the accident, and pay tribute to the rescue services.<br/>
While I accept that it is impossible to make snap judgments on the information available, will the Secretary of State say whether weather was a factor at the time? Does he understand that the most urgent need is to determine whether the S-61 is similar to that which at one time suffered a spate of gearbox trouble? That must be determined as quickly as possible, and, if necessary, such helicopters will have to he grounded in the interests of the safety of people who continue to use them. Will he assure us that that will be done as quickly as possible because there will be great worry and concern among those people who have to fly over the North sea every day and their relatives?</p>

<p>I confirm that, although there was a little fog and cloud about in the North sea earlier today, visibility was about two miles. Therefore, visibility does not appear to have been a factor.<br/>

Is the Secretary of State aware that the Sikorsky S-61 has been involved in three losses in the past two years and eight ditchings in the past 20 years; and that, according to my information, a door fell off one yesterday? This anxiety is shared by many oil workers, and it is also highlighted in the Civil Aviation Authority's report, which the Secretary of State received yesterday. May I suggest that he reads that report about helicopter safety?<br/>
In the light of experience of inquiries, may I add my voice to those of others who have asked the right hon. Gentleman to press the Crown Office to ensure that there is no unnecessary delay in the fatal accident inquiry? As for the excellent aviation inspector's formal investigations, will the right hon. Gentleman ensure that no extraordinary pressures are brought to bear, as happened in the case of the Boeing company over the loss of the Chinook helicopter in 1986, when the inspector's report was delayed by more than two years?

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for his opening remarks. It appears that, once again, the rescue services have performed superbly.<br/>
I repeat what I have already said about helicopter safety: in the past 10 years there has been one fatal accident involving an S-61, so there is no reason to make sweeping remarks about the aircraft. The hon. Gentleman should do nothing to suggest that he has made a snap


judgment, which would cause unnecessary concern on the part of the relatives of those who are still working today in the North sea.<br/>
As the hon. Gentleman heard me tell the House, the fatal accident inquiry is a matter not for me but for the Law Officers. I shall convey to them the fact that the House feels that the matter should be treated urgently. I cannot do more than that; they must make their own arrangements, and I am sure that they will.<br/>
The accident investigation branch caries out its work, as the hon.

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement.<br/>
In the defence debate last month, I set out the basis on which we have been considering options for change in defence. I would now like to advise the House of the broad proposals that we are considering and on which we will now be consulting with the NATO authorities and our allies, with the defence industries, and, most importantly, with all those directly affected in the armed forces and the MOD's civilian staff. My statement today follows the publication this morning of a valuable report from the Select Committee on Defence on the defence implications of recent events in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.<br/>
The declaration issued at the NATO summit meeting here in London earlier this month said:
<q>Europe has entered a new, promising era &#x2026; This alliance must and will adapt".</q><br/>
The "Options for Change" have identified the ways in which our forces might be restructured by the mid-1990s in the light of these developments. The pace of change will depend upon the signature and implementation of a Conventional Forces in Europe agreement, on the progress of the two-plus-four talks, and on how quickly Soviet troops leave eastern Europe and other Soviet forces are run down. The precise shape of our contributions to NATO must reflect discussions yet to come with the NATO authorities and with our allies.<br/>
In the options for change studies, we have sought to devise a structure for our regular forces appropriate to the new security situation and meeting our essential peacetime operational needs. The framework that we have provided would be reinforced in a period of tension by drawing on volunteer reserves and reservists, who will have an important role to play. We have also allowed for the possible need to build back up our forces over a longer period should international circumstances ever require us to do so.<br/>
There clearly are opportunities but also risks in Europe; and elsewhere some worrying trends&#x2014;not least, the proliferation of sophisticated weapons systems. We shall therfore continue to need a robust defence capability as our insurance against the unexpected. Our armed forces, albeit at lower levels, will be as important a safeguard for our country in the future as they have been in the past.<br/>
Our proposals will bring savings and a reduction in the share of GDP taken by defence. We need force levels which we can afford and which can realistically be manned, given demographic pressures in the 1990s. The aim is smaller forces, better equipped, properly trained and housed, and well motivated. They will need to be flexible and mobile and able to contribute both in NATO and, if necessary, elsewhere.<br/>
What I now have to put before the House are some proposals for change and some elements that will not change.<br/>
We shall retain our strategic deterrent with a four-boat Trident force. In accordance with NATO policy for an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional forces, based in Europe, we shall also need a sub-strategic force of dual-capable Tornados with a stand-off missile.<br/>
We must also continue to ensure the effective defence of the United Kingdom itself. A comprehensive air defence capability will still be essential, although with a smaller fighter force than had been planned. The United Kingdom fighter force would be held at seven squadrons of air-defence Tornados, supplemented by armed Hawks, and the remaining two Phantom squadrons would be withdrawn. We plan to retain at about present levels our home defence forces and our capability to deal with hostile mine-laying in home waters. We shall sustain our contribution in support of the police in Northern Ireland. For as long as they are needed, we will provide forces for our dependent territories and other overseas responsibilities in the Falklands, Cyprus, Gibraltar, Belize and&#x2014;until 1997&#x2014;Hong Kong.<br/>
We will continue to play our full part in the defence of Europe. We will continue to deploy forces in Germany alongside our German and other allies, a contribution which is, I know, warmly welcomed by the German Government. We envisage that, in the changed circumstances of the mid-1990s, our stationed forces could be roughly half their present strength. When reinforced from the United Kingdom, our Army contribution could comprise about two divisions, rather than four as at present. Our contribution will need to be shaped with that of our allies to fit the new force structures which we expect to see in the central region.<br/>
We expect to reduce the RAF presence in Germany from four bases to two. We envisage retaining Harrier and helicopter forces there. As Germany takes on the air-policing responsibility for its territory, we would envisage phasing out our air-defence contribution. We envisage maintaining six squadrons of Tornado aircraft in Germany and the United Kingdom with nuclear and conventional roles in Europe. The two variants of Tornado will provide the backbone of the future Royal Air Force. Aircraft not deployed in peacetime will be retained for use should we need to build back up our capability.<br/>
In view of Chancellor Kohl's request that troops of the three western powers should stay in Berlin as long as Soviet forces are in the present German Democratic Republic, we envisage continuing to contribute to an allied presence, including an RAF contingent, for this period in Berlin. We intend to retain an amphibious capability in the longer term, the role of which will include reinforcement of NATO's northern region. We shall also maintain an air contribution, to the defence of the northern region, but we are looking again at the future requirement for the United Kingdom mobile force.<br/>
Elsewhere in our maritime contribution, we need to take account of the decline in the size of the Soviet navy but also of its continuing modernisation, especially with new classes of submarine. We propose to maintain three carriers, update their Sea Harrier aircraft and, subject to satisfactory progress, proceed with the EH 101 helicopter programme. I envisage a future destroyer/frigate force of about 40 ships. The reduction would be achieved by paying off older, less capable ships. In addition to Trident, we envisage a future submarine force of about 16 boats of which three quarters would be nuclear powered. We see the Buccaneer force in the anti-ship role being replaced by dual-capable Tornados redeployed from Germany and re-equipped with Sea Eagle missiles. There would be a small reduction in Nimrod numbers.<br/>
A capability for other contingencies would be provided by establishing a strategic reserve division bringing

together amphibious, parachute, airmobile and armoured formations with roles also in Europe or in national defence.<br/>
I have described how we now see the armed forces evolving in the period to 1995. These proposals are now for further study and consultation with NATO and or Brussels treaty partners. When we are able to take final decisions will depend on many factors, not least progress in the autumn on CFE talks, a successful outcome to the two-plus-four talks, a clear timetable for Soviet withdrawals from Europe, and the pace of discussions with our allies on the evolution of NATO strategy and operational concepts.<br/>
We shall want in particular fully to consult the German Government over changes in our deployments in Germany. We aim to move in an orderly and properly planned way to our new force structure, after the consultations that I have described and when the necessary conditions have been met. We shall at the same time conduct a detailed scrutiny of our equipment plans, including our research and development effort, to ensure that they would be in keeping with our changed requirements.<br/>
Work remains to be done on detailed force structures and on changes in the support area, where we will be looking for substantial savings, before we can clarify the implications for individual units. We envisage in broad terms by the mid-1990s a Regular Army of about 120,000, Royal Navy/Royal Marines of about 60,000 and a Royal Air Force of about 75,000. On that basis, the overall reduction in regular service manpower would be about 18 per cent. We expect our civilian numbers to be similarly reduced. The volunteer reserves will continue to play a key role, and we wish to consider the appropriate numbers for the future, having regard to our needs and realistic levels of recruitment and retention.<br/>
There will now be further work on the detailed implications of these broad proposals. Their costs will, of course, be within the expenditure plans published in the last public expenditure White Paper. Revised figures for defence expenditure will be announced as part of the Government's decisions on the total public expenditure programme in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's autumn statement. In respect of the current year, the House is aware that I am taking steps to constrain expenditure within the agreed provision. Announcements have been made on aircraft. Consistent with our longer-term plans, we shall be easing back on Army recruiting and retiring early several ships and submarines, and making some other short-term changes to the programme which will be announced shortly.<br/>
This country has owed a great debt to its armed services throughout its history. Their abilities and professionalism are not something that can be lightly discarded and then easily recalled when they may suddenly be needed. We have a duty to tell them what we believe the future is likely to hold for them at a time when the pace and scale of events in Europe offer real opportunities for change.<br/>
We believe that the new force structures that we envisage can give us strong and reliable defences, in changing circumstances, and at an affordable cost. Our proposals provide for us to continue to make a major contribution to the north Atlantic alliance as it adapts to the changes that its resolution and cohesion have done so much to make possible.<br/>
It is a time of opportunity and hope for change, yet without putting at risk the safe protection of our country nor neglecting fair consideration of those whose task that is. Our aim is an orderly and planned transition to the new world now unfolding, and I commend it to the House.</p>

<p>The House welcomes the statement. For a while, it was uncertain whether we would have it before the House rose, and today was both the first and last possible time to have it. The statement is the first useful step in the consideration of our response to changing events. As the Secretary of State said, it dovetails with the report of the Select Committee on Defence. I am sure that the House will agree that many of the changes set out in the statement will come as a consequence of arms control and of Soviet withdrawals from Germany.<br/>
I realise that the statement was lengthy, and that many hon. Members wish to ask questions about it, but some points must be made. What significance does the withdrawal of two Army divisions have for equipment requirements, and in particular the orders for the replacement of the Challenger tanks? What implications will that have for the proposed multinational force? What discussions has the Secretary of State had with his NATO allies about what form this will take?<br/>
The Secretary of State said that the two variants of Tornado will provide the backbone of the RAF. Where does this leave the European fighter aircraft programme? How many of the proposed nuclear-capable aircraft will be in Germany? Have the German Government been consulted about this? My understanding is that there is widespread reluctance within Germany to accept this nuclear-equipped aircraft and nuclear weapons. What is the basis for this hosting programme?<br/>
I am sure that the Secretary of State is aware that the Select Committee on Defence has expressed considerable reservations about the tactical air-to-surface missile project. The House is entitled to know roughly what the costs of this programme will be and from where the weapons will be procured. Will they be American or Franco-British?<br/>
Will the Secretary of State confirm that this is the first occasion on which he has recognised that there are Soviet naval reductions? On a number of occasions we have had lectures about the Soviet naval procurement programme. In the light of these reductions, and in the light of the reduction in our Navy to about 40 frigates, will there be a replacement for the type 42? There will be all-party relief at his remarks about the EH 101 programme, about which there was great anxiety. His remarks will be taken as encouragement.<br/>
The significance of the announcements to service morale will not be lost on the House. In his statement, the Secretary of State suggests that there could be a reduction in recruitment, almost hinting at natural wastage as one of the solutions to the personnel problem. Will he confirm that natural wastage will not be the only method of securing reductions in troop numbers? Will he concede that it will be necessary to change the nature of service conditions and to attract to the services, for the new types of forces that he has recommended, a different breed of

soldier who may well have to be paid more and who will certainly be looking for better conditions than those that have been suggested recently?<br/>
Will the Secretary of State confirm that the absence of any reference to an extended out-of-area role is in line with the views expressed in the Select Committee's report? Will he also confirm that we are seeing here an operation that will be working within the existing limits of British capabilities and that we will not have an enhanced out-of-area capability?<br/>
The Secretary of State's proposals will require much consideration within the House and outside. A number of people involved in the defence industries and the services have made a great contribution to the defence of Britain and they must be taken account of at this time.<br/>
Will the right hon. Gentleman make the financial implications of the changes known to the House as soon as possible and ensure that we have an early debate when the House returns after the recess or as soon as the autumn statement is available, so that we can discern the economic consequences of the cuts? They will mean little to the House without a price tag attached to them.<br/>
Will the Secretary of State arrange perhaps a two-day debate in Government time as soon as the House resumes so that we can examine properly the implications of his useful contribution to what we regard as a process which will be far longer and more extensive than he described today.</p>

<p>The House must respect the hon. Gentleman's courage. He rose to his feet with hon. Members behind him who are pledged, under a Labour party conference motion, to slash defence expenditure by as much as &#x00A3;9,000 million, and then made a moving speech on behalf of the workers in Leeds who hope to provide tanks, the workers of Westland who hope to provide helicopters and the workers in Edinburgh and Lancashire who hope to produce the EFA. We hope that it will be possible to proceed on all those projects, and I note his great concern for their future.<br/>
I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for saying that this is a first useful step in putting forward proposals in response to the changing circumstances. I suspect that only the Conservative party will put forward concrete proposals on the matter. We shall look forward with great interest to a coherent response from the Opposition.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman referred to consultation in respect of the other proposals that I made. I sought to emphasise that I am putting forward a number of proposals on behalf of Her Majesty's Government in respect of our future defence structure which are precisely for consultation because we are determined to play our proper and full part in the NATO alliance.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman referred to TASM and the sub-strategic missiles with dual capable aircraft, but he will know that only this month the NATO summit here in London made the unanimous statement that there should be an appropriate mix of nuclear and conventional weapons based in Europe, and my announcement is absolutely consistent with that.<br/>
I am not hinting at natural wastage. I regard the opportunity to ensure that we make a proper, orderly and planned change as a virtue. We hope to achieve that in a way that takes proper account of the lifetime of service that many have given. We want to make changes to the


new structure in an orderly and planned way. That is a duty that we have to those in the armed forces, and it is one that the Government are determined to discharge.</p>

<p>Our allies have made certain statements. For example, Chancellor Kohl announced a figure of 370,000 for the Bundeswehr for a united Germany. Other NATO allies have also made proposals.

I did not respond to the point raised by the hon. Member for Clackmannan (Mr. O'Neill) about the concept of multinationality. There is the possibility of a multinational corps in which we could make a significantcontribution. That is the way to go forward.<br/>

I hope that he will understand my disappointment that, as yet, no consideration has been given to the suggestion that the number of warheads to be deployed should be no greater than those presently deployed in the Polaris system.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman should understand that there will be great disappointment about the suggestion that the United Kingdom might seek to deploy the tactical air-to-surface missile. There may be a NATO case for the deployment of that weapon, but thus far no compelling evidence has been produced to justify the United Kingdom embarking upon that course.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the hon. and learned Gentleman's general welcome, even though he let himself down a little at the end of his remarks. The biggest. waste of money conceivable would be to have a nuclear deterrent that was not credible and not effective. That is the base line. There is no point in having a deterrent if it is not likely to work and is not likely to provide the deterrent effect that we seek. The deterrent has proved to be the biggest life saver in the history of man, and we are determined to maintain that capability. That is my first point.<br/>
Secondly, our policy is absolutely clear in the sense that the background to my statement today is the success of the policy to which we have held over the years. Part of that is not to depend solely on a strategic nuclear deterrent but to have a sub-strategic nuclear deterrent. That of course has the unanimous agreement of NATO.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend recognise that the caution with which he has made his statement today, both as to the size of the possible economies and the time scale within which they may be available, will be much welcomed on this side of the House? Will he continue to reaffirm that the reason why he is able to make his statement&#x2014;cautiously optimistic as it is&#x2014;is precisely because this Government supported the policies of the NATO alliance, which brought about the reassessment of Soviet foreign policy, against continual opposition from the Labour party at every stage? Will my right hon. Friend tell the House how he sees the ever-increasing costs of weapons procurement within a constrained defence budget being met unless we recognise the need for ever-wider international co-operation in weapons procurement?</p>

<p>I thank my right hon. Friend for his comments. The leadership of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, and of my right hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Heseltine) as one of my predecessors, in standing firm at a critical moment in our history, is now viewed by many as the turning point that opened up the possibility of the wonderful changes that we have seen. One might have hoped that some of those lessons would at last be appreciated by some Labour Members.<br/>
We now begin an intensive period of examination of force structures, equipment programmes and support arrangements. There is a tremendous amount of work to be done. My right hon. Friend the Member for Henley made the point that our allies face similar challenges. I spoke to our major allies this afternoon, and they are considering at this moment the difficult challenges that confront them. We shall wherever possible examine taking advantage of co-operation and cost sharing in programmes.</p>

<p>As far as I can see, the Secretary of State's statement makes no reference&#x2014;any more than did his defence statement of a few weeks ago&#x2014;to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, even though it comes up for possible renewal or may end in a few months. The Government must surely have a policy on that issue. Do not the Government understand that, especially in the light of the most welcome ending of the cold war, far and away the worst danger of the world being blown to pieces is the proliferation of nuclear weapons in other countries? If Defence Ministers in other parts of the world listen to the Secretary of State, it might be a recipe


for the multiplication of their weapons. Will the right hon. Gentleman say what steps the Government will take to make the nuclear non-proliferation treaty truly effective?</p>

<p>The House will certainly hand to the right hon. Gentleman any award for consistency of position, no matter how consistently wrong that position has been. Our position has always been abundantly clear. If the right hon.

<p>I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his measured and orderly response to the challenge of the momentous events in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. He will recall the disastrous effects of some of the cuts of the past&#x2014;from the mindless disarmament talks in the 1930s to the more recent cuts that affected the Army's regimental system in the 1960s and 1970s. To help Army morale, what reassurance can my right hon. Friend give that we will not repeat the mistakes of the 1960s and 1970s?</p>

<p>I hoped in my statement to give a broad outline of our proposals. There have been some very worrying rumours suggesting that the reductions in the Army would be much more substantial, and the figure of 80,000 was quoted, implying that one in two people in the Army would lose their jobs. I hope that I have been able to give some reassurance about the numbers and the time scale.<br/>
The defence staff and the chiefs of staff have worked quite excellently on what I have been able to say today. We now want to widen the circle so that the individual services can also address the particular problems that they have to address and we can therefore have a wider involvement of people. That is the best way to achieve a more sensible outcome.<br/>
I do not conceal from the House the fact that we will have to face some very difficult decisions and problems. However, throughout the armed forces and the Ministry of Defence there is a recognition that this is an opportunity for change. If it can be a movement towards a smaller and better defence structure for our country, it is to be welcomed.</p>

<p>Is not this statement a case of no serious change and no significant savings? Are not the Government guilty of extreme cowardice in failing to face up to the opportunities for disarmament and so transfer resources from war to peace? Will not the consequences be a slowdown in world disarmament and an increase in arms proliferation as other countries quote Britain's military posture as a reason for their actions?</p>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman talks to the leader of his party about his policy. However, he may have noticed that my statement today, in certain important respects, follows on from the outcome of the NATO summit. He may not have noticed that, when the Leader of the Opposition was in Washington and talking about developments in Europe and the NATO summit agreement, the right hon. Gentleman said that it was good to be alive. I am not sure whether that spirit has quite spread to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p>I congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence on making it clear that the reductions that he envisages will depend not just on agreement over Soviet withdrawal and disarmament, but on the achievement of what is agreed. May I also congratulate him on making it clear that British forces will remain in Germany? The presence of British and French forces in Germany is fundamental under the Brussels treaty to the maintanance of the European Community. Does my right hon. Friend agree that developments in the Gulf over the past few days have made it clear that we may well have to share responsibility for out-of-area operations?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his kind welcome for what I have said today. With regard to the continuing presence of British forces in Germany, it has always been made clear to me by the German Government and NATO that stationed forces&#x2014;those of the United States, the British and our other allies&#x2014;are an important element in the cohesion of the alliance.<br/>
With regard to my right hon. Friend's second point about developments elsewhere, whatever implications such developments may have for us, in many areas the world is not a very steady and safe place at the moment. It is very important for the basic needs of this country, with its responsibilities, alliances, interests and connections, that we maintain an adequate defence capability.</p>

<p>I welcome the undertaking to continue the commitment to Northern Ireland, but would it be possible to increase the number of specialist elements, including the supply of helicopters, which are urgently needed by the Regular Army, the Ulster Defence Regiment and the police, particularly in the light of yesterday's atrocity.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for noting that I confirmed our determination to maintain our contribution. We will certainly consider specialist aspects.

We will certainly seek to respond to those requests as effectively as we can.</p>

<p>May I commend my right hon. Friend on his timely statement and on appearing to get the balance about right in these crucial matters? I wish him well in carrying out the restructuring and making sure that we shift slowly towards a maritime strategy as opposed to a continental one. In that context, I note the considerable reduction in submarines.<br/>
I wish my right hon. Friend well in making sure that his future programme is led by strategic needs and not by the considerable pressures of the Treasury Bench.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend waited until my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury had withdrawn before embarking on that brave sally. Certainly we have tried to strike a fair balance. I understand why my hon. Friend picked up my point about the change in submarine numbers from 27 to 16. The reduction appears bigger than the reality. The Soviet Union is reducing the number of submarines but introducing more capable, effective and modern submarines. That is exactly what we shall be doing.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State agree that the first challenge which faces him in his restructuring task is to preserve the high quality and motivation of British service men, who are so widely admired throughout the western alliance? His second challenge is to find the right strategic decision when no one can foresee the strategic shape of things to come. The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the lack of agreement on CFE and two-plus-four; he might have mentioned instability in the Soviet Union. Therefore, he is quite right to resist the temptation to cut the services ruthlessly and arbitrarily. If the House is entitled to look for a peace dividend, the services are entitled to look for a services dividend. Will the right hon. Gentleman say a word about the force structure that he envisages for the strategic reserve division?</p>

<p>The whole House knows the keen interest that the hon. Gentleman takes in these matters. I am extremely grateful for what he said. Now that our words go rather further afield, I know that his comments will be deeply appreciated by our armed forces who serve in many parts of the world. On a day when two of them have just been awarded the George medal, it is a reminder of the professionalism and courage that they bring to bear in quite unexpected circumstances and of the debt that we owe them.<br/>
The exact structure of the strategic reserve division will require further consideration. I have tried to set out the elements that will be within it, and that work will now be carried forward.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that his statement today illustrates the fact that a multi-balanced force reduction approach is more appropriate than a unilateralist approach? He would not have been able to make reductions without reductions on the other side of the iron curtain. Will he say a little more about the future of amphibious capability, as many of us take the view that the Royal Marines and the flexibility they provide are particularly appropriate to modern defence?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I made it clear that we intend to maintain an amphibious capability in the longer term. Obviously, that includes the capability of marine commandos to discharge their amphibious work. The House knows that we are considering the vessels that are required for that, but it is important that we maintain that capability which provides the flexibility and mobility that will become increasingly important if we have lower force structures and levels.</p>

<p>In adding my welcome to the broad objectives of the statement, may I put it to the Secretary of State that, in an uncertain world, it is prudent common sense for Britain to maintain an effective minimum nuclear deterrent for the foreseeable future? As the sub-strategic systems are just as important as the four-boat Trident force, when will the Secretary of State be able to announce a decision on the weapons system to be carried by the Tornado?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, who takes a close and well-informed interest in these matters which qualifies him to contribute to defence debates in the House. On the latter point, as he knows, we are considering two alternatives&#x2014;the American and the

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has a distinguished record. Obviously, the House listens with great respect to his comments. He may be interested in the quotation that I found today, which says of the Korean war:
<q>It was a contingency which took the British Government and its military Chiefs of Staff by surprise; the first of many in following years to make unexpected and irresistible claims on money and manpower.</q>
We certainly hope that we shall not face anything like that again. My job is not to take risks but to ensure that, if what we do not want to happen occurs, we can defend ourselves. My hon.

<p>I welcome the Secretary of State's decision to make a statement before the recess, but may I press him for a debate when we return? Will he give the House the benefit of his thinking on the threat assessment, which led him to his conclusion to go ahead with the tactical air-to-surface missile? How many ships does he intend to decommission, given that we have about 40 frigates and destroyers? In view of the importance of the statement to the economy of the fourth poorest country in the world, will he reassure the House that today's announcement does not entail any change to his previous statement about the future of the Brigade of Gurkhas?</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Patronage Secretary has a good line to my right hon, and learned Friend the Leader of the House and he will have heard the hon. Gentleman's first comment. I would welcome the opportunity for a debate, the timing of which can be discussed.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked about the number of frigates. The current number is 48 and, as I said, it will decrease to about 40 through decommissioning or disposing of some older frigates. There will not be an equivalent reduction in capability. I am aware of the statement on the Gurkhas made by my predecessor in May last year.</p>

<p>I again confirm that what I have said today is conditional on the developments going in the direction that we want them to go. We can change direction or arrest development and build back up if our hopes are dashed. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Duffy) picked up the phrase "service dividend". I attach importance to that, as well as to any implication of savings called a peace dividend. In a service dividend I certainly include equipment which is reliable, which works and for which there are spares, so that we can ensure better equipped, even if smaller, armed forces.</p>

<p>Will the Secretary of State, in simple and straightforward terms, tell the House exactly how much money the Government envisage saving as a result of his statement? Will he confirm that there will be an early opportunity for debate, particularly as the announcement that four Trident submarines will be based on the Clyde will be met with bitter resentment in Scotland?

<p>On the first point, which I sought to cover in my statement, I cannot give an answer to the hon. Lady, for the obvious reason that I have set out our policy. We believe that this is the right approach to the defence strategy of our country. We must now examine the matter in detail and cost in detail the implications of it. I have talked about an 18 per cent. reduction in the level of our armed forces, equivalent reductions in civilian manpower, the need to examine the support area for equivalent savings, and the need to examine our procurement budget and weapons system as well. The outcome of that will produce significant savings during the later part of the year.<br/>
As I have told the House, as for this year, I am facing serious problems with transitional costs and inflation. I have already announced to the House certain savings that we must make. We shall obviously live within whatever cash base line we have for this year. That is the answer to the first point about money.<br/>

<p>My right hon. Friend's statement will be welcomed for clarifying the future of the armed forces as well as the wider community. Will he give an assurance that the welcome plan to form the new division to bring together our various land and air capabilities will take full account of the present instabilities in the middle east, not only in the Persian gulf but in other parts of the middle east where there are considerable threats to security and the supply of oil to western Europe.</p>

<p>It may be possible in two years' time to cut even more substantially the present force levels. Most people would agree that, because there are so many uncertainties, prudence is necessary in the meantime. The cuts that have already been announced are substantial and will hurt deeply. If, as appears to be correct, the Soviet naval building programme continues and the Royal Navy is unable adequately to meet its existing commitments with about 50 frigates and destroyers, how can the Secretary of State believe that with about 40 frigates and destroyers there will be no loss of capability? I await anxiously his reply. I simply do not believe that it will be possible to cut to 40 without having to reduce capability. Is the Secretary of State considering reducing capability?</p>

<p>Our naval capability has to be matched to our assessment of the threat, as it has been in the past. As I have already made clear, the Soviet numbers are being reduced. However, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the enhanced capability and quality of the new submarines are high. Our changes are in much the same direction. We know the enhanced capability of our newer submarines. The reduction in submarine and frigate numbers relates to older boats. We shall seek to ensure that a balance is kept.<br/>
I ought to warn the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;he may not be aware of this&#x2014;that his hon. Friend the Member for Clackmannan (Mr. O'Neill), who is the shadow


spokesman on defence, used the phrase, "This is something that we shall have to pay very close attention to," when referring to a new study, published today, that proposes that no more tanks, frigates or attack submarines should be bought. Apparently, the European fighter aircraft will be cancelled, but Trident will be kept. I do not know whether that is the new Labour party policy, but it shows how confused it is getting.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend's statement will be admired well beyond the House. Within the NATO alliance, however, there are certain nations, and many more political parties, that wish more drastic cuts to be made in their national defence structures than that which my right hon. Friend suggests for the United Kingdom. Will he bear in mind the fact that the CFE negotiations in Vienna are not going as well as might have been expected? We hope that a treaty will be signed in December, but until it is signed, will my right hon. Friend make it absolutely clear in NATO that our defence structures must stay as strong as he has suggested and that we must not give way to demands for a peace dividend?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. We are trying to get the balance right. There have been massive changes. Whatever happens in Vienna, it is difficult to believe that east Germany, Hungary and Czechoslovakia will shortly return as fully paid-up membes of the Warsaw pact, as they were, say, two years ago. The position in the Soviet Union is much more uncertain; there are enormous tensions there. That is why I believe that the balance that I have put before the House today is the right one to strike.</p>

<p>Before the right hon. Gentleman's statement, Britain was spending 40 per cent. more of its gross domestic product on defence than West Germany, although West Germany is closer to the Soviet Union than we are.

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for joining in the debate. We know that he speaks for the majority of Labour party members. At the Labour party conference, the hon. Gentleman, the hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Ms. Ruddock) and Bruce Kent carried their motion by a 2:1 majority against the Opposition Front Bench, so he is entitled to speak, and he speaks with authority. He wants a &#x00A3;9 billion cut in the defence budget, so it is either the end of the Royal Navy, or the end of the Royal Air Force, or both.<br/>
My announcement will lead to a reduction in our armed forces from 310,000 to some 255,000. In Moscow, Chancellor Kohl announced a figure of 370,000 for the Bundeswehr in Germany. That is for a country that does not carry responsibilities that some other countries have to bear. I am not sure whether behind his question lies the proposal that we should shift to conscription. Anybody who examines the financial costs knows that one of the reasons why German costs could be lowered is that Germany does not have a volunteer army: it has conscription.</p>

<p>What was meant in the statement by
<q>a detailed scrutiny of research and development in keeping with changed requirements"?</q>
I acknowledge that it is a complex subject, that there are many contracts with people and that there is a great deal of talent in the research industries and establishments of this country, so could they not be put to use by British industry? Why is it that our industrial costs are so much greater than those of the Germans and the Japanese in terms of research expertise? Could not an imaginative plan be devised before September or October to help not only the universities but institutions such as the natural history museum, which is important for its research into global warming? We have obligations to skilled people. Can we honour them?</p>

<p>I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman, but the sentence means exactly what it says. It may lead in part in the direction in which he looks. We must examine the scale of research and development in defence and decide how much we can afford and what research and development is justified. If that means that we can release resources, they may be able to go to some of the institutions to which he referred.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend accept that both the Royal Marines and the Parachute Regiment will be delighted with the formation of the new division? I am sure that they will work in friendly rivalry within it.<br/>
In all that my right hon. Friend said there is the presumption that Germany will remain within the NATO alliance. However, he knows that there is a very outside chance that the socialists and the greens in Germany will win the election in December. Does he agree that, if that unfortunate circumstance were to come about, there might have to be yet another rethink?</p>

<p>I would have expected my hon. Friend's opening comments. I know of his great loyalty to and support for the Royal Marines and the Parachute Regiment. As for his question about Germany's membership of NATO, I have always believed that in the end the Soviet Union, whether reluctantly or otherwise, will be forced to accept the democratic decision of the people of East Germany and of a united Germany. It is important for the coherence of NATO that that remains the position.</p>

<p>The statement is a welcome start, but the Secretary of State cannot be accused of seizing opportunities or grasping nettles, let alone of beginning to convert the defence industries. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the Select Committee's report. May I therefore appeal to him to pay particular attention to the cautionary remarks of the Select


Committee about the danger of nuclear escalation through the deployment of tactical air-to-surface missiles? Would it not be a vicious irony if a conventional peace dividend were to clear the decks for a nuclear war?</p>

<p>I am not sure how the hon. Gentleman ended, because I lost the thread in the middle. Although he may think that my statement was modest, I assure him that its implications will be profound for both those in the armed forces and those who work in support industries. He should reflect on the implications of that. There will also be implications on the procurement side for some of the defence industries. I dare say that even in his surgery he may find people who will not believe that my statement was modest.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend confirm that recruiting will continue at a sufficient level to maintain an appropriate profile of age and experience in the armed forces and to ensure that the armed forces continue to provide a worthwhile and rewarding career? Does he share my surprise, indeed incredulity, that the Opposition spokesman should express anxiety about pay in the armed forces when his party held down pay as a matter of policy? As a result, our first act in government was to increase armed forces' pay by 32 per cent. to bring it back in line.</p>

<p>Whatever the Opposition Front-Bench spokesman may say, I shudder to think what the hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) would propose for armed forces' pay in view of his proposals for defence as a whole.<br/>
My hon. Friend's first point was an important one. It will be a challenge for us to ensure that the changes are made in a way that maintains the structure of the armed forces and a sensible age profile. I am under no illusions that that will be a real challenge.</p>

<p>Without casting aspersions on the morals of the Secretary of State, may I say that he sounds like a religious prostitute who said, "Oh God, make me pure, but not yet." <i>[Interruption.]</i> The House should not get so excited; I have waited all this time. We are slower than any other major nation to realise precisely what has happened in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe. The Secretary of State and the Government act as if the Russians were about to attack next Thursday. In all conscience, why do the Government not realise that this is not only a militaristic matter? The poor, the sick and the old are waiting for the peace dividend, and it is time that we did something about the money. What does the Secretary of State intend to do, other than being so militaristic or conveying that impression? Do we always need an enemy? Will the enemy continue to be the Soviet Union, or could it be that we are getting weapons together like Gaddafi and others and that the Arabs are the real enemy?</p>

That was carried through from a Cabinet to the defence chiefs in 1919 and it rolled forward to 1932. It resulted in soldiers having to exercise with football rattles instead of real ammunition and it left the country dangerously undefended. It is precisely that attitude&#x2014;</p>

The Secretary of State's statement tells me two things. First, it is a defeat for the Minister of State for Defence Procurement. Secondly. the Secretary of State has missed a wonderful opportunity. The people of Britain expect a peace dividend. The opportunities were there for the Secretary of State to cut defence by as much as 50 per cent. to allow the real problems, not the problems from the Soviet Union, to be addressed, including the education crisis in our schools. homelessness and poverty.

Will my right hon. Friend clarify one part of his statement? He said that he envisaged a 16-boat submarine fleet, three quarters of which will be nuclear-powered. Will he elaborate on the future shipbuilding programme and, in particular, say whether there is to be a follow-on to the Trafalgar class submarine, a nuclear-powered submarine, the seventh and last of which is currently being completed in Barrow?</p>

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement about my proposed financial settlement for Scottish local authorities for 1991&#x2013;92.<br/>
This is the first year in which the Scottish announcement is in respect of the total level of local authority resources that are determined by the Government&#x2014;that is, revenue support grant, specific grants and business rates. Collectively, those are known as aggregate external finance. In determining the settlement I have taken into account the views of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities expressed when I met it on 6 July regarding the spending levels that it thought were required for next year. I have also had full regard to the additional burdens facing local authorities and to the scope that undoubtedly exists in local government for improved efficiency.<br/>
I propose that aggregate external finance for 1991&#x2013;92 should be set at &#x00A3;4,338 million. That is &#x00A3;410 million higher than the corresponding figure for the current year. The House will realise that that is substantially more than the application of the normal formula rules to the comparable English settlement would produce. In addition, a further sum of &#x00A3;15 million will be provided for safety netting next year. This also will be the second year in which the safety net has been funded entirely by the Exchequer. So, overall, the settlement amounts to a total of &#x00A3;425 million. Proposals for the distribution of that amount to individual authorities will he announced in the usual way in the autumn.<br/>
In reaching this settlement, I have assumed that local authorities will contribute the sum of &#x00A3;10 million in the second year of the Government's policy of moving to a common rate poundage with England and thereby reduce the excess rate burden on Scottish business. I shall announce the total reduction that will be made in business rates next year at a later date, but the fact that the local authorities' contribution has already been taken into account in this settlement means that the reduction in non-domestic rate income will not require a reduction in aggregate Exchequer finance below the figure that I have just announced.<br/>
Overall, the settlement that I have announced today is a very fair one. Even if, as COSLA has forecast, authorities were to budget to increase their expenditure next year by as much as 9 per cent.,&#x2014;that is, close to the current rate of retail prices index inflation&#x2014;there should be no need for community charges to increase, on average, by more than that amount. And if, particularly with the expected fall in the rate of inflation, authorities increase spending by rather less than 9 per cent.&#x2014;as I would hope they would&#x2014;there should be scope for next year's charge levels to be lower in real terms. I hope that Scottish local authorities will also take into account their very high expenditure compared to local authorities in England and Wales. If local authorities in Scotland were to reduce their spending to levels closer to those elsewhere in Britain, there would be scope for large reductions in the community charge.<br/>
As hon. Members will know, I announced last Thursday a number of changes to the community charge. Those included major revisions to the transitional relief

scheme, the prescription of a boundary for the rating of bed-and-breakfast establishments and additional classes with restricted maximum multipliers for the standard community charge. The changes to the transitional relief scheme, which will take effect in Scotland from 1 April 1990, will increase significantly the value of relief received by individuals and the numbers entitled to receive relief. Our decision to set a boundary for the rating of bed-and-breakfast establishments has been widely welcomed, while the additional standard charge classes have been identified as a result of experience gained in operating the new powers, which took effect at the beginning of this year.<br/>
Those changes and the settlement that I have announced today represent good news for community charge payers in Scotland.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State accept that the adjustment to the transitional relief scheme to which he has just referred and which was announced earlier in the week is no substitute for the fundamental reform that the injustices of the poll tax demand? Can he confirm that the first year of transitional relief has been worth only &#x00A3;11 million to poll tax payers and not the &#x00A3;30 million that he promised when it was announced? Why is the scheme still to be fraudulently based on notional poll tax figures dreamt up by the Scottish Office rather than on what people actually pay? Will he confirm that barely one in six will qualify for help under the new scheme, even with the so-called improvements? Can he give an undertaking that this small cosmetic change will not be funded from money already allocated but not used in earlier years of the transitional relief scheme and that the Treasury will be providing additional help? Will he say what the transitional relief changes will be worth to the poll tax payer in a full year and will he give the cost of the total package that he has announced, on which there has been a remarkable silence so far?<br/>
On the aggregate external finance figure, the Secretary of State sounded remarkably smug. Does he accept that there are some question marks about the figures? Is it not the case that the Government's contribution to the cost of rebates has been cut by 2 per cent. and that the resultant shortfall of &#x00A3;14 million has, for the first time, been included in the aggregate external finance figure? If he takes the aggregate external finance total with the safety net contribution included, for the current and coming year, is not the picture rather different? The Government's contribution to the safety net is being halved from &#x00A3;30 million to &#x00A3;15 million. When that is taken into account, the increase in grant falls to a true figure of &#x00A3;395 million or 10 per cent. The Secretary of State might remember that the comparable figure announced by the Secretary of State in England a few days ago was 12&#x00B7;8 per cent.<br/>
The Secretary of State proclaims that this statement is good news for the poll tax payer. Does he accept that, on a standstill budget with no expansion of service, the average payment is likely to rise by about &#x00A3;30 a year? This package will not do.<br/>
Does the Secretary of State accept that the most bitter disappointment will be felt not in local government circles but in the community at large, where no one will see this minor tinkering with transitional relief as an answer to the desperate need for radical changes in the poll tax system? It will be condemned as inadequate to the point of insult.


Does the Secretary of State realise that, to restore his damaged reputation, he must tackle the unjust principles of the poll tax? He cannot get away with doling out a little conscience money in the vain hope of buying peace.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman's protestations about the community charge would sound more convincing if he was not wallowing in a sea of controversy as a result of his ill-judged proposals for a roof tax in Scotland. Scotland is still waiting to hear what the hon. Gentleman proposes to do with his misguided, ill-judged and ill-thought-out proposals.<br/>
Today, the hon. Gentleman started by asking about transitional relief. It is indeed the case that the cost of transitional relief in the first year is likely to be less than originally anticipated. The precise amount is not yet known because there are a still several applications to come forward. There is likely to be less cost because it has become clear that the cost of the transition to community charge from rates has imposed less of a burden in Scotland than south of the border, about which the hon. Gentleman should be pleased, not sad. The criteria are exactly the same throughout Britain&#x2014;fewer people meet those criteria in Scotland precisely because the change to the new system has produced less individual hardship.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also asked why it was a notional community charge payment that was taken into account. The reason is simple&#x2014;the purpose of the taxpayer paying transitional relief is to help those whose bills have gone up purely because of the change from a rating system to a community charge system. It is not intended to compensate for decisions taken by individual local authorities to increase their real spending and impose additional burdens on their charge payers, which is a matter for them to answer for to their charge payers.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman also referred to the percentage increase that he said that today's aggregate external finance statement represents, and suggested that it was 10 per cent. He is wrong&#x2014;the figure is actually 10&#x00B7;4 per cent. The hon. Gentleman said that the figure was nevertheless less than the percentage increase announced to the House last week by the Secretary of State for the Environment, which was 12&#x00B7;8 per cent. Of course it is less&#x2014;does the hon. Gentleman realise that, because of the huge level of Scottish local authority spending compared with that in England, to achieve an equal percentage to that announced by the Secretary of State for the Environment, I should have to provide for Scottish local authorities no less than &#x00A3;70 million more than COSLA even requested? I would have to give Scotland &#x00A3;165 million more than its normal formula share of United Kingdom expenditure&#x2014;a formula that is already generous to Scottish requirements.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman and Scottish local authorities cannot avoid the fact that their expenditure is no less than 32 per cent. higher for every adult in Scotland than comparable expenditure in England and 29 per cent. higher than comparable expenditure in Wales. As long as they insist on such excessively high expenditure, comparisons in terms of percentages are, frankly, meaningless. The settlement that I announced today represents not only the full formula consequentials of the announcement made by the Secretary of State for the Environment, but &#x00A3;70 million more than the formula would have provided for. I take no great comfort in that, because, if I were not providing that &#x00A3;70 million to help

support local authority current expenditure, those resources could be made available for health, and capital expenditure on housing, education or elsewhere. The hon. Gentleman should take that into account.</p>

<p>Am I correct in thinking that the sum announced by my right hon. and learned Friend is close to the sum bid for by local authorities in Scotland?

<p>My right hon. Friend is absolutely correct&#x2014;the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities asked for a settlement of &#x00A3;433 million, and the figure that I announced today is &#x00A3;410 million, which is so close to the figure that it was seeking that it can hardly make a great song and dance about the settlement that I announced.</p>

<p>I welcome the changes to the poll tax, particularly those relating to bed-and-breakfast accommodation, which will be helpful in my constituency. Does the Secretary of State agree that all those changes to the poll tax have increased administrators' problems and shown that the system is in a terrible mess? The changes have also increased problems for the elderly, particularly those who applied for transitional relief and found that they were ineligible, and others who did not apply. Is the Secretary of State aware that the elderly are suffering stress and distress as a result of the number of forms with which they have to cope, because the administrators cannot cope with all the changes?<br/>
In his statement, the Secretary of State referred to the high expenditure of local authorities in Scotland compared with those in England and Wales. Is it not time that he started to compare like with like, in population terms, and gave us a breakdown of the subsidies and public expenditure that go to regions of England, particularly the south-east, where there is such benefit from mortgage tax relief? Will the Secretary of State do some work during the summer, return for the new Session and tell us exactly what Scotland contributes to the Exchequer from its industries and the amount spent by the Departments, not the Scottish Office, on Scotland, compared with England? If he did that work, we might prevent much of the argument.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Lady for her welcome for the changes in relation to bed-and-breakfast accommodation, which will be important, particularly for the tourist industry in the rural regions of Scotland.<br/>
The hon. Lady is correct to say that pensioners&#x2014;and indeed others&#x2014;can be disturbed and upset by complicated and difficult forms, whether in this or any other sector of public administration. With regard to the community charge, I am entitled to add that single pensioners are among those who have benefited most from the change from the old rating system to the community charge. The hon. Lady should consider that.<br/>
The hon. Lady is right to say that the south-east of England may have considerable prosperity that is not enjoyed by some other districts. That is why I concentrated on a comparison between Scotland and Wales, which is a part of the United Kingdom with a similar economy and social profile. Expenditure per adult by local authorities in


Wales is &#x00A3;776; in Scotland it is &#x00A3;978&#x2014;I am curious to know the explanation for that. When I asked COSLA whether it had an explanation, I was met with blank incomprehension. It admitted that it had no explanation and said that it would try to find one. I hope that it does, because I am genuinely curious to know whether there is a good basis for a higher level of local authority spending. If there is a good reason, we all wish to know it, and if there is not, there may be scope for reduced spending and reduced tax bills.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State accept that the poll tax is, of itself, a local authority cost that need not exist if we had a proper system for funding local government, which he has refused to introduce? Instead of making fundamental changes to the poll tax, he continues to tinker with the system, with the attendant costs to local authorities in the administration of the tax.

Although at the end of the day it will be the local authority that determines the level of the local community charge on the basis of its proposed expenditure, in the light of the settlement announced today there is every prospect that authorities&#x2014;particularly good authorities such as Eastwood district council&#x2014;will be able to reduce their community charge in real terms.</p>

<p>As the right hon. and learned Gentleman mentioned ill-judged schemes of raising local government revenue, does he not realise that he is the number one expert when it comes to ill-judged schemes in Scotland, to the extent that the poll tax is one of the most hated taxes ever inflicted on the Scottish people? The fact that the Conservative party's rating in


Scotland is now equivalent to the vote received by the communists in the elections in East Germany is a political indictment of the right hon. and learned Gentleman.<br/>
As the settlement is based on the assumption that inflation will remain in the region of 9 per cent.&#x2014;it is actually higher than that now&#x2014;does the Secretary of State realise that, even in his own area, there is talk about free travel for the elderly, home helps and education services being cut?

The hon. Gentleman is aware that, even in the Scottish context, Lothian community charge payers, of whom I am one, have the dubious privilege of paying the highest community charge in Scotland.

If three months' experience of the poll tax was enough for a review in England, why was not three months enough for a review in Scotland? Is it not true that every change in the poll tax has been dictated by circumstances south of the border?

The hon. Gentleman must realise that there is nothing anti-Scottish in pointing out that Scottish local authorities levy taxes which must be paid by people in Scotland and which result in local authority expenditure being

dramatically higher than that in any other part of Britain. Why the hon.

The right hon. and learned Gentleman continually asks why local authority spending in Scotland is higher than in England and Wales. Why does he not take up the offer made to him by the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which remains on the table, to fund a proper inquiry to look into the reasons, not least of which is geography? That would give him the answers and he might be prepared to fight Scotland's corner for the level of services we need and not give us a reduced figure that is below the 12&#x00B7;8 per cent. that the Secretary of State for the Environment announced for England last week.</p>

before they can come up with a preliminary response to the question. Geography might be relevant if we were talking simply about Highland region, but why Glasgow, Dundee, Hamilton or Motherwell should require so much additional expenditure compared with similar industrial towns in Wales or England is a legitimate matter for public debate, given that it is the same United Kingdom taxpayer and Parliament who are funding that expenditure.</p>

Protests about that from the Labour party are crocodile tears, because the Labour party is committed, not to completing that process, but to reversing it. It has made it quite explicit that, when it has the power to do so, it will return to local authorities total freedom to determine the level of business rates. As such local discretion has led to Scottish business, industry and commerce paying higher business rates then those in other parts of the kingdom, it would be disastrous to the prospects for employment and inward investment in Scotland if the Labour party were to carry out the policy to which it is publicly committed.</p>

That would be a helpful clarification of his aspirations. Like other local authorities, Lothian has been provided with increased resources to take account of inflation over the years.

<p>I shall come to the hon. Gentleman's question in a moment, but first I shall deal with the distribution of resources between Lothian regional council and other local authorities. We discuss that matter with the convention as a whole. Clearly, the debate within Lothian about the level of its resources has identified various options put forward by the different political parties. It is not my business to suggest to a local authority a specific item of policy, but if it seeks taxpayers' money to help finance its spending, it is my business to point to the fact that the level of spending in Lothian is greater than that in other parts of Scotland as well as in other parts of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Last week, the Secretary of State for Health postponed implementation of the community care proposals on the grounds that local authorities were not ready, and that there was confusion over the poll tax in England and Wales. In Scotland, local authorities claim that they are ready and have put a great deal of effort into the work, and the Secretary of State claims that the poll tax is working well in Scotland. If the poll tax can come first to Scotland, why cannot community care come first to Scotland? By how much would the poll tax have had to go up in Scotland so as to implement community care? What calculations has he made?<br/>
The Secretary of State claims that the Scottish people were receiving an excessively high level of services&#x2014;not that there were excessively high levels of expenditure. In education, Scotland is better served than England and Wales&#x2014;the pupil-teacher ratio is better and there are better staying-on rates. Over 50 per cent. of local authority spending is on education. Would the Secretary of State like a cut in that sector?</p>

<p>We have said that we wish to see a phased introduction of community care. The hon.

On this matter, not unreasonably, I prefer the views of the commission to those of the <i>Scotsman</i> editorial.<br/>
Education expenditure is one of the issues that Scottish local authorities will wish to consider. They will also wish to consider whether higher expenditure on education compared with other parts of the kingdom gives a proportionate benefit to the youngsters who attended Scottish schools. We need to identify whether Scottish education is so demonstrably superior to that in England and Wales as to justify the higher expenditure. That is a legitimate matter of public debate, which the local authorities and no doubt others will wish to address.</p>

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, Under Standing Order, No 20, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,<br/>
<q>the decision taken today by PowerGen to close two of its power stations.'</q><br/>
One of those power stations, Elland, is in Calderdale, which is near Halifax. This makes the proposed closure a problem for my constituents, many of whom work at the plant. The closures are likely to trigger a round of cost cutting as PowerGen and its rival National Power seek to maximise profits. This is the first sign of what will happen to the industry if Hanson takes over.<br/>
PowerGen has given the age of the power stations and the excuse of non-commercial viability as reasons for closure. It does not appear to have considered other factors, such as the importance of the position of Elland, which is within 20 miles of the Yorkshire coalfield, and the effect on the local community of job losses.<br/>
The unions do not accept the reasons given for the closures, and neither do I. In the past few months, Calderdale has lost more than 1,000 jobs in manufacturing, and a further 130 jobs will go if Elland closes. Under the Central Electricity Generating Board, all power stations had excellent and expensive regular overhauls. There was a good level of investment and superb background of training. The CEGB was scrupulous in providing safe and efficient power.<br/>
The Labour party is committed to clean, safe power and is looking at the clean coal burn technology, which could be fitted to power stations such as Elland. Experts inform me that, if proper maintenance is carried out, there is little difference between old and new plants. While power stations under the CEGB were valid, efficient, safe public assets, we are witnessing now the wicked, unacceptable face of privatisation, the worshipping of profit and the scattering of our precious assets to land speculators.

<p>The hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Mahon) asks leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 20, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that she thinks should have urgent consideration, namely,
<q>the decision taken today by PowerGen to close two of its power stations.</q><br/>
I have listened with care to what the hon. Lady said about this matter, which affects her constituency. As she knows, the decision that I have to take is whether to give it precedence over the business set down for consideration today. I have to say that the matter that she has raised does not meet the criteria of the standing order. Therefore, I cannot submit her application to the House.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker, of which I have given you and the Secretary of State for Education and Science brief notice. It concerns the rights of Parliament in respect of its duties to protect the public purse and to ensure that there is no abuse in expenditure of money voted by Parliament.<br/>
You, Mr. Speaker, will be aware that a detailed code of conduct has been laid down by the Cabinet Office in relation to expenditure on Government publicity. For example, paragraph 2(c) of that code says that Government publicity
<q>should not be, or be liable to misinterpretation as being, party political.</q>
Paragraph 2(d) says that it should be produced
<q>in an economic and relevant way.</q>
Paragraph 5 says:
<q>it is no less crucial if government publicity is to remain acceptable within the conventions, that it avoids any doubt about its purpose".</q>
Paragraph 6 states:
<q>Image building, whether explicit or implied, whether by Government as a whole or by Ministers, is not acceptable.</q>
Paragraph 10 says:
<q>in each case, those responsible must be able</q>
for the purposes of the expenditure
<q>to give a persuasive reply to the following questions&#x2026;Is it necessary to have a publicity proposal which goes beyond what can be achieved in the normal way (eg Parliamentary announcement, Ministerial speech, regular publication)?</q>
Annex A says:
<q>distribution of unsolicited material should be carefully controlled.</q><br/>
It has come to my notice that the Secretary of State for Education and Science has had printed and distributed 76,500 copies of a little pink book which, according to the front, contains
<q>A summary of messages from recent speeches by the Rt. Hon. John MacGregor, OBE, MP, the Secretary of State for Education.</q>
The cost, which will have run into thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money, plainly breaches the code.<br/>
Moreover, it comes oddly from a Secretary of State who in February made a speech saying that he was taking measures to cut the burden of paperwork caused by the Education Reform Act 1988, and proclaimed that he had reduced the paperwork by 150,000 sheets, to allow 1,680,000 sheets of paper, paid for by the taxpayer, to be used in the production of such a booklet.<br/>
Given what I have read out from the code&#x2014;that image building is not acceptable and that publicity, where there is any doubt about its purpose, is not acceptable&#x2014;and given that the Secretary of State has already made those speeches and received a perfectly fair press in respect of them, there can be no doubt that the expenditure of thousands of pounds of public money clearly breaches the code. In addition, it smacks of the kind of the practice of some of the regimes to the east of Britain which have just collapsed.<br/>
I understand, Mr. Speaker, that your powers are limited, but Parliament has a duty to control such abuses of expenditure. As you are the guardian of Parliament's rights and duties, I put it to you that, before the House rises, the Secretary of State&#x2014;not the Under-Secretary of State&#x2014;must have an opportunity to come to the House to make a statement about how he came to waste thousands


of pounds of Government money on what is explicitly party-political propaganda when cuts in education and schools are occurring throughout the country. The Government have clearly breached the dividing line between legitimate Government information and party-political propaganda.</p>

They will be shocked and dismayed to receive thousands of copies of this party-political propaganda, for which they have not asked, at a time when playgroups and many other users of school buildings have been placed in great difficulty.

<p>I beg to move,<br/>
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require every holder of a justices' on-licence to install on the licensed premises concerned a device enabling persons who have consumed intoxicating liquor to take a breath test before leaving the premises; and for connected purposes.</q><br/>
No one will be more aware than you, Mr. Speaker, that much of the most basic controversy in the House is not about objective, but about method. Objectives are easily stated; implementation and method are altogether another matter, involving not only resources but generally that most difficult civil procedure, an adjustment of rights and obligations. The Bill is no exception. Its objective is quite clear and I wish to make it unequivocal. It is to reduce the incidence of dangerous driving associated with alcohol.<br/>
Both the motor vehicle and alcohol, taken separately, may be described as good servants and bad masters. Taken together, the combination can be lethal. We know that the current cost to society is some &#x00A3;400 million per annum and an unmeasurable quantity of tragedy, pain and grief. The current Government philosophy assumes that a total separation of the vehicle and its driver from alcohol is both desirable and possible. It is expressed in the exhortation, "Don't drink and drive", and that has been confirmed most recently in a letter to me from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. All concerned now accept that there is a gulf between the law and the advice given, and some advocate a stiffening of the law which, taken to its logical limit, would require a zero limit and random breath testing. My Bill is based on an analysis which seeks to demonstrate that the current philosophy is fundamentally flawed.<br/>
First, a zero limit implies that the motor vehicle can be used as an instrument for enforcing prohibition on the roads. No state has ever achieved that, and none ever will. It is an aspect of moral fundamentalism, and fundamentalism flies in the face of human nature. Secondly, it is based on an assumption that random breath testing, on a large enough scale and enforced with Cromwellian rigour, will eventually achieve the objective. That, too, flies in the face of experience. It is an emotional response to the problem, and that is something that we cannot afford.<br/>
Emotions are malleable; facts are very stubborn&#x2014;and the House will probably not welcome the facts that I shall now place before it. They are drawn largely from two official reports from the Transport and Road Research Laboratory, published within the past two years, on drinking and driving. They disclosed that, of some 2,500 people stopped and tested on a random basis in Warwickshire and Sussex recently, 52 per cent. had consumed alcohol within the last 12 hours; 17 per cent. had alcohol in their bloodstream; and that, of those, 3&#x00B7;6 per cent. were just under the limit and 1&#x00B7;3 per cent. over the limit. Some 33 per cent. of those sampled had visited a pub, club, hotel or restaurant.<br/>
What does that suggest? First, it suggests that the elimination of the 1&#x00B7;3 per cent. is an essential and legitimate target; secondly, that the reduction of the 3&#x00B7;6 per cent. is both desirable and practical; thirdly, that exhortation&#x2014;however brilliant or intense&#x2014;will not have much effect on the remaining 69 per cent. There is not


much point in endeavouring to push water uphill or alcohol back into the stills and vats of the distillers and brewers.<br/>
I come now to the crucial figure of 33 per cent. who had visited clubs, pubs, hotels and restaurants. There are about 135,000 licensed premises in the United Kingdom. Assuming that each receives a modest 50 visits per day by car, we have a target figure of more than 2,000 million visits per annum. If we apply the research laboratory's figures to that total, we must conclude that 344 million journeys will be made by drivers with alcohol in their bloodstreams, and that 2&#x00B7;6 million&#x2014;1&#x00B7;3 per cent.&#x2014;will be made by drivers unfit to drive.<br/>
That last figure is the real target of the Bill, bearing in mind two other research laboratory figures&#x2014;that 40 to 50 per cent. of those tested drove themselves home and that a significant number of those tested who thought that they had consumed fewer than three units had, in fact, consumed more. Fifteen were over the limit. That ignorance cannot be right or justified, and it is not in the public interest.<br/>
What can be done? I have already eliminated draconian enforcement, which leaves only one obvious alternative&#x2014;to assist members of the public to discover for themselves whether they are in categories 1, 2, 3 or 4. That requires the Government, first, to abandon the absurd notion that either laws or exhortation can achieve a total segregation of drinking and driving; secondly, to encourage drivers to test their alcohol levels as a matter of routine; and thirdly, to provide them with the means to do so.<br/>
My Bill would make the provision of such a facility an obligation on every licence-holder. I could not bring a machine into the Chamber, but I have a photograph with me which some hon. Members have already seen. The machine is accurate, reliable and easy to use. It has been successfully applied in Australia, California, Germany, Sweden and many other countries. It is estimated that 17,000 tests a day are carried out voluntarily by members of the public in Australia alone. The Royal Australian Navy has rated such machines an outstanding success, and some states are considering compulsory installation. It would cost &#x00A3;137 million, at a cost of &#x00A3;1,000 per machine, to install one in every pub in the United Kingdom&#x2014;but what is that against a saving of thousands of lives and a medical bill of several hundred million pounds?<br/>
One outstanding criticism is that such devices would encourage drivers to drink up to the limit. There is no evidence to support that view. A pilot study in Australia revealed that there was

<q>no evidence of changes in respondents' behaviour as a result of obtaining BAC levels.</q>
The inventor of the fuel cell&#x2014;I have two examples with me, of the sort used by the police and of those that can be applied to the ignition lock of a car&#x2014;concluded that
<q>their installation does not, contrary to some opinion, lead to brinkmanship but to responsible and knowledgeable drinking by an educated public.</q>
That is our target.<br/>
Drivers should never be driving when out of the yellow zone depicted in the diagram I am holding. It is the zone of virtually nil risk. The whole of the red zone is a legitimate target and it should enjoy all our attention. If we endeavour to eliminate the yellow zone, we shall be squandering massive resources to no avail. There are about 7,000 breathalysers in the United Kingdom, almost all in the hands of the police. My purpose is to put 135,000 in the hands of the public, and thereby both reduce dangerous and drunken driving and release the police for much more important tasks.<br/>
I shall conclude with an analogy. Aircraft flying into Heathrow have their height and operations controlled by two devices&#x2014;the radar at Heathrow and the altimeters in the aircraft. To suggest that the pilot should come in without altimeters and that the only people to know the aircraft's height should be the controllers at Heathrow, is obviously ridiculous. To suggest that vast numbers of the public who are likely to be driving with alcohol in their bloodstreams should have no method of discovering that fact until they are stopped by the police has always struck me as ridiculous. To put that right is the purpose of the Bill.</p>

<p>This group of new clauses and amendments relates to or arises from the Children Act 1989 and the need for new arrangements for family proceedings. The changes will allow the 1989 Act to deliver its aims and objectives more fully in all family proceedings.<br/>
Clause 6 enables the Lord Chancellor to make directions about the allocation of family proceedings in county courts. They will fall into two parts. First, directions will be made allocating particular types of proceedings to a particular level of judge. That will enable the Lord Chancellor to give a comprehensive direction


covering all family business and to ensure that particularly sensitive proceedings, such as care cases, are heard by judiciary of sufficient standing.<br/>
Secondly, directions will be made allocating a particular type of proceedings to a specific individual judge. The effect will be to create a nominated group of circuit and district judges who will specialise in specific types of family work in county courts. Their selection will be a matter for the Lord Chancellor on the advice, and with the concurrence, of the president of the family division.<br/>
New clause 7 extends the rule-making provisions in section 93 of the Children Act 1989 to cover all family proceedings. That will ensure that children and other family proceedings brought in the magistrates court under the Children Act 1989 will be subject to the same rules of procedure. New clause 20 amends section 28(1) of the Justices of the Peace Act 1979 to enable rules to be made under section 144 of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 to allow for the delegation of the duties and powers authorised to be done by a justices' clerk to somebody who is his deputy or assistant.<br/>
Amendment No. 59 concerns section 97 of the Children Act 1989, which provides for rules to enable a magistrates court to sit in private in certain proceedings under that legislation, and restricts the publication of material that might identify the child in question. Those measures supplement other statutory provisions concerning privacy, and amendment No. 59 clarifies that point. Amendment No. 53 makes it clear that when a young person is brought before a court for variation or discharge of a supervision order, the court will have the power, should it be necessary, to remand him to local authority accommodation if he is under the age of 18 or, in the sad cases where this is necessary, to a remand centre or prison if he has attained the age of 18.<br/>
Amendment No. 54 concerns regulations about staying access&#x2014;that is, access to a member of the family with whom the child or young person is staying, which needs to be properly planned. Amendment No. 54 provides for that. Amendment No. 60 removes the 90-day time limit for complying with directions made under a supervision order, and amendment No. 61 will ensure that no child in care will remain a ward of court. Amendment No. 168 will ensure that the power to make rules of court contained in section 93 will be available also to the relevant rule-making authorities in Northern Ireland. The remaining amendments make the necessary consequential amendments, repeals and minor technical changes, and correct certain inconsistencies.<br/>
I commend the amendments, which will enable changes to be made to the Children Act 1989 necessary to allow that very valuable legislation to deliver its aims in a full and proper way.</p>

<p>I welcome the Solicitor-General's explanation, but we are dealing with a host of new clauses and amendments which would have been better introduced in Committee, when there would have been an opportunity for organisations and individuals to consider and comment on a major initiative. That would have been the right course, rather than introducing these amendments on Report.<br/>
Having said that, I welcome the proposed changes, and hope that we may eventually see the emergence of a complete family court, bringing together all the jurisdictions. The Bill is an important step in that direction. I should like to know how many different tiers of courts will still be dealing with children's work and what changes are envisaged in substantive law. Judging from the new clauses and amendments, I suspect that no changes are anticipated.<br/>
It is some years since I ventured into a juvenile court or into the family division, but I know from magistrates close to me that they look forward to the new challenges in family work. Shall we still have wardship dealt with in the High Court, custody in the equivalent of the divorce courts, care in the magistrates courts, and so on? Will the old divisions remain, or will a change emanate from the proposals that we have had only a short time to study?<br/>
I welcome the proposals for specified judges and for "specified descriptions" of judges&#x2014;whatever that expression may mean. I accept the need for specialisation. I am told that nothing is more impressive than the solicitors panel which appears in care cases before London juvenile courts. The expertise and the care that it exhibits is, I am told, impressive. It follows that the Lord Chancellor is right to propose a degree of specialisation, and the considerable training and familiarity gained from dealing with like cases on a regular basis will be of assistance.<br/>
How are the new procedures to be monitored once they have been implemented? We all recognise and regard as important the independence of the judiciary, but we know also that some are better than others. Where people no longer wish to be specified or are quite frankly, not up to the task of being specified, it is important that they should be able without difficulty to be transferred to other tasks. There is plenty of demand in the realm of general Crown court work, so none of them would be unemployed.<br/>
It is important not to specify or allocate responsibilities to someone who, over a period of time, finds that he is perhaps not attuned to the needs and changes. I hope that we can have an assurance that the president of the family division will keep a most watchful eye on those who have been chosen to ensure that standards are not only maintained, but improved.<br/>
In a half sentence before he finished his opening remarks, the Solicitor-General referred to the reliance on local authorities with regard to care and accommodation facilities. My impression is that that is rather patchy in some areas and perhaps one or two local authorities are not so co-operative as they might be.<br/>
That co-operation must exist in the provision of facilities and we must bear in mind that local authorities have very few financial resources these days. It must also exist in the provision of reports. I have heard complaints from magistrates that local authorities do not always produce the required reports and that they are not always particularly co-operative. We should be told about that because it is very important. If any persuasion is necessary, I am sure that in the face of argument, those who may not be so good as the others will do what they can to improve the necessary co-operation between the judiciary and local authorities.</p>

<p>I wish to raise one point about the Children Act 1989. It has been brought to my attention by the Justices' Clerks Society that there is a proposal that legal aid certificates for the


child and the parents should be granted by the Legal Aid Board. The board's delivery rate is in the region of up to 20 weeks for 100 per cent. delivery. In such cases it is absolutely essential that legal aid is granted immediately.<br/>
The justices' clerks know the facts of the matter and can very often grant legal aid overnight or during the course of the night. They can assess the needs and representation in those delicate cases in which speed is often essential and in which the aid should be granted at the first available opportunity.<br/>
To leave it to the Legal Aid Board with its cumbersome processing procedures&#x2014;I do not say that unkindly&#x2014;would, I believe, be a considerable mistake. I hope that the Solicitor-General will take on board that one small point, which could mean a terrific amount to the children and parents involved. Perhaps he can suggest to the Lord Chancellor that that proposal is not wise.</p>

<p>I echo the concern voiced by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) about this procedure today. We now face complicated new clauses which have been introduced at the last minute and without adequate briefing for hon. Members. It would have been convenient and a courtesy if the Government had provided some notes on clauses to allow for a better informed debate.<br/>
Not only hon. Members are being neglected in that way. The interest groups affected by the changes, in many cases, learned of them only at the last minute. Some of those groups learned about the changes only last Friday. That is far too late to allow a proper process of consultation. This procedure is a preparation for inadequate legislation. I am not sure whether Ministers want to give the House of Lords a useful job and something to do, but having considered the Bill initially, further changes will have to be made in the House of Lords to remedy the deficiencies caused by the last-minute rush of clauses before us today.<br/>
There is such enormous legal power on the Government Front Bench that it is virtually an all-knight party. However, it is not good enough for the best legal brains to be vamping the Bill at the last minute in this fashion. The president of the National Union of Mineworkers was invited to go away and run a fish and chip shop. On the evidence of this Bill, the best legal brains could not run a fish and chip shop. Cobbling things together in this way is just not good enough. Indeed, my most devastating criticism is that I could have done it better myself. That should certainly bring them to their knees.<br/>
I welcome the Government's proposals as a first step along a road which we need to take and along which we need to progress far more quickly than the measures propose. However, the road leads towards a separate self-contained structure of family courts to deal with those matters as a specialised area. That proposal is long overdue in this country and we delayed far too long in developing such a structure. The faster the progress we can make, the better. That structure will need a specially trained and selected hierachy of judges to deal with family matters. People with sensitivity and with experience and training in that area are required and any step along that road is welcome.<br/>
I have long been an advocate of a Manpower Services Commission or Training Commission scheme for judges.

The training of judges in this country is totally inadequate in view of the weight of responsibility that falls on them. Training is to be provided in family matters. Such training is long overdue in many areas.<br/>
I understand that, in France, judges who deal with family matters are required to undergo a course of psychotherapy so as to understand their own prejudices, what motivates them and their own feelings, hang-ups, inhibitions and problems about the family&#x2014;in short, so that they can know themselves. I do not know what results would be produced if some of the judges that I have seen around this country were required to undergo psychotherapy in that way, but if they at least knew themselves and the prejudices that motivated them, that would be extremely useful.</p>

<p>At the beginning of our proceedings, it is right that I should yet again declare my interest in the matter. When the proceedings on the Bill began, I was a solicitor.

<p>I wonder whether my hon. Friend would like to sink with me.<br/>
The history of the discussions and debates about family courts and related matters is not good. On Report on the Children Act 1989, when the Solicitor-General was present and we were discussing family courts, my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) entered the Chamber and announced the resignation of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Unfortunately, following that, discussions on the Children Bill were curtailed. I am not sure whether that will happen again with quite the same drama today.<br/>
New clauses 6 and 7 raise important points, which were raised during the passage of the Children Act and in the Standing Committee on this Bill. The clauses proceed from a press release&#x2014;not a statement&#x2014;by the Lord Chancellor on 9 July this year in which he referred to the creation of family hearing centres.<br/>
I share the disappointment voiced by my hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell). Having started on the road to family courts in the Lord Chancellor's Second Reading speech in December 1988, having been promised a family court at some stage and having been told that the Children Bill was the family court in all but name as it dealt with the judicial matters, it is disappointing that the Solicitor-General has decided not to announce the formal establishment of a family court. There is great support by hon. Members on both sides of the House for the creation of a family court, for the reasons that have been outlined by hon. Members in debates on family matters during the proceedings on the Children Bill and on Second Reading and in the Standing Committee stage of this Bill.<br/>
The case for a family court is unanswerable. How disappointing it is that the Solicitor-General, having promised in the Children Bill that he would set up a rolling programme to establish a family court, has given us something rather less than that&#x2014;that is, family proceedings panels and family hearing centres. I hope that the Solicitor-General will confirm that next week he will


announce the venues for those family hearing centres. If that is the case, it would have been much more appropriate for him to make that announcement today, as it would have given us the opportunity to discuss those important matters.<br/>
I agree with what has been said about consultation. What a different approach has been taken on the Bill from that taken by the right hon. and learned Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor), now the Minister for the Arts, during the passage of the Children Bill, which was heralded as a consensus Bill, when the right hon. and learned Gentleman adjourned the Committee and allowed discussions between Opposition Members and officials of his Department when any new or different proposal was put forward, especially one of such complexity.<br/>
6.30 pm<br/>
Despite the army of civil servants present today, no attempt has been made by the Lord Chancellor's office or his Department to contact members of the Committee to discuss an issue of deep concern to those of us involved in family rights and the Family Court Campaign. There have been ample opportunities to do that. Pledges have been made about the need to carry the Committee with the Government, but none of those pledges has been realised.<br/>
On 11 July 1990, Baroness Faithfull, chairperson of the Family Court Campaign, issued a statement in which she commented quite favourably on the Lord Chancellor's press release, saying:
<q>Now is the time to move that step forward to ensure that we have a family court.</q>
She ended her statement with the following words:
<q>It is vital to maintain the momentum of the Lord Chancellor's rolling programme of family court reform by a firm public commitment to the next stages in the process. It is hoped that under the new arrangements there will be reasonable access for families to the courts.</q>
She went on to comment on the Children Act.<br/>
I hesitate, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bolsover has just entered the Chamber. I do not know whether he is bringing us news of a resignation as he did on a previous occasion, or whether he intends to take part in a debate on family courts. Today, I received a letter from the Solicitor-General about a new body called the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board, which I know he will deal with when we discuss amendment No. 26, which talks about the need to provide almost &#x00A3;1 million of Government money for the new board. If he is prepared to provide &#x00A3;1 million for a board dealing with licensed conveyancers, surely he can provide the necessary resources for fully fledged, all-singing, all-dancing family courts&#x2014;to use the words of the Solicitor-General when we discussed the matter on Report of the Children Bill. Money cannot be the problem, so it must be the Government's commitment to enable that to happen.<br/>
In my constituency an overworked and understaffed juvenile court deals with family matters. Only one court in Leicester deals with such cases. The waiting room has to accommodate more than 140 people. No refreshments are available for the advocates, the parents or the children. People have to wait for a long time for their cases to be heard, as there is no fixed appointments system. The conditions are intolerable. On hot days such as today, people have to submit to the pressures of the weather. Their cases are dealt with in the same building that houses young people who may have been found guilty of criminal offences. It is not good enough for the Government to say

that there is no outside pressure. If they look at juvenile courts throughout the country, they will find that the service is inadequate.<br/>
I should like to know which groups the Solicitor-General, the Attorney-General or the Lord Chancellor has consulted about the proposals. What are the Solicitor-General's plans for monitoring the proposals? Are there any precedents for what he suggests in any other areas of law? Will he give me a straight answer to a straight question? When will we reach the end of the rolling programme? When will he or the Attorney-General come to the Dispatch Box and say, "We have tried out various experiments; we have made progress and time has moved on. We have had consultations with the Department of Health and now is the time for us to have fully fledged family courts with trained lawyers and judges." When will the Government make that commitment? Instead of having a rolling programme with no timetable and no end, the Solicitor-General should make a specific pledge that at a fixed time and date family courts will be introduced into our judicial system.</p>

<p>I am most grateful for the welcome of the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) for the legislative provisions. As he said, he did not take part in the discussions on the Children Act, but he and the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) will know that the major initiative which relates to the group of amendments was the Children Act 1989. The amendments use the Bill as a legislative vehicle to build upon that major initiative.<br/>
Several hon. Gentlemen, including the hon. Member for Leicester, East, asked how the provisions fit into the framework of family courts, about the monitoring of the proposals and about training. The hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham) asked a detailed and pertinent question about the granting of legal aid certificates. I shall seek to answer those points. I emphasise to the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) that this is not the first step; we are building upon an important major first initiative, the Children Act.<br/>
The hon. Member for Leicester, East has just become a barrister, and he will be concentrating upon clarity of expression. As the Lord Chancellor has made clear, in order to have a successful family court, whether it deals with children or wider family law, it is necessary first to create and establish a proper body of law which applies to those matters. That is exactly what we have done in the Children Act, which has been widely recognised on all sides to be a major initiative. Having created a body of law, we can create the specialised courts structure to administer it. That is what we are in the process of doing, and the amendments assist us in that process.<br/>
The proposals will be put into effect in accordance with the framework which the amendments help to construct. To that extent, they are a significant first step towards the creation of the family courts. The next step must be to establish a coherent body of family law, drawing together the different aspects, and then to create the court structure&#x2014;I suspect in a way similar to what we are doing for children in relation to the wider body of family law. Then the programme to which I refer will have rolled on and we shall not simply have been making pledges for the future, with which we have been all too familiar in politics in the past. We have seen a certain amount of it from the Labour


party in the recent past. We shall be dealing not with pledges for the future, whether or not they have been costed, but with the constructive creation of a real system.</p>

<p>I will not answer the hon. Gentleman. I have told him that it is a rolling programme, and it will roll forward. He should welcome the advance and recognise how important it is.<br/>
The programme will be monitored and staffed at every level by a specially selected and trained judiciary. The monitoring will be undertaken by the Lord Chancellor and the president of the family division, who will have the benefit of a central advisory committee drawn from experts in the wide number of disciplines which come together in this aspect of children law. The committee will be judicially chaired and will assist in monitoring. There will be training at every level.<br/>
The Legal Aid Board will set up a special structure to ensure that legal aid certificates can be dealt with swiftly. Meantime, I take note of the point made by the hon. Member for St. Helens, South.

<p>These new clauses and amendments give the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board the powers it needs to exercise proper administration and control over authorised conveyancing practitioners, to preserve assets pending investigation and to provide for an appeal system against its decision, should an aggrieved party wish to appeal.<br/>
New clause 8 allows the board to serve a notice on an authorised practitioner requiring him to provide the board with such documents or information as it thinks reasonably necessary in connection with the discharge of any of its functions. New clause 9 allows the board to appoint one of more competent persons to investigate the affairs of the authorised practitioner. New clause 10 creates a general prohibition against disclosure of information received by the board, its staff or an investigator appointed by it in the exercise of their functions under the Bill without the consent of the person from whom the information was obtained or, if they are different, the person to whom it relates. New clause 11 deals with exceptions from restriction on disclosure.<br/>
6.45 pm<br/>
Amendments Nos. 65, 66, 69 and 70 to schedule 16 are consequential amendments to the Fair Trading Act 1973, the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1976, the Estate Agents Act 1979 and the Competition Act 1980 to allow other regulators to pass information to the board without committing offences under their disclosure regime.<br/>
Taken together, the four new clauses and five amendments complement new clauses 12 and 13, which deal with the board's intervention powers. Together, they should provide the board with all the powers it needs to take action to protect the interests of clients and to obtain the evidence necessary to pursue disciplinary proceedings against authorised practitioners. They represent the result of the Lord Chancellor's undertaking during the Lords Report stage, which was conferred by my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General in our Committee stage, to consider further what powers of intervention and investigation the board might need. The Law Society sought to have similar amendments moved in the Lords Committee stage. Its amendments were modelled on its own papers.<br/>
In presenting these results of the further consideration which the Committee stage afforded us, I commend the new clauses to the House.</p>

<p>I have no wish to detain the House, which is faced with a galaxy of amendments and new clauses, or to intrude too much into these proceedings. However, Report stage allows Back-Bench Members to raise concerns. I shall try to be as brief as possible.<br/>
I welcome the new clauses, as do many organisations, such as the Law Society, which have been considering extending the availability of conveyancing by authorised practitioners. We all recognise that the Building Societies Act 1986 paved the way for this provision. We are anxious to ensure that there should not be any conflict of interests. I should be grateful if my right hon. and learned Friend could confirm that there will be further consultation on clause 38, which allows the Lord Chancellor to make provision for regulations, after the Bill receives Royal Assent.<br/>
One issue causes me great concern. It relates to the potential conflict, not just of interest, but within the role of authorised practitioners who are, in effect, acting as agents for large financial institutions and building societies. It is impossible to regard the issue separately from the general supervision of the financial services industry and the Financial Services Act 1986.<br/>
Building societies, insurance companies and banks are generally tied agents of life assurance companies. Polarisation rules mean that, as tied agents, their duty and interest is to the life assurance company, but as conveyancers their interest and duty must be to the client. I must declare an interest as an insurance broker and representative of one of the insurance broking institutions. Independent financial advisers have a duty to the client, not just to the life office. Will my right hon. and learned Friend have particular regard to that? Over the next year


or so, we are likely to see further development of the financial services industry regulatory regime. Indeed, the first debate after the recess will be on precisely that subject.<br/>
I am concerned that there should be a proper fiduciary relationship, so that each part of any arrangement can be properly costed. The public should have the maximum possible safeguards. The House and the country will have noted that a large insurance company recently bought up 500 estate agency practices and has now effectively withdrawn from that market. A similar event would be a disaster for rural solicitors' practices and for the public whom they serve. There is a risk of small practices closing down because of the loss of conveyancing business only for the institutions to decide that conveyancing is less profitable than they thought. These are important considerations, as these firms would be lost.<br/>
I hope that my comments are helpful. Perhaps my right hon. and learned Friend will say that those points have been taken on board.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) for his welcome and to my hon. Friend the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway) for his contribution. I understand the points that my hon. Friend makes on behalf of independent financial advisers, with whose position I have the greatest sympathy, who are rightly watching the regime that we are creating for authorised conveyancing practitioners to ensure that proper safeguards are provided for clients and for the public as a whole.<br/>
The first point that my hon. Friend raised was on consultation. He will have noticed that in the Bill consultation is required statutorily on many points. My right hon. and noble Friend is anxious to consult. Indeed, I have had the opportunity of taking part in the consultation processes with interested parties, including independent financial advisers, to see that the structure that we create on the statutory framework is practical and achieves the objectives and the safeguards that we have set out to achieve, which we are debating today and which we debated in some depth in Committee in relation to this new clause and new clause 88.<br/>
My hon. Friend will know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and his predecessors have consulted on some interesting possible developments in the financial services framework. They should tie in with what we are discussing today. I hope that those assurances are of assistance to my hon. Friend. I commend the new clause to the House.</p>

<p>The amendments, although necessarily bulky&#x2014;I apologise to the House that they are bulky, but they will be recognised by members of the Committee as following our previous discussions&#x2014;are straightforward in their main purpose, which is to extend the powers of the Council for Licensed Conveyancers so that it will have the opportunity to apply, under the framework in part II of the Bill, for approval to license conveyancers to undertake probate work, and authorisation to grant them rights of audience and rights to conduct litigation.<br/>
The council is a statutory body, established under the Administration of Justice Act 1985 to grant licences and regulate practitioners solely for the provision of conveyancing services. It therefore has no power to license its members to do other work.<br/>
Under clause 27 of the Bill, however, professional or other bodies will be able to apply for authorisation to grant their members rights of audience and rights to conduct litigation. Under clause 46, bodies may be approved by the Lord Chancellor to grant their members

exemptions from the provisions of section 23(1) of the Solicitors Act 1974, thus enabling them to undertake probate work.<br/>
The Council for Licensed Conveyancers has already shown its interest in seeking such authorisation and approval. Furthermore, in the Green and White Papers that preceded the Bill, the Government made it clear that they intended that licensed conveyancers should be able to offer probate services.<br/>
It is therefore necessary to amend the Administration of Justice Act 1985 to enable the council to pursue applications for authorisation or approval under those provisions, and the new clause 14 and first part of the new schedule provide for that.<br/>
The procedures required in the event of a successful application are set out in detail to be consistent with the framing of the original legislation. The amendments will not in themselves, however&#x2014;this should be understood&#x2014;give the council the power to grant any further rights or exemptions. They will simply place it on the same footing as other bodies able to seek authorisation in due course.<br/>
Part II of the schedule extends the council's more detailed powers to enable it to operate and to regulate its members more efficiently and effectively, and to improve the position of the consumer client. They include increased powers to delegate functions to committees of the council, and to intervene in the practice of a licensed conveyancer; revised powers to deal with cases in which the professional services provided are inadequate, including a new power to award compensation of up to &#x00A3;1,000 in such cases and adopt for licensed conveyancers the powers in relation to solicitors that were added to the Bill in Committee in this House; and finally, additional powers to require licensed conveyancers to account for deposit interest on money held for clients, and powers to endorse or attach conditions to licences.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 72, 78, 80 and 81 concern necessary minor consequential and transitional changes, and repeals.<br/>
The amendments will enable the new profession of licensed conveyancers to seek to develop other new areas of business in the provision of legal services, to the benefit, we hope, of the profession and the consumer, and to make further changes to increase consumer protection.</p>

<p>I thank the Solicitor-General for his comments. Did the Council of Licensed Conveyancers ask for those powers to obtain rights of audience, did it ask solely in relation to probate work, or did it ask at all? Perhaps the Solicitor-General can confirm that only 200 licensed conveyancers are actually in private practice, At the end of 1993, the Government will have provided &#x00A3;466,000 in subsidy to the licensed conveyancers' body. Is that expenditure to continue? Is it consistent with the Government's rather market-orientated, vigorous financial approach to those matters?<br/>
I welcome the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) to the Government Front Bench. It is always good to see Lambeth councillors in the House. One is the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It is nice to see another on the Government Front Bench. It is only a pity that hon. Members cannot hear him talk.</p>

<p>One need not go through the rather enormous declarations of interest that all those who served on the Standing Committee went through in their traverses between one side of the legal


profession and the other. Although I do not intend to do that, it will shorten matters if I inform the House&#x2014;most hon. Members are aware of this&#x2014;that I shall be speaking on behalf of the Law Society, as I did in Committee. Although my personal thoughts may penetrate my arguments, it will be much easier if everyone presumes, unless I say otherwise, that the views that I am giving are those of the Law Society.<br/>
The hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) has more or less made the points that I wanted to make. However, may I underline one of them, which I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will deal with in his answer. The Law Society's solicitors' branch believes that this is an entirely proper new clause. The creation of licensed conveyancers to compete with solicitors is fair enough, but if they continued to receive public subsidy, that would not be totally satisfactory; indeed, it would be unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>I rise only to sound a note of dissent from the tendency to praise with faint damns. I welcome the new clause and the expenditure.

Our creation needs the encouragement and support that he is getting. On that basis, I welcome the new clause.</p>

<p>I do not know whether I am talking out of turn. I was not a member of the Committee that considered the Bill and I saw the papers only about an hour ago. Therefore, the House will forgive me if I am somewhat confused about the matter.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend referred to the use of authorised conveyancers in probate cases. This may therefore be an opportune moment to ask him a question about that. Little was said about probate practice when the Bill was discussed in Committee. If authorised conveyancers are to be allowed to do probate work, will provision be made to ensure that reasonable charges are set by them for the work that they undertake? Solicitors' costs are taxed. Solicitors charge far less than banks for their probate services. The general public will not be given the protection that they ought to have unless the Bill contains such a provision. I have been unable to spot one. Is a complaints procedure provided for in the Bill, to which the general public will have access, in respect of the probate services that the new profession will be allowed to provide?</p>

<p>This new profession will supplement the great solicitors' profession which has existed for hundreds of years. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) has left the Chamber. To some extent, he can claim to be the midwife of the new profession, and to some extent the midwife's fees have been paid in the form of the &#x00A3;466,000 that was mentioned. I take the figure from the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser). I do not have it in front of me. However, that will be pump-priming money to enable this professional body to get off the ground.<br/>
There are about 700 licensed conveyancers. The hon. Member for Norwood was right when he said that only about 200 of them are in independent private practice. Most of the others are employed by solicitors. A good many of them are legal executives, and some of them are quite distinguished. That is a sound basis for a new profession.<br/>
I shall seek to find the answer to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Sir H. Rossi) about the taxation of costs. The Bill will create a framework within which the Council for Licensed Conveyancers will be able to provide protection to the public of the kind that the Law Society seeks to provide for the public in relation to solicitors. I do not suggest that that protection is as sophisticated and advanced as that which has been developed by the Law Society over a long period. That, however, is the objective, and that is why the Government have primed the pump.</p>

<p>There is both a similarity and a distinction. We do not intend to seek to get back the pump-priming money. That is where there is a distinction, compared with the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board. The board figure is &#x00A3;900,000. That is the figure that the hon. Gentleman and I discussed in Committee. I intended to write to him, and I apologise for the fact that I did so only today, with more details of the make-up of that sum. It is intended that some of the start-up money for the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board should be recouped.

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This new clause extends the concept of legal professional privilege so as to apply to the new classes of legal practitioner established by the Bill&#x2014;that is to say, authorised advocates, authorised litigators, authorised practitioners and probate practitioners.<br/>
Legal professional privilege is based on the practice, developed in the Court of Chancery in the first instance, which ensures&#x2014;this is a sensible and thoroughly up-to-date purpose&#x2014;that communications made to and from a legal adviser for the purpose of obtaining and providing legal advice and assistance are protected from disclosure in the course of any subsequent legal proceedings. The reason is not undue love of secrecy; the protection exists to enable the client to confide fully in his adviser without fear of disclosure. That is valuable in the interests of the administration of justice.<br/>
Clearly, a person seeking advice from one of the new classes of legal practitioner being created by the Bill should be in no worse position, as regards the confidentiality of his communications to and from the practitioner, than if he were seeking advice from an established legal practitioner.<br/>
The new clause therefore ensures that communications to or from one of the new legal practitioners will enjoy legal professional privilege, just as if the practitioner acting for the client had been a solicitor.</p>

In Committee the Government gave an assurance that an amendment to cover Scotland would be tabled on Report.

A separate clause is required to cover Scotland, because there are differences between the ways in which barristers in England and Wales practise and the way in which advocates in Scotland practise. The most relevant


difference for these purposes is that advocates do not practise from chambers in the way that barristers do. Therefore, references to tenancies, which occur in clause 53, would not have any meaning. I have said enough about this thoroughly worthwhile provision.</p>

<p>The package of amendments of which new clause 19 forms part was foreshadowed in another place and in Committee. It establishes in primary legislation an identical power and identical test for its exercise in each court whereby legal and other representatives may be ordered to compensate others for costs that result from the representatives' own fault. In doing so, the amendments clear up a confusion in the law about the applicable test in such cases in the Supreme Court. After debates in another place, and with the agreement of the Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls, the Government are in no doubt that the applicable test should be the one of simple negligence and that the test needs to be clearly established in primary legislation. In plain terms, justice surely demands that all the courts have power to shift the loss from an innocent party on to the representative whose negligence has caused it.<br/>
I hope that amendment No. 14 will be taken with the new clause or, if not, immediately afterwards. I trust that it is relevant for me to speak to it now.<br/>

<p>Amendment No. 37 brings clause 93 into line for the magistrates civil jurisdiction. New clause 19 does the same for criminal proceedings in the Crown court and magistrates courts by means of a new section in the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. Amendments Nos. 13, 15, 38 and 40 apply the power to representatives who are not lawyers. Amendment No. 42 and new clause 19(2) provide the important new safeguard of an appeal from the magistrates to the Crown court. Amendments Nos. 39, 41 and 183 are purely consequential.<br/>
I should make clear the relationship between the amendments and the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Whenever costs are incurred through the fault of a representative, the power which is the subject of the amendments will be available. It will not be affected in any way by the inherent disciplinary power of the Supreme Court. Conversely, the latter remains intact.</p>

The representative, whether for the prosecution or the defence, must act in accordance with the instructions of the plaintiff or defendant. There comes a point when those instructions can create the problems that give rise to the impression of either negligence or incompetence. However, the representative is not in a position to tell the court the true reasons for his or her actions, simply because to do so would be a breach of privilege.</p>

<p>One trusts that a course of action followed by an advocate is always at least consistent


with, if not the result of, instructions properly given. But negligence is a breach of the duty to take reasonable care. Therefore. all the circumstances must be taken into account. If the complaint is the result of the proper application of an advocate's discretion to instructions properly given to him, that will be a complete defence. The inherent jurisdiction of the court remains intact and the negligence test applicable under these proposals in no way affects any stricter test applying under the inherent jurisdiction.</p>

<p>I want to concentrate on the amendments. There is no disagreement about the principle in the new clause. However, practitioners are entitled to some protection against these provisions, particularly since it is not always as easy as the Attorney-General said for a representative to explain openly exactly what his client has said. For instance, if may be alleged against a representative that the time of the court has been negligently wasted because a case was fixed as a plea of guilty and, at the last moment, it was changed to a plea of not guilty. However, that may have been the result of instructions given by the client. It may be difficult to advance arguments about the relationship between a solicitor or barrister and his client in explaining why the costs have been thrown away. They may have to say to the court, "He told me for 12 months that he was guilty and at the last moment he said that he was not guilty." That may be embarrassing for the person involved and it would not be easy for the representative to put forward that argument.<br/>
What is more, despite what the Attorney-General said, there is no suggestion that, if the Crown prosecution service is negligent, it should pay the costs of the other parties. What he is suggesting in those circumstances would not lead to equality between prosecution and defence. In those cases, the costs may be paid out of public funds and not personally by the Crown prosecution service.<br/>
The amendments seek to ensure that costs will be awarded against a representative only if they have been negligent or seriously neglected their duty to the court. Also, before any order is made, a legal representative must be given the opportunity to make representations against it so that such matters will not be dealt with in their absence. We advocate that, if such an order is made, there should be a right of appeal against it and that if an appeal is successful, the costs of conducting it ought to be given to the advocate who was wrongly stigmatised by the order.<br/>
There was a case last year which was written up in some detail this month in the London criminal practitioners magazine. It involved five cases of solicitors against whom costs were ordered under the existing inherent jurisdiction. When the matter went to the Court of Appeal, it was clear that the fault did not lie with those against whom the orders for costs were made. The appeal had to be financed by the Law Society and, as far as I know, the costs were not paid by the Crown prosecution service, out of public funds or, as might be argued under the circumstances, because he seems to be at the heart of the matter, by the judge.<br/>
Such matters should not be undertaken lightly. If such orders can be made against them, legal representatives should be adequately protected in the way we have suggested in our amendments.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser). You will have noticed, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that my name accompanies the illustrious names of the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) and the hon. Member for Norwood on the amendments. I ask the Government to consider the amendments sympathetically. Even if they are not prepared today to think again, they might bear in mind the fact that another place has yet to consider amendments from this House.<br/>
As hon. Members know, the basic position of inherent jurisdiction now means that cost orders can be made in circumstances in which there is a serious dereliction of duty to the court. The duty to the court is paramount.<br/>
I wish to echo the words of various hon. Members who have mentioned the amount, and often the complexity, of the new clauses and amendments that are still arriving at this late stage. The original intention of the Bill many moons ago was to extend the existing powers to the magistrates court. That was acceptable to the profession. Now, at this late stage, we have a considerable and sudden increase in powers.<br/>
My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General said that after consideration it was decided that the overall test should be straight negligence. However, orders can now be made against a legal representative for<br/>
<q>any improper, unreasonable or negligent act or omission".</q><br/>
The making of such orders virtually needs the adoption of completely new procedures. It is relatively simple to assess from the bench a serious dereliction of duty to the court, but when we are considering what constitutes
<q>any improper, unreasonable or negligent act or omission",</q>
the trials within trials in criminal cases will be as nothing compared to trials that may feature legal representatives before minds are made up. There has been little consultation on this because of the late arrival of the new clause, and I ask my right hon. and learned Friend to think again.<br/>
The hon. Member for Norwood referred to the specific amendments which bear my name. New clause 19 gives the right of appeal from a magistrates court to a Crown court, and amendment (e) gives the right of appeal from the Crown court upwards. What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. If there can be an appeal from the magistrates court, there should be an appeal from the Crown court. It is only fair. The justification is that we are dealing with an extremely serious matter for the lawyers involved and the higher the court, the more serious it is.<br/>
Amendment (g) deals with the costs of an appeal. At present, under the new clause, an appeal can be made from the magistrates court to the Crown court, but there is no power to award costs to a successful appellant. I pray in aid the words of the Lord Chief Justice in November 1989 when he was considering five cases of Crown court cost orders against solicitors. He expressed concern at the lack of such a power and indicated a preference for a power to award costs from central funds. That is what amendment (g) seeks to do. I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General will consider it sympathetically. It was raised in another place and the Lord Chancellor was unclear as to what would be the outcome.<br/>
Amendment (b) relates the new provision to the court and the client. Therefore, we retain the negligence test of
<q>any improper, unreasonable or negligent act or omission</q>
and we add


<q>in breach of that representative's duty to the court or to his client.</q>
That limits the provision and makes it easier for a court to make up its mind. Also, it may prevent the chaos that could occur as a result of the breadth of the original provision. Also, because of a duty to the court or to the client, it removes the other party to any particular proceeding from urging that such an order be made against his adversary. That is important in criminal cases where some heat may have been engendered. It is vital that the defence advocate remains free to defend his client fearlessly as well as to the best of his ability.<br/>
Amendment (c) gives the right of appeal from the Crown court to the Court of Appeal.<br/>
Amendment (d) is important. It gives legal representatives the right to appear before any cost order is made against them. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General knows, Supreme Court rules, order 62, rule 11(4), give such a right of appearance to the legal representative in civil cases. If we are to be rational, that should apply to any criminal proceedings.<br/>
It is all very well to say that natural justice will prevail and any judge or judicial officer is bound to allow legal representatives to come before him before he makes such an order, but the very fact that it is mandatory under the Supreme Court rules, but is not mentioned in the Bill, is not right. The absence of that stipulation could encourage the odd, occasional abuse. No one in his wildest dreams suggests that there will be many cases of something so serious, where a legal representative is not given a chance to say what happened and why, but it could happen. That should not be allowed, so my right hon. and learned Friend should treat the new clause sympathetically.</p>

<p>As a practitioner, and one who occasionally sits as a recorder, I agree entirely with the Government that there was a need for some definition and for consistent standards to be applied. I therefore welcome the general approach that has been taken. However, the common test of simple negligence, as it has already been described this evening, is broad. It lets in a degree of subjectivity, and possibly even capriciousness, which might affect practitioners unfairly.<br/>
The test set out in new clause 19 includes a reference to "improper" and "unreasonable" behaviour. Those of us who make the criminal appeal reports part of our bedtime reading will know that every now and then, perhaps once or twice a year, a judge has been known to be unreasonable. Occasionally, a judge does something that, in terms of the quality of justice that he is dispensing, is slightly beyond the bounds of propriety. It would be wrong if the practitioner found himself the victim of a charge of judicial impropriety or unreasonableness against which he had no appeal.<br/>
I invite the Government to take the view that there must be a balance of justice which enables the practitioner, who is affected by what could be an extremely damaging order against him, to try to obtain redress from a higher court. A substantial proportion of a practitioner's income in one year might be affected, possibly because the judge had taken an unfavourable view of the client. rather than the lawyer, and allowed that attitude to rub off on the lawyer.

There is a serious need for an appeal procedure to accompany the clear definition of the standards to be applied.</p>

<p>I shall follow the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) by asking whether there have been any consultations with the Law Society and the Bar council on the wording of the new clause and whether both those organisations have expressed their satisfaction with the wording used.<br/>
Having listened to the remarks of the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery, one can envisage a scenario in which a tetchy judge considers a particular line of cross-examination to be wasting the court's time. Judges tend to he short with advocates who do that. I wonder whether the effect of the new clause might be to enable the judge to hold in terrorem over the advocate the possibility that he might lose a day's refresher fees for having taken up too much time on a particular line of cross-examination. That might even apply to the winding-up speech at the end of the trial, when the judge may decide that what is being put to the jury is entirely irrelevant to the jury's consideration, whereas the advocate may feel that he is doing the best that he can for his client. It would be wrong if in those circumstances the advocate could be told that, if he did not sit down and shut up, he would lose a day's fees.</p>

<p>Earlier, I asked the Attorney-General a specific question&#x2014;what happens if the advocate seeks to follow instructions and is then the subject of criticism? In my experience, in a long trial, often the question being asked of the witness at the beginning of the trial only assumes relevance in the judge's or jury's minds much later on. What will happen in those circumstances? Is the advocate to be criticised and made the subject of a cost order simply because he has foreseen an issue that may arise and become mature in three weeks time? The provisions as drawn do not protect against that.<br/>
I also asked the Attorney-General why the Crown prosecution service was exempt. What is the difference between it and a defence advocate, at whatever level? What protection is there for the independent advocate, whether solicitor or barrister, employed by the Crown prosecution service who is given, as sometimes happens, instructions which cannot possibly be followed because of lack of evidence? Decisions have to be taken. Trials are sometimes dropped on the day. When instructions cannot be followed for those reasons, it is due to negligence not on the part of representatives, but on the part of those who instruct.<br/>
It is wrong that a professional person&#x2014;solicitor, barrister, prosecution or defence counsel&#x2014;has to set out to clear his or her name, which may cost incredibly large sums of money, depending on where the matter ends up, when it may well have been the judge who was at fault. In a perfect world, all judges would be perfect, but we live in the real world where, as we all know, Monday morning blues can take over and what appears to be the most obscure point turns into a major row and temper s are lost. That happens to us all at some time. Are we then to be told that, although we may ultimately be proved to he in the right, we shall be penalised?<br/>
The one thing that the press love is to see an advocate or a lawyer criticised. It makes raging headlines. The Government are saying that they will give a right of appeal in certain cases and allow the matter to be examined. The


appellant may be proved right, as in the case of the five London solicitors, who have suffered not just the cost of clearing themselves, but adverse publicity. The press never apologise.<br/>
That has happened to me in my professional career as a solicitor. About 15 years ago, the Sheffield <i>Star</i> ran a story saying that I had been excluded from the cells. It made front page headlines on a Saturday night. A mistake had been made, but because it was said in court, it was covered by privilege and I could not sue. A lawyer had made a mistake&#x2014;he was never briefed again, but that was another matter.<br/>
The same thing happened to me at the Bar. Once again, the Sheffield <i>Star</i>&#x2014;a paper which does not seem to like me very much, although I cannot understand why&#x2014;stated that a lawyer had been criticised. The Bar council and the senate said that it was perfectly proper and that every step had been taken. They made absolutely no criticism. But a judge had got the wrong end of the stick. What compensation is granted? It may be thought that I have a personal gripe about this matter, and I have. Experience has taught me over the years that Monday morning is the worst day of the week, and not just because it is Monday morning and therefore everyone's worst day of the week.<br/>
If the Attorney-General is going to he fair to those who have to perform a public duty standing up in a courtroom, he should be really fair and ensure that when judicial criticism is wrong, there is a right of reparation for the advocate, be he the prosecutor or the defender, in whatever court, at whatever level.<br/>
Perhaps the Attorney-General would think along the lines of allowing a little favourable publicity when a lawyer is cleared&#x2014;at least that would be fair. All of us who practise the law have suffered in this way at some stage. Parliament is supposed to be the protector of the people; perhaps it should also protect those who sometimes have to work in conditions which are unfair and in circumstances in which they are not always popular. Sometimes, what happens on Monday morning can be the result of an argument in another forum on Sunday night in which one did not take part.</p>

<p>That was a moving plea from the hon. Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham). We are all familiar with Monday morning blues; some of us are familiar with the blues on Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday and Friday as well. I am afraid that one has to have a broad back as an advocate&#x2014;to say nothing of what is required of a Law Officer. If one is wrongly criticised, it is my experience that judges are usually fair enough to acknowledge the fact and to make amends.<br/>
I wish to deal first with consultation. The amendments establish a simple point of principle&#x2014;that lawyers are to be liable in costs for the consequences of their negligence. That is quite a popular and simple point. The issue of the appropriate tests for such powers was raised in Committee in another place, when the Law Society sponsored an amendment to what is now clause 93 which would have substituted
<q>serious dereliction of duty to the court</q>
for the test of the clause.<br/>
Before Third Reading in another place, the Lord Chancellor's officials had discussed with the Law Society the Department's own view of the current law and the probability that it would need to be clarified in the Bill.

The Lord Chief Justice and the Master of the Rolls having agreed, the Lord Chancellor wrote to the president of the Law Society on 30 April, consulting him on the proposal to establish a simple negligence test in the Bill. The president replied on 6 June, apologising for his delay and expressing his preference for leaving the law alone, but making some specific points on the proposal.<br/>
Since then, there has been further correspondence between the Lord Chancellor and the president. The Government amendments reflect the view taken by the Lord Chancellor and his officials during those consultations, so it can be fairly said that there has been consultation with the president.<br/>
I take seriously what has been said about the potential gravity for practitioners of the exercise by the court of this power. The power itself is difficult to criticise, but it is of course possible to criticise a hypothetical example of its exercise. The Bill does not provide for an appeal from the exercise by magistrates in a magistrates court of this power to the Crown court. Amendment (e) seeks to introduce that.<br/>
We cannot contemplate costs being paid out of central funds if there were to be a successful appeal. It is a principle strongly adhered to that central funds should not be liable in the event of compensation being paid for the exercise of a judicial function. My right hon. and noble Friend and I have, however, given careful thought to whether there should be a right of appeal against the exercise of this power in the Crown court and, having heeded this Opposition amendment, I can tell the House that it will be accepted.<br/>
I think that that will be seen as a fair response, but I cannot be so accommodating about central funds, for the reasons that I have given. This is a substantial concession, since amendment (e) lies at the heart of the anxieties that have been expressed.<br/>
To answer the hon. Member for St. Helens, South, the position of the Crown prosecution service is as follows. Under section 9 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 there is provision for an order to be made against the service itself when the advocate is an employee of the service, and against the agent personally in the case of an agent. So there is noexemption&#x2014;</p>

<p>I think that I have dealt with that point, if the hon. Gentleman will forgive me.<br/>
Amendment (b) would make it a condition for the exercise of the cost power that there be a breach of the representative's duty to the court or his client. The same provision is made for other proceedings by amendments (a) to amendments Nos. 14 and 37. The Government's view is that, those amendments are not correctly conceived.<br/>
While the concept of breach of duty to the court or client may well be the foundation for the inherent jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, that formulation can add nothing to the perfectly clear statutory test laid clown in new clause 19 (3)(a) and in the Government's equivalent amendments to clause 4 and clause 93. Indeed, the concept of duty could only either repeat what is already there or reintroduce the danger that it is the Government's purpose to remove&#x2014;of confusion with some more restricted test.<br/>
The effect of amendment (c) would be to apply the cost power against representatives in criminal proceedings to lawyers employed by the Crown prosecution service. I have already dealt with that subject, so I proceed gratefully to amendment (d), which would require regulations to make procedural provisions, first, for a reasonable opportunity for representatives to be heard and, secondly, for no order to be made more than six months after the procedures are disposed of. Originally, clause 93 (4) covered all proceedings in the magistrates court. That subsection requires the magistrates court rule committee to lay down certain procedural requirements for the exercise of the magistrates' new cost power.<br/>
New clause 19 separates out criminal proceedings because they are best dealt with in the comprehensive code for costs in criminal proceedings contained in the Prosecution of Offences Act. One consequence is that there will be no requirement for rules or regulations to deal with such procedural matters in relation to criminal proceedings in the magistrates court. But the Government never intended to create any such requirement in relation to the Crown court or any court apart from the magistrates courts.<br/>
In general, it is not desirable to require rule committees to make provision which it should be in their power to make. For example, the whole machinery of costs in the High Court as set out in order 62 depends on a general statutory power which it is the rule committee's duty to use to the best possible effect. Clause 93 makes an exception to that general position which is justified, on balance, by the novelty of the magistrates' power to order representatives to pay costs.<br/>
The responsibility of the magistrates courts rules committee to regulate the new power is similarly new, but no such novelty applies to the Lord Chancellor's power under the Prosecution of Offences Act to make provision in relation to the costs of criminal proceedings. It is simply unnecessary, and therefore undesirable, to make equivalent provision for criminal proceedings.<br/>
Moreover, certain procedural aspects of criminal proceedings have in the past been dealt with by practice direction and it does not seem sensible to require the Lord Chancellor to duplicate whatever might be best dealt with in that way.<br/>
I am grateful for the amendments that have been tabled. One at least of them has enabled me to make a substantial concession which I believe goes to the heart of hon. Members' anxieties and I hope that the House will consider that an appropriate way to respond. I must invite the House to reject the remaining amendments.</p>

<p>The new clause and the amendment amend section 22 of the Solicitors Act 1974, which makes it an offence for an unqualified person to prepare certain instruments so as to permit registered trade mark agents to draw or prepare any instrument relating to any design, trade mark or service mark, and to permit registered patent agents to draw or prepare any instrument relating to any invention, design, technical information, trade mark or service mark. The new clause also defines the meaning of those terms. Amendment No. 116 ensures that the provisions of new clause 21 will not be undermined by the provisions of section 102 and 102(a) of the Patents Act 1977.<br/>
The present monopoly is not thought to serve any real purpose in consumer protection and unnecessarily adds to


the cost of the service that trade mark and patent agents provide to the public. As the monopoly relates neither to advocacy nor to the conduct of litigation and as these transfers are not conveyances in the sense in which that term is used in part II of the Bill, there is no way in which the monopoly can be altered under the machinery created by the Bill.<br/>
The amendments have the support of the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents and the Institute of Trade Mark Agents. Looked at in the round, they are in the general public interest.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
This is a modest amendment that was made at the request of the Law Society. It provides that an agreement

between the solicitor and his client about the solicitor's hourly charging rate may constitute a contentious or non-contentious business agreement. Those to whom the clause matters will understand that language.</p>

<p>I support the new clause. My constituents sometimes complain that they do not know how much they are being charged by solicitors. They wait until the end of their cases and when they receive the bill, they inevitably feel that they are being charged too much. That applies not only to those who receive legal aid but lo those who do not. It is appropriate that, when the client goes initially to see a solicitor, he and the solicitor should agree an hourly rate. That is in the consumers' interest, and the rate should be supplied by the solicitor in writing so that it is clear from the start exactly how much the client is to be charged.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) for welcoming this new clause and the amendments. They fulfil undertakings given by my noble Friend the Lord Chancellor and my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General on Second Reading.<br/>
The purpose of the amendments is to provide a framework in which multinational partnerships consisting of English and Welsh solicitors and foreign lawyers can be subjected to the minimum regulation necessary to provide protection to the clients of such partnerships or incorporated bodies.<br/>
The amendments have five main components. They require the Law Society to maintain a register of foreign lawyers who are entitled to enter into multinational partnerships or recognised bodies with solicitors. They amend the Administration of Justice Act 1985 to permit the creation of such recognised bodies, managed and controlled by solicitors and foreign lawyers. They give power to the Law Society to extend the rules that it makes

for solicitors in respect of professional practice, conduct and discipline, the keeping of clients' money and the compensation and indemnity funds to registered foreign lawyers who are members of such multinational partnerships.<br/>
The overall effect is to provide a proper framework for this new type of multinational partnership for which the way was cleared by clause 54, which removes the statutory inhibition on the formation of multinational partnerships. I commend the new clause and the amendments to the House.</p>

<p>During consideration in another place there was some worry that, in opening the way for the extension of rights of audience in the Crown court, the Bill might also have made it possible for the Government


to limit the right of a defendant to select his legal representatives or effectively to limit the categories of legal representatives from whom he could choose by limiting the numbers of lawyers on a case. That is, of course, no part of the Government's plan, nor is it any part of our plans to impose or require fee sharing.<br/>
A litigant's ability to choose his legal representatives&#x2014;I use the plural advisedly&#x2014;is an important part of the safeguards of access to justice in a general case. My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor therefore accepted an amendment that was designed to make it clear that the defendant's choice was to be preserved. In doing so he also made it clear that, in defence of the legal aid fund and all those who pay for it, he must be able to secure value for money and there was a need to ensure that the amendment was drafted to allow for that.<br/>
On reflection it became clear that some reworking was necessary. The amendments that resulted in the existing clause 49 were introduced after careful consideration and extensive discussion with both branches of the legal profession. Broadly, their effect is to make it impossible for the Government to prescribe for any proceedings in the Crown court the number of representatives or their category, but to leave unchanged both the Lord Chancellor's powers to decide how much their work is separately worth to the legal aid fund, and also the court's powers to decide that the circumstances of a particular case mean that one representative will do where two would be usual.<br/>
The amendments, as far as they went, were broadly welcomed by the Standing Committee. Other amendments tabled by the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) would have extended the provisions to legally aided proceedings in the High Court or the Court of Appeal. In Committee, I undertook to consider whether the principle of the Government's amendments might be extended to some or all of the higher courts.<br/>
The amendments are the result of that consideration. They go further in that they extend the principles to the House of Lords as well. They are comparatively simple. The existing clause 49, which is restricted to representation in the Crown court under part V of the Legal Aid Act 1988, will be replaced by a new clause that extends to all the higher courts, including the House of Lords, and is identical in structure to the existing clause. The result is that the present rights of the legally aided client to select his representatives will be preserved in full. The present power, under the 1988 Act, to make regulations limiting the number of legal representatives to one will no longer apply to the Supreme Court and the House of Lords, but the Lord Chancellor's powers to make remuneration regulations reflecting the value to the legal aid fund of the work done will be preserved.<br/>
I believe that that will be seen as a helpful response to the representations made in Committee and elsewhere.</p>

<p>The new clauses and amendments are helpful because, had they not been introduced, relations between the professions would have been soured with the extension of the rights of audience. The Opposition tabled new clause 25, which has been taken with this group. It enables two legal representatives to be appointed even in contempt and care proceedings. Is that new clause

necessary, or are its provisions similar to those of the Government new clause, in which case we need not press it any further?</p>

<p>As one of those who pressed the Attorney-General on this in Committee, I am grateful for the new clause and in particular its extension to the whole of the Supreme Court, which includes the Crown court. The whole basis of legal practices in many parts of the country&#x2014;in rural areas such as my constituency as well as in many of our large cities&#x2014;is that the client comes to the solicitor, although the solicitor may not necessarily have the expertise to take the case to its conclusion, even if he has the right of audience to do so. Therefore, the client is best served by a specialist preparer and a specialist advocate. The new clause will continue those arrangements.<br/>
The county court is not included in the new clause. We discussed the situation in the county court when we explored the various possibilities in Committee. The county court is, quite rightly, to have a much expanded jurisdiction, and it will deal with many of the serious civil cases, particularly those involving personal injury. It is to be hoped that the litigant in the county court will not be adversely affected by any requirements to be set by the Legal Aid Board. It is to be hoped that the civil litigant will still be able, in the wide range of cases in which he is entitled nowdays to have a specialist preparer and specialist advocate, to have those services into the future.</p>

<p>I too welcome the new clause. I should have been one of those who would have created a row, souring relations not just between the professions, but between the two Front Benches. The Attorney-General has accepted an important principle. I only wish that a statement about it could have been made earlier, as that would have meant that people would not have had to lobby so long and hard.<br/>
The Attorney-General's acceptance of the principle was spoilt when he talked about value for money in legal aid. That goes back to a point made by the Solicitor-General in the Committee considering the Legal Aid Bill in 1988, when he said that the interest of justice had to be made cost-effective. We believe that legal aid is a right. It is the only means by which people can protect their rights in court. At a time when &#x00A3;1 million is being thrown away on the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board and &#x00A3;460,000 is being given away to the Council of Licensed Conveyancers, the Attorney-General could be a little more supportive of the legal aid scheme, rather than applying the pure Thatcherite principles that I am afraid have affected this important part of policy.</p>

The Government's new clause and provision is wider in scope than new clause 25, tabled by the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser). I hope that that deals with his anxiety.<br/>
I agree with the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) that substantial work will be dealt with in the county court under the provisions of part 1. The Government will take careful note, as I am sure will the Legal Aid Board, which is independent of the Government, of the points that he made.

<p>These new clauses and amendments deal with the important topic, which we discussed in detail in Committee, of tying in and the perceived abuse, as it can be, of the mortgage lender using his potentially coercive power to the disadvantage of the borrower. I explained in our debates in Committee that, when dealing with this problem, our touchstone must be openness, so that a borrower can see clearly how much a loan will cost him or her, whether that loan is provided alone or in conjunction with other services.<br/>
Clause 81 became clause 88 and new clauses 30 to 33, together with the amendments, create a slightly longer but a clear and coherent structure to deal with this potential abuse. I shall not outline them in great depth, but there are one or two points of principle to which I should draw attention.<br/>
New clause 30 prohibits people who make residential property loans from doing so as part of a package with other services unless certain conditions are first complied with. The lender must inform the borrower, by notice, in a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, that the loan and other services are separate services. He must inform the borrower whether the terms and conditions of the loan are variable and, if the borrower declines to take other services in the package, as many borrowers will, that the lender will not refuse to provide the loan simply for that reason.<br/>
The lender must provide the borrower with a statement of the price payable for each of the other services in the package, and the extent to which the terms and conditions of the loan would differ if it were made without the other services in the package. Differential pricing is to be permitted and may be justifiable and desirable, but it must be clear to the lender what he is buying and what he is paying for, whether he takes the package as a whole or just an individual service.<br/>
New clause 31 provides for the Secretary of State to prescribe which of the services the inclusion of which in a package with a loan cause the previous clause to apply. They may include insurance and other financial services, valuation and surveying services, conveyancing services and removal services. The clause also provides for connected agreements.<br/>
New clause 32 provides that it is an offence to fail to comply with the requirements of new clause 30 or refuse to


grant a loan, having complied with the conditions of subsection (3) where the proposed borrower declines other services in the package.<br/>
New clause 33 provides for enforcement powers, which are to be carried out by the local trading standards officers, technically described as local weights and measures authorities and by the Director General of Fair Trading, except in Scotland, where prosecuting will, as always, be in the hands of the procurator fiscal.<br/>
There we have a full statutory framework to cover this important matter of tying in, which, as I said, we dealt with in considerable detail in Committee. I commend that new framework and the new clauses to the House.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="748678" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1990-07-25a.553.0" hansard_membership_id="8281" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32910" speakername="Mr. Alex Carlile" colnum="553" time="19:45:00">
<p>I apologise for taking up just a few minutes on the important issue of tying in. In Committee, I said that I had had the assistance of the TSB Group plc on some issues arising in this context, and I should add that I have had the same assistance again for the purposes of this Report stage.<br/>
I am grateful to the Solicitor-General for the rethink that has taken place. We are often criticised in the House for having rather political and unconstructive Committee stages, but, within the bounds of political practicability, the Committee stage of this Bill has been a credit to the House and many useful changes have been made.<br/>
The principle which concerned those of us who spoke on the matter in Committee has been accepted and there is much thanks for that. The tying-in provision under clause 88 has been radically redrafted and now seems clearly to permit differential pricing of financial service packages.<br/>
In a sense, the financial services sector is, like the legal profession, facing regulatory powers and uncertainty about what will happen when the regulations are made. I am sure that the Solicitor-General will give an assurance that the regulations will be subject to a proper consultation procedure with all interested parties.<br/>
It is clear that the redrafted clauses have moved the previous clause 88 provision from being one under which tying in should be prohibited to one under which a mortgage lender may provide controlled services only after it has been through the bureaucratic hoop set out in new clause 30.<br/>
The financial services sector is concerned that those hoops, as I have called them, might impose unnecessary bureaucratic burdens on firms which would be wholly unjustified by the nature and incidence of the perceived malpractice that the Government are seeking to outlaw. That could have a considerable impact on costs, and any significant impact on costs is not absorbed but passed on to the consumer. We are concerned here to achieve value for money for the consumer and a fair deal for the consumer and the financial services institution providing the service.<br/>
I want to make some, I hope, constructive suggestions to reduce the administrative burdens associated with the proposals. It seems odd that, by reason of new clause 31(6)(a), another member of the same group of companies can be liable to be prosecuted for an offence committed by the lender under new clause 30, subsections (2) and (4), because the two companies are to be treated as one.<br/>
For example, under the provisions as drafted, if a customer applied to a bank for a loan and said that he would make his own arrangements for other services, such as insurance, the bank would not apparently have to

satisfy the conditions under new clause 30(3). However, if the customer later told the bank that he had decided to take a controlled service from a sister company, the requirements would bite. That they should bite in those circumstances seems questionable, when the lender had had no part in arranging the supply of the controlled service to the customer, nor stood to receive a direct benefit from the service being purchased.<br/>
It would therefore be helpful if the Government could look again at new clause 30 to see whether it could be amended so that the conditions in subsection (3) applied only in circumstances where the provision of controlled services had been arranged by the lender. After all, it would be self-evident to a borrower that the services he was buying were separate services.<br/>
If it were possible to amend the law in that way, it would be feasible to dispense with the provision under new clause 31(6) while maintaining the object of the tying-in provision. That would remove the unfair liability for prosecution which might be faced by suppliers of controlled services because they happened to be related to a lending company.<br/>
8.15 pm<br/>
In addition, new clause 31(9) defines the words "notice" and "statement". It would be a great help to financial institutions if the Government could assure them that it would be possible to combine all the information requirements under new clause 30 in just one document&#x2014;which could, if it suited the lender, be the agreement itself.<br/>
It is not entirely clear why the requirement that the lender should inform the borrower whether the terms and conditions of the loan are capable of subsequently being varied is regarded as relevant in the context of tying in. Typically, some terms of the residential property loan, most obviously the interest rate applicable, will be variable, and that will apply whether or not the loan is part of the package. It is therefore an important issue upon which the institutions would welcome assistance.<br/>
New clause 31 does not appear to recognise circumstances where the lender prices a package in terms of an aggregation of individual prices for the individual controlled services, but as one or more package prices. Presumably the Government are prepared to allow package pricing, as it may well achieve in most cases the aims of value for money and a fair deal for the consumer. It is therefore an important point.<br/>
Finally, with regard to the regulations governing advertising and promotion, which it is envisaged that the Secretary of State may make, one hopes that it can be assumed that those regulations will be entirely consistent with other similar regulations. In particular, I have in mind those relating to the advertising of mortgage loans under the Consumer Credit (Advertisements) Regulations 1989, which cover all personal loans to be secured on land, regardless of whether they are to be under regulated agreements, and with advertising rules for endowment. insurance under the Financial Services Act 1986.<br/>
All that sounds, and is, a little complicated, but they are issues of importance which, if not sorted out properly, could well adversely affect consumers when they walk into the bank or building society full of nervousness and trepidation to try to obtain what may well be the most important financial transaction of their lives. Therefore, clarification and clarity are of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>I have had the benefit of advice from the Association of British Insurers, and I shall voice some of the points that it has made to me. As disclosed in the Register of Members' Interests, I am a director of Bowring Wales Ltd. and an insurance broker. Therefore, I am interested in the subject.<br/>
The Association of British Insurers feels that the new clauses are a great improvement, in terms of clarity, on those that we considered in Committee. It is particularly pleased that many of the points that it made have been taken into account and are to be found in the new clauses. In particular, a question that I raised about section 16 of the Insurance Companies Act 1982 seems to have been resolved by the new clauses.<br/>
However, insurers remain concerned that they will be obliged to offer a loan without the other services where they had been seeking to offer that loan as part of a package. After all, insurance remains the main business of insurance companies, not the offering of loans. As the market develops, insurance companies may feel that they cannot continue to offer loans, and they may withdraw from the market. That would be a disadvantage because it would reduce the market available to consumers.<br/>
The Secretary of State has wide powers to go beyond the new clauses by amplification in orders and regulations. I note that he is required to consult the Director General of Fair Trading and others. It is therefore appropriate to seek an assurance that, in such an event, the Secretary of State would consult fully with the insurance industry and think carefully before proceeding with any orders or regulations.<br/>
The provisions of new clause 33 will be enforced by local weights and measures authorities and by the Director General of Fair Trading. That must mean, of necessity, that a range of local weights and measures authorities will be involved. Consequently, there must be the possibility of a variation in response. There could be a lack of uniform approach towards enforcement. I look for an assurance from my right hon. and learned Friend the Solicitor-General that he expects uniformity in the enforcement of the new provisions. It would be helpful if he could enlighten me on how he envisages that being achieved.</p>

<p>The new clauses are a useful package of protection for the consumer, and should be welcomed. One matter that concerns me is how to bring the package to the attention of the consumer. He must understand that they are there for his protection and that they prevent people offering to lend money doing certain things. Will there be a publicity campaign&#x2014;a house buyer's charter&#x2014;to draw attention to the measures? They are there to protect the consumer when he is buying a house, taking on an enormous mortgage burden and dealing with people presenting a package.<br/>
Another concern is that, although the conditions under new clause 30 apply to a lender, there is no reference to, for example, a mortgage broker, who can put together a package on the basis of commission. Is he also obliged to disclose his commission and to account to the buyer for that commission? A solicitor or a legal practitioner must do that when putting together a package for the client. Only when there is full disclosure can there be full protection. As I understand it, there is nothing in the new clauses to cover that.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Sir H. Rossi) said almost everything that I wished to say, so I shall not repeat it. Perhaps the way to deal with brokers would be for the Solicitor-General to say that the Director General of Fair Trading, in exercising his jurisdiction as the supervisor of consumer credit, would perhaps show the yellow card to any broker who had a consumer credit licence and was encouraging people to enter into package arrangements that would be illegal if offered by a lender but not expressly illegal if put together by a broker.<br/>
I agree wholeheartedly with what the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green said about giving publicity to the right to choose, which a borrower should have so that he is not being given something that he wants tied in with something that he does not want and does not need.</p>

<p>Our debates on this matter have been highly constructive, and I am grateful to the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) for his kind remarks. We are trying to deal with what I believe has been, and can be, a real abuse of power. I am sure that the way to deal with it is by complete openness by the lender, with the borrower knowing what every ingredient of the package costs&#x2014;above all, what the loan will cost, and then what the other services in connection with the loan will cost.<br/>
I shall deal first with the question of consultation. New clause 31(12) makes an express statutory requirement for consultation by the Lord Chancellor, first with the Director General of Fair Trading and then with all others with whom he sees fit to consult. That is a broad power, but I am confident that it is my right hon. and learned Friend's intention to consult widely. The way to achieve good legislation in this area is to put it to the industry and let it understand what we have in mind. It can then point out any inconsistencies and pitfalls, as it has done constuctively in the development of this new clause.<br/>
I am grateful to the Trustee Savings bank and the hon. and learned Gentleman for giving me an early sight of their constructive comments. I do not believe that they and other commentators need be worried about the provision becoming unnecessarily bureaucratic. I think that that also answers the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Sir H. Rossi), who wanted to know how the borrower would get to know about it.<br/>
The structure of the new clauses means that the lender must notify the borrower by notice, in a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, of his rights and of the requirements in relation to the separate services and, of course, the separate pricing and the power to take some or all of the services on offer. That means that a borrower gets the forms in a way that immediately shows his rights and opportunities. There is no reason why that should not be backed up with publicity if that appears to be sensible. It is not something the statute provides, or needs to provide.<br/>
On advertising, what is required must be consistent with the requirements of the new clauses as a whole. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North (Mr. Jones) for his kind remarks on behalf of the Association of British Insurers. I participated in some of the consultations with that body, among others, and the probing and constructive way in which it sought to ensure that the system should work in practice and should meet its needs has helped us to frame the new clauses in a way that I believe need cause it no anxiety.<br/>
I can think of no reason why insurance companies should be put off providing loans under the new framework. After all, it must be recognised that the provision of property loans is a sensible long-term investment for insurance companies. All that we are seeking is to ensure that the borrower, whose financial strength is of great importance to the insurance company, knows exactly what he is buying and is not being forced to buy something that he does not want at a price that he would not choose to pay if he were free to choose.<br/>
There are two answers to the question of enforcement. First, on the issue of uniformity, the whole matter will be supervised by the Director General of Fair Trading and he will keep an overview. Secondly, I know from personal professional experience a good deal about the work of the weights and measures and trading standards authorities. There was a time when I could claim some expertise in the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. Trading standards officers are served by journals, and it is amazing how quickly the result of any case or any problem particular to that area of enforcement is raised, discussed and commented upon in those journals. Consequently, one finds among those authorities a high degree of uniformity and a desire among enforcement officers to perform their duties in a sensible and uniform way.<br/>
This helpful debate has teased out a number of useful points, and we shall try to learn constructively from them in putting into operation the framework that we now have in sensible statutory form. I commend the new clause to the House.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.<br/>
New clause 5 seeks to implement the recommendation of the Select Committee on Home Affairs in its 1982 report on miscarriages of justice. Had it been implemented then, there is little doubt that a number of the problems that have arisen since in our judicial system might not have done so. The new clause seeks to establish an independent review tribunal composed to a large extent but not exclusively of non-lawyers. A useful precedent has been set by the inquiry currently being conducted by Lord Justice May into the Guildford, Woolwich and Maguire convictions, in which he is accompanied by lay assessors. New clause 5 would allow a tribunal wide discretion in regard to procedure, and I hope that it would also have powers to subpoena witnesses and documents. One of the problems confronting Sir John May was persuading some witnesses to give evidence and to produce relevant documents, and we should learn from that lesson.</p>

<p>It is very good of the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) to have given me notice of his intention to raise that subject and to refer to the 1982 Select Committee on Home Affairs. I am sure that the lessons to be drawn from the 1982 report are just as appropriate today, and perhaps the House and the Select Committee itself would do well to return to that topic once Lord Justice May has reported, to see what additional lessons are to be learned. Perhaps

the hon. Member for Sunderland, South agrees also that it will be important to consider Sir John's conclusions with great care against the 1982 report and tonight's debate.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that intervention, and I agree with the hon. Member for Westminster, North (Sir J. Wheeler), who occupies a distinguished position as chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee now, and who was a member of it when it made the recommendations to which I refer in 1982. I look forward to the Committee returning to the subject under his guidance, because he appreciates, as do many right hon. and hon. Members of all political persuasions, that it is an issue that will not go away.<br/>
New clause 5 would allow the tribunal to consider evidence deemed inadmissable by the courts. I hope that one other matter considered by the Committee in 1982 will also be resolved in the terms of reference of any independent review tribunal, I refer to the requirement that the burden of proof must remain with the Crown to secure a conviction and not, as is increasingly the case, with defendants, to prove their innocence.<br/>
That relates to a fundamental principle of our judicial system, but regrettably, in a number of recent referrals to the Court of Appeal, it has appeared&#x2014;I speak as someone who attended the Birmingham pub bombings appeal on several days in 1987 and early 1988&#x2014;that defendants are required instead to prove their innocence. Our current law does not require them to do so. That point is one to which the Select Committee's 1982 report specifically drew attention, and I hope that that issue will be resolved once and for all.<br/>
The recommendations of the 1982 report received unanimous approval. That Committee was chaired by Sir John Eden, and its other members included the hon. Members for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Dame J. Knight), who is not regarded as being on the wet side of the Conservative party, and for Reigate (Mr. Gardiner), who is also not regarded as a member of the soggy, bleeding-heart wing of the Conservative party. I take heart from the fact that they all subscribed in 1982 to the report's conclusions, and I regret that one or two of them cannot be present this evening, to say whether they have since changed their minds or still stand by the recommendations to which they put their signatures some time ago.<br/>
The terms of new clause 5 were first embodied in an amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Harborough (Sir J. Farr) and myself to the Criminal Justice Bill in June 1988. During my short time as a Member of Parliament, it has been a pleasure to be associated with the hon. Member for Harborough in respect of such issues. It will be apparent to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that the political views of the hon. Member for Harborough and myself cover a wide spectrum. If that hon. Gentleman and I can agree on an issue, it should not be all that difficult for other right hon. and hon. Members to follow us. I pay tribute also to the consistency with which the hon. Member for Harborough was prepared to pursue the case of the six innocent men wrongly convicted of the Birmingham pub bombings long before it was a popular issue.<br/>
New clause 5 represents an idea whose time has come. As long ago as 1982, the Select Committee on Home Affairs, in the wake of a number of appalling miscarriages of justice, decided to investigate that topic, and reported that, with the exception of the Home Office witnesses, it


interviewed no one who was against the idea of an independent tribunal. As long ago as 1976, the distinguished Lord Devlin first mooted the idea, and I am pleased to note that in their evidence to Sir John May's committee, the Bar Council, the Law Society and a host of other witnesses have called for some form of independent review tribunal.<br/>
I have received many letters on that and related issues, including one from a Law Lord giving the concept his support. I shall not embarrass him by naming him, as he would probably be blackballed from his club. When Sir John May reports, I hope that he will make such a recommendation, but we must be prepared for the possibility that he might not do so.<br/>
Everything that has happened in the eight years since the Select Committee's report confirms that wisdom of its recommendations, which were rejected by the Government. Had an independent review tribunal been in place there is no doubt that the Guildford and Woolwich convictions would have been overturned many years ago and without the anguish caused to the individuals directly concerned and to many others. The Maguire family would have had their convictions quashed many years ago and the people wrongly convicted of the Birmingham pub bombings would also have had their cases resolved some years ago.<br/>
The Birmingham case is particularly relevant because the case is deadlocked. The big problem is the Court of Appeal. The Birmingham case has already been to the Court of Appeal, where a mass of new evidence was presented. Instead of ordering a retrial, the Court of Appeal decided to adjudicate upon the new evidence itself in the absence of a jury. It threw out the appeal with contempt.<br/>
The problem is that the case is destined to go back to the Court of Appeal. However, no one who is conversant with the case believes that the Lord Chief Justice who presided at the previous appeal will accept any degree of the new evidence which may be put before him. No-one conversant with the issue has much faith in the Court of Appeal. That is why we are looking for an alternative way, in particular cases, of breaking the deadlock.<br/>
The purpose of the court of last resort, as it is sometimes called, or the independent review tribunal, is to correct mistakes. I do not complain about the fact that mistakes are made by our courts. Any legal system, however perfect, will make mistakes. I complain about the fact that we do not appear to have an adequate mechanism for owning up to mistakes and to a large extent that is due to the belief among senior members of the legal profession, that the system cannot make mistakes. One or two of those people have been frank enough to say that out loud and that does nothing to improve their credibility among those of us who mix in the real world.<br/>
For example, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, who subsequently became Home Secretary, said in the House on 14 April 1948:
<q>As a realist I do not believe that the chances of error in a murder case, with these various instruments of the State present, constitute a factor which we must consider &#x2026; There is no practical possibility. The hon. and learned Member asks me to say that there is no possibility. Of course, a jury might go wrong, the Court of Criminal Appeal might go wrong, as might the House of Lords and the Home Secretary: they

might all be stricken mad and go wrong. But that is not a possibility which anyone can consider lightly. The hon. and learned Member"&#x2014;</q>
that is, whoever put that startling proposition to Sir David Maxwell Fyfe&#x2014;
<q>is moving into a realm of fantasy when he makes that suggestion."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14 April 1948; Vol. 449, c. 1077.]</q>
That is how difficult it is to persuade senior lawyers of the possibility that the legal system is capable of making mistakes. In passing, I mention that Sir David Maxwell Fyfe went on to hang Derek Bentley, who is widely regarded as having been innocent.<br/>
The next difficulty facing those of us who have attempted to raise serious miscarriages of justice is the belief among certain senior sections of the legal profession&#x2014;I do not suggest that it is shared by all&#x2014;that mistakes should not be admitted if they bring into question the credibility of the legal system. For that, we must be grateful to Lord Denning who, as so often, said out loud what others say only in the privacy of their clubs. In the spring of 1988, in a BBC2 programme entitled "Did you See?", he said in so many words that there were circumstances in which persons who were innocent should remain in gaol if the credibility of the legal system was threatened. I am grateful to him for saying that, because that describes fairly graphically, and brings home to many people, the problem that we face.</p>

<p>Would it not be fair to record that Lord Denning, with customary grace, has said publicly that he regards the opinion that he expressed then as a serious mistake?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="748741" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1990-07-25a.564.1" hansard_membership_id="128" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3133" speakername="Mr. Mullin" colnum="564" time="20:45:00">
<p>I was not aware of that, but I will take the Attorney-General's word for it. The opinion on which I know Lord Denning has backtracked is the judgment that he gave in 1980 when the Birmingham pub bombing appeal was referred to him and he made that remarkable and much quoted statement about the appalling vista that would arise if he were to allow the appeal. He has said that he was mistaken about that. We always welcome, however late in the day, a conversion; it is not for me to pour scorn on that.<br/>
All those who have campaigned over many years about the more celebrated cases of miscarriages of justice have had to face the problem of the extraordinary stubbornness of senior individuals in the legal system, due in part to their sheltered upbringings. Many of them tell us&#x2014;having listened to some of their pronouncements, I am inclined to agree&#x2014;that they have fine minds and are very intelligent. However, I am often struck by the fact that people who are so intelligent can also be very stupid at the same time, and that trait&#x2014;I put it no higher than that&#x2014;is to be found in some of the judicial responses to some of the more celebrated miscarriages of justice. That is why we need an independent review tribunal which is slightly more flexible than the Court of Appeal.<br/>
I will cite a few examples to make my point. Timothy Evans was hanged by mistake in 1950. In 1953, the person who carried out the murder for which Evans was executed&#x2014;John Reginald Halliday Christie&#x2014;was arrested and it was obvious to everyone concerned that he was responsible for the murder&#x2014;everyone concerned, that is, except some of those at the highest levels of the legal


profession. An inquiry was set up under Mr. Scott Henderson which found that there was nothing to worry about.<br/>
A further inquiry under Mr. Justice or Lord Justice Brabin found, I believe&#x2014;the Attorney-General will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;that while Evans might not have murdered his wife, he must have murdered the baby. That was complete nonsense, but it was not until 1966&#x2014;after a campaign at least as great as that in relation to the Birmingham and Guildford cases&#x2014;that the Home Secretary was finally prevailed upon to offer Timothy Evans a posthumous pardon. Even now, one or two hon. Members&#x2014;lawyers, of course&#x2014;have approached me saying that Evans was guilty all along.<br/>
In the Confait case, an inquiry set up under Sir Henry Fisher concluded that the youths who had just been released were probably guilty. Sir Henry had to be repudiated when the person responsible came forward.<br/>
In the Meehan case, Patrick Meehan was released from a life sentence and an inquiry was set up under Lord Hunter, a senior Scottish judge. That inquiry concluded that Meehan was probably guilty. Lord Hunter had to be repudiated when Meehan was compensated.<br/>
Perhaps the most celebrated illustration in recent years of difficulties with the Court of Appeal is the case of Cooper and McMahon, who were convicted in 1970 of a post office murder in Luton. It swiftly became apparent to most sensible people that there was something seriously wrong with the case. Four successive Home Secretaries referred the Cooper and McMahon case back to the Court of Appeal on four successive occasions. On each occasion the judges sat stony faced and said that they had heard nothing new. In the end, the Home Secretary of the day, now Lord Whitelaw, became so exasperated because he could think of no way of persuading the Court of Appeal to face up to what had gone wrong, that he simply ordered the gates of the prison to be opened, gave the men railway tickets and sent them home. That is how difficult it is to persuade the Court of Appeal to face up to serious mistakes.<br/>
Anyone who has read the judgment of Lord Roskill at the Guildford appeal in 1976 or 1977 will realise that that was an opportunity to end the Guildford case 13 years ago. It was obvious to everyone concerned that a mistake had been made. I commend to students of the subject the judgment of Lord Roskill explaining why those convictions were still satisfactory.<br/>
A department exists within the Home Office&#x2014;I believe that it is called C3&#x2014;to advise the Home Secretary on cases where there is cause for concern. I have had some dealings with that department. I have always found the individuals who work there courteous and well meaning but, generally speaking, useless at resolving problems. That is not their fault, but the fault of the system of which they form a part. They do not appear to have the power to conduct the slightest independent research, even to the extent of lifting a telephone, and their job seems to consist merely of poking holes in evidence submitted by others. I recall that Sir David Napley, who was interviewed by the Select Committee in 1982, said that he could not think of one case in which the C3 department took the initiative in getting a conviction quashed.<br/>
Anyone who doubts the difficulty with the C3 department should read the 22-page memorandum placed in the Library by the Home Secretary two years ago&#x2014;no doubt it was drafted by the C3 department&#x2014;explaining

why the Maguire convictions were safe and sound. There is even a page on why innocent contamination could not possibly be the cause of the difficulty, although the Home Secretary&#x2014;no doubt prompted by the C3 department&#x2014;now takes the view that innocent contamination is the latest fallback position. Anyone who wishes to celebrate the effectiveness of the present system should study that memorandum.<br/>
In 1983, the Government replied to the Select Committee rejecting its principal recommendation on the independent review tribunal saying that convictions were primarily a matter for the courts to decide. However, the Government sought the advice of the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, who promised some greater flexibility in terms of ordering retrials and accepting references back from the Home Secretary.<br/>
If such a promise was made, it was reneged upon. In the Birmingham case, the judges immediately rejected with contempt an application for a retrial, although there was an enormous amount of new fact upon which a judgment would have to be made. At the end of the Birmingham judgment, which is fairly scandalous, the Lord Chief Justice went so far as to say, "As with so many cases referred to us by the Home Office, the longer it went on, the more convinced we became that the original convictions were safe." That was a message to the Home Secretary, because the Guildford and Woolwich cases were then in the pipeline. It meant, "Don't waste our time sending any more of these cases, because this is how they will end." That is how it was read by many at the time and we now know what happened.<br/>
I should like to think that the Government, and indeed all of us, have learnt some lessons from the experience of events in the past two years, particularly from the Guildford, Woolwich and Maguire cases, but I suspect that that may not be the case. I am delighted that the Labour party and my right hon. and learned Friend, the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) broadly support an independent review tribunal. I welcome the support that that proposal has received from hon. Members from all parties. If the judges are unhappy about the suggestion, they have only themselves to blame. There have been many opportunities over the past decade or so for something to be done about those great scandals and I regret that they have not faced up to them.<br/>
An independent review tribunal is only one of the number of measures that will be necessary to restore the public credibility of the judicial system. We shall also have to stop convicting people on the basis of confessions obtained in police custody, which form the main part of the most celebrated wrongful convictions. We shall have to review the training and selection of judges and, in the light of what Sir John May recommends, we shall have to examine carefully the forensic service.<br/>
Our judicial system is being brought into discredit around the world by its inability to face up to mistakes. That is why I commend new clause 5 to the House.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) and the hon. Member for Harborough (Sir J. Farr) have done the House a service by tabling new clause 5, which is perhaps one of the most important proposals that we are discussing tonight. I fear that there is increasing concern about appellate procedures in cases in which there is some tension and emotion and particularly in terrorist cases. The track record in recent


and not so recent trials of that nature and the limited view taken by the Court of Appeal are causes for concern. The existing machinery obviously needs to be improved.<br/>
Against that background, the Labour party has published proposals for the need for an independent review body to investigate suspected miscarriages of justice. What eventually emerges may not necessarily be in the precise form as presently proposed. The proposals emphasise the need for a wide consultative procedure that must include the composition of the review body and the establishment of an effective, impartial and independent body to investigate miscarriages of justice. That certainly does not exist now to the satisfaction of the general public. As far back as 1982, the Home Affairs Select Committee report and Justice&#x2014;an eminent and experienced body of which I am a humble member&#x2014;reported in that vein. The problem simply will not go away and there is increasing disquiet about our existing procedures.<br/>
I am not wedded to the exact form of words proposed by my hon. Friend, but he is right in principle. There is a need for a new body able to take a wider view and, where necessary, to take the case apart. If we had permanent machinery of that sort, there would be no need for ad hoc inquiries. Indeed, the establishment of ad hoc inquiries makes the case for some sort of body and the case for making it permanent is made out by the increasing concern about a whole spate of cases.<br/>
As a practitioner who from time to time finds himself before the Court of Appeal, I want to make it clear that the Court of Appeal does an effective and satisfactory job for the run-of-the-mill case. I say that in no patronising way. One is not always pleased with the results. That is another matter and may involve a subjective rather than an objective view. It is not the independence of the Court of Appeal that is the cardinal point; it is the type of remit that custom, practice and legislation give it. After all, it is a creature of statute. That is the heart of the problem.<br/>
9 pm<br/>
The cases considered by the Secretary of State and the investigative machinery at his disposal frequently cause concern. My hon. Friend has gone to some lengths to describe that machinery. I accept that serious mistakes can and do happen. I fear that even in future, with the most ideal, new radical machinery, mistakes will happen. Our job is to limit the chances of mistakes happening and to have machinery to correct them as speedily as possible. The convention is that, short of a political earthquake coupled with some evidence, nothing is done. It is an indictment of the present system that it needs a sustained campaign by the great and the good for action to be taken.<br/>
My hon. Friend is proposing an independent body which will be open in its inquisitions and will be the trigger for action by the Home Secretary. It is the sifting machinery, preliminary to a Sir John May inquiry, which is necessary. It is adumbrated here that there could well be a full hearing, presumably by the body itself. I am not sure whether that is necessarily the right way to proceed, but we are trying to find the best solution.<br/>
One could go on at great length, but I shall not do so tonight. The problem will not go away. There is a need for new investigative machinery. Justice delayed is justice

denied. It is wrong that under present procedures decades must go by&#x2014;a third or a half of a working life&#x2014;before justice is done. That cannot be right.<br/>
In this age of new technology, with new tests and machinery every day, there is a lack of balance between what is available to the Crown prosecuting a case and what is available to the defence. An individual, certainly one on legal aid, cannot have all the resources necessary for scientific tests that sometimes border on the frontiers of knowledge. Government agencies exist to serve the people as a whole, not merely the organs of Government. Therefore, where appropriate, they should be available to assist and advise individuals who appear before the Queen's courts.<br/>
I certainly accept the principle, if not the words, of my hon. Friend's amendment. I am sure that we shall return to the matter again. As the Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee suggested, once Sir John May has reported, it may be wise and prudent for the Select Committee to return to the subject again.</p>

<p>I support the remarks of the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin) and the cogent remarks of the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris). I do not think that I am a rarity on this side of the House, but I am certainly one among perhaps not all that many in the Conservative ranks who consider that a succession of miscarriages of justice have come to the forefront, even since the Criminal Justice Bill of 1988, in respect of which I tabled a new clause, was considered in Committee. We did not even imagine the horrendous outcome that the hon. Member for Sunderland, South suggested in relation to the Maguire and Guildford cases. I do not think that even the hon. Gentleman dreamed that his worst fears would be realised.<br/>
My interest, apart from that of any ordinary person, whether Conservative, Labour, Social Democrat or whatever, is to correct a miscarriage of justice. I firmly believe that my hon. Friend the Member for Westminster, North (Sir J. Wheeler), who was on the Select Committee, was right when he said that something had to be done. Unfortunately, his cogent remark was only an intervention. Had he been making a speech, I would probably have intervened and asked him why it had taken so long and eight years is a lifetime for people who have been wrongly imprisoned.<br/>
The hon. Member for Sunderland, South referred to my interest in the Birmingham Six, which may or may not be well known. I happened to be concerned about them, which may or may not be well known, because one or two of them are in Gartree prison in my constituency. When they first went in, they asked me to do a bit of photocopying for them because the prison rules in respect of the photocopier are strict. While I was photocopying their petition to Justice and other organisations, I became interested in their story. I did some investigation. Of course, about five or six years ago, there was a story in the Sunday papers about forensic tests that were said to be bogus. The Gries test was shown by some Sunday papers to be bogus. The Gries test was the forensic test that sent down the Birmingham Six, and they are still inside.<br/>
As an ordinary citizen, I am interested in miscarriages of justice. Anything must be better than the present arrangement. That is what I tried to say when I moved my new clause when the Criminal Justice Bill was considered in Committee a couple of years ago. That is why I am


pleased also to be associated with the hon. Member for Sunderland, South in the new clause. Let us hope that it will not be another few years before something is done.<br/>
I cannot see any reason&#x2014;I never shall&#x2014;why the findings of a Select Committee that was set up to deal with miscarriages of justice should be totally ignored by the House. At that time, my new clause was considered at 1 o'clock in the morning&#x2014;hardly a key time of the day. This debate is an improvement on that. There was a unanimous recommendation by a Select Committee, many members of which are still in the House. It is just not good enough to forget it. I charge my right hon. and learned Friend, for whom I have great admiration, as I have for all of my Government lawyer friends, at least to have another look at the Select Committee's recommendations. If their recommendations are put into effect and the kind of miscarriage of justice that occurred in the case of the Birmingham Six is not allowed to happen again, we shall have done some good.<br/>
Many professional lawyers think that the layman is trying to bind their hands. We are trying to do nothing of the sort; we are leaving the legal system intact. In 1982, the Law Society was strongly in favour, as was the Criminal Bar Association, of an independent review body. Both said that it would be sensible to provide a little more expert advice to the Home Secretary, who has an impossible job. However brilliant one may be, it is impossible to be right all the time. An independent review body, based on the recommendations in the Select Committee's report, ought to be established soon. I have great pleasure in supporting the new clause.</p>

<p>I support the concept of a court of final appeal, although for none of the reasons given so far. I do not believe that it is constructive to look at past examples; one has to consider generalities. In too many instances the arguments advanced in support of a court of final referees have related to a particular case. That is unwise. Anyone who believes that a particular system is right on every occasion is wrong. Everyone makes mistakes. Anyone who practises either as a solicitor or as a barrister&#x2014;I have practised as both&#x2014;knows that he has made mistakes in the past. A mistake may be made by failing to call a witness. The significance of a tiny piece of scientific evidence may not be apparent at the time; one fails to realise its significance. Only later does scientific knowledge highlight the fact that there was more significance to that tiny piece of evidence than was thought at that time.<br/>
Judges, counsel, solicitors and witnesses are human and make mistakes. I do not intend to refer to the findings of the May inquiry, but it is so easy to look back 14, 15 or 20 years and be hypercritical of actions taken by human beings at that time. It is more productive to accept that people try to do their job, within the confines of the system, as well as they can but that they are constrained by the knowledge that exists at the time.<br/>
The problem with forensic evidence over the years has been the imbalance between the facilities available to the defence and the prosecution. Scientific services are Government services and people's services. They should therefore be available to everyone. However, there comes a time within our system when a feeling of partisanship is suspected. All lawyers are well advised to be aware of that danger. If one feels partisan about a particular incident, one may or may not inadvertently fail to disclose evidence,

particularly scientific evidence. One may also Fail to disclose other extraneous factors that in turn become crucial to the testing of the evidence.<br/>
If we are to have a court of final referral, which I hope one day we will, I hope that it will not be only for the great and the good. I have always worried about a simple case&#x2014;a shop burglary 20 years ago. I was convinced at that time and I am to this day that the man convicted of it, on circumstantial, not confessional, evidence, was probably innocent. The problem is that he was given a six-month sentence which has long since been served. He had to serve that sentence and, more importantly, his career was ruined. He wanted to be a professional&#x2014;it does not matter which profession&#x2014;but it was no longer open to him.<br/>
9.15 pm<br/>
A court of final referral is as important to people like that as it is to those accused of major criminal offences or terrorist offences. We have to be equally wary of those cases.<br/>
The present system has stood the test of time. We may not always agree with the results we obtain in court&#x2014;we would not be human if we did&#x2014;but that does not mean that the system is wrong. I disagree with the attacks made upon the Court of Appeal because experience has shown that in 99&#x00B7;99 per cent. of cases the system is fair and right. As my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) said, the system is right.<br/>
I agree with our trial system. Mistakes will be made, but, by and large, it is right. We are not saying that the systems are wrong. Those of us who support a court of final referral merely accept the principle that mistakes can be made. Such a concept needs to be thought about carefully, even if it is not in the form suggested in the new clause. It needs to be established because the frontiers of knowledge are for ever extending and, in a just and good system, we have to be able to accept that we can make a mistake.</p>

I tried to do that in Committee but was unsuccessful because I do not have his legal skills. It is important to discuss this general problem, as my hon. Friend did on Second Reading. I am speaking as a layman&#x2014;a person passionately concerned about something that appears to be wrong, even rotten, in the state of justice. There is a general feeling that this is a major problem that we cannot deal with. Something has clearly gone wrong, but there seems to be no way out. We must find a way of dealing with it.<br/>
It is clear from the Guildford, the Maguire and the Birmingham cases that something has gone drastically wrong with justice. In the atmosphere of that time, it was clear that it would be difficult to get justice and to obtain independent, conscientious police work that was not aimed simply at getting a conviction.<br/>
The machinery of justice is not there to bend to such pressure; it is there to ensure that cases are treated fairly. That is the reason that there should be an adequate appeals procedure&#x2014;so that, if a court has failed in the initial instance, for whatever reasons, the verdict can be looked at again objectively and proper redress provided. In the cases that I mentioned, it is clear that that opportunity did not exist.<br/>
We have to do something along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South. I am alarmed at the way in which the Court of Appeal seems to feel it incumbent upon itself to back previous decisions, as if a challenge to such a decision and the methods by which it was taken is a challenge to justice itself and the rule of law. It believes that it is somehow defending the system against unjustified, unreasonable and unfair criticism. It does not examine the facts of the case, which is surely its responsibility. It is even more alarming to hear rumours that judges in the Court of Appeal continue to believe, despite all that has been said, that people are guilty. Such rumours are disconcerting.</p>

<p>It is clear, and the Attorney-General may have heard it said, that several senior judges have gone round, as they have done in other cases, saying that the people convicted of the Guildford and Woolwich pub bombings and the Maguire family, whose convictions have been quashed, were guilty but got off on a technicality. That is outrageous. It is completely false.</p>

<p>If such attitudes have been voiced, they are absolutely wrong and show that justice was not available through that channel. If that is the case, it should arouse the strongest possible concern, as should any implication that if cases are sent back to the Court of Appeal, they are thrown out as a testimony to the virility of the Court of Appeal.<br/>
The second problem is the way in which the Court of Appeal seems to regard it as necessary to think itself into the mind of the jury at the original trial and say that, even if certain evidence had been presented at the trial, the jury would have come to its original conclusion. That is an impossible and wrong intellectual feat for the court to perform.<br/>
The real threat to justice is the feeling that it has not been done, the feeling that there is no way out or the impression that something that is wrong cannot be dealt with. That is more of a threat to justice than anything that I can imagine.<br/>
In its sixth report in 1981&#x2013;82, the Home Affairs Select Committee, after a thorough inquiry, came to the firm conclusion that there should be a further means of redress along the lines suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South. I quote with concern the evidence given to it by Sir David Napley, who told the Committee that he was unable to recall from his own experience
<q>a single case where the Home Office has, as a result of its own investigations, felt able to recommend a pardon or any other recognition that a conviction was necessarily wrongful.</q>

But he said that, on the other hand,
<q>on a number of occasions (officials) have quite freely expressed to me their sense of disquiet about particular cases but have pointed out that since appellate courts either on appeal or on reference under Section 17 have refused to interfere with the verdict they felt unable themselves to intervene.</q><br/>
It is a self-reinforced system. That is why we need to cut in with a provision such as that in the new clause. It is apparent that under existing powers, where the Secretary of State refers cases to the Court of Appeal because of doubt about a conviction, the machinery does not work well. It appears that on occasions the Court of Appeal positively resents the exercise of that power. Rather than dealing with the reference in an open-minded fashion, it expresses its resentment in its finding. Therefore, we need an independent review.<br/>
I do not think that the Attorney-General will leap to the Box with a glad hosanna and say, "Yes, you are right, it has all been a terrible mistake, and we accept the new clause." I do not think that he will do as I want him to. He is concerned about the reputation and probity of British justice, and the respect for it, not only in this country but in Ireland, and the need to redress the obvious deficiencies that have occurred. If he recommends us to reject the new clause, he must say that the Government are concerned about the issue and that he is looking for a way of dealing with a problem that is detrimental to the interests of justice in this country.</p>

<speech hansard_id="748752" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1990-07-25a.572.0" hansard_membership_id="8462" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18106" speakername="The Attorney-General" colnum="572" time="20:45:00">
<p>I make no complaint that we have spent considerable time on a topic that it would be idle to deny is, at present, a source of much anxiety.<br/>
If I deal with the new clause in a way that applies more closely to our proceedings on Report than if we were discussing its content in a different context, I hope that I shall not be accused of wishing to dodge an important debate or playing into the long grass the considerations that have been properly and cogently expressed. I do not agree with all that has been said, as I shall summarily try to make clear. At this stage of the evening, when several right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House have given voice to their anxieties and their support for the thinking behind the new clause, it is appropriate for me, in reply, to deal with the matter quickly, and I propose to do so in the way that I have explained.<br/>
The Bill does not set out to alter the criminal court structure. To introduce a new clause such as this into the Bill, particularly at this stage, when it has not even been debated in Standing Committee, would be inappropriate. I do not believe that, with hand on heart, hon. Members are seriously suggesting that it can be.<br/>
The Home Secretary and I, following the investigation by the police into the Guildford Four's convictions and the subsequent decision of the Court of Appeal in October 1989 to quash their convictions, appointed Sir John May to inquire into the circumstances leading to, and deriving from, those convictions. That inquiry had wide terms. It was also asked to examine the case of the Maguire family and their co-defendants.<br/>
The first public hearing began on 21 May, and on 11 July the Home Secretary announced to the House that the Maguire case would be referred to the Court of Appeal. That inquiry's terms of reference were deliberately made wide and the Government confidently expect that Sir John May's report will range widely. He has said that, among the matters that he intends to consider, is whether any changes are needed to the existing arrangements for considering allegations that


there have been miscarriages of justice. His interim report was published on 12 July and his final report will receive the most careful consideration.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) rightly distinguished between the function of the Court of Appeal in dealing with a reference to it under the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, and the Home Secretary's function in making such a reference, and considering whether or not to make it. That is an important distinction to bear in mind, and it was not very evident in the speech made by the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin).<br/>
I do not want to be thought to be pre-empting the Government's consideration of whatever Sir John May will recommend. I repeat that I expect his report to range widely, but it would be quite wrong of me to say anything that showed any personal predilection for any recommendation that he may make&#x2014;or against one.<br/>
9.30 pm<br/>
The hon. Member for Sunderland, South referred to the judgment given by the Court of Appeal when dealing with the Birmingham Four's reference. He thought it right to call the judgment scandalous. That is unfortunate language. Any court can deal with the matter brought before it only on the basis of the evidence put before it. As the House knows, when the Home Secretary makes a reference, it must be treated under the legislation as a fresh appeal. There has been a tendency to criticise the Court of Appeal in this and other cases for not having dealt with the matter as it might have done had it been in possession of all the material that subsequently became available.<br/>
If, when dealing with one of these references, the Court of Appeal took into account material that had not been put before it in evidence, that would indeed be grounds for complaint, and loud complaints would be heard in this House&#x2014;</p>

<p>I just want to complete this thought. When hon. Members speak, as many have tonight, about courts not owning up to mistakes, they must be clear in their mind what they are talking about. If they are speaking about what is subsequently revealed to have been an irregularity amounting to a miscarriage of justice, but one which has become apparent only by reason of the later disclosure of material that was not available to the court at the time, the court is not shown to have made a mistake.<br/>
The court has no investigative powers. Much has been done, no doubt unwittingly, to undermine confidence in the judiciary by people saying that it has not been willing to own up to mistakes, who offer in support of that proposition illustrations of the type that I have described. That should not be done.</p>

<p>I hear what the right hon. and learned Gentleman says. My view&#x2014;I think that it is shared widely&#x2014;is that, from the moment the Balcombe street IRA unit was captured in 1976, everyone concerned in the prosecution knew that the wrong people had been convicted. That can easily be shown, and Sir John May may well come to that conclusion.<br/>
In the Birmingham case, what went wrong came to light only later, but that was five or six years ago, and by now it should be dawning on people in high places; it has certainly dawned on those of us who travel on buses.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="748756" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1990-07-25a.574.0" hansard_membership_id="8462" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18106" speakername="The Attorney-General" colnum="574" time="20:45:00">
<p>The House will know that I certainly cannot comment on the facts of those cases, but I ask the House to bear in mind the functions that the House has conferred on the Home Secretary and on the Court of Appeal. Under section 17 of the 1968 Act, the Home Secretary has power to refer to the Court of Appeal the case of any person who has been convicted on indictment. Alternatively, he may in certain circumstances decide to recommend to Her Majesty the exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy, or he may grant a free pardon. Of course, that is not nearly as satisfactory to those who believe that there has been a miscarriage of justice, because if there has been such a miscarriage, they rightly look to the judicial system to correct it. My right hon. and learned Friend the Home Secretary would not normally consider it right to intervene unless there was new evidence or some other consideration of substance, which had not been before the courts and which appeared to cast doubt on the safety of the conviction.<br/>
The right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon said that we needed a tribunal that would take a wider view. He did not identify that wider view, and I find it difficult to see how a view wider than that which the Court of Appeal is required to take can exist. On a reference, the Court of Appeal is required to ask itself whether there is a lurking doubt and whether the conviction is unsafe or unsatisfactory. If there is a doubt, the court must act accordingly. It is difficult to see how we could take a wider view, unless we ask a tribunal to act upon material that is not put before it in the form of evidence. On an appeal there are no holds barred on evidence and fresh evidence can be put before the court.</p>

<p>I sought to put forward as briefly as possible some of the sentiments expressed by Sir John May. On page 36 of his report he comments on the views of the Court of Appeal in that case and on the way in which, in Sir John's judgment, the Court of Appeal erred in upholding the judge's directions, to which I referred. The comments are contained in paragraph 10.1.19. Perhaps I unduly saved the House's time in not referring to them earlier.</p>

<p>The House has heard the right hon. and learned Gentleman's comment, and we must leave the matter there.<br/>
The anxiety, the existence of which I have acknowledged, derives from cases that were heard about 15 years ago. Since that time, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 has been put in place and tape recording is almost universal. We also now have an independent prosecution service. Each of those innovations constitutes a significant safeguard against malpractice of the sort that can lead a court to be presented with inadequate or false evidence. We should bear those matters in mind when we think about the reliability of our criminal justice system.<br/>
The debate has given rise to some extremely interesting and properly brought forward views. It is not appropriate to use the Bill as a vehicle for such a major constitutional reform and it would not be appropriate to accept the new clause. I hope that the House will agree that the new clause should be rejected.</p>

<p>I am grateful to hon. Members who have supported the new clause, and especially to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris).

<p>The two new clauses are different in substance, and I shall briefly describe their effect. New clause 24 would create a department of legal administration&#x2014;what is called in many countries a Ministry of Justice. It would be answerable to the House of Commons, it would be amenable to the supervision and the investigation of a Select Committee, and it would answer to this House for what is the considerable current expenditure of the Lord Chancellor's Department.<br/>
New clause 26 would create a judicial appointments commission, the exact terms of which it sets out. Essentially, it would be concerned with the selection, training and appointment of judges, chairs of tribunals

and other judicial figures, including magistrates. The commission would have as its overriding principle that its work would have to be directed<br/>
<q>to the fair, just and efficient administration of justice without partiality or prejudice.</q><br/>
The creation of a department of legal administration would bring the administration of the law&#x2014;the spending on the administration of the courts&#x2014;into the political arena to a much greater degree than at present. It would have a spending budget of &#x00A3;1 billion a year, including legal aid. By contrast, the setting up of a judicial appointments commission would take the appointment of the judiciary out of the political arena and, for the first time, make it entirely consistent with the constitutional principle that the appointment of the judiciary should be entirely free of political control.<br/>
I wish to go into a little more detail about the proposed department of legal administration. First, its main function would be the spending of about &#x00A3; 1 billion. The Lord Chancellor would cease to be the last of the big spenders in the House of Lords. It was perhaps justifiable to have a Minister in the other place at a time when the Lord Chancellor's Department spent little money and when there was no legal aid scheme. Now, with expenditure of &#x00A3;1 billion a year, the Minister should be accountable to the House of Commons.<br/>
Secondly, a department of legal administration would allow criticism of the administration of the courts, but not the exercise of judicial judgment and discretion. The matter would be in the centre of the political arena rather than tucked away in a corner of the unelected Chamber. Such a department would also be responsible to this House for the operation of the legal aid scheme and its coverage. Eligibility for that scheme has slipped from 90 per cent. of cases to 70 per cent. and is still falling. That matter ought to be the subject of much greater scrutiny by this House, including by the Select Committee on Home Affairs.<br/>
The Attorney-General may say that the Government are spending more and more money on legal aid. Although that is true, the reason is the crime epidemic that has become evident since the present Government came to power. From the figures it is clear that a high proportion of that expense is accounted for by criminal defence costs. Claiming credit for an expansion of the legal aid service by quoting expenditure figures is like saying, in the event of a plague, that the national health service is doing better only because it is spending more on combating it.<br/>
The legal aid scheme should be exposed to much more debate, criticism and accountability in this House. There should also be much public discussion and constructive criticism of the work of the Crown prosecution service. I have always made it clear that we are strong supporters of the concept of the CPS, but we want it to operate efficiently. Although we are concerned about the defence of liberty, civil rights, and the ability of the individual to receive a fair trial, the victims of crime have rights. If prosecutions are handled incompetently and are not given sufficient resources, and if those guilty of crimes escape because of the prosecution's inefficiency, that too is wrong. The quality and rewards of the CPS should also be debated more thoroughly in this House.<br/>
A department of legal administration could concern itself with law reform. I would prefer to see many more people asking questions of this House about why we retain stupid, unfair or outdated laws and do not go about


reforming them more thoroughly and quickly. I can think of whole areas of law in urgent need of reform, which would occur if more pressure were exerted on this House.</p>

<p>I shall refer in a moment to controversial issues and the part that a department of justice or a department of legal administration could play in them.<br/>
I can think of a number of areas where law reform should proceed more quickly. One example is the liability of an original lessee. It is ridiculous that someone who signed a lease 50 years ago as the original lessee should still be liable. It is wrong also that those having leasehold flats have not been given a system of enfranchisement and of commonhold ownership consistent with present day ownership. When I was Minister of State for Prices and Consumer Protection, it struck me as ridiculous that one had to use a private Member's Bill on a Friday to push through a reform such as the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, which I, with my former hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough, was able to put on the statute book. It seems silly that we should not have a more vigorous system of law reform run by a department of legal administration answerable to this House.<br/>
The Attorney-General referred to the Shops Act 1950. There are a number of outdated items of legislation on the statute book, and many others proposed that are highly controversial. A department of legal administration should not shrink from making it possible for the House to reach decisions about them.</p>

I hope that it will be possible to expedite the passage of law reform legislation through the House by the combined use of a Select Committee and a Standing Committee as happens at the moment with consolidation legislation.<br/>

<p>I want to see a department which will develop a comprehensive coverage of advice and representation across the nation, not just including the legal professions, but encompassing advice agencies such as the citizens advice bureaux, which would assist a network of law centres supported by central and local government. It should be sufficient to meet the needs of the population and be assured of independence. I would like

to see a coverage of representation and assistance for tribunals no matter what their nature. We want to develop a system of advice and representation, both lay and professional, which ensures that no man or woman's rights are diminished or abrogated because of a lack of advice, help or representation.<br/>
Those matters should be given more attention by the House. A department of legal administration could be examined critically and constructively. There is no reason why those matters should not be the subject of more political debate and controversy in the House. The administration of justice should not be remote or mysterious. We want to bring the large amount of spending and other important matters concerning the administration of justice into the House under a prime department for the first time.<br/>
I want now in contrast to consider the establishment of a judicial appointments commission. That would remove political control and the exclusive nominal control of appointments from the Lord Chancellor and the Prime Minister, who are both Cabinet members. I do not want to criticise the way in which the present Lord Chancellor has conducted his duties as he is responsible for the appointment of the judiciary. I have great admiration for the work of the Lord Chancellor's Department in the way in which it assembles information and gathers intelligence to make judicial appointments.<br/>
However, I am sure that it is wrong that such a duty should be undertaken by a political Minister. The number of appointments is now so much greater than when the system was traditionally under the control of the Lord Chancellor. For example, there are 920 judicial appointments, excluding appeal and High Court judges, and there are thousands of magistrates. The overriding principle would be the independent and efficient administration of justice. However, there are other targets and criteria which we could give to a judicial appointments commission which it could conduct in a way that was free from political control.<br/>
We could ensure that judges were more representative of the communities that they served. Judges are not masters of the community; they are its servants. I know that the Lord Chancellor has taken seriously the importance of the appointment of women, who I am reminded from time to time are not a minority, but the majority in our society. I know that he also takes seriously the appointment of black people and other representatives of ethnic minorities in this country. However, if we had a judicial appointments commission it would be possible to be more expansive and imaginative and to invite more ideas about the way in which we could make the judiciary and the bench more representative of the population they serve.<br/>
Despite the good faith and good intentions of the Lord Chancellor's Department, the judiciary simply does not reflect the composition of the country. There are 408 circuit judges presiding over Crown courts and county courts, but only 17 of them are women. There are 216 county court registrars, of whom only four are women. There are 49 stipendiary magistrates, of whom eight are women, a rather better figure. Industrial tribunals deal with employment cases and sexual and racial discrimination. Of 64 full-time chairs of industrial tribunals, only six are women. There is only one woman out of 16 social


security commissioners, and there is only one woman out of 14 chairs of social security appeal tribunals. Much though we may try, it is simply not good enough.<br/>
We need a commission which is set targets and criteria so that appointments to the judiciary and chairs of tribunals reflect the community they serve, including women and other groups.<br/>
We should encourage a career structure in the judiciary where it is not always possible for someone with 10 years' experience in the courts to go straight to being a judge. Some people may find it much more difficult to achieve a judicial post because of their career patterns and experience. There is no reason why someone should not be appointed chair of a tribunal and, if they prove themselves to be good after serving for a short time in that capacity, to move to a higher or different judicial appointment so that a career pattern would be created within the judiciary in addition to the traditional pattern of serving as an advocate and then being appointed, sometimes temporarily and sometimes permanently, as a judge.<br/>
Such a commission would encourage our judges to be more accountable and discuss more constructively the nature of their work and the way in which they approach it. Having removed judicial appointments from political control, it might be easier to rebuke and, if necessary, dismiss judges. I know that we are not here to criticise individual judges, but there is much concern about judges who say that women are liable to be raped if they walk home alone on a dark night. There have been examples of judges who appear to be out of tune with the needs and views of the community that they serve. A commission removed from political control would be freer to deal with such matters.<br/>
We want a judicial appointments commission which is transparent in its operations. I am not suggesting that confidential information that affects whether someone should be appointed should be entirely open and that people should have to disclose the sources of that information, but the way in which the system works has to be transparent. Those who seek an appointment need to know what has been said about them and to be given an opportunity to counter any unfavourable statements that might damage their possible career in the judiciary. We want a system that is transparent and imaginative.<br/>
One of the proposals involves a more vigorous political debate about the administration of the law, the efficient conduct of our courts, the expenditure of money and the extent of legal aid. We want one vigorous political department dealing with the administration and reform of the law. In contrast, we want another body that is independent of politics, that is transparent and that perhaps will approach more imaginatively the task of recruiting, training and appointing judges. Both propositions are needed, and I hope that they will be supported.</p>

<p>It is one of the ironies of a Report stage such as this when we come under pressure of time that a whole galaxy of worthy and interesting subjects comes up for discussion. It is tempting to let loose, particularly about a ministry of justice or a department of legal administration. My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General will be relieved to know that I shall resist that temptation and speak briefly, perhaps wearing my Law Society hat, to register a genuine anxiety about the new clause 26 which deals with a judicial appointments commission.<br/>
Our judicial appointments system is historic, thorough and experienced, but it is perhaps one of the most closed and charmed systems in the land. We touched on that in Committee. I do not criticise the system as such, but its nature does not exactly charm most solicitors. Indeed, they feel somewhat outside the system of selection at the very time when they are penetrating the higher courts. taking on judicial appointments and hoping to take over more of them. That is a serious concern.<br/>
I have definite sympathy with new clause 26, as does the Law Society, and I hope for some suitably reassuring words from my right hon. and learned Friend.</p>

<p>I wish to raise one matter on new clause 24. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) referred to the rights of the victim. I have some questions for the Attorney-General.<br/>
Why will the Legal Aid Board not grant the cost of experts in many defence cases of serious crime? That is a serious matter. For example, in a car ringing case, the Crown had experts in engineering and motor sciences. The defence asked for an engineering expert because the Crown's evidence was to be challenged, but the request was refused. Is that justice?<br/>
Why has a senior judge found it necessary to write to the Director General of Public Prosecutions with anxieties about the competence of counsel in certain prosecutions in the south-eastern circuit? Why has a certain criminal court judge written to a senior member of the Bar&#x2014;I am prepared to supply his name to the Attorney-General&#x2014;about exactly the same question? Why is there a general belief that grade 3 barristers are not being briefed and grade 3 work is being sent to grade 2 barristers? Could it be that the Crown prosecution service is being starved of funds and therefore cannot brief competently?<br/>
Is that why briefs on rape cases, which must be tried in the central criminal courts, are being touted around the Temple in an attempt to find a prosecuting barrister? Will that bring justice to the rape victim who has a right for her case, which is the Crown's case, to be put properly in our courts? Could it just be that the Treasury purse strings are operating in such a way as to constrain and restrict the right of the Crown prosecution service to brief the most competent and best counsel? Is it right that a considerable number of the best and most competent senior juniors seem to be ceasing to do prosecution work? Is that in the interests of society?<br/>
The Attorney-General will say that I should ask the Minister responsible, but who, bar the Attorney-General, is responsible and answerable to us? If we had a ministry of justice and a Select Committee to oversee those matters, the Select Committee could call witnesses and ask questions. I have been a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee for some years. We can touch upon certain little matters because our brief carries us that far, but we cannot touch on the Lord Chancellor's Department, and we cannot touch on other matters to do with legal aid.<br/>
We can touch, however, as we did recently&#x2014;although I declared an interest and did not take part in the inquiry&#x2014;on the Crown prosecution service. Would it not be wiser if all the spending Departments were under one Ministry, with a Minister answerable at the Dispatch Box, fortnight in and fortnight out, not just for 15 minutes at Attorney-General's Question Time but for perhaps an hour, as many other Ministers are?<br/>
These matters are of considerable importance to men and women in the street. Whether we defend them properly or prosecute them properly is a matter of concern to society. The victim and the defendant have interests, and the Treasury's cold hand seems to be causing damage to both.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) said that he was concerned that so many new and radical ideas that have been put forward not just by the Government but by the Opposition are being considered so late at night and in such a brief time. He was quite right. That is why, at the start of the proceedings, I raised a point of order about the allocated time preventing hon. Members from carefully considering the many amendments to the extent that we would like.<br/>
This new clause places on record the cornerstone of the Labour party's policy on legal affairs. I am not particularly friendly towards the name "Department of Legal Administration". It sounds a bit Jim Hackerish. I have raised this matter with my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris). What's in a name? I am sure that we could make progress in terms of what we call our ministry of justice because of the important role that it will play in the administration of policy when my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon takes over as the Secretary of State for justice or legal administration and my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) takes over as his deputy. It will mean a radical departure in legal administration.<br/>
Hon. Members have heard much praise for the Lord Chancellor in respect of this and other Bills which have been initiated by him. I must admit that I have never seen the Lord Chancellor in the other place. Marvellous tablets of stone come down from the other place to be discussed in this place. They then go back amended&#x2014;if one can amend tablets of stone&#x2014;and we never get the chance to question the Lord Chancellor or ask him to tell the House his thinking behind certain aspects of policy.<br/>
One of the most important aspects of the creation of a department of legal administration is the presence in the House of a Minister accountable to Parliament and responsible for a whole Government Department which is of major concern to ordinary citizens. There is no point in giving rights to people, either nationally or locally, if those rights cannot be enforced properly. With this new clause, we seek to ensure that a Minister will be responsible for those aspects of policy and can be questioned.<br/>
I agree with the comments by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham), who said that 15 minutes of questioning every three weeks is not enough. We should like to see the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General much more often in the House. I am disappointed when I have to read about developments such as the initiation of the family hearing centres in newspapers and in press releases from the Lord Chancellor. I should much prefer the Attorney-General to come before the House and make such statements as a Minister with responsibility for a whole Department.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South is the most senior member of the Select Committee on Home

Affairs, on which I serve. He is right when he says that that Committee does not have time to ensure that the work of the Lord Chancellor's Department is scrutinised. I know what the Attorney-General will say. He will say that a major inquiry has been held into the Crown prosecution service. I believe that that was the first major inquiry into the workings of the Lord Chancellor's Department.<br/>
There are many other policy aspects that the Select Committee has not dealt with. I should like an inquiry to be held into the administration of the legal aid fund. We have been unable to hold such an inquiry. I should like an inquiry into the administration of justice in civil cases, but the Select Committee has not had time to do that. I should like an inquiry to be held into judicial appointments. It cannot be done, because the Select Committee does not have sufficient time in which to hold such an inquiry. Because of the number of inquiries that the Select Committee is to undertake in the next year, there will be insufficient time to inquire into even one part of the operation of the Lord Chancellor's Department. That is why a Department with a Minister responsible to the House of Commons is needed. A Select Committee which could carefully scrutinise the work of that Department is also needed.<br/>
We should also like the Attorney-General to tell us more about the Crown prosecution service. When a Minister is made responsible to the House of Commons, we hope that detailed debates will be held into the operation of the Crown prosecution service. Despite the fact that a major inquiry has been held into the Crown prosecution service, it has been debated in this place only once. When I was fortunate enough to win first place in the ballot for Adjournment debates, I decided that we should debate the Crown prosecution service. That was the first occasion on which the Attorney-General came to the House and admitted that the operation of the Crown prosecution service was causing problems.<br/>
I went to Nottingham a couple of weeks ago to address the annual general meeting of the Law Centres Federation. I hope that one of the first tasks of the new secretary of state for justice, or minister with responsibility for the department of legal administration will be to ensure that there is a network of law centres throughout the country. It has long been the Labour party's policy to establish a law centres network. Certain parts of the country&#x2014;Croydon is one&#x2014;have no ready access to law centres.<br/>
I worked for three years in a law centre in Leicester. There is no better way for citizens to obtain quick, efficient and cheap advice than from law centres. We should consider the possibility of creating a network of law centres that makes use of the services of those who work in citizens advice bureaux. I hope that, when my right hon. and hon. Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) starts his first day as Minister with responsibility for these matters, he will announce to the House the creation of a network that we have talked about for 11 years but that we have had no chance to initiate.<br/>
I strongly support the new clause and I hope very much that the Attorney-General will support it too. If he does, he will have the privilege of being the first Minister in the history of Parliament to be totally responsible for a Government Department of legal administration. We shall be happy to give him that privilege, because the principle is so important.</p>

<p>I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for calling me to speak to the new clause which stands in my name. I also thank my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris) for taking the two principles that I tried to embody in amendments that I tabled in Committee and turning them into something much more effective than I was capable of doing. The two new clauses embody two important principles to which I am strongly attached.<br/>
The first is a ministry of justice. I make no apology for discussing such principles this late at night. It is not our fault that we are forced to debate major issues such as this at the tail end&#x2014;one might say the fag end&#x2014;of the Session and late at night. It is the fault of the Government's casual DIY approach to the Bill. They have rushed in long, complicated clauses on Report after the Bill has passed through the House of Lords and Committee. They did so to pre-empt the time necessary to discuss the fundamental principles behind the new clause.<br/>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) I prefer to call the ministry of justice the department of justice, because the present title is somewhat cumbersome. A ministry of justice is a vital principle. 1 have always been an advocate of relieving the Lord Chancellor of certain functions. I yield to none in my admiration for the present Lord Chancellor. He is a breath of fresh air, vigour and reform, partly because he comes from the different and somewhat better legal tradition in Scotland. He has come to the job with clear, fresh eyes and a vigour of which the conservative profession in England was not capable.<br/>
It has always seemed to me that the tripartite role could best be dealt with by removing the Lord Chancellor's function as a judge and employing a benign and avuncular actor to preside over the deliberations in another place. Robert Morley springs instantly to mind, or perhaps Lord Hailsham could make a comeback in his successful career of presiding over another place. I would transfer the functions specified in new clause 24 to a proper ministry of justice of the kind that every civilised country has and which we, too, should have.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leicester, East has made the case for the new clause eloquently and articulately. I shall not repeat it. It is important that the principles embodied in the new clause are discussed in the House. There is no doubt that, if we had had a ministry of justice, we could have achieved reforms in the judicial system, reforms in the appointment of judges and law reforms such as that which my hon. Friend mentioned, and which I too would like to see, to provide for a system of law shops. In such centres justice could be provided quickly and effectively to people who came in off the street. The awe, mystique and expense of justice would be removed. If we had had a ministry of justice, we as politicians accountable to the people would have seen the inadequacies of the system and pressed for change. Only that insulation from pressure has made the system of justice so inaccountable.<br/>
The judicial system is at the end of the day a service industry that must serve the purposes of the people. For that, the voice of the people must be influential. It must be heard. The system must be accountable to the representatives of the people in those important functions and provisions. That is the basic principle. If the system was accountable to the House we would have a better and more adequate system.<br/>
New clause 26 would create a judicial appointment commission. It deals with the basic question of the nature of judges. I emphasise two points. First, we need proper and adequate training to create a genuinely trained professional body of judges such as exists in the rather different system in France. The judge is the last bastion of the English amateur tradition which has been inadequate in so many respects. If we had a proper system of training provided by the judicial appointments commission proposed in the new clause, and a staff college for judges, we would have a more effective system of justice. A more representative body of judges would be achieved by that method.<br/>
It is interesting that the incoming president of the Law Society has made one of his aims for the year to secure a more representative body of judges&#x2014;a wider range of appointments. He wants to see solicitors appointed. We have heard comments from many sources about the unrepresentative nature of the bench. Sir David Napley, a former president of the Law Society, said:
<q>The appointment of judges has long been in need of radical overhaul. It's too tied up with the old boy network.</q>
He said that it is clear that the appointment of judges
<q>should be subject to independent scrutiny.</q>
I echo those comments. We have an unrepresentative body of judges which needs to be made more representative. It needs to be made professional by a judicial appointments committee.<br/>
10.30 pm<br/>
The people who have the greatest control over the appointment of judges seem to be incumbent judges. Every new High Court appointment is preceded by a meeting between the Lord Chancellor and the heads of divisions. They exercise a negative veto. All sorts of reports and complaints can be brought to bear against people put forward. The system is controlled not by politicians but by the incumbents. That means that it is not responsive to social developments in our society. It is a self-reinforcing system. The judges, seeing themselves as the fount of wisdom, like to see new judges as chaps like themselves. That is one of the main road blocks on the way to reform.<br/>
There can be no argument about the unrepresentative nature of judges. A report of research by Lord Gifford published in 1986 says:
<q>judges are from a narrow social background, almost all white, male, upper middle-class, from an independent school and Oxbridge.</q>
The Labour research department did a study of 465 judges, which was published in January 1987. It said tha more than one in three of them is past the state retirement age of 65. Age does not necessarily bring wisdom, although in my own case it does. It has been said of others that they immature with age, but I do not think that that can be said of me. Age is no automatic guarantee of wisdom. It is open to question whether we are keeping judges on for too long in the present structure.<br/>
Only 17 of the 465 judges were women and there was only one black judge, although there were four judges of white South African extraction. The report looked at all the categories of judges and proved that the exclusive nature exists at all levels of the system.<br/>
I tabled some questions to the Attorney-General a couple of weeks ago. They yielded the information that there are 83 High Court judges, of whom 27&#x00B7;7 per cent. are aged between 60 and 69 and 10 to 12 per cent. between 70


and 75. They are obviously youthful and vigorous and full of new ideas, ready to respond to the challenges of change and adjust to the new society in which we live.<br/>
The second question to the Attorney-General yielded the information that 77 per cent. of the 83 High Court judges went to schools listed in the <i>Independent Schools Yearbook.</i> That means that they went to private schools. Some 80 of them, 96 per cent., went to university, and 84 per cent. of them went to either Oxford or Cambridge. They were all chaps drawn from that narrow, class background and, in almost every case, from the Bar, which is unrepresentative and, given the pattern of entry to it, will remain so. It is almost essential to have either a working wife or private wealth to persevere through the system.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure what help my hon. Friend had, but he certainly did not have a bursary while working part-time in another job. It is necessary to come from a fairly substantial background. That means that judges represent a class, a restrictive range&#x2014;</p>

<p>I was merely making a joke.<br/>
That narrow range means that they are prejudiced because the judges are not representative of the wide range of views in a pluralistic society as they should be because they are dealing with that society's problems. It is partly that narrow, restrictive range and backgroud that gives judges their attitude and makes them see themselves not as protecters of the liberty of the subject or guarantors of the rights of people who want to be empowered in our society, but as the defenders of the Executive. They see themselves as lions under the throne, rather than defenders of rights.<br/>
That is a tragedy to those of us who would like to see some definition of rights. I was one of three Labour Members who voted for the incorporation of the European convention on human rights into British law. Now, 230 Labour Members believe in it because it has become party policy, but we three were a little advanced because we did so before that. But it is difficult to justify that incorporation given that we cannot trust the judges because they come from such a narrow range and have such a restricted set of attitudes.<br/>
I was fascinated to read in a recent book by Professor Keith Ewing, "Freedom Under Thatcher", arguments that point to the conclusion that it is difficult to have a Bill of Rights in this country when we have such a narrow, unrepresentative range of judges with such prejudiced attitudes. It makes the point that, had Robert Bork been proposed for high judicial office in this country, as he was in the United States, he would have been appointed. There would have been no criticism, no review, no possible contest in the House of Commons. We have no accountability to reveal the weaknesses or attitudes of such people.<br/>
The book goes on to argue that we have a narrow, unrepresentative range of people, adjudicating on issues such as a woman's right to abortion. Such wide social issues are determined by a group of men, appointed from the same background. Judges are given the power to disrupt decisions and adjustments made by the processes of politics, which are those of persuasion, compromise and agreement. From their restricted background the judges

blunder into difficult ethical, social and political matters which are then subject to the prejudices of that narrow range of people.<br/>
It is interesting that so many of the legislative developments, the restrictions of freedom, which have gone on under this Government, were anticipated by judicial development before Parliament passed the legislation to consolidate them&#x2014;for example, the police power to regulate public assemblies in the Public Order Act 1986. Many of the restrictions on political freedom that have taken place in the 1980s have not been the result of legislation, but judge-made initiatives, authorising the extension of Executive power. The judges anticipated and sanctified the restrictions on freedom of movement, freedom of the press and freedom of assembly because they come from such a narrow range of backgrounds.<br/>
I should like to quote the remarks on social issues of one or two of this ancient, white, unrepresentative group of judges. Judge Raymond Dean told a rape trial jury:
<q>When a woman says no. she doesn't always mean it.</q>
Judge Bertrand Richards, of Lancing college and Oxford, told a woman who had been raped that she was guilty&#x2014;</p>

<p>I should have thought it perfectly legitimate to quote the judges to illustrate the unrepresentative composition of the bench of judges, Madam Deputy Speaker. However, I shall move on.<br/>
We propose a way of ensuring that the judges are more representative, that they are trained to do the job, and that they view themselves not as lions under the throne defending the Executive but as defenders of the rights of the people. The judicial appointments commission proposed in the new clause is rather like the sort of civil service commission which has given us such a high quality of civil servants. Why should not the judges be subjected to that sort of commission's search for excellence?<br/>
I commend those points to the House as major advances.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of the hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) that, having indulged himself in a recitation of a well-known operatic style of denunciation of the judges, he should now go off to talk to his hon. Friend the Member for St. Helens, South (Mr. Bermingham). Nevertheless, I invite him to deal with the facts.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman regaled us with a long catalogue of supposed illustrations of the bias of the judiciary towards the Executive. I cannot quote him verbatim because he spoke at such length and with such rapidity, but in essence he said that the judges are on the side of the Executive and have never done anything to protect the liberty of the subject.<br/>
I should like the hon. Gentleman to think about the emergence of judicial review, of which I do not doubt he has heard. Judicial review was not the creation of this House&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I hope that the hon. Member for Great Grimsby will not leave the Chamber now, because I want him, if he will be good enough to do so, to pay attention. Judicial review was not the creation, as I say, of Parliament; it has been the creation of the judges over the


past 25 years. It has been a proper curb on the exercise of power by the Executive. Is not it strange that this socially privileged, biased and protected judiciary should have set about finding a means with which to protect the individual against the Executive and excessive use of power? That is something of an anomaly, given the pattern with which the hon. Gentleman regaled us.<br/>
The hon. Member for Great Grimsby must think about this: judicial review is the one way, in the absence of a written constitution, in which the courts can acquire jurisdiction over the use of Executive power. That blows the whole of the hon. Gentleman's thesis out of the water&#x2014;</p>

<p>For about half an hour the hon. Member for Great Grimsby spoke on a fairly familiar theme. The two new clauses contain much of obvious importance. For example, the importance of the selection of the judiciary is self-evident. We should approach the matter upon the basis of a sensible appreciation of what judges do and their record. Those of us who know the people who became judges in the time that we have been in the profession, know that is absurd to say that there is some sort of bias towards a social background of one kind or another. The same applies to those who are called to the Bar or who become solicitors.<br/>
10.45 pm<br/>
There is a disproportionate number of women judges, but one must remember that judges are appointed from the legal profession and the Bill seeks to broaden the pool from which the judiciary can in future be recruited. The Government are entitled to credit for that. Because of the demands imposed by practice at the Bar, it is harder for women than for men to make a go of the Bar. We hope that the position is improving. I think that I am right in saying that at present more than 50 per cent. of students admitted to the Inns of Court are women.<br/>
It is extremely important for the judiciary to be representative, and the Lord Chancellor has taken substantial steps to see that numerically and in other ways the judiciary becomes more representative of the community.<br/>
New clause 26 deals with the appointment of a judicial appointments commission. The Lord Chancellor's practice, which has been followed by all his recent predecessors, is to take full and careful advice. That means wide and continuing consultation with the judiciary and the leaders of the profession. Much work has been carried out by his Department to identify the best candidates. It is wrong to say that the Lord Chancellor is not responsible and not answerable. He is answerable to the House of

Lords and, by reason of our arrangements, I am answerable to the House of Commons for the Lord Chancellor's business.<br/>
If there were a series of bad appointments, the Lord Chancellor would be called to answer for that, and so would I. It is a mistake to suggest that, per se, a commission is likely to be better at achieving the results that we all want than the Lord Chancellor, who uses the machinery at his disposal, and consultation. In the past 10 years, the system has been greatly improved. There is no secrecy about it, and the Lord Chancellor's predecessor published a book entitled "Judicial Appointments", which brought matters into the open. Consultation is now wider than it has ever been and thought is continually being given to the best methods of gaining information on possible black, women and solicitor candidates. A two-year experimental initiative has been set up in limited parts of the country to identify solicitor candidates for part-time judicial appointments. Much more is being done.<br/>
It is satisfactory that an increasing number of black and women barristers are progressing successfully at the Bar. The hon. Member for Great Grimsby spoke about judicial training, which is important. I do not go along with his comparison with the French judiciary. That would require much more research than the hon. Gentleman has been able to give it. The Judicial Studies Board is worthy of his attention, as is the work that is put in nowadays to training the judiciary at every level, rather than just after judges are appointed. Great progress has been made in that regard.<br/>
New clause 24 would create a department of legal administration, answerable through a Minister or Ministers to the House of Commons. Although it is proper for hon. Members to put forward the arguments that they have made tonight, it is not a practical proposition to incorporate into the Bill, without even discussion in Committee, such a major constitutional change. The clause would make a Minister in the House of Commons responsible for administration of the courts, appointment of the judiciary, legal services and most of the other functions that at the moment fall to the Lord Chancellor and his Department. That is undesirable.<br/>
I feel that there is great merit in having the Lord Chancellor sitting in the House of Lords, as he is thereby removed from the full force of party politics. That helps to protect and maintain more effectively the independence of the judiciary. The Lord Chancellor remains accountable to Parliament as a whole for the way in which he carries out his ministerial duties, in the same way as those Secretaries of State who have been Members of the other place have been. The Law Officers answer for the Lord Chancellor in the Commons. I do not know whether the House considers that satisfactory, but it gives the Treasury value for money.<br/>
The new clause would also establish a statutory judicial appointments commission. That proposal was considered by the Government, and rejected as not offering the same advantages as the present system. It also suggests that the Lord Chancellor should be responsible for supervision of the legal profession. He has a general responsibility for the health of the legal and judicial systems, but it is no part of the Bill to give him the task of supervising the legal profession directly. That would provide the means for unacceptable interference by the Government in the affairs of the independent and self-governing professions. Those are major disadvantages.<br/>
The hon. Member for St. Helens, South asked four factual questions, of which the first was: why will not the Legal Aid Board grant the costs of experts in criminal cases? That is a good question to put to the board, which is independent. I am prepared to answer for anything in the jurisdiction of the Lord Chancellor, provided that the hon. Gentleman takes the trouble to write to me about it, and give me particulars.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman's second question was: why has a senior judge had to write about the competence of prosecuting counsel? If the hon. Gentleman cares to write to me about that and to give me the particulars, he knows that I shall deal with it. The next two questions were: why is grade 2 work being given to grade 3 people, and is it because of shortage of funds in the CPS? Why are rape prosecutions being hawked around the Temple, and is it because the fees are not enough? Under our present arrangements, all those questions can be put to me, provided that the hon. Gentleman raises them, and I will answer them, as he knows. It does not need the paraphernalia of a department of legal administration to be set up to get somebody to answer such practical questions here in the House.<br/>
I have enjoyed listening to the arguments. The horse has been trotted out, although not to a crowded grandstand. I understand that it represents the Labour party's policy in those matters, but I must invite the House to reject the new clause.</p>

<p>My concern and my regret is the passing of the term "barrister" from a term of definition to merely one of art. For many centuries now there have been barristers in this country and the degree of barrister has been a qualification, when some years' experience have been added to it, for certain types of office, including judicial office. Many of us here, including myself and including the Law Officers, are proud to be barristers and to hold that degree.<br/>
In amendments Nos. 114 and 118 we see two of the many examples&#x2014;there will be many more to come in other legislation&#x2014;of the disappearance of the term "barrister" from our statutory law.<br/>
Amendment No. 114 goes further than merely the removal of a term or definition. It deals with the Crown prosecution service and substitutes for the words
<q>who is a barrister or solicitor</q>
the words
<q>who has a general qualification (within the meaning of section 58 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990).</q>
That involves the potential dilution of standards; the sacrifice of useful experience and qualification for no apparently good purpose.<br/>
Under the amendment, instead of the Crown prosecutor in question being a barrister or solicitor, that person could be anyone with full rights of audience in the magistrates court. So we are going down a standard, from someone with rights of audience in the Crown court to anyone with full rights of audience in the magistrates court. I wonder, first, why we have to do away with the definition of barrister and, secondly, why we have to put up with the potential dilution of standards in that way.<br/>
Amendment No. 118 deals with the important Supreme Court rule committee. As the Attorney-General knows, by virtue of clause 7 the rights of appeal to the Court of Appeal can be curtailed by the Supreme Court rule committee. Up to now it has been necessary to have on that committee two barristers and two solicitors, ensuring that the committee always has upon it a reasonable


representation of people experienced in the use of the courts, the High Court in particular, both at the preparation stage and at the advocacy stage.<br/>
Amendment No. 118 will substitute a provision which could mean that there would be no barristers on the Supreme Court rule committee. That raises the potential of a committee dealing with important matters which could lack those very people who have the greatest and most direct experience of the matters which will be considered by the committee.

<p>As always, the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile) makes a carefully prepared speech, and I shall naturally ensure that the Lord Chancellor and the Government take careful note of his points. I am sympathetic to what he said about the diminished use of the description of a barrister. The same could be said about the description of a solicitor. We are reluctant for that historic nomenclature to be less widely used and we have therefore considered the drafting of the amendments carefully and on a number of occasions. That consideration has made it clear that attempting to graft references to those who acquire new rights of audience or the right to conduct litigation on to the existing nomenclature would be less clear and considerably more cumbersome.<br/>
11 pm<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman noted and acknowledged that the nomenclature is employed, and that what matters is very much more the substance than the form. For example, clause 29 states:
<q>On the coming into force of section 25&#x2014;</q>
<q>(a) barristers shall be deemed to have been granted by the General Council of the Bar the rights of audience exercisable by barristers (in their capacity as such)".</q>
Of course, the nomenclature is by no means abandoned.<br/>
I have responded with sympathy to what the hon. and learned Gentleman said and I shall ensure that what he has said is properly taken into account.</p>

<p>Amendments Nos. 97, 98 and 100 are minor drafting amendments designed to remove an element of ambiguity that may have crept into clause 15 as a result of previous amendments.<br/>
On amendments Nos. 99 and 101, after the explanation that I gave in Committee of the purpose and effect of what we called the cab-rank rule in clause 15, concerns were expressed about the exact interpretation of subsection (3)(c). They arose in particular to the answer that I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) about rules permitting an individual advocate to refuse a case on grounds relating to the amount of remuneration offered.<br/>
Having responded to the substance of the question, which I think correctly represented the Government's view, I later felt that I had compressed the necessary context of how the new provisions would affect the process by which decisions are taken under the Bill. The Government have reconsidered whether it is possible to express more clearly not only the obligations that subsection (3)(c)(iii) will require an authorised body to place on individual advocates, but the precise remit of the advisory committee, the Lord Chancellor and the designated judges in approving or reviewing such rules. The amendments are designed to achieve that clarification.<br/>
I will begin by putting beyond doubt the Government's position. We could not and would not wish to impose a statutory obligation on a professional body as a whole or on individual advocates to undertake legal aid cases no matter what the level of remuneration payable. To do so would interfere with the careful balance struck in the provisions of the Legal Aid Act 1988 dealing with remuneration.<br/>
The essence of those provisions is to empower the Lord Chancellor to set remuneration rates that are enough, but not more than enough, to attract lawyers to do the work. Clearly, compulsion is incompatible with that. Even more importantly, compulsion would imperil the freedom of the individual practitioner and also the legal profession itself.<br/>
The Government are also concerned not to restrict the freedom of individual advocates in a number of other circumstances. It must not be possible, for example, for particular litigators to choose to send particular advocates so great a volume of legal aid work that those advocates are unable to structure their practices in the way that they


want or to undertake other work. It is important that the legislation is couched in such a way as to allow professional bodies and the new framework the maximum flexibility possible to deal with such situations, consistent with the efficient and proper administration of justice.<br/>
There is no reason to accept the argument that different requirements imposed on advocates of different backgrounds automatically constitute an unlevel playing field. The differences may be justified, necessary and fair.<br/>
That being the case, I am introducing the amendments to remove an ambiguity that some people believe exists in the current drafting of clause 15. Confusion has arisen mainly because of the phrase in subsection (3)(c)(iii):
<q>the nature of the source of any financial support".</q>
The intention behind that phrase was to differentiate between the source of any financial support narrowly considered and certain of its other characteristics. The new machinery set up under the Bill would not be obliged to strike down every professional rule that allowed an exception to the principle of non-discrimination.<br/>
The Government believe that if such a rule were framed in terms of accepting or refusing work simply on the basis of whether or not it was legally aided, it would not be acceptable. The legislation ought to require those comprising the machinery to strike it down. By contrast, the Government do not believe that the machinery ought to be able to strike down a rule that permitted an advocate to refuse a legally aided case where there are reasonable grounds for him considering that the fee is not a suitable one for him in all the circumstances, when his standing, seniority and standing will be relevant.<br/>
The test of reasonableness is an objective one, and the advocate in a given instance would have to defend his application of it.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman for confirming that the reasonable grounds for objection will be objective and not subjective, but can he confirm that, for the purposes of subsection (5), "reasonable grounds" will be a matter for the new machinery to consider?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="748827" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1990-07-25a.595.1" hansard_membership_id="8462" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18106" speakername="The Attorney-General" colnum="595" time="22:15:00">
<p>Yes, I think that that is the case. What is claimed to be a reasonable ground can be the subject of an objective test, and it will fall to those who comprise the machinery to determine whether or not it is satisfied in a given case.<br/>
Subsection (5) will provide a statutory clarification of the extent of the general principle of the nondiscrimination rule. It will now be provided that the rule shall not be taken as incompatible with the general principle if it allows the advocate or litigator to withhold his services if there are reasonable grounds for him to consider&#x2014;having regard to the circumstances of the case, the nature of his practice, or his experience and standing&#x2014;that he is not being offered a proper fee.<br/>
As I have stated, the test of reasonableness is objective and the individual will have to defend it. Although the advisory committee will be free to consider the merits of rules which go beyond the statutory requirements of clause 15(3)(c)(iii), the committee and those comprising the rest of the machinery will be precluded from finding that the

interests of the proper and efficient administration of justice require a legal practitioner to act if he is not to be properly remunerated for his services.<br/>
I have perhaps spent rather too long moving the amendment, but the matter has been of the greatest concern to the legal profession, and quite properly so. I believe that, as a consequence of the substantial consultations that have taken place, the amendment meets reasonably the concerns that have properly been expressed and I hope that it will receive the approval of the House.</p>

<p>The Attorney-General was right to state that there has been extensive consultation about the matter. I am sure that all sides of the profession, and certainly the Bar, are grateful for the extent of the consultation.<br/>
As the Government are aware, the Bar has taken a strong line with its members in relation to legal aid. It has gone so far as to say that it should be a principle that, if a barrister is offered a brief in a field in which he is sufficiently expert, at a level appropriate for his practice, even if it is a legal aid case, he should take it. Indeed, the rule at the moment is that he must take it. I understand the difficulties that can arise from such a stringent rule, but I suggest that it is a very important principle for the litigant that there should be expert advocates to do all cases requiring such expertise, whether they are privately paid or the subject of legal aid.<br/>
I am grateful to the Attorney-General for confirming that the phrase in amendment No. 101
<q>if there are reasonable grounds for him</q>
is an objective test and not subjective, and that reasonable grounds for the purposes of new subsection (5) are matters for the new machinery.<br/>
How does amendment No. 101 impinge on legal aid work? Will an advocate be able to decline a legal aid case within his field of practice simply because legal aid rates are lower than his private rates? The way in which that is answered will be extremely important for litigants in future. It may have some little influence on the way in which the machinery approaches those issues.</p>

<p>I am grateful for the hon. and learned Gentleman's comments. The consultation has been worth while. It does not follow that, because legal aid rates may be lower than some private rates, legal aid fees are not to be regarded as proper fees. All the circumstances must be considered. I have identified some that will be of general application, but all the circumstances of a case would have to be looked at and the objective test of reasonableness would then have to be determined. That would be for the new machinery.</p>

<p>Amendments Nos. 145, 146 and 147 have been tabled following an undertaking that I gave in Committee to give sympathetic consideration to an amendment tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman). The customary right of solicitors' clerks to be heard in chambers in county courts is to be recognised in statute. My amendments are a little more complicated than those tabled by the Opposition, so I shall take a short time to explain their effect.<br/>
The Government amendments avoid using the term "solicitors' clerks", which is archaic and imprecise. We prefer the concept of an individual acting on the instructions of a qualified litigator&#x2014;a description which covers three groups. First, it includes a practising solicitor as defined in clause 17(8)(b); secondly, it includes a corporate body recognised under section 9 of the Administration of Justice Act 1985; thirdly, it takes in any solicitor referred to in section 88(1) of the Solicitors Act 1974. In addition, although the class of persons being given these rights of audience will usually be employees of such qualified litigators, there will not always exist the legal relationship of master and servant between them.<br/>
The amendments additionally provide a power for the Lord Chancellor to prescribe, with the concurrence of the president of the family division and after consultation with the president of the Law Society, certain categories of family proceedings in which these rights of audience will not subsist as rights, but will be exercisable only at the discretion of the court in individual cases. The reason is that nearly all family business is heard in chambers. That includes family business where representation by non-legal staff may sometimes be inappropriate. It may not be necessary for the power to be used but, especially in the light of the Government's overall strategy for developing family jurisdiction, it is sensible to provide for the possibility of its exercise in future. We have consulted the senior judiciary before tabling these amendments.</p>

<p>Since 1972, I have been involved in advising the Institute of Legal Executives, and I therefore declare an interest. The amendment in my name and that of the right hon. and learned Member for Warley, West (Mr. Archer) deals with a question to which my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General referred.<br/>
The question is whether it should be entirely within the discretion of the judiciary to determine whether people who are members of the institute or other solicitors' clerks should be heard in the proceedings covered by the amendment. Perhaps not from time immemorial, but


certainly over many generations, it has been accepted that solicitors' clerks and, in this case, fellows of the institute should have competence and, by way of some form of prescription, the right to be heard. The amendment would reserve their position and ensure that they could be heard before a master of the Supreme Court in hearings for the assessment of damages or in chambers in any country court.<br/>
We discussed this subject in Committee. We were given to understand that the fellows of the institute and other solicitors' clerks who qualified would have the right to be heard. It appears from the Government amendment that the right is not given to them in the precise terms for which they hoped. It is of importance to the institute and to solicitors' clerks that they should be heard in chambers in the High Court or a county court. Why does a qualification appear to be imposed on their right to be heard, which has been understood for many generations?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has represented those important members of the legal profession for many years. The amendments that the Government, having taken advice, have found it possible to bring forward, give to those whom my hon. Friend assiduously represents what they reasonably need. We have listened to the representations that have been made. I believe that they now have what they reasonably need, and they certainly have that which the senior judiciary are prepared to support.<br/>
It is, of course, important for that branch of the legal profession, as it is for every other branch, to remember that they are the providers of services&#x2014;services to clients and to the courts and, through each of those services, to the administration of justice.<br/>
It has been necessary to consult the senior judiciary&#x2014;it would have been remiss of us if we had not done so&#x2014;and what is now brought forward in the amendments represents what has the support of the judiciary. I believe that it provides what is reasonably needed and what has been reasonably pressed for.</p>

<p>The amendment has been ably and succinctly moved by the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz). At the risk of further incurring the wrath of the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile), I endorse what the hon. Gentleman said. The Law Society's rules of conduct are deemed approved for courts to which solicitors already have access under the Bill, and that means magistrates courts and county courts.<br/>
There can be many substantial actions at county court level. There are many good solicitor&#x2014;advocates at county court level. The amendment provides a more logical and rational structure by extending this to the higher courts as well. There can be little difference in terms of rules of conduct between what is deemed to be approved for county courts and what at the moment happens in the higher courts under schedule 4.<br/>
This is a logical amendment. The training regulations are new. Solicitors are propping up the rungs of advocacy. As something new, it would need to be dealt with under the schedule 4 procedure, as would any amendments to the existing solicitors' rules of conduct. That seems to me to be sufficient. As for the rules of conduct, deemed approval should apply to all courts.<br/>
There are doubts about the schedule 4 procedure. They were voiced in Committee and have led to the tabling of

other amendments that relate to the powers of designated judges. If the Government were disposed to accept the amendment, it would resolve some of those doubts.</p>

<p>I assume from the use by the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) of the word "ape" that this is some kind of guerrilla warfare by himself and the hon. Member for Leominster (Mr. Temple-Morris) on behalf of the Law Society. I do not understand how the Law Society, through the hon. Member for Leicester, East, could say in Committee, "When we think about legal executives it is a matter for the new machinery," when it is prepared to say on Report, on a matter that affects the Law Society, that it wants to bypass the new machinery. We have not heard a word that would justify making the Law Society an exception to the rule that the new machinery should decide what are the appropriate rules.<br/>
I regret having to say it, but according to the speeches we have just heard, the Law Society has fallen far below the standard that it generally sets for itself. I hope that we shall hear that the Government resist the amendments stoutly and that these matters will be dealt with by the new machinery.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) either does not understand the framework of the Bill or, regrettably, has misstated it. I must therefore urge the House to resist the amendments. Their effect would be to remove the restrictions as to the extent to which the rules of conduct of the Law Society are deemed to have been properly approved for the purposes of clause 25. The society's rules of conduct would thus be deemed to have been approved in their entirety for the purposes of granting rights of audience and would not require approval or be subject to review on any grounds, including whether or not they would have been approved had they been submitted for approval under the procedure laid down in part I of schedule 4.<br/>
The amendments would therefore significantly undermine the provisions for bringing the Law Society in to the new framework for granting the rights of audience created by this part of the Bill. I was therefore somewhat astonished to hear the hon. Member for Leicester, East, who normally follows our proceedings with great care, say that his amendments would reflect the will of Parliament when the will of Parliament is to create a carefully constructed framework which his amendments would entirely undercut.<br/>
All other bodies seeking to grant rights of audience to their members are to be subject to the requirement that they possess rules of conduct which are, in the view of the Lord Chancellor and of four senior judges, appropriate in the interests of the proper and efficient administration of justice in relation to the court or proceedings in question. By excluding the rules of conduct of the Law Society from the review mechanism established by clause 30, the amendment would set the Law Society outside that framework, in that it would become the only body whose rules of conduct were not open to scrutiny by the advisory committee, the Director General of Fair Trading, the Lord Chancellor and the designated judges in respect of its members exercising rights of audience.<br/>
It is hard to find any reason why the Law Society should want these amendments to be put forward on its behalf, or to be accorded this unique privilege. Therefore., I must advise the House to resist them.</p>

<p>I am somewhat surprised at what the Solicitor-General said. I understood that the amendments dealt with the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board. I was given to understand by the Government Whip, who asked me not to speak on the Ways and Means resolution, that the Solicitor-General would speak to the amendments. They are important. They relate directly to the Solicitor-General's letter to me and, I assume, other members of the Committee about the changes that were envisaged on the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board.<br/>
The House may not be aware that this morning members of the Committee received a letter from the Solicitor-General dated 24 July 1990 about the amount of grant that is to be given to the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board. It is to be a grant of some &#x00A3;900,000. He went into great detail about exactly what the grant is to be used for. The main emphasis of the letter is the cost per square metre of the premises of the board. He told us that the central charge per square metre is likely to be in the region of &#x00A3;375, with rates&#x2014;I think that he means poll tax&#x2014;of some &#x00A3;115 per square metre and maintenance and other charges at approximately &#x00A3;40 per square metre. On the basis of those charges, a quarter of a million pounds in respect of the grant of &#x00A3;900,000 of taxpayers' money is to be paid in rent and rates&#x2014;or poll tax&#x2014;for the board.<br/>
The Solicitor-General went on to set out the conditions under which the grant is repayable. He said that the aim is that the board should become self-financing as soon as possible. That is precisely the point that I and other hon. Members raised in Committee. How much of the money will be repayable? Will it be pump-priming money&#x2014;the phrase used by the Solicitor-General in describing the &#x00A3;460,000 given to the Council for Licensed Conveyancers? When will the board be self-financing? Is there a timetable? All that he said in his letter to me and other members of the Committee was that it would be as soon as possible.<br/>
The Solicitor-General went on to say that any further money would be recouped through subsequent fees. He did not say how much the fees would be. I raise the matter because it is of concern to me. I served on the Committee that considered the Bill and on the Committee on the Legal Aid Bill. I heard the Solicitor-General go on about the need for value for money. The Government are giving

away almost &#x00A3;1 million of taxpayers' money on a scheme that has no timetable. Is it a bottomless pit? Will he come back at a later stage and say, "&#x00A3;900,000 is not enough because the rent has risen from &#x00A3;250,000 to another figure. We should like some more money, please."?<br/>
It is important that, rather than telling us that the amendments are technical, the Solicitor-General should give us an explanation of them. He also promised on an earlier amendment that he would tell us the amount that he proposes to pay to the Council for Licensed Conveyancers. He said earlier&#x2014;I respected his honesty&#x2014;that he did not know whether the latest grant of &#x00A3;130,000 would be the final grant paid to the Council for Licensed Conveyancers. I saw the hon. and learned Member for Feltham and Heston (Mr. Ground) go to speak to those in the civil service Box, and presumably he was supplied with an answer to the question. When the Solicitor-General replies, I hope that he will convey the answer to the House. If the two figures are added together. we are talking of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 million. I see that the hon. and learned Member for Feltham and Heston has moved to the civil service Box once again, so I shall continue until the necessary information is conveyed to the Minister.<br/>
About &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5 million of taxpayers' money will be paid without any conditions being set. There is no timetable for when the money will come back. We do not know what the fees will be. There is no understanding of how long the enterprise will last. We have not been told how the expenditure will be monitored. We hear, however, that value for money is the prime criterion of the legal aid fund. We wait in hope for answers from the Solicitor-General. I see that the hon. and learned Member for Feltham and Heston is about to return to his place. Let us be supplied with the figures. These important amendments should not be passed on the nod, as the Solicitor-General would wish.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz) is right to describe the amendments as technical. As I explained, the pump-priming funding of the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board amounts to about &#x00A3;900,000 a year. I summarised the contents of my letter, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. He rightly quoted from it.<br/>
The board must provide itself with suitable accommodation, and it is the sort of board that one would expect to find accommodated in London. That is a major part of the cost. That and other matters are set out in my letter.<br/>
It is not easy to say how quickly the authorised conveyancing practitioners will make application and become self-financing. As there is considerable enthusiasm on the part of several fairly large bodies to participate, I hope that the process will not be over long.<br/>
I have received such advice as can be given on the pump-priming money for the council that will represent the licensed conveyancers. It is not possible to say when the money will cease to be necessary and when the council will become self-financing. That is not entirely surprising. The hon. Member for Leicester, East has had the benefit of being a solicitor, and he is now moving into his new profession. He will appreciate that to start a new profession&#x2014;albeit a small one with about 700 members&#x2014;costs money. I have in mind the licensed conveyancers and the expenditure of &#x00A3;430,000 so far. It is the will of Parliament that this should be done. The hon. Gentleman would rightly be the first to complain if Parliament willed the end but not the means.<br/>
The same can be said of the Authorised Conveyancing Practitioners Board. The hon. Gentleman speaks of the board as if he were not in favour of it, but I do not think that that is his stance. I think that he accepts that it must be properly funded. We must look to the future to ascertain how quickly it becomes self-financing. I am sorry that I cannot assist the hon. Gentleman further, but I have done my best.</p>

<q>'( ) requiring that any authorised practitioner who is proposing to provide conveyancing services to the public by appointing a qualified person (as defined in section 34(6)) in private practice to act on its behalf in connection with the provision of those services shall only appoint such a person;</q>
<ol>
<li>(a) where it selects those persons which it appoints to provide conveyancing services on the basis of objective criteria which relate to the quality of the services available from, and the qualifications held by, those persons and their officers, employees or members;</li>
<li>(b) where such criteria are not applied in a discriminatory manner; and</li>
<li>(c) where a statement of such criteria is available on request from the authorised practitioner w all qualified persons who may wish to provide conveyancing services on behalf of that authorised practitioner.'.</li>
</ol><br/>
The amendment seeks to address the circumstances in which an authorised conveyancing practitioner&#x2014;that is, one of the banks or building societies which will be receiving almost &#x00A3;1 million per year towards their authorised board to help them out&#x2014;decides to provide conveyancing services, not through the in-house department but by instructing solicitors or licensed conveyancers in private practice to provide the conveyancing services on behalf of the authorised practitioner&#x2014;that is, the corporate conveyancer. The danger is that authorised practitioners may select only one or two solicitors in a particular area to provide conveyancing services, which could endanger the survival of other independent solicitors and licensed conveyancers.<br/>
The amendment would enable regulations to be made ensuring that authorised practitioners had to select solicitors and licensed conveyancers to act on their behalf on the basis of objective, qualitative criteria and would have to instruct any firm that fulfilled those criteria.<br/>
That reflects the present admirable practice of banks and building societies in not discriminating between one firm of solicitors and another. I hope that that practice, which is to the benefit of solicitors and the client, will be continued. Discriminatory selection by one of the new professions of one of the older professions&#x2014;not the oldest profession&#x2014;could be damaging.</p>

<p>When dealing with old professions, one should not be discriminatory but one should always be discriminating.<br/>
When we discussed this amendment in Committee, I said that I would think about it further. As I said then, the Lord Chancellor's regulations will provide that authorised practitioners must maintain satisfactory standards of competence and conduct in providing services. The


regulations make provision to ensure the efficient transaction of business. In that context we have thought about the matter.<br/>
Authorised practitioners must bear the requirements in mind when they select a qualified person to act as agent. The Lord Chancellor said recently, however, to the president of the Law Society that it would be a significant advantage to the client to know that solicitors employed as agents by authorised practitioners were fully competent to do the work under the special circumstances that will obtain. Therefore, the Government are prepared to consider whether the regulations&#x2014;this is how we think that it should be dealt with&#x2014;should contain criteria for the suitability of solicitor agents.<br/>
The existence of the criteria would be a substantial advantage to solicitors who thought they met them and that they were being unfairly or unjustifiably excluded from the lists of those who authorised practitioners choose to work for them.<br/>
I do not think that, realistically, we can look for the regulations to do more than that. Decisions on how many solicitors to use as possible agents and which ones must be matters for the commercial judgment of authorised practitioners, provided that all agents meet the standards of service that authorised practitioners will be required to uphold.<br/>
As the House will be well aware, the Lord Chancellor has undertaken to consult widely on the regulations and has already asked the president of the Law Society for his views on what criteria should be considered in respect of this matter. I hope that that is a helpful answer which will achieve, as far as possible, in practice&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am sorry if my answer was not helpful. We have done our best to think about the matter. It would not necessarily be in the interests of fair competition to attempt to regulate the way in which authorised practitioners, as private businesses, allocated their work. That is an entirely different matter from the allocation of contracts by public authorities. The Government are not likely to be better able than practitioners to guess at appropriate commercial practices. I believe that what the Lord Chancellor has offered to do in relation to the provisions will be of assistance. I am sorry that I cannot offer more than that at present.</p>

The purpose of the amendment&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am grateful to the Government Whips for moving our amendments, and if they are prepared to carry on doing so, I shall sit down, but I expect that they will change their minds.<br/>
The purpose of the amendment is to enable the period of qualification of a solicitor to count towards the total period of qualification for the purpose of receiving judicial office. I can give an example from my experience. I think that I have been a solicitor for about 30 years, almost to the day. If the Law Society were to obtain rights of audience in a higher court, and if I were to choose to be an advocate in a higher court&#x2014;I am not sure that I would&#x2014;with my considerable experience of 30 years as a solicitor, as the rules stand I would have to start all over again if I wanted to clock up 10 years to obtain judicial office. It is a personal example, but it is a good one. It


would seem a pity if I had to put in 40 years' experience in order to qualify for appointment for judicial office. That is why it would he right if rights of audience were given, and I could count the 30 years, as well as the time that I was qualified to be an advocate in the higher court.</p>

<p>I agree with what the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) said. Many solicitors are already experienced advocates. I salute the hon. Gentleman's 30 years. Many have specialties that are useful for the bench, which is different from the Bar in terms of the attributes that sometimes make good and great judges. Many solicitors also have wide experience which is useful to the bench. Advocacy experience is not always needed for the bench.<br/>
Last, but not least, one does not have to appoint Lords Justices. All that is required, under the amendment, is the largest pool of experience and, hopefully, wisdom for the main office that needs those qualities.</p>

<p>I think that there is some misunderstanding about the effect of the clause as amended. The personal example offered by the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) illustrates the importance of stressing that the Government have made special provision for those currently qualified as solicitors and who in future obtain full High Court or Supreme Court rights of audience. The deeming provisions in paragraph 3 of schedule 17 will enable those solicitors&#x2014;this will include the hon. Member for Norwood&#x2014;to count their years' standing and years' possession of rights of audience in the lower courts as if they were years' possession of higher qualifications. Solicitors qualifying in future would have to hold the higher qualification for the full period required for any particular appointment.<br/>
The amendment would have undesirable effects which I am sure the hon. Gentleman does not intend, and would put an undue burden on others who become freshly qualified, requiring them to last longer.

The reason for the amendment is almost self-evident. It is that the Parliamentary Commissioner would have jurisdiction to look at the listing of court cases except when that was done under the direction of a judge; so that if a judge directed a case to be heard on a particular day, that would be a matter of judicial decision. But other listing decisions would be administrative decisions and subject to the jurisdiction of and investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner. Since most of the complaints made by solicitors about the inefficiency of the courts relate to listing, this would be an effective remedy and provide an effective supervisory function to be exercised over the dispatch of justice. As the Government believe in efficiency and saving money, I hope that they will accept the amendment.</p>

<p>I support what my hon. Friend the Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser) has said. It is wrong that the privilege of the judges should be extended to cover a matter of this nature.

<p>I must resist these amendments. There is a misunderstanding. It is easy to say that listing is a purely administrative function, but it is not accurate to say so. The intention of the clause as a whole is to allow the Parliamentary Commissioner to investigate the administrative acts of court staff&#x2014;that is, actions necessary to carry on the administration of the courts&#x2014;but to prevent him from investigating actions taken in support of the judiciary in the judicial process. The distinction is important, as is widely recognised, if the independence of the judiciary and the judicial process is to be preserved.<br/>
I am surprised that the amendment is being pressed by the Opposition because, although it is perfectly true that listing is usually performed by court staff, it is a function carried out on behalf of the judges and under their authority. That is an important matter of principle. If listing were not accepted as a judicial function, it would theoretically be open to the Executive to influence the outcome of cases, including those to which public authorities were a party. The Executive could do that by, for example, ensuring that cases were listed before judges known to be sympathetic to a particular point of view, or simply by delaying or by bringing forward the hearing of a case. There is a much more important underlying point of principle involved than is recognised. I must resist the amendment.</p>

<p>The amendment is a good example of consultation producing better legislation. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser), who used his own deep practical experience as a solicitor to advance arguments in Committee to which I was instantly attracted. His arguments were about the disadvantages of a three-year flat period for limitation during which one had not only to issue but to serve one's process.<br/>
One has three years, or it may be six years, in which to issue process and only four months rather than the previous 12 months in which to serve it. Those with detailed knowledge of obtaining leave to serve in difficult circumstances realise that if we had taken the route suggested by the civil justice review, many detailed

administrative provisions made under rules of court would have taken much time to understand. I am not talking here about the physical process of serving, although that can be relevant.<br/>
The hon. Member for Norwood said that ordinary litigants would think that they had three years, which is the normal time for a personal injuries case, and might turn up to their solicitor in the last week or the last day or two and the solicitor would not have time to serve process. Insurance companies and others might also be less constructive and helpful than they are under the present rules, and the whole procedure would cause more trouble than it was worth. I said that we would think again.<br/>
In the meantime, we had an extremely helpful paper on the matter from the Law Commission. We have carefully examined that and have decided that the civil justice review suggestion of a period of limitation in which not only service but issue had to be carried out was outweighed by the disadvantages. We have therefore tabled the amendment. I am grateful to the members of the civil justice review for the attention that they gave to this matter.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.<br/>
I express my warm appreciation to all hon. Members, and in particular to the right hon. and learned Member for Aberavon (Mr. Morris), the hon. Member for Norwood (Mr. Fraser), the hon. and learned Member for Montgomery (Mr. Carlile), and all those from the Back Benches on both sides of the House who have contributed greatly to the success of the parliamentary handling of the Bill. The Bill takes an important place in the Government's strategy of encouraging competition and the widening of choice, particularly the widening of choice for those who are customers here for legal services. I believe that the parliamentary process has worked very well because of the assiduity of hon. Members. I hope that, in turn, they feel that the Government have listened and responded constructively in many instances, although not in as many as they would have wished, to suggestions to improve the Bill. I am grateful for all that has been done.<br/>
I realise that the Bill has occasioned a great deal of approval in the country, but also a certain amount of anxiety. Each of those reactions has been well founded. I believe that much of the anxiety has been dispelled. The Bill will take its place as a constructive measure.</p>

<p>If I am forgiven anything in this House, I am sure that I shall be forgiven my brevity on this occasion. I endorse the Attorney-General's thanks to the Committee for its consideration. I thank the Law Officers and the Lord Chancellor for their courtesy and

explanations at all times. I am especially grateful for the work done by Lord Mischcon and his team in the other place.<br/>
The improvement of the Bill was necessary because of the severe criticism levelled at it. We have not objected to extending rights of audience. I was anxious that the power should not be enshrined solely in the bosom of a political Minister, even though he be the Lord High Chancellor. Now that the judges have a new and important role, we are anxious that the aims of the Bill are carried out. I am confident that they will be. If there is any breakdown, we shall have to return to the matter later and consider it afresh, but I am sure that that will not be necessary.<br/>
One of the sad omissions from the Bill is that it has no enhancement for legal aid. The professions are concerned about profitability in that area. I fear that one day we shall have to return to that.</p>

<p>This is broadly a good Bill which will result in a more balanced profession. Perhaps all those who have been closely associated with the Bill would agree that it is as important for that which has been discussed but is not in the Bill as for that which is in the Bill following our discussions.<br/>
During its progress, the Bill has been improved in relation to consumer safeguards in conveyancing. However, the danger to the small solicitor&#x2014;other than in Scotland where that has been overtly recognised&#x2014;remains and must be monitored. We shall also have to monitor how the rights of audience work. There remains concern about the designated judges. Indeed, I had intended briefly to air that concern, had I spoken to the amendment which I did not succeed in moving a few moments ago.<br/>
I am sure that many people will carefully watch what happens with the new authorised conveyancers and the consumer interests relating to them. They should be no obstruction&#x2014;I do not suggest that they will be&#x2014;to solicitors' rights of audience in the higher courts.<br/>
I welcome the role of the ombudsman and hope that increasingly the administration of the courts will be considered by that gentleman.<br/>
I thank the Front-Bench spokesmen for both the Government and the Opposition for the spirit of courtesy that has prevailed during the passage of the Bill.</p>

<p>I thank the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General for their courtesy and co-operation. I also thank their officials, to whom all members of the Committee had access during the Committee stage, which was extremely helpful.<br/>
I make no apology for saying that I still view the future of the legal profession with trepidation. It is essential for our constitutional safeguards and for the liberties of the citizen that there should be a strong and independent Bar in England and Wales. I hope that, through the process of consultation and reasonable argument, we have ensured that when the machinery set up by the Bill comes to consider the future of the profession it, too, will bear in mind the need for that strong, independent Bar as part of our legal establishment.<br/>
With that in mind, I wish the Bill a fair wind, although I suspect that we shall argue some of the issues time and time again.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure and a privilege to address the House on the day of the appointment to Government of my hon. Friends the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton), for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Kirkhope), all of whom I am delighted to see in their rightful places on the Treasury Bench. I wish them all a long and distinguished career, and I wish them well in their new, arduous and onerous responsibilities.<br/>
I remind the House that the reason for this debate was the excellent decision of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) who in 1989, as Secretary of State for the Environment, was so concerned about the strong feeling against the existence of Humberside county council that, exceptionally, he ordered the Local Government Boundary Commission for England to consider the case for that county's abolition.<br/>
My right hon. Friend was moved to take that decision because he had received about 7,000 representations from the people of the ill-loved county of Humberside expressing their opposition. He took the view that it was right and proper for the Boundary Commission to consider whether the people concerned should revert to residing in their rightful counties of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire.<br/>
The commission's interim report did not, sadly, accord with the wishes of my constituents. Just three weeks ago, on 5 July, my hon. Friend the Member for East Lindsey (Sir P. Tapsell) initiated an Adjournment debate on the same issue. He drew attention to the guidelines given to the Boundary Commission, whose interim review published on 7 March states in paragraph 47, on page 13, that there are three strands to any consideration of boundaries. As the commission approaches the task of drafting its final report, I take this opportunity to remind it of its terms of reference, and that the three strands that it is obliged to take into account are:
<q>whether the boundary accords with the wishes of the local inhabitants;</q>
<ol>
<li>(ii) whether it reflects the pattern of community life; and</li>
<li>(iii) whether it is conducive to the effective operation of local government or any associated services."</li>
</ol><br/>
On the first test, there is no doubt that the majority of my constituents&#x2014;and, I suspect, those of Glanford and Scunthorpe and of Great Grimsby&#x2014;wish to return to the county of Lincolnshire, as that most likely to reflect
<q>the pattern of commmunity life".</q>
Lincolnshire has a natural boundary in the form of the river Humber estuary. The old country of the east riding of Yorkshire was the other county which had the river Humber as a natural boundary. The residents of south Humberside look to Lincoln and to the county of Lincolnshire as the county with which they identify.<br/>
Our experience of living under the dreaded county of Humberside over the past 15 years with regard to whether it is
<q>conducive to the effective operation of local government</q>
is that the county of Humberside fails that test. The community charge in the county of Humberside is about

&#x00A3;100 higher than it is in the county of Lincolnshire. Lincolnshire can deliver its local government services&#x2014;eduacation, social services, roads and all the ancillary services&#x2014;at a cost to the charge payer that is &#x00A3;100 less than the charge in the county of Humberside. That test proves conclusively that Lincolnshire is the county which is most conducive to the effective operation of local government for my constituents.<br/>
I remind my hon. Friend the Minister, who was kind enough to reply to the debate three weeks ago that the hatred of my constituents for the county of Humberside is virtually total. The unhappiness about the concept of Humberside which persists among many of its residents 15 years after its creation shows that now is the time to urge the Local Government Boundary Commission for England to consider the strength of local feeling. I fully accept that it is probably unlikely that my hon. Friend the Minister can add much more to what he said three weeks ago, but I hope that he will assure me and my constituents today that he will draw the attention of the Boundary Commission to the strength of feeling that I am expressing on behalf of my constituents.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will draw to the commission's attention the fact that I was elected by the people and speak for them. My voice on their behalf must be considered when the commission produces its final report. This is the appropriate time to urge the Boundary Commission to accept the challenge thrown down by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury. At this point in the sad history of the county of Humberside, people's confidence in the county has been sapped. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to pass on my views.<br/>
I am delighted to see that my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller), a Yorkshire Member, is present in the Chamber. He has told me that he would like to support my comments and I will now allow him to substantiate some of my points.</p>

<p>I wish to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) on initiating this debate and I agree with everything that he has said.<br/>
As my hon. Friend pointed out, my hon. Friend the Member for East Lindsey (Sir P. Tapsell) initiated a debate on this subject on 5 July. He spoke in similar terms and argued for the abolition of Humberside, for the creation of a new county of East Yorkshire and for the return of South Humberside to Lincolnshire. The fact that we have had a second debate so soon after the first, shows the strength of feeling about this.<br/>
Both debates have been initiated by hon. Members representing constituencies south of the river Humber. Lest it be thought that the strength of feeling is greater in the areas that were formerly unashamedly in Lincolnshire, I remind the House that the Local Government Boundary Commission for England found that the strength of feeling&#x2014;or outrage as I would describe it&#x2014;about their incorporation in Humberside is even greater among those who live to the north of the estuary.<br/>
Although I represent a constituency in West Yorkshire which is quite a long way from Humberside, I speak as a native Yorkshireman and a member of the Yorkshire Society. I have no trouble in understanding why the


changes that came about in 1974 have never been accepted. Those who drew purely artificial lines on the map to create this concoction cannot easily be forgiven.<br/>
Some think that the problem of assuaging traditional loyalties could be resolved either if Humberside changed its name, although it is difficult to think of an alternative, or if postal addresses were altered. That argument is similar to that put by those who argued for the new administrative counties at the time of the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. They claimed that there was no problem because people would still be able to retain their traditional counties. Most of those on the north side of the estuary still feel themselves to be Yorkshire people, but know that something significant has been taken from them by the creation and continuation of a new administrative county for which they feel no affection and little, if any, loyalty.<br/>
The Boundary Commission considered issues under the two heads of convenience of administration and traditional loyalties as well as patterns of community life. On the first, it concluded that a reversion to more traditional boundaries would be
<q>no better able to provide effective and convenient local government than the present Humberside County Council.</q>
At no point did the commission suggest that local government would be any worse. Not surprisingly, it found that there were too many imponderables to make a judgment as to whether there would be an improvement or a deterioration. The main issue, therefore, related to the transitional inconvenience of a further disruption in local government.<br/>
When it comes to the preferences of the people as a whole rather than those of people with a stake in the status quo, there is no doubt about how they feel. When asked for their opinion, 62 per cent. of all residents wanted a change from the present county. On the north bank, 64 per cent. stated a wish to see some sort of Yorkshire solution. Many, like me, felt that the answer could be the creation of a new East Yorkshire county, including Selby, although that issue has not exercised most people's minds at this stage. Curiously, a reason why the Boundary Commission seemed to come down against that option was that the present boundary between York and Selby is unsatisfactory. Surely, more urgent attention could be given to that matter if necessary, rather than leaving it until the Humberside issue has been resolved.<br/>
The Boundary Commission rather airily dismissed the deep feelings of people for Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, stating:
<q>Such loyalties should be able to co-exist with support for Humberside as an administrative unit.</q>
Unfortunately, that statement is out of touch with reality. After many years, the survey carried out on behalf of the Boundary Commission shows that only just over a third of the people of Humberside would support the retention of the county. That being so, I find an element of perversity in the Commission's conclusion, especially bearing in mind the strong lead given by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), the former Secretary of State for the Environment. I accept that it is difficult for any group of people to reach one decision and then to come to a contrary one.<br/>
Like my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes, I appreciate that my hon. Friend the Minister cannot say anything substantive today. I realise that the law does not allow my right hon. Friend the Secretary of

State to reach a conclusion off his own bat. Rather, he must endorse or refuse one presented to him by the Boundary Commission. I can only say, with a great deal of support from those who still think of themselves as Yorkshire or Lincolnshire people, that I hope even now that there will be a recognition that a decision to go back to something like the ancient Yorkshire and Lincolnshire which existed before 1974 would be enthusiastically applauded not only in the present Humberside but far outside the existing boundaries of that unloved teenager.</p>

<p>It was no surprise to me that my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes (Mr. Brown) chose this subject. I have been aware of his strong feelings on the issue. He has never been one to be shy about making his views known, particularly when his constituents are concerned. He set out his case against the present county structure with his usual skill and exuberance, and he was supported in that by some additional points by my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Waller), who gave his views from a slightly different perspective&#x2014;from West Yorkshire. On 5 July I answered a debate initiated by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lindsey (Sir P. Tapsell). I recall that my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Cleethorpes intervened on that occasion as well.<br/>
It might be appropriate if I set out a little of the background, because the present boundary review takes place in a more general framework. I shall then comment more specifically on the Humberside review.<br/>
Until 1972, the review of local government boundaries was somewhat haphazard and intermittent. There were periods of great change interspersed with periods when little happened. In 1972, it was thought that a new system would be appropriate. There was general agreement that it should not be possible for the Government of the day to make changes as they saw fit, because that would introduce the temptation to change electoral boundaries for political convenience.<br/>
I believe that Governor Gerry of Massachussetts was the first politician who fell victim to the temptation to alter boundaries to suit his political ends. I understand that he designed a constituency which looked rather like a salamander. Someone thought that it should be called a gerrymander, so he gave his name to a political system and it passed into our language.<br/>
In 1972, the then right hon. Member for Crosby, the late Graham Page, wisely wished to protect his successors as Ministers for Local Government from the temptation to follow in Governor Gerry's steps. He designed a system which ensures that changes can be made when they are desirable for
<q>effective and convenient local government.</q>
Those words appear in the Local Government Act 1972, which also imposes constraints upon the Secretary of State of the time in initiating such changes.<br/>
Effective and convenient local government has three components, to which reference has been made&#x2014;first, whether the proposed boundaries reflect the wishes of the majority of the local residents; secondly, whether the alterations would provide more efficient services at county or district level; thirdly, whether they would better reflect the pattern of community life.<br/>
Under the Local Government Act 1972, the Local Government Boundary Commission for England was set up. It is a small, expert body of people who review local government boundaries throughout the country and form a view of what will make for effective and convenient local government. The legislation provides for the commission to take the Government's views into account. That is done by way of Department of the Environment circulars. The legislation also provides for local people to be given every opportunity to have their say, both before the proposals are submitted to the Secretary of State and afterwards.<br/>
A very important feature of the system is that the Secretary of State can only work within the framework of the commission's recommendations. He can either accept its recommendations or reject them. He can accept them with some modifications, but what he cannot do, and has no power to do, is to devise changes of his own and come up with something quite different from the commission's recommendations.<br/>
My hon. Friend mentioned the role played by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) on Humberside. The guidelines for the first Humberside review laid down that the abolition of the county council or any principal authority should not be recommended. However, after the Commission recommended that there should not be a major change on Humberside, a large number of people took issue with the report. Over 7,000 representations were received. My hon. Friend mentioned that figure.<br/>
In the light of that response, my right hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury decided that the commission should have a further look at the question, without the previous constraints. He therefore directed the comission to carry out a further review and to take a

completely fresh look at the question. It was able to consider the abolition of Humberside county council and the division of the county in whatever way seemed appropriate, and that remains the position. As I told my hon. Friend the Member for East Lindsey earlier this month, we now await the commission's report on its further review.<br/>
We know that the commission is carrying out careful and thorough studies of all aspects of the question. It has told me that its consideration of all the questions involved is proving somewhat more difficult than expected. Nevertheless, I should prefer the commission to take a careful, considered and painstaking look at every aspect of these possible boundary changes rather than trying to meet an artificial deadline.<br/>
My hon. Friends know that the Government cannot express an opinion at this stage. I have listened carefully to what they have said today and I shall draw the Boundary Commission's attention to the debate. It is right that it should be made aware of expressions of opinion in the House.</p>

<p>Yes, I have read the report of that debate, and Lord Hesketh sent the report of the debate to the Boundary Commission, so the chairman and the members of the commission are also aware of it.<br/>
At this time I can express no views on the merits of the case, but I await the commission's report with interest. In conclusion, I repeat that I will ensure that the commission is made aware of the views that have been expressed today.</p>
