<p>When the Minister "soon" meets the chairman of British Railways, will he emphasise to him that he means to start improving British Railways on the principle of the retention of all present routes and services, including the Woodhead cross-Pennine route? Will the Minister also encourage British Railways by authorising more investment, especially in commuter services in the Leeds-Bradford area, which has been starved in comparison with London and the South-East?

<p>The Government certainly appreciate the importance of British Rail and support it. The Woodhead cross-Pennine route is a freight service, the responsibility for which lies with the chairman of British Rail and does not come to me. With passenger services the responsibility and decision come to me, and I have informed the chairman that we would be totally opposed to the massive cuts that are mentioned in the corporate review.</p>

<p>Is it not sound policy that British Rail should exploit to the full the commercial potential of its existing assets? When the Minister meets the chairman, will he encourage him to develop the services&#x2014;modestly, but on a better basis&#x2014;at Alnmouth station in Northumberland, where there is considerable potential for improvement?</p>

<p>I shall certainly look into the specific matter raised by the hon. Gentleman. On the general point, I agree with him; I believe that the energy crisis underlines the importance of the railway system.</p>

<p>When the Minister meets the chairman, will he encourage him to end the penny-pinching restrictions that are causing British Rail to reduce the services between Glasgow and Girvan, a line that has been developing over the last few years? If there are any difficulties with oil, the Minister might encourage the chairman to introduce steam trains on that line, and others in Scotland.</p>

<p>The chairman will have heard what the hon. Member said. As I understand the present position, five trains will be cancelled on that line&#x2014;only on Saturdays, and only in the winter months&#x2014;as a means of saving fuel.</p>

<p>When my right hon. Friend next meets the chairman, will he discuss with him the rapidly declining

quality of the Aberdeen-Inverness railway, which passes through my constituency, and which is of major importance to the many thousands of Service men based there and to the students who have to pursue their studies elsewhere? In particular, will he consider establishing a proper link with the inter-city routes from the North-East of Scotland to the south?</p>

<p>At the risk of making the Minister's next meeting with the chairman a very long one, may I ask him also to raise with the chairman the forecasts which make it plain that within the next few months British Rail will go through the ceiling on the public service obligation grant and that the figures for future years are unrealistic? Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that, unless he revises the ceilings, the only short-term alternative for British Rail is a sharp increase in fare, at the very time when, if the energy crisis means anything, we should be making public transport more attractive and not more expensive?</p>

<p>I do not accept that. The chairman has made it clear that he wants and intends to live within the cash limits. The cut in the PSO for 1980&#x2013;81 was about &#x00A3;22 million, of which &#x00A3;13 million was decided by the previous Government.</p>

<p>Does the Minister accept that the Scottish area of British Rail is one of the least reliable and punctual of all the areas in the British Rail federation, and that that is largely because of the clapped-out locomotives that, unfortunately, the staff have to use there? Will he authorise the chairman to increase the investment on British Rail in Scotland, to make sure that the services improve, and particularly to electrify the line to take account of the shortage of diesel oil that is likely in the next 20 years?</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. The chairman accepts that it is important&#x2014;I believe that this is common policy on both sides of the House&#x2014;that British Rail's freight operations should run at a break-even point. That is certainly the policy of this Government. It is one that we shall pursue.</p>

<p>As the Minister has met the chairman since the production of the British Rail corporate review, will he make clear what options he would regard favourably to meet British Rail's problems&#x2014;increasing prices, reducing manpower or selling off assets&#x2014;as he has reduced the option of closing lines?</p>

<p>The options that are open are under consideration at present. Clearly, one of British Rail's most important aims must be to improve the productivity of the system. I believe that this is recognised by the chairman. British Rail has made proposals to the unions, and they are under consideration at present. I believe that they are important for ensuring the future of the railway system.</p>

<p>When he meets the chairman, will my right hon. Friend put to him that London commuters, who have recently suffered yet another substantial increase in the cost of their season tickets, are rather more concerned with reliability and punctuality than with frequency of service, and that they would willingly accept a reduced spring timetable, a reduced number of trains, if they could rely on those trains running as advertised and on time?</p>

<p>I am willing to talk to the chairman about that. The Government have already made clear that we shall have a major re-examination of the efficiency of commuter services in the South-East. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission will be given that task, which will be carried out this year.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend give the House a little more detail about what he will say to the chairman about productivity, bearing in mind that Sir Peter Parker said at the end of last year that British Rail had not even begun to get it right yet? Would not the whole question be much easier if there were one confederation of trade unions covering the railway industry, or is that just wishful thinking?</p>

<p>I do not know whether it is wishful thinking. It is certainly not something that the Government or I can influence. What my hon. Friend says is absolutely correct. As the chairman has said, productivity is the rock upon which British Rail's future is based. British Rail's operating costs are 70 per cent. labour. This underlines the importance of the proposals made by British Rail to the unions, and the importance of their being accepted.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman appreciate the deep concern felt throughout the country about the arbitrary delay in such schemes, without any formal announcement by his Department?

<p>I do not think that there are that many arbitrary delays taking place. I have indicated that only one scheme listed to start last year has not started, and that is because of a legal challenge.

<p>My answer was about 1979&#x2013;80. There is only one scheme listed in the Supply Estimates that will not start, and that is because we must await a High Court hearing. It is a scheme that we are anxious to begin&#x2014;the widening of the M1 in Hertfordshire. There is no spare money in the programme; there will not be the under spend that has occurred in previous years.</p>

<p>I accept that the accident record of motorways is much better than that of other major roads.

<p>Will the Minister give an undertaking that before he acts on the report of the Armitage inquiry the issue will be debated in the House?

<p>I can give an assurance that no decision on the issue of lorry weight will be made before the House has had an opportunity to debate that important issue. The hon.

<p>Does the Minister realise that the assumptions to which he has referred take account of the noise of vehicles? Is he aware that of the mix of ordinary private vehicles and heavier lorries the latter are noisier? Does he agree that the Armitage inquiry should pay more attention to the noise generated by heavy lorries, especially on motorways in urban areas? Is he aware that some bedrooms are no more than 50 ft. away from the motorway? That is one of the many reasons why heavier lorries should not be allowed.</p>

<p>The lights on motorways make a substantial difference to accident levels, which is an end in itself, but that in turn leads to substantial savings in cost.

<p>In the absence of my right hon. Friend the Lord Privy Seal, I shall reply.<br/>
We naturally greatly regret the incident to which the right hon. Gentleman refers. I understand that police investigations are in hand. My right hon. Friend the Lord Privy Seal gave a full account of progress on the ceasefire and preparations for the elections in this House on Wednesday 16 January. I have nothing to add to that and to the remarks that I made during the debate on the two Southern Rhodesia orders the following day.</p>

<p>I thank the Minister. Because we all want elections that are free and fair, we deplore this act of violence and, indeed, all other breaches of the ceasefire, from whatever source they come. Whoever turns out to be responsible&#x2014;and I understand that police investigations are taking place&#x2014;does not the Minister agree that this event reinforces the warnings and complaints against the use of undisciplined auxiliaries made by Mr. Sithole and Mr. Nkomo in Salisbury only this weekend? Can the Minister assure the House that these auxiliaries are under proper control and are being effectively monitored by the Commonwealth military observers? Will he now reaffirm the Lancaster House agreement that breaches

of the ceasefire should in the first instance be dealt with by the armed forces&#x2014;Rhodesian and Patriotic Front&#x2014;to which the malefactors are thought to belong?<br/>
Will the Government now instruct the Governor that in those circumstances, when the security forces have to be used it will be the regular forces and not the auxiliaries that are deployed?<br/>
Finally, will the Minister take this opportunity of refuting the very damaging report in <i>The Times</i> today that Mr. Mugabe may be banned from entering Rhodesia owing to unresolved differences over the release of detainees? Such a ban would be a disastrous error of judgment.</p>

<p>The specific incident to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, as I have said, is under police investigations. I do not think that there is any more that I can add to that.<br/>
The auxiliaries, as the right hon. Gentleman well knows&#x2014;we discussed this last week&#x2014;are, of course, accountable, like all the other forces&#x2014;Rhodesian security forces, the police and the Patriotic Front forces&#x2014;to the Governor. In that sense they are monitored. If any incidents are reported with regard to their activities&#x2014;there have been some&#x2014;they are reported to the Ceasefire Commission and investigated.<br/>
Breaches of the ceasefire are part of the same question. All these forces are responsible to the Governor for ensuring that the ceasefire is observed. I remind the right hon. Gentleman that the Governor's primary responsibility is to call out the police first, and it is only when the police are unable to deal with the situation that he can call upon the Rhodesian security forces, or, for that matter, the Patriotic Front forces, to help him to deal with the situation and to bring matters under control.<br/>
As for Mr. Mugabe, I understand that he hopes to return very soon. There is one very serious point and one very serious obligation, which I believe&#x2014;I am sure that the whole House will agree&#x2014;is of very great importance if this agreement is to succeed. At present,Mr. Mugabe detains no fewer than 71 people in Mozambique. If the Lancaster House agreement is to be fulfilled, it is singularly important that he should undertake


his part of the agreement and his obligation by releasing the detainees. I hope that he does that this week.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may pursue the Minister a little further on the question of the detainees. Of course they should be released, but is the Minister confident that these detainees are in the charge of Mr. Mugabe and not in the charge of the Mozambique Government, in whose territory, certainly, they are? What efforts have been made to establish that point? The Minister mentioned a figure of 71. That is an important number, but can he say how many detainees there still are inside Rhodesia itself&#x2014;those who are still being held under martial law and other legislation? I think that it is time that we had the two figures, as it were, brought together.</p>

<p>The detainees in Mozambique are people who were detained by Mr. Mugabe and his ZANU movement, but they are detained in Mozambique prisons, so there is a joint responsibility by both the Mozambiquan Government and Mr. Mugabe. I should say that we are therefore making very strong representations both to the Mozambiquan Government
and to Mr. Mugabe. We hope that they will both be able to respond.<br/>
I should also add that in many other respects the Mozambiquan Government have been very co-operative in respect of this agreement.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that while the Governor is troubled on all sides by those who seek to gain political ground by the use of violence, many Conservative Members feel that the Governor has been remarkably judicious and even-handed in the weeks during which he has been in Salisbury? Secondly, will the Government continue to resist calls for British troops to play a more active part in maintaining peace in Rhodesia?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend, and I am quite sure that the Governor will be. Bearing in mind the extremely difficult situation with which he deals, he will be the first to accept that complaints are coming in from all sides, and he regards this as part of his job. I do not think that he would mind

my saying that he has broad shoulders, both physically and metaphorically, to enable him to deal with this very difficult situation. The House should not underestimate the achievements of the Governor and his team over the last five weeks. They are quite remarkable.<br/>
As for British troops, as my hon. Friend knows, we make a substantial contribution to the monitoring force. The Governor has already stated that in his view all component parts of the monitoring force have fulfilled an outstanding task in the last five weeks. There is no question but that their task is a monitoring task and not a peacekeeping task. There is no suggestion that any British troops should be involved in peacekeeping as opposed to monitoring.</p>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman satisfied that the Governor is complying with the agreement in the following respects: in allowing the undisciplined auxiliaries, with their personal allegiances, to act as part of the security forces; in allowing Walls&#x2014;as he has been doing&#x2014;to publish communiqu&#x00E9;s without the Governor's oversight and vetting; in making clear in public comments&#x2014;again, he has been doing this&#x2014;that he hopes that Robert Mugabe does not win; and in accepting South African intervention, particularly in view of the Lord Privy Seal's words during Question Time on, I think, 18 December, that there could be no question of any foreign intervention in Rhodesia?</p>

<speech hansard_id="1713927" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-01-23a.434.1" hansard_membership_id="7558" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17448" speakername="Mr. Luce" colnum="434" time="">
<p>I am a little surprised by the one-sided nature of those questions. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Of course, I accept that they are all valid questions, but I am slightly surprised by their one-sided nature.<br/>
All the parties agreed at Lancaster House that the auxiliaries would come under the authority of the Rhodesian forces and, in turn, of the Governor, once he arrived. That is the position now. As I have already stated several times previously&#x2014;last week and today&#x2014;any incidents that are reported with regard to the auxiliaries or, for that matter. any other forces&#x2014;and we are at present deeply disturbed by the number of incidents that have emanated from the ZANU forces&#x2014;are reported to the Ceasefire Commission.<br/>
General Walls is accountable, and all his actions are accountable, to the Governor. At the end of the day, all these forces are accountable to the Governor. That is the essential prerequisite to success.<br/>
As for the South African situation, we made it plain before the Governor arrived that there would be no external intervention. As we discussed very fully last week, the Governor has announced, with the agreement of my right hon. and noble Friend the Foreign Secretary, that there should be a small contingent of South African troops within the vicinity of Beitbridge, whose sole purpose is to defend that bridge. We have been over the argument for this, and I gave the reasons very carefully last week.</p>

<p>Given that it is enormously difficult to protect people from assassination, can the Minister assure the House that particular efforts are being made to protect the major personalities, who are obvious targets in the election? Given that two wrongs do not make a right and that the detention of people in Mozambique cannot be justified by the argument that some are detained in Rhodesia, will the hon. Gentleman say what right of appeal exists for those still in detention in Rhodesia? What direct contact has he had with the Government of Mozambique in regard to the 71 persons in detention there?</p>

<p>It was agreed at Lancaster House that the Governor would have responsibility for doing his best to ensure that during the election all the political candidates were as secure as possible. Naturally, the Governor is deeply concerned by what happened last night. His major obligation is to undertake to give the best security possible to the main political leaders in Rhodesia. That he has undertaken to do.<br/>
I apologise to the right hon. Member for Stepney and Poplar (Mr. Shore) for not giving a complete answer to his original question about detainees, whether in Mozambique or Salisbury. The Governor has released the 81 detainees who were detained under ministerial orders in Rhodesia when he arrived. The final lot were released during the course of last week. He is at the same time reviewing the cases of all those who might be

affected by the amnesty ordinance that was passed in Rhodesia.<br/>
As for martial law detainees, which may have been in the back of the right hon. Gentleman's mind, martial law will be brought to an end just as soon as all the parties are prepared to conform with the ceasefire. We are in daily touch with the Mozambiquan Government, the President and his Ministers, as well as with ZANU, on the question of the detainees in Mozambique.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. It is a natural characteristic to focus on the problems rather than on the progress that has been made. My hon. Friend is right in stating that we should not underestimate the remarkable achievements of the last few weeks, whether we are talking about progress on the ceasefire, the normalising of relations between Rhodesia and the surrounding States, the progress on refugees, freedom of the individual, electoral progress achieved by the Election Commissioner, or economic progress.</p>

<p>Is it not clear that the Governor has shown unmistakable bias against ZANU and that the total evidence indicates that he is going out of his way to ensure than ZANU is inhibited in the election campaign?

<p>I refute totally any suggestion that the Governor is biased. It is my view and, I think, the view of those who have observed him at work, that the achievements of the Governor and his team over the past few weeks have been terrific. He should be thanked for everything that he is doing in that respect. The hon. Gentleman may have his complaints&#x2014;he has every right to raise them&#x2014;but participants in the election, now that they are in Salisbury, have every right to make their anxieties known through the machinery that is available&#x2014;the Ceasefire Commission, the Election Council, or the Governor himself&#x2014;which all the leaders are in the process of doing. The Governor's doors are open. He is anxious to fulfil the letter and the spirit of the Lancaster House agreement.</p>

<p>Is it true that there are still many thousands of ZANU guerrillas out in the bush and that no serious attempt appears to have been made to persuade them to come in to the collecting points?

<p>About 21,600 Patriotic Front forces have now assembled in the 14 assembly places. That is a remarkable achievement in itself. On the other hand&#x2014;I think that this is the point that my hon. Friend is making&#x2014;there are still substantial numbers of forces, particularly ZANLA forces, who have infringed the ceasefire agreement, who have come across from Mozambique and who are still operating, particularly in the eastern parts of Rhodesia. This is a very serious point. It challenges the whole agreement. We hope that, very quickly indeed, Mr. Mugabe will bring his forces under control.</p>

<p>Surely, the Minister will agree that it is a cause of concern that there are deteriorating relations between British troops enforcing the ceasefire and some of those who have come out of the bush.

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman not aware that there are increasing complaints about auxiliary forces and indiscipline? What steps is the Governor taking to summon Bishop Muzorewa, whose forces are mainly involved, to make sure that these people are taken out of sensitive areas? Will he publish, as early as possible, the reports so far of the Ceasefire Commission so that we can see the evidence? Will he accept from me that the evidence that we read in the press in this country&#x2014;we have no other source of information&#x2014;is that emanating from the Governor's office, and that it takes the form of a continuing bias and continuing statements against Mr. Mugabe? If the hon.

<p>I have already said that the Governor has broad shoulders and can take this. He has been criticised by all participants as well as being praised by many sources. That is perhaps an indication of his impartial approach to the whole problem. I am interested that the hon. Gentleman focuses solely on the auxiliaries. I have already told the House that there have been a number of reports of incidents caused by auxiliaries that are already being investigated, but the largest bulk of reports of incidents


emanates from ZANLA. This is the serious aspect of the problem.<br/>
We want all sides to participate successfully in the agreement. If the hon.

<p>We acknowledge that progress has been made, but the Government would be unwise to minimise the growing concern&#x2014;there is plenty of evidence of it inside and outside Rhodesia&#x2014;about stability and the way in which the ceasefire arrangements have been carried out. The Commonwealth military observer forces have a crucial part to play. Those forces and units, regular or irregular, that are observed by them are clearly under a form of scrutiny that limits their freedom of action. That is important. Has the hon.

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his reference to the importance of the work of the monitoring force, which is, of course, fully stretched because its task is extremely difficult.

soldiers, with other component parts. They are doing a marvellous job. I think that it is up to the Governor&#x2014;he is the man on the spot, and in a position to judge&#x2014;and if it becomes necessary to ask for additional assistance, I am sure that he will feel quite free to ask us to provide it.</p>

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement about the Council of Agriculture Ministers' meeting in Brussels on 21&#x2013;22 January, at which I represented the United Kingdom, with my hon. Friend the Minister of State.<br/>
The Council had a general discussion on the proposals on milk and sugar which the Commission put forward in December. The Commission confirmed that it would be changing these proposals and that new proposals, together with proposals on the price fixing, would be made on 6 February. I stated the urgent need to achieve savings in expenditure on the CAP but pointed out that these savings must be made in a way that did not discriminate against any one particular country.<br/>
In this regard, I confirmed that the United Kingdom Government would not agree to any co-responsibility levy which provided exemptions to exclude from the levy a substantial percentage of producers in other member States. I also confirmed our objection to the original proposals for a sugar quota which resulted in a larger cut for Britain than for any other country. The Commission confirmed that it would be reviewing the sugar quotas, taking into account the much higher production of the United Kingdom during 1979.<br/>
I expressed the necessity to confirm the difference between savings in expenditure and increases in income obtained from levies. On the Commission's original proposals, in 1980 85 per cent. of what were described as savings would in fact be increases in income derived from levies.<br/>
In a discussion on sheepmeat, I strongly objected to the fact that the French Government continued to disregard both the treaty and the findings of the European Court. The Italian Presidency and the Commissioner pointed out the damage that this was doing to the Community and urges the French Government to comply with the decisions of the European Court so that progress on a

permanent sheepmeat regime could be made in tolerable climate.<br/>
The French Minister was asked during the meeting to confer with the Commissioner on legal interim measures that would enable the French Government to comply immediately with the Court's decision. After discussions with the Commission, the Commissioner had to report that the French Government were unwilling to pursue any of these legal interim measures that were available to them.<br/>
The French pressed for a commitment on common measures which would include intervention. I pointed out that seven member States had opposed intervention and that we remained totally opposed to any intervention within a sheepmeat r&#x00E9;gime. At the end of the discussion, the Italian President expressed his regret that the French Government were unwilling to agree to comply with the law and stated that it was now the Commissioner's duty to take every action available to safeguard the treaty. The Commissioner informed me of the further legal action being taken against the French, and I presume that, with the instruction of the Presidency and the general views of the Council, the Commission will now seek an interim injunction from the European Court against the French illegal actions.<br/>
In a discussion of additional support measures for wine outside the agreed wine package, I pointed out the great expense of these measures and the lack of need for them. Therefore, no progress was made towards any decision on this question.<br/>
There was a discussion on certain proposals which are part of the structural package. I maintained the United Kingdom's reserve on the whole of this package and pointed out the difficulties that were likely to be involved in funding such a package.</p>

<p>The House is obliged to the right hon. Gentleman for that full statement. With regard to milk and sugar, I am pleased to note that fresh consideration is being given to the original Commission proposals. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will continue to take a firm stand on both these issues, and particularly on the unfairness of the sugar quotas against Britain.<br/>
Regarding sheepmeat, will the right hon. Gentleman agree that the French tactics must not be allowed to succeed? Their aim is to delay recognition of the European Court's decision until they can get a favourable sheepmeat regime for themselves in barters and deals on the United Kingdom budgetary problem, on fisheries policy and on the sugar quotas.<br/>
Am I right in thinking that, even if the Commission seeks an interim injunction from the Court in order to make France comply, it will still take some weeks, and by then the Minister will be into the agricultural price review with the intransigent French trying to blackmail him and the Council on sugar, milk and so forth? Will the right hon. Gentleman take it, therefore, that we hope that he makes sure that the French do not succeed in their goal?<br/>
What is the Council's present view on shipments of grain and subsidised butter going to the Soviet Union, and what is Her Majesty's Government's policy on this issue, since it must stick in the gullet of the British taxpayer that he is subsidising butter mountains in the Common Market and the beneficiary is the aggressor in Afghanistan?</p>

<speech hansard_id="1713949" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-01-23a.443.0" hansard_membership_id="2341" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30690" speakername="Mr. Walker" colnum="443" time="">
<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman, and I welcome his support on the milk and sugar questions. The points which he made are totally valid. In almost the very words which he used, I expressed to the Council of Ministers that, in my judgment, the French Government were pursuing a tactic of trying to create a major crisis in the Community in the hope that, in order to avoid such a crisis, major concessions would be made to the French viewpoint on sheep-meat. If the Council followed that course, it would, I beleive, be disastrous for the future of the Community.<br/>
I think that the important feature of this Council meeting, perhaps more than any other, is that it was clearly seen that this was not a dispute between the British Government and the French Government but was a dispute between the whole of the Community and the French Government. It is, in fact, the whole Community which is being threatened by these tactics, and if they were allowed to succeed and bring benefit to France, that would be against the interests of the Community as a whole.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman asked about the time scale. The application for interim measures can only be taken once the two cases which the Commission is bringing against France are in the Court. One action is already in the Court. The second, which is on the levy, will be in the Court within seven days. If an application for interim measures is then immediately brought, the total time scale will be three to four weeks before the Court could actually decide and order the interim measures.<br/>
There was no discussion on butter, although there was a discussion on grain, on which the Council agreed to comply totally with the insistence of the Council of Foreign Ministers at their meeting that there be no replacement by the Community as a whole of the American cereals going to the Soviet Union.<br/>
With regard to butter, it has been the consistent position of this Government and still so remains that it is appalling for taxpayers throughout Western Europe to provide massive subsidies for butter when the Community has been selling butter to the Soviet Union at 25p a pound which was sold within the Soviet Union at 110p a pound. We as a Government are totally opposed to the continuation of such trade.</p>

<p>Will the Minister agree that it is very difficult for a British Minister of Agriculture to persuade his counterparts to agree to anything in Brussels these days? In view of the seriousness of the situation, will the right hon. Gentleman agree that the Commission should reform the common agricultural policy if we are to save a great deal of money?<br/>
With regard to the export of lamb, does the Minister agree that the ban will not be lifted this year? Because of the serious plight of the sheep producers, will he consider increasing the deficiency or guarantee payment at the price review this year?<br/>
I am sure that the dairy and sugar producers in Britain are pleased that he is taking a firm stand on their behalf on Europe. Will the Minister say what are the latest developments on aid to marginal farmers in Britain?</p>

<p>It must be recognised that there is an existing CAP that has a


budget of &#x00A3;8 billion. That is of considerable social and economic consequence to many of the member States. A radical and dramatic reform of that policy is not possible without causing considerable social and economic disruption within Europe. It is not for the Commission to reform the CAP; it is for the member countries collectively to do so. A major reform is necessary, but, for obvious reasons, it is unlikely to take place within a matter of weeks or months.<br/>
On the question of sheepmeat, this year I believe that the French will comply with the law and that there will be free entry to the market. I do not believe that after a Court decision, five months delay and an interim injunction, the French Government, in the face of opposition from all member States in the Community and the Commission, will pursue their action.<br/>
I enjoyed perhaps less than anybody the frustrations of the past few months. I am sure that in the interests of Europe it has been right to work through the Commission, to go through the right procedures, and to rally the whole of the Community against the French action. I hope that within the next month or two we shall succeed in opening the market.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) knows of, and has personally welcomed, the substantial increases made in hill farm subsidies. By that act alone, we have shown that it is our intention to ensure that sheep producers in Britain do not suffer.</p>

<p>I congratulate my right hon. Friend on being so firm about the co-responsibility levy for milk, the unfair suggestion about sugar and the other negotiations on French lamb, in all of which the House will support him in taking a strong and robust line.<br/>
With regard to the export of grain from Britain or Europe to Russia, I urge him to consider the large contracts that are already signed and under way with Poland and other Iron Curtain countries, and to ensure that Russia does not import excessive amounts through the back door.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his remarks on milk, sugar and sheepmeat. It is the policy of all Community countries that any exports

of grain to countries such as Poland should be in line with the traditional volume of exports that have taken place to those countries. The Government believe that that is a right decision. Continuing sensible trade arrangements with these countries&#x2014;but not on the basis of increasing exports to allow them to assist the Soviet Union&#x2014;is the correct policy.</p>

<p>Surely it is clear to the Minister that the French intend to protect the income of their lamb producers at all costs. They will not submit to any measures that do not provide that income in the future.<br/>
Will the right hon. Gentleman expand on paragraph 8 of his statement, which is interesting but does not tell us very much?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1713955" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-01-23a.446.1" hansard_membership_id="2341" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30690" speakername="Mr. Walker" colnum="446" time="">
<p>I take the opportunity of the hon. Member's remarks to point out categorically to the House that the decision of the Court and the position of the treaty do not demand that sheep producers in France should suffer a drop of income. They have a perfectly legitimate, legal right under the treaty to provide aids to their sheep producers, as long as there is not a sheepmeat regime, that will maintain their incomes. The claim that the French Government are taking such action to defend their producers because there is no other way is a total myth.<br/>
The talks that took place yesterday between the Commission and the French Government were for the purpose of telling the French Government of the methods that they could employ, at their expense, to defend their sheep producers. I do not believe that the French will continue to persist in violating the treaty and the European Court's decision. It is not in the interests of their sheep producers to do so. I believe that they are taking this action to provide a bargaining position within Europe, and I intend to see that they do not succeed.<br/>
Paragraph 8 of my statement refers to structure packages. It is a series of regional aids to various parts of the Community that affects a whole range of countries, including parts of Britain. The totality of that package is expensive, and, in our judgment, is not cost effective in its present form.</p>

<p>Will the Minister accept, on behalf of my farmers, my thanks for his extremely firm stand on the co-responsibility levy? Can he go further and say what will happen in four weeks after the interim injunction is passed? If the French do not comply, what are the means by which the interim injunction can be enforced?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1713957" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-01-23a.447.1" hansard_membership_id="2341" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30690" speakername="Mr. Walker" colnum="447" time="">
<p>It is the first time in the history of the Community that a member State has decided to continue to defy a decision of the European Court. There is always some acceptance that a Court decision might not be complied with within a few days, or even a few weeks, of the decision, as it may cause difficulties and rearrangements may have to be made. A community such as ours, would be tolerant in such circumstances.<br/>
When it is a question of five months' delay after a decision, with the Commission returning to the Court for further action, and the Court then ordering an interim injunction on the principles on which it has judged five months previously, I believe that for a member State to continue to act against the law and against the treaty would be intolerable to other member States. It would be for those member States, perhaps at a higher level than that of the Agriculture Ministers, to discuss what action needs to be taken to ensure that all member States comply with the treaty.</p>

<p>Why has the Minister apparently abandoned his claim for damages against the French Government in the European Court for the losses already suffered by the sheepmeat industry? Is he aware of the growing concern, especially among hill sheep farmers, that there is a weakening in the present market for fatstock that will be reflected in the autumn store prices? Although the Government are right to say that the case is between the eight member States of the Community and France, the principal sufferers are the farmers and hill sheep farmers of Britain. What will he do about that? Will he listen to the point made by the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mi. Howells) about increasing the guarantees?</p>

<p>As the hon. Gentleman knows full well, because he has tabled questions on the subject, the Conserva-

tive Government increased the payment to the hill sheep farmers from the rather miserable 50p offered by our predecessors to a sum that is a considerable multiple of that figure. The result was to restore confidence that would otherwise have been lost.<br/>
I have dropped no claim for compensation. I have worked quickly through the Commission. It was the Commission that asked me for the figures on damage that had been done to both the British Government and the producers as a result of the illegal action by France. I have supplied the Commission, at its request, with that information and with the figures. In my judgment, it is the duty of the Commission to ensure that the treaty and the law are enforced.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that a great many British people do not understand why we are being so beastly to the French, bearing in mind that they are pursuing policies similar to our policies in the EEC, namely, those directed at the national interest? Would not a little more intelligence on all sides be helpful in securing an amicable settlement with our most-needed ally in Europe?</p>

<p>No member State has pursued its national interest to the degree of, first, totally violating the basic principle of the treaty and, secondly, totally ignoring a major decision of the European Court. When a number of actions were taken against the British Government in the European Court in the lifetime of the previous Labour Government, and whenever those actions were against us, we always complied with the law. I should have thought that my hon. Friend, in view of his considerable connection with the law, would at least suggest that member States should set a good example in respecting the law.</p>

<p>In view of what the right hon. Gentleman has said about the rights of the French farmer with regard to the protection of sheepmeat, does he agree that the British sugar industry, and particularly workers in the British sugar beet industry, should have the same right of protection from unfair quotas imposed by the Commission as there is no surplus of sugar in this country? Will he promise to act, if necessary unilaterally, to protect that industry, particularly the workers who would otherwise be unemployed if


the French get away with the quotas that they want to impose on it?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman mentioned workers in the sugar industry. I am receiving two lots of letters from those workers, one asking that I reduce the quotas in the sugar beet industry for the benefit of the cane industry and the other asking me to increase the quota to the sugar beet industry and lower the quota to the cane industry. Therefore, there is a slight difference of opinion among workers in that industry as to what should happen in regard to quotas.<br/>
I think that the quotas suggested by the Commission were unfair. We believe that it is essential to reduce the cost of the CAP by reducing the total sugar beet quota throughout Europe. We believe that all countries, including our own, must make a contribution, but the contribution that was suggested for the United Kingdom under the original proposals was totally unfair and unacceptable to the British Government.</p>

<p>Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that, despite his efforts and those of his predecessors, many of us are becoming rather tired of Ministers of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food deploring the CAP, the lack of an agreement on fisheries policy, the intransigence of the French and so on? There seems to be no prospect that any of those things will be changed for the benefit of the United Kingdom. Will he now start to take steps that are inevitable and, for the survival of the United Kingdom, start negotiations to come out of the Common Market?</p>

<p>In the world of the 1980s, with the considerable trading pressures of the new emerging manufacturing countries, of the United States and Japan and the increasing intervention in economic affairs by the Soviet Union, I believe that it would be totally disastrous for Europe to become divided.

<p>I must correct the hon. Gentleman. The legal action is not a legal action of the United Kingdom Government. It is a legal action of the Commission, which has sought from me information with regard to damages. Obviously the decisions of the European Court with regard to compensation and damages are unknown and are, indeed, difficult to predict as there is no precedent for a Government failing to comply with the decision of the Court.

<p>I have had talks with the French Minister on several occasions and have discussed that topic with him outside the Council of Ministers' meeting. My hon. Friend's suggestion that that is the way to solve this problem fails

to understand that this is not a dispute between the British and French Governments. It is a dispute between the Community as a whole and the French Government. What the French Government are doing is a violation not merely against this country but against the Treaty of Rome and the decision of the European Court. It is the entire European Community which should be concerned with that fact.<br/>
That is why I believe it is right that the negotiations, talks and agreements should take place between the French Government and the Commission. It is not a matter for bilateral talks between the British and the French. From the very beginning, we have been willing to allow the French Government to take legal actions to protect their sheep producers, and there is no reason why complying with the law should in any way damage their producers. That remains the situation.</p>

<p>Following the right hon.

<p>No, because the only truth in that suggestion would be if our negotiating position was in any way affected by the French Government's attempts at duress.

<p>I beg to move,<br/>
That this House takes note of the Report of the Royal Commission on the National Health Service [Cmnd. 7615].<br/>
The purpose of today's debate is to give right hon. and hon. Members in all parts of the House the chance to express their views on the Merrison report. Since the establishment of the National Health Service after the last war, there have been a number of reports on various aspects of the Service, but this was the first set up to examine the Service in its entirety. Some had expected, perhaps, something more dramatic&#x2014;a report which would signal a major turning point in post-war policies for health. Others anticipated a much more pessimistic document reflecting so much of the evidence which Sir Alec Merrison described at an early stage in the commission's work as "a high-pitched scream".<br/>
I know that I speak for the whole House when I express thanks to Sir Alec and his colleagues for the long and arduous hours which they devoted to their task. Whatever its origins&#x2014;I shall come to that in a moment&#x2014;the report stands as a valuable compendium of information and proposals about the nation's health care services. I believe that many, perhaps most, people will accept the commission's judgment that the National Health Service is neither
<q>the envy of the world</q>
nor
<q>on the point of collapse".</q>
Many would agree, too, with the conclusion that
<q>we need not feel ashamed of our Health Service and that there are many aspects of it of which we can be justly proud.</q>
The commission recognised that it dealt
<q>only cursorily, and sometimes perhaps even superficially, with important topics".</q>
That does not detract from the value of much that the report contains.<br/>
The commission started life in very curious circumstances. It was conceived in crisis. No doubt the appropriate parts of Mrs. Barbara Castle's diary will shed


as much light on the events leading up to the establishment of the commission on 20 October 1975 as they have on her defeat on "In Place of Strife"<br/>
Right hon. and hon. Members who were in the House at the time will remember that, as Secretary of State for Social Services, Mrs. Castle had succeeded in antagonising virtually every major group in the National Health Service, with the possible exception of isolated groups of trade union militants who were blacking private patients. There is little doubt that the main purpose of the establishment of the commission was to get Mrs. Castle off the hook. If she had not chosen to "stir it up" after the 1974 election, there would have been no Royal Commission, no 500-page report, none of the 117 recommendations, and little of the vast volume of evidence which the commission studied. So perhaps, after all, Mrs. Castle was not wholly in vain.<br/>
I begin my remarks on the report with three general points on which I hope there can be wide accord in the House.<br/>
First, although public concern about our health services tends to focus largely, sometimes even exclusively, on our acute hospital services, the health of the nation depends upon a far broader spectrum of services. It is sometimes said that the public health measures of the last century, coupled with the notable improvements in the standard of living of the country that have been made in this century, have done more to improve the health of our people than all the ministrations of the entire medical and nursing professions. Clean water, clean air, better housing, better standards of nutrition, the control of infectious diseases&#x2014;all these have transformed the lives of our people as they have transformed the lives of countless millions all over the world, many of whom have no access at all to a national health service as we understand the term.<br/>
The point I am seeking to make is that the range of services which we usually think of as constituting the National Health Service form but a part of a much wider range of policies and attitudes which influence people's health. In this wider context, as much responsibility attaches to individuals as rests upon public authorities. There is a risk that if we attach disproportionate attention to the National Health Service in its narrow

sense we may fall into the error of underrating the extent to which individuals can and should accept responsibility for their own health.<br/>
That leads on to my second point&#x2014;that the demand for health services exceeds the supply. There is no limit to the amount that could be spent on health services. The Royal Commission quoted one witness as saying that we could easily spend the whole of the gross national product on health care. The 1944 White Paper, and many of the debates and the legislation that followed, failed to recognise the truth of that point. The 1944 White Paper stated:
<q>The proposed service must be comprehensive in two senses&#x2014;first that it is available to all people, and, second, that it covers all necessary forms of health care".</q>
The Royal Commission commented:
<q>The impossibility of meeting all demands for health services was not anticipated".</q>
It can say that again. Perhaps one of the heaviest burdens which our doctors and nurses and others who work in the National Health Service have to carry is the sheer pressure created by rising expectations.<br/>
Our people have been encouraged by successive generations of politicians to believe that they are always entitled, as of right, to have their every health expectation promptly and expertly satisfied. I believe that that is a sheer impossibility.</p>

<p>Will the Minister indicate whether that statement refers only to the National Health Service or to health services in general?</p>

<p>Obviously it refers to health services in general. In a privately financed health service&#x2014;financed by insurance or by charges&#x2014;a market can operate and demand can influence supply. My proposition is true generally. Certainly it is true in countries that finance their health services in different ways. Every Minister of Health has had to recognise that.<br/>
I note that my predecessor, the right hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Ennals), is in the Chamber. He told the House in April 1978:
<q>Of course there are limits to the amount of money that can be made available and limits to what we can do within any given budget. We should all like more money for the NHS. But there is only so much that the taxpayer is prepared to afford."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 20 April 1978; Vol. 948, c. 700.]</q>


The right hon. Gentleman was right and, I am glad to see, still stands by what he said.<br/>
However, we must be prepared, as politicians, to accept the logic of that proposition. We must stop encouraging the public in the belief that they can have whatever they want, whenever they want it. We must begin to protect our doctors, nurses, hospitals and clinics from the ever-mounting pressure of demand which seems sometimes to threaten and engulf the Service. People must learn that if they consult their doctor for every minor ailment, or seek help for problems that are not really medical problems, if they demand "a pill for every ill", they cannot legitimately complain if the resources do not exist when serious trouble arises.</p>

<p>Will the right hon. Gentleman consider the corollary of his statement?

<p>I realise that the hon. Gentleman knows a great deal about these matters. He is perfectly right. There is a real dilemma which people have to face. The hon. Gentleman must have complaints, as do many of my right hon. and hon. Friends, from general practitioners that their surgeries are filled with people who have no need to be there. Labour Members are always complaining about the huge drugs bill which is incurred by the National Health Service. Hon. Members are now receiving continuing complaints of people being referred to out-patient departments for treatment which in past years was carried out by general practitioners.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman has mentioned the crowded surgeries and the huge drugs bill that results, but the Royal Commission report distinctly points out that the charges for drugs imposed on patients at the time of need do not make for "better doctoring" or discourage
<q>frivolous use of the Health Service by the public".</q>
Will the right hon. Gentleman assure the House that he will make representa-

tions to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the basis of the report, and that he will not raise prescription charges as they do not discourage patients from going to surgeries?</p>

<p>With regard to the huge drugs bill, my right hon. Friend will have seen the report about various local authorities making vast savings on drugs. One of them has saved &#x00A3;100,000. If that were multiplied all over the country, would it not be true to say that we could get an equally effective, if not more effective, Health Service without paying at all?</p>

<p>Although we may have had some criticism of the campaign that my predecessor launched, with the funny little Disney-like figure, which irritated a lot of people, the objective is clear. There is a case for trying to persuade patients that they should not ask for a pill for every ill. Doctors should also try to be more sparing in their prescription of drugs. It is a clinical matter and it is dangerous for politicians to tread on clinical paths, but my hon. Friend is right in what she says. There are instances in which medical practices and hospitals have deliberately set out to try to reduce the drugs bill. They have found that by giving attention to the question it has been possible to succeed. That is the kind of thing for which we must look.</p>

<p>There is a wide range of views on this matter. When I spoke to the British pharmaceutical conference in Exeter in September, I indicated that I was not much attracted by that proposition, but it will continue to be studied.<br/>
The point that I was making is that the National Health Service simply cannot attend to all ills. It used to be the envy of the world. The commission


believes that there are still aspects of it of which we can be proud. But even this muted praise will fade into recrimination if all of us who use the Health Service do not learn to do so with a greater sense of responsibility.<br/>
Doctors often tell us that their best patients are those in late middle age or older; they do not seek help unless it is really necessary. Many younger people, who have grown up knowing only the National Health Service, seem to have fewer inhibitions and are very much more demanding. I believe that there is a need for a widespread programme of public education to encourage a more responsible, a more restrained and a more informed use of our health services.<br/>
I have been told that the financial constraints of the last few years have in some ways been good for the Service, in that they have encouraged the elimination of much waste. I am sure that that is true. But have these constraints yet begun to influence patient attitudes? It is difficult to be clear about this. It is very subjective but I get the impression, in talking to doctors around the country, that there is as yet little sign of it. It is a fact that should give the House cause to think.<br/>
Of course, we can encourage individuals to do more to insure themselves and to seek treatment outside the Health Service. Of course, we can encourage people and firms to give voluntarily to finance Health Service projects. That must be common sense in the circumstances in which we find ourselves. But it will not be enough. Every developed country has had to take steps to restrict its expenditure on health services. We are no exception. I agree with the commission when it said:
<q>To believe that one can satisfy the demand for health care is illusory and that is something that all of us, patients and providers alike, must accept in our thinking about the NHS".</q>
After 30 years of rising expectations, it will not be an easy lesson to learn.<br/>
This brings me to my third point, which concerns resources. The commission stated:
<q>It would be unrealistic to suppose that the fortunes of the National Health Service can be insulated from those of the nation.</q>
The Government are committed to maintaining spending on the National Health Service at the level set out last January in

the White Paper of the Labour Government. We have every intention of adhering to that pledge.<br/>
The gross expenditure on the National Health Service for Great Britain for 1978&#x2013;79 was &#x00A3;7,900,000,000. The estimated out-turn for 1979&#x2013;80 is &#x00A3;7,930,000,000. The planned spending for 1980&#x2013;81, set out in the White Paper published before Christmas is &#x00A3;8,170,000,000. If we look at the net spending, we find that the growth is rather more, because more of the expenditure is covered by charges. The 1978&#x2013;79 outturn was &#x00A3;7,720,000,000, in 1979&#x2013;80 it was &#x00A3;7,730,000,000, and the plan for 1980&#x2013;81 is for &#x00A3;7,900,000,000.<br/>
The figures are clear. I have never tried to conceal that in the current year, 1979&#x2013;80, the Service is facing difficulties. The squeeze on spending this year has to be contrasted with the obligations that we inherited&#x2014;and have fully honoured&#x2014;to finance the pay increases that we inherited, particularly those arising from the Clegg comparability exercises. By the end of the year, the Government will have had to find between &#x00A3;350 million and &#x00A3;400 million over and above the cash limits laid down by our predecessor. That is three times the amount that we have had to ask the Health Service to find by making savings.<br/>
No one can escape the facts. If we spend more on pay, there is less left for services, and 1 per cent. on the NHS wage bill could provide for 80,000 in-patients, or could build 1,000 hospital beds or buy 6,000 kidney machines. The trade-off between pay and services is evident.<br/>
For 1980&#x2013;81, the Government will make up for this year's inflation and, over and above that, provide for 0&#x00B7;5 per cent. growth, which is precisely in line with the previous Government's projection. We can all recognise&#x2014;this is common ground&#x2014;that this rate of growth is not as much as the Service needs to cope with an ageing population, to keep up with medical advances and to maintain standards. We recognise that.<br/>
It cannot be said too often that what we spend on health depends on what we earn as a nation. Until the nation is earning more, we shall have to make do with this very low level of growth.<br/>
I have, nevertheless, decided to continue next year the redistribution of resources across the country that has been


going on since the Resource Allocation Working Party reported in 1976. No region should receive an increase in real terms in its allocation of less than 0&#x00B7;3 per cent. This will enable me to give the worst-off regions, as defined by the RAWP, an increase twice as big, of 0&#x00B7;6 per cent., when more funds become available to the Service in the future so that the redistribution process can go faster. I hope to announce the volume allocations next month.<br/>
It is against this financial background that we have to look at the Opposition's amendment and at the commission's suggestion, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster (Mrs. Kellett-Bowman) referred, that all charges should be eliminated. It put the cost at about &#x00A3;200 million at the price levels of a year or so ago. I have to tell the House that, if the charges were to be abolished today, this could be achieved only by a cut in spending on the National Health Service by an equivalent figure, and today's figure would be nearer &#x00A3;250 million. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Where do the Opposition think that the money is to come from? Would they have been any more successful in getting it out of a Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer? Of course not. It would be the equivalent of building five new hospitals each year, each costing &#x00A3;50 million. That is what we would have to forgo if we were to do without charges.<br/>
The commission, as an advisory body, was not faced with the practical consequences of abandoning charges, but the Opposition have been faced with those consequences. The pattern of their behaviour&#x2014;I say this in all frankness&#x2014;has been entirely consistent. In Opposition Labour Members invariably demand the abolition of charges. In Government they invariably put them up. That is the consistency of sheer humbug. I see hon. Members shaking their heads, but they should look at what happened with dental and optical charges. The Labour Government tried to put up road accident charges and produced a silly scheme that they had to abandon. Who introduced the present pattern of prescription charges? It was Kenneth Robinson, a Labour Minister of Health.<br/>
The Conservative Party does not say one thing in opposition and do another when in Government.</p>

<p>No. The right hon. Member is obviously poised to make a speech. He can make his point then.<br/>
We have never pretended that we could do without charges. Charges are an essential part of paying for the National Health Service. Unlike the Labour Party, we believe that that is one way of underlining the responsibility of the individual for his own health care&#x2014;that he should pay part of the cost where he can afford it.<br/>
Against that background&#x2014;of knowing that one can never meet all expectations, and that there is a limit to what the taxpayer will pay&#x2014;is it so unreasonable for the Government to examine alternative methods of financing health care? I know of no other advanced industrial country that finances so high a proportion of its health care needs from taxation.<br/>
The Royal Commission pointed out some of the disadvantages&#x2014;and I acknowledge them&#x2014;that a shift to greater reliance on insurance might entail. These disadvantages are neither fanciful nor insubstantial. We have no intention, for instance, of trying to imitate the United States. However, across the Channel one finds countries that have comprehensive health care. People there are not denied the benefit of medical attention because they cannot pay for it. Such countries are able to pay a higher proportion of their gross national product on health care services but a substantial proportion of the cost is met by some form of health insurance. There are advantages in such a system.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Minister for Health and I, when touring those countries, noted some of those advantages. For instance, we noted the advantage gained in a hospital which can generate its own finance. It is thus autonomous and runs its own show in a way that is almost impossible in this country. I believe that any sensible Government, faced with financial constraints, should look at the experience of other nations to see what can be learnt.<br/>
I therefore make no apology for the fact that this Government have set in train an investigation of the possibilities of increasing the insurance element as a means of financing the National Health


Service, though I have to tell the House that it is likely to be some little while before I can report the outcome of this study. A number of bodies outside the Government are similarly engaged on work in this area, and we shall wish to take account of this in our own thinking.<br/>
I turn now to some of the specific recommendations of the Royal Commission on which the House will want to know the Government's views.<br/>
First, I shall deal with structure and management. The House will remember that on Second Reading of the Health Services Bill I specifically reserved my remarks on that subject for today's debate. We warmly endorse the Royal Commission's view that
<q>&#x2026;large organisations are most efficient when problems are solved and decisions taken at the lowest effective point.</q>
I believe that more local responsibility will mean greater responsiveness to patients' needs and better staff morale. That is the thinking that illuminates the proposal which we have put forward for consultation in our document "Patients First".<br/>
The Royal Commission, in proposing a strengthening of management at the unit level and a simplification of the structure above that level, reflects a wide consensus. Attention both inside and outside the House has tended to concentrate on the elimination of the area tier. It has to be recognised that in many places there are six tiers of management, not three. There are the DHSS, region, area, district, sector and unit levels. In the Government's view, it is the last named, the unit level&#x2014;that is, the hospital and the primary care services&#x2014;which is much the most important.<br/>
The main thrust of the proposals in "Patients First" is aimed at pushing down responsibility to the hospital and primary care service levels. To achieve that, we need to strengthen the administration at that level so that managers can take on the greater responsibility that they will bear. We want senior administrators, senior nurses, back in the hospitals and running the community services. If this can become effective, we see no need for an intermediate sector level between the hospital and the health authority. By "the hospital" I mean, In some cases, a group of smaller hospitals.</p>

<p>It will reduce bureaucracy. We have had the grace to recognise mistakes and are doing something to put those mistakes right.<br/>
It is common ground that multi-district areas have not proved satisfactory in practice. There has been a duplication of staff and functions at area and district level and health authorities have been somewhat remote both from Health Service staff working with patients and from local communities. We therefore propose a rather larger number of smaller district health authorities normally covering populations between 200,000 and 500,000. Such authorities would make for more effective management of the services for which they are responsible and allow a much better understanding between health authority members, the staff and the public.<br/>
The Royal Commission gave consensus management what I think many people regarded as a surprisingly clean bill of health. For the management of districts, we will retain consensus management. In the Government's view, however, this team approach can never replace the personal responsibility of individual managers for managing the services for which they are answerable. What the Service needs above all else is good, effective local leadership, and leadership is essentially a matter of individual men and women in positions of responsibility.<br/>
The role of a consensus team is to take strategy decisions and deal with broad planning and matters of that sort. Their task is to gain the commitment and support of all the disciplines involved.<br/>
In "Patients First" we said that we would not change the system of family practitioner committees, which, on the whole, have worked well and given rise to few difficulties. We therefore disagree with the Royal Commission and propose instead to accept the views of the professions administered by the FPCs. We want them to be retained.<br/>
The question of the future of community health councils is more difficult. I am on record in the House, and outside, as paying tribute to the work of many CHCs on behalf of the public as consumers. Paragraph 26 of "Patients First" means exactly what it says. The


creation of more locally based district health authorities certainly raises the question about the need to have community health councils in addition.<br/>
Next year the cost of these councils will be over &#x00A3;4 million. It is certainly proper to ask whether that money would be better spent directly on patient care. However, the Government's mind is genuinely open on this question, and we shall listen with great care to what is said both in the House and in response to a consultative paper.<br/>
Another recommendation of the commission, which we have rejected, is its suggestion that regional health authorities should become directly accountable to the House. I do not see how that could accord with our constitutional arrangements. It is the Secretary of State who is accountable to this House for the Health Service and for the money spent on it, and it is he who can be made to answer on the Floor of the House or in Committee for failures.<br/>
I cannot see how the chairman of a regional health authority, let alone all the members of that authority, can be held accountable. In any event, it does not seem to us that it is consistent with our desire to give more authority and greater autonomy at local level.<br/>
We see a continuing and important role for regional health authorities, principally for the allocation of resources, for ensuring firm financial control down the line, and for strategic planning. Regions will have the immediate task of making proposals for the restructuring of the Service in their regions, but "Patients First" opens up the possibility of looking at regions rather differently in the future.<br/>
What we have in mind is that it would help to underline our desire to see more local autonomy if the regional role were more a co-ordinating and less a controlling role. That is why in paragraph 40 of "Patients First" we suggest that one possibility is for the majority of the members of the regional health authority to consist not of independently appointed people but of the chairmen of the district health authorities and their constituent districts. I must stress that any such change would come, not immediately but in perhaps three or four years, after the Service has been simplified at the local level as I described a moment ago.<br/>
We also propose to simplify the professional advisory machinery, so that the views of clinical doctors and other professionals will have more impact on health authorities, but at lower cost to the Service and with less wasted time by highly trained clinicians sitting on committees and doing tiresome paper work. I should like to make it clear that the same principle applies to community physicians. I share the view of the Royal Commission that the specialty of community medicine has a future, but the highly specialised doctors concerned must be allowed to concentrate on profesional matters and be given help to spare them merely administrative chores. If in our restructuring of the health authorities we can manage with fewer administrative doctors, they must be encouraged to move back into clinical work.<br/>
In the same way, the NHS needs the nurses who carry out essential administrative and managerial functions. However, I want to ensure that we do not have more managers than we need. Above all, I want to ensure that professional people who are mainly engaged in clinical work are not distracted from it by avoidable and repetitive administrative chores of one sort or another. In so far as they are, I believe that we must try to relieve them of the burden so that they can concentrate on their main task&#x2014;the clinical care of patients.<br/>
London has especially difficult problems. The Royal Commission recommended an independent inquiry into London's problems. We came to the conclusion that this was a recipe for delay, and we do not propose to proceed in that way. As it happens, the problems are becoming better understood as a result of a number of studies by the London Health Planning Consortium, the University of London&#x2014;the Flowers working party&#x2014;and others. I recognise that difficult decisions lie ahead, but the Government are determined that they will be taken with the minimum delay. As a London Member, I say that London's problems have been left unresolved for too long. In the interests of Londoners and, indeed, of the rest of the country, the uncertainty must be ended&#x2014;and this is what we aim to do.<br/>
I stress that the Government document is genuinely consultative. We have to strike a balance between giving time for


proper discussion and a long period of uncertainty for staff. There is also the danger of planning blight, stressed by the Royal Commission. We propose to take decisions in the light of comments on "Patients First" received by the middle of the year. We hope that all structural and managerial changes will have taken effect by the end of 1983.<br/>
I turn to the rest of the Royal Commission's recommendations. Obviously, I cannot deal with more than a few. Some of the recommendations involve heavy spending. In round figures, it is estimated that the cost of the Royal Commission's recommendations could be another &#x00A3;2 billion a year. Obviously, that amount of money does not begin to be available under present circumstances. Those recommendations must await the availability of money.<br/>
Many of the recommendations either endorse existing policy or can be taken on board in the course of normal departmental business. However, some of them touch on the wider issues which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech. The first is prevention. The commission set as its
<q>first objective for the NHS</q>
that it should
<q>encourage and assist individuals to remain healthy".</q>
This is as much a matter for each individual as it is for the Health Service. Certainly prevention is infinitely better than cure, and each of us must accept a primary responsibility for looking after our own health.<br/>
Health education is an essential process in creating understanding and in generating the will to safeguard one's health. When examining departmental quangos, I had no difficulty in deciding that the Health Education Council has an essential role, which is better performed outside than in Government. However, I have asked the new chairman, Professor Lloyd, to conduct a thorough review of the council's work, with a review to seeing how the council can become more effective in reaching out to the public and influencing the public's attitude on health matters.<br/>
I am in little doubt that much health education can take place only in our schools. That is the age at which the basic lessons of good health can be

learnt. Later in life, teaching has an uncomfortable way of turning into preaching, and that tends to be both resisted and resented. I want to see the Health Service playing a fuller role in health education. In one sense, every time a patient sees his doctor it should be an occasion for health education. I want to see health education officers playing a leading role at the local level as initiators, organisers, providers and distributors of information. My right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science has recognised in his rec0ent consultation paper on the curriculum the place of health education in schools. If we ask individuals to accept more personal responsibility, as we are right to do, we must ensure that they have the necessary knowledge to make that a reality.<br/>
The Royal Commission has endorsed the call for fluoridation of water supplies. I am fully alive, as is every Minister who has held my office, to the controversial nature of this recommendation. I have to tell the House that it remains the Government's view that extensive trials throughout the world have shown that it safely and effectively reduces the prevalence of dental caries&#x2014;one of the commonest diseases and one which has lifetime consequences for general and dental health. Like all my predecessors in this post, I have been impressed by the authority of bodies which support fluoridation&#x2014;the Royal College of Physicians, the British Medical Association, the British Dental Association, the United States Public Health Service, the Canadian Department of National Health and Welfare and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. The list is long and distinguished.<br/>
In Britain only 9 per cent. of the population is receiving fluoridated water. In Canada the figure is 46 per cent., in the United States of America 47 per cent., in New Zealand 63 per cent. and in Eire 90 per cent. Children in areas receiving fluoridated water have markedly healthier teeth, and I understand why the Royal Commission recommended legislation.<br/>
However, on such a controversial issue we in this country have to proceed by consent and I must tell the House that the Government have, at the moment, no proposals for legislation. Rather, let us see whether we can achieve better results by persuasion. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why


not?"]. The powers exist but we need to persuade people to use them.</p>

<p>This issue is of extreme importance. When I was Secretary of State, it became clear not only that the evidence in favour of fluoridation was overwhelming but that the vast majority of the area health authorities wished to have it. However, I discovered that a modest amendment of the law was required to enable the health authorities to carry out their wish. I cannot understand why the Secretary of State does not proceed now, in the early months of a new Government, on a controversial subject and introduce that small item of legislation.</p>

<p>No. I must move on.<br/>
The Government attach great importance to perinatal care. I am pleased to know that the new Select Committee marking my Department intends to complete the study started by its predecessor in the last Parliament. We await its proposals with great interest.<br/>
The House is already considering a Bill on seat belts. We await the decision. We are in the course of discussing with the tobacco industry new arrangements to replace the current agreement, which runs out at the end of March, covering advertising, promotions, the health warning, and reductions in the yield of harmful substances in cigarettes. It is often said that smoking is the greatest single preventable cause of disease and premature death. Yet some 20 million people in Britain continue to smoke. We are determined to make progress in this area.<br/>
The House will have seen that, in November, the Incorporated Society of British. Advertisers announced tighter guidelines on alcohol advertising&#x2014;a wise

move which rightly recognises the seriousness of the problem of alcohol misuse.<br/>
The House will recognise that all this is a familiar catechism; but familiarity in no way lessens the importance of making progress in these areas.<br/>
There are two other general points on which I should like to touch. One concerns industrial relations in the National Health Service, about which the commission had much to say in chapter 12 of its report. I fully accept the commission's view that people who work in the National Health Service have special obligations and that the Government must not take advantage of this. The commission recommended that there should be a review of the arrangements for negotiating pay and settling disputes at national level in the National Health Service. I know that whereas, in general, the Whitley Council system has worked well, there is no doubt that "it grinds exceedingly slow" and this has, at times, led to frustration and strife.<br/>
The commission made the interesting recommendation that it should be for the TUC to initiate discussions with staff interests, with the objective of recommending agreed procedures to me. I am glad to be able to tell the House that the TUC has accepted this proposal and, at a meeting in my office last week, Len Murray told me that discussions will begin shortly. Of course, the issues concern staff associations and professional bodies which are not affiliated to the TUC, as well as many unions that are. Mr. Murray assured me that there would be no difficulty in bringing the non-affiliated bodies into these discussions, and this I very much welcome. He also gave an undertaking that the Department and management in the Health Service would be kept in close touch with their work as it proceeded. I wish this exercise well, which, as the commission points out, requires patience, good will and, above all, the determination to succeed.<br/>
The other matter to which I should make a brief reference concerns hospital policy. The Royal Commission made a number of recommendations on hospital services, and most of these are for hospital managements to pursue. Of course, the commission wanted to see
<q>a much more rapid replacement of hospital buildings",</q>
but this must depend on extra money becoming available.<br/>
The commission had a good deal to say about the human aspects of the sheer size of hospitals, and quoted criticisms about district hospitals that were too large, too impersonal and too remote. Concentrating services in a few large hospitals also deprives local communities of the benefit of much-loved smaller, local hospitals. Such hospitals are often the pride and joy of local communities and their closure strikes at the heart of community life. Smaller hospitals are much less prone to the difficulties of industrial relations and morale, and we have made no secret of our desire to try to save as many of our small hospitals as we can.<br/>
In the light of this, we have reviewed our hospital policy and have decided that the issue is one of such importance that we intend to put out the discussion document explaining the problems and setting out the options. We hope that it will be widely considered both inside and outside the Health Service. I attach great importance to this review, which in time will, I hope, lead to a reassertion of the human values in society without which any health service can become remote and impersonal.<br/>
The review of hospital policy is only one aspect of our overriding concern that the Health Service exists primarily for patients. Indeed, that was one of the central themes of the Royal Commission, and it is a proposition which illuminates the whole of the Government's thinking about the future of the Service.<br/>
In the foreword to "Patients First", my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales and I said:
<q>Our approach stems from a profound belief that the needs of patients must be paramount.</q>
We made another equally important point:
<q>It is doctors, dentists and nurses, and their colleagues in the other health professions that provide the care and cure of patients, and promote the health of the people. It is the purpose of management to support them in giving that service".</q>
These two principles seem to me to be paramount in any consideration of our National Health Service, and I know that they are principles which attract support in all parts of the House.<br/>
The commission's report is an important document which deserves a full

and rational discussion by the House. It is a pity that the Opposition have chosen the occasion for yet another party political re-run of their ancient and irrelevant prejudices. If they insist on voting on it at the end of the debate, I must ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to join me in the Lobby against the Opposition's ritual amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, to leave out from "House" to the end of the Question and to add instead thereof:
<q>welcomes the Report of the Morrison Royal Commission on the National Health Service and particularly its unanimous endorsement of the principle that the National Health Service should be free at the time of need and nationally financed.</q>
I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to support the amendment in the Division Lobby. The Secretary of State criticised it. Yet what the Opposition are doing is to support a unanimous recommendation by the Royal Commission.<br/>
This is an important debate about one of our major institutions. I endorse the Secretary of State's thanks to Sir Alec Merrison and his colleagues for, and his congratulations on, producing a lucid and comprehensive review of the NHS.<br/>
Before dealing with the report, the House should be aware that the debate takes place against a background of major policy changes from this Government, and, if many of these proposals are carried out, that will have the effect of making either redundant or more pertinent many of the key suggestions proposed by the Royal Commission.<br/>
I turn to the report itself. The most striking thing about it is that, after three years' intensive work, the commission is unanimous. That, of itself should carry a great deal of weight both in the House and throughout the country.<br/>
In paragraph 2.6 the report sets out what the Royal Commission believes the objectives of the NHS should be. They are to:
<q>encourage and assist individuals to reman healthy; provide equality of entitlement to health services; provide a broad range of services of a high standard; provide equality of access to these services; provide a service free at the time of use; satisfy the reasonable expectations of its users; remain a national service responsive to local needs.</q>


As the fundamental basis for achieving these objectives, the commission unanimously recommended that the Service should be free to all at the time of use, paid for by national financing, and that all charges should be abolished so that this principle could be fully implemented.<br/>
To meet this requirement of the report, charges would have to be phased out by a future Labour Government, and that is our policy goal. I make that very clear. This recommendation is central to the Royal Commission report, and the Labour Party believes that it is crucial to the future of the National Health Service.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) must face the logic of the proposition. His party has been totally dishonest on the issue of charges. Does the right hon.

<p>It said "abolish". I have the quotation here. The Labour Government did nothing about that.<br/>
In its manifesto of October 1974, the Labour Party boasted that it had frozen dental charges. But a Labour Government raised dental charges two or even three times over the next few years. The Labour Party cannot go on saying different things when in Opposition.</p>

<p>The prescription charge of 20p was not increased during the five years of Labour Government. I admit that the introduction of charges by a Labour Government was regrettable. We want to get back to first principles and we will. I make that statement on behalf of the party I represent.<br/>
This debate is taking place in the first weeks of 1980, a fresh decade, one far removed from 1948 and the inception of the National Health Service. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the problems earlier in the century, the need for better food, clean water and so on. I want to look at the position as it was in 1948. It was assumed then that, with the universal

availability of medicine and hospital treatment, better housing, food and education, the demand on the NHS in the ensuing years, both financially and physically, would diminish. That has not happened.<br/>
The following factors must be taken into account when we assess the present and the future. Technology and science have made vast steps forward in medical care. They play a major part in the pressure for hospital treatment. This is one of the big factors adding to the increasing hospital waiting lists. Demographic changes relating to the elderly, and particularly the over-75s, will bring an increasing burden, both financial and administrative. Inner city problems, with which the Royal Commission deals but to which the right hon. Gentleman did not refer in detail, are a major headache for medical practitioners.<br/>
The difficulties of financing and the increased pressure on limited resources will be with us for the foreseeable future. For a labour-intensive organisation such as the NHS now to have to pay decent wages and salaries to those employed in it means increasing costs. We do not dodge that. In addition, there is a need for capital development and the introduction of sophisticated equipment. All those matters add up to a continuing call upon our national resources. How people can say, as some do, that the NHS does not need more money beats me. That idea is not acceptable to me and my hon. Friends.<br/>
Those are some of the major problems. I shall deal with some as we proceed, but I want first to look at the Royal Commission's views on the proposed reorganisation&#x2014;with which the right hon. Gentleman dealt, and which we discussed initially in the debate before Christmas&#x2014;the removal of a tier of administration and the effects that that will have on the Service. The Government will be giving us details of their proposals, I presume, during the Committee stage of the Health Services Bill, after consultations have taken place. But I wish to make one or two central observations during this debate.<br/>
We, of course, support means of improving administration, as long as they lead to cost savings, less bureaucracy and simplification, and particularly if they will put right the disastrous measures introduced by the present Secretary of State for Industry during the last Conservative Government's period in office. But, while


generally supporting the proposals for change, we must beware of treating them as a panacea for all NHS problems. They will not raise morale overnight, they will not suddenly release vast resources to be spent on new buildings or cutting waiting lists. Nor will they make patients suddenly feel part of a small organisation instead of a large bureaucracy.<br/>
We must keep matters in perspective and realise that because there are no obvious answers, as the Royal Commission confirmed, there will inevitably be difficulties with the form of reorganisation selected. Every hon. Member is aware that when one starts out on change, both in local government and in the NHS, the ideas seem perfect or near perfect. One thinks that they will resolve all difficulties, but often they create many more than they resolve.<br/>
Another question with no easy answer is that of democracy and local accountability. The Royal Commission is almost silent on this. Although the report talks about the possibility of some forms of local democracy, perhaps through local government, it avoids making any firm recommendations. In this regard there are special considerations to be taken into account, as the report states. It says that the NHS:
<q>is a self-help system, reacting to individual demands but not actually seeking out those most in need of its services.</q>
In many instances it is the reverse of local government and its operation. Clinical judgment is also an issue with which there is no comparison in any other service, because the layman is not allowed to make a challenge.<br/>
For those reasons and many more that it is not possible to elucidate today, I acknowledge that there are no easy answers to the problems. But the issue of democracy and accountability is continually raised by people both in and outside the NHS, not least by the Labour and trade union movements.<br/>
The question must be asked: how many people using the NHS are aware of their representatives on district, area and regional authorities? I suspect that very few are. There is no direct link, no election. People know their councillors and their Members of Parliament, but they would be hard put to it to name members of those authorities. In an

organisation as important as the NHS, they should know who is responsible for decisions, of whom they should ask questions and to whom they should complain. If the Government go ahead with their proposals to reduce the numbers of elected local representatives on area and district authorities, that will further diminish the indirect local accountability.<br/>
Against that background, it is ironic that the Government should threaten the very existence of the community health councils, which are possibly closest to patient need and which the Royal Commission recommended should be strengthened. The Secretary of State did not allay any of our fears this afternoon.</p>

<p>I am very interested in what the right hon. Gentleman is saying. Do I understand that his party is giving an assurance that, if and when it again forms a Government, area health authorities may have on them a proportion of members directly elected by the people?

Would it not be better to agree to direct representation through the ballot box?</p>

<p>I take the hon. Gentleman's point. We do not have the answer to the problem. In fact, the Labour Party evidence to the Royal Commission is very confused on this point. It talks of "on the one hand this" and "on the other hand that". But the question of election and accountability should be properly raised. There should be a public debate, and that is what I am trying to encourage. I am certainly not laying down any policy, because we have no policy on this matter, but it would do no harm to have an open and frank debate.<br/>
I turn to private practice, which is a major issue that the present Government are to introduce, turning us away from the fundamental principle under which the NHS was created. In its observations on private practice, the Royal Commission said that it was only a minor factor. But it made that comment under a different Government, when there were different types of policies which had been pursued by consecutive Governments since the inception of the NHS. If it


had had the right hon. Gentleman's proposals before it, the Royal Commission might have taken a much sharper view.<br/>
After careful study, the Royal Commission dismissed the insurance principle. On pay beds, which were being phased out, it advocated the strengthening of the Health Services Board, which is now to be abolished.</p>

<p>The Royal Commission accepted the existence of the Health Services Board. It made one recommendation about strengthening the powers of control over private medicine, a recommendation that is in the Bill that will shortly go into Committee&#x2014;namely, that the aggregate of small developments should be open to inspection. It made no recommendation whatever about keeping or getting rid of the board. It took it for granted.</p>

<p>That is not quite correct. The board endorsed the policy of my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Ennals) of phasing out pay beds. It went into some detail. There was no recommendation immediately to abolish pay beds, but the board recognised that it should carry out the proposals of the previous Labour Government. Surely the Secretary of State does not deny that he is reversing pay bed policy. The reversal is a major policy change.<br/>
The Royal Commission examined the insurance principle. After careful examination it dismissed it.</p>

<p>I am sure that my right hon. Friend is as well aware of paragraphs 18.40 and 18.42 of the Royal Commission's report as is the Secretary of State. Paragraph 18.40 states:
<q>Pay beds arouse strong emotions.</q>
Paragraph 18.42 states:
<q>From the point of view of the NHS the main importance of pay beds lies in the passions aroused and the consequential dislocation of work which then occurs. The establishment of the Health Services Board led to a welcome respite from discussion of this emotional subject.</q>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman will remember that on Second Reading of the Health Services Bill I quoted the views contained in a leader that appeared in <i>The Guardian.</i> The leader stated that the climate now is very different from that at the time of the furore in 1975. That cannot owe anything to the work of the Health Services Board over the past two or three years. The pay beds that it has phased out have almost exclusively been those that have been little used. The argument that peace is attributable to that policy and that dispute will break out again cannot be sustained. I do not believe that this will happen.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State seems sensitive about the work of the Health Services Board. We know that he intends to abolish the board. I am sorry to say that the arguments that existed prior to the board undertaking its work may return. I hope that that will not be so, but I foresee difficulties in future.<br/>
The Royal Commission advocated the abolition of charges. We have since seen charges increased by 250 per cent. We know that further increases will be introduced. My objection to private practice is that it is immoral. No one should have the right to buy health care that extends beyond that which can be obtained by another person. The insurance principle would have to be introduced to achieve a major increase in the private sector. The Secretary of State has confirmed this afternoon that he is giving serious consideration to doing exactly that. I acknowledge that that principle appeared in the Conservative Party's election manifesto.<br/>
It is worth repeating what Professor Brian Abel-Smith had to say in a recent lecture.</p>

<p>It is the facts that matter, not who states them. The professor said:
<q>The only problem which a switch to health insurance could help to resolve would be that of unemployment. If we followed the German or French examples it would mean creating some 150,000 to 200,000 extra bureaucratic jobs to collect the separate contributions and pay the individual bills for the over 500 million


separate parcels of health care used by the British population each year. The elimination of separate billing is one of the largest economies from having a national health service.</q>

<p>I understand that the right hon.

In the age of the micro-chip it does not seem necessary to make administrative problems the dominating factor. These are problems that can be overcome.</p>

<p>We shall await with some interest the scheme that the right hon. Gentleman brings before the House.

<p>The right hon. Gentleman labours this argument. My hon. Friend the Minister for Health and I visited a Belgian hospital. We pressed the management on this very issue. There is an insurance system in Belgium. We asked how many members of the staff in that hospital were engaged in sending out bills.

The insurance system would lead to the transfer of resources from stress areas to non-stress areas. That would be the result if market forces were allowed freely to operate.<br/>
Paragraph 2.12 of the Royal Commission's report states:
<q>about 60 per cent. of the total expenditure of the NHS goes on children, the old, the disabled, the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped.</q>
Those recipients would have no chance in a free-for-all system. It is worth saying that over 50 per cent. of NHS hospital beds are occupied by the elderly. It is no good the elderly going to BUPA and other such organisations for assistance.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for underlining my argument.<br/>
The Royal Commission recognised that the problems in the inner cities are of major proportion and concern. It considered it a sad fact that on average the worst primary care is to be found where health needs are greatest&#x2014;in our decaying city centres. The Royal Commission quoted the courageous evidence of the Royal College of General Practitioners, which reads:
<q>Care by some doctors is mediocre and by a minority of an unacceptably low standard.</q>
I welcome what the Royal Commission reported, but I believe that we shall have to go even further. It is one of the major problems facing the Health Service.<br/>
The previous Labour Government initiated a move towards giving more health resources to deprived areas, including inner cities. The commission has rightly given considerable attention to the quality of primary care services in such declining inner city areas. This was a main plank in the Labour Party's evidence, and the commission has come out with bold proposals for retiring


elderly general practitioners, extending health centres, establishing general practitioners on a salaried basis and with limited lists, improving deputising arrangements and reviewing the control exercised by the Medical Practices Commission. Such proposals would bring about a substantial improvement in the health care of the population living in the centres of our great industrial towns.<br/>
The inner city problem is not unconnected with the whole question of preventive medicine. An extension of preventive medicine would be to the advantage of the whole population and I welcome the emphasis that the commission places on anti-smoking campaigns, compulsory seat belts, tackling the problem of alcoholics, the statutory fluoridation of water, and on bringing abortion more firmly into the National Health Service.<br/>
I appreciate that some of these issues are controversial, but, bearing in mind the Secretary of State's comments regarding smoking and fluoridation, we shall give him full support if he goes ahead along the lines suggested by the Royal Commission. We shall give him unstinting support, as these issues must be argued out with the public as well. As the Royal Commision said, smoking is probably the greatest factor contributing to ill health. To deal with the problems of smoking would not be unpopular with smokers, because many of them would like to be released from the habit. We welcome the proposals of the Royal Commission. They should be implemented. However, much more needs to be done concerning preventive medicine.<br/>
As regards inner city areas, the present Government's policy of phasing out school meals will have a detrimental effect upon child health. It will lead to an imbalance in diet and will be unsatisfactory for many children attending city schools.<br/>
The Secretary of State raised the issue of drugs. The widespread use of drugs and the escalation of their cost is an issue that the Royal Commission considered. However, it did not make any firm suggestions, apart from giving advice to doctors. The question of drugs will become an increasing problem, and some form of control over the drugs industry and the way that drugs are prescribed is inevitable. The Labour Party proposed

the bringing into public ownership of one of the major drug companies.<br/>
That should be seriously considered. However, the Tory approach of deterring people from obtaining drugs that they need, by imposing penal charges, is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree that the Government's policy of increasing prescription charges will encourage patients to take more drugs each time they visit the doctor, in order to cover a longer period so that they do not have to pay the increased charges so often?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has underlined another problem facing the drugs industry. The prescription of drugs must be taken into account. The Service employs over 1 million people&#x2014;800,000 in England alone&#x2014;and, therefore, industrial relations and industrial democracy are vital factors. Much needs to be done. While some positive steps were taken in that direction by my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North, he would agree that we were only at the beginning of the road. It is not impossible to bring together those in the profession and other workers so that an agreement and understanding can be reached.<br/>
We must return to the issue of pay beds, because the Government's policy will not help. I am disappointed that regional secure units in some areas have not been able to proceed because of difficulties in industrial relations. That is regrettable and I hope that the dispute will be cleared up soon, because those units should be fully operational. I have seen a unit in the Manchester area. What is happening now is most unfortunate.<br/>
The question of finance is at the centre of an organisation of the size and complexity of the National Health Service. It is quite right that we can no longer have such a service on the cheap. Consultants, doctors, nurses, craftsmen and all types of ancillary workers are entitled to decent wages and working conditions, with modern and better-equipped hospitals. More money is needed, and no short cut can be taken. Raffles, bazaars, casinos and street collections will not even scratch the surface of the problem, as the Royal Commission has clearly stated. If we are to maintain one Health Service that is available to all and is based


on the principles that I enunciated earlier, it must be financed nationally.<br/>
The National Health Service needs more money, and the British people should be made aware of the only sensible, humane and democratic way of financing that Service&#x2014;through taxation. In return they will receive some of the best medical services available. Both the Labour Party and the Conservative Government aimed at a &#x00BD; per cent. growth rate, but that is not sufficient. The Health Service needs more resources and, if necessary, we must educate the British public. If they want that type of Service, they must pay for it. The only way to do that is through direct taxation. We now stand at a crossroads.</p>

<p>The Chief Secretary referred to increasing prescription charges, and the Prime Minister did not repudiate that. Nor has the Secretary of State repudiated it today. I wish that the Secretary of State would show me where those charges were mentioned in the Conservative manifesto. The public were not informed that prescription charges would become 75p or more. That is not in the manifesto. The Government have carried out some sleight of hand.<br/>
The last paragraph in the report of the Royal Commission says,
<q>In our review of the National Health Service as it exists we found much about which we can all be proud. Our examination of foreign health systems for the most part reinforced that view. If in considering some aspects in detail we have made specific criticisms, we have done this in the hope that in the future the NHS can provide a better service, not because we think it is in danger of collapse".</q>

That is the conclusion of the report. It says that it has recognised all the difficulties and all the problems.<br/>
I believe that the Health Service can be improved and that some bureaucracy can be removed. Industrial relations can be improved. It will not be an easy job and it will not happen overnight. We can succeed only if the National Health Service is treated as such and is free and paid for by the whole community throughout its working life. That is the only way to improve the National Health Service, and that has been unanimously endorsed by the Royal Commission. I therefore have no hesitation in asking my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote for the amendment.</p>

<p>The report results from the establishment of a Royal Commission under the most ill-starred circumstances. It would have been preferable for the Royal Commission to have been established as part of a carefully thought out proposal by the then Government to seek radical reform and improvement of the Health Service. When one looks at the history of events, it is obvious, however, that it was set up as a matter of expediency because of the widespread concern&#x2014;indeed, uproar&#x2014;in the medical profession at the activities of the then Secretary of State, Mrs. Barbara Castle. Like my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I, too, cannot wait for the next few Sundays to complete reading, over the breakfast table, her account of those exciting days. It would, therefore, be surprising if the Commission, which was set up in those circumstances, provided any fundamental answers to the problems that we are all aware exist in the National Health Service.<br/>
In a report of this length it is inevitable that there are matters with which few of us would disagree, but there is also an absence of positive contribution to solving the problems that all our constituents experience with the Health Service today. This is partly due to its terms of reference, which greatly tied the hands of the commission. They were:
<q>To consider in the interests both of the patients and of those who work in the National Health Service the best use and management of the financial and manpower resources of the National Health Service.</q>


The hands of the Royal Commission were tied merely to consider improving the present system. The commission was not to be permitted to cast its net wider and consider whether, having regard to the water that has flowed under the bridge since the Beveridge report and the events just following the war, there might be a need for a new ideal in deciding what was the best Health Service for the 1980s.</p>

<p>I do not suggest for a moment that they objected. If I am driven to say so by the hon. Gentleman, one of my complaints&#x2014;and I believe that a number of my hon. Friends will agree&#x2014;is about the ease with which the commission seemed able to accept some of the propositions advanced by the Labour Party about matters such as charges.

<p>The hon. Gentleman is casting aspersion son the balance of the commission, but it was extremely well balanced. It consisted of people with experience from within the Service and from outside. No one from the Government Front Bench has critcised its nature, structure or balance.<br/>
With regard to the commission's terms of reference, the hon. Gentleman cannot have read paragraph 1.6, which says:
<q>It would have been possible to have interpreted our terms of reference in a narrow financial and administrative context and written a straightforward technical report along these lines, but it would have been wrong to do so.</q>
The commission went on to say how widely it had interpreted its terms of reference. The hon. Gentleman cannot get away with the arguments that he is putting forward.</p>

<p>It is a long report, and we can all fling pieces of offal from the carcase into each other's faces. The com-

mission says that it was unable to come up with more fundamental proposals for reform or a new look for the Service. I suggest that that has a great deal to do with the basis on which it was set up.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman suggests that my hon. Friends do not share my views, but I do not see any obvious sign of dissent from my hon. Friend the Minister for Health. The right hon. Gentleman has his story and he is sticking to it. Equally, it is wrong for him to think that there is not a formidable body of opinion within the medical profession and outside the Conservative Party that certain of the ideological convictions that underlie the report are not the most persuasive to many of those who have to try to make the Health Service work.<br/>
A further problem derives from the statement of the objectives of the National Health Service on which the commission based its work. It was:
<q>We believe that the NHS should: encourage and assist individuals to remain healthy; provide equality of entitlement of health services; provide a broad range at services of a high standard; provide equality of access to these services; provide a service free at the time of use; satisfy the reasonable expectations of its users; remain a national service responsive to local needs.</q>
It is all very well setting out these grand and, indeed, proper considerations, but I do not believe that the commission considered in any fundamental way the practicality of those objectives while tied to the present system. It is merely repeating the underlying basis on which the Health Service was set up in the 1940s, without recognising the extent to which some of those ideals have been undermined by the passage of time.<br/>
I have before me paragraph 437 of the original Beveridge report, which sets out the fundamental ideal behind setting up the Health Service, and very good it sounds. However, at that time there was a total failure to appreciate the inordinate cost to the State of
<q>a health service providing full preventive and curative treatment of every kind to every citizen without exceptions, without remuneration limit and without an economic barrier at any point to delay recourse to it".</q>
The Beveridge report goes on to express a suggestion that underlay the setting up of the National Health Service. With the passage of time it now seems naive, but it was that the effect of setting up the National Health Service in


that form should be to reduce progressively over the years the volume of use of that Service, since an effective medical service has its impact on the health of the nation. We have seen quite the contrary, and we are facing a situation today where more demands are being made on the Health Service than ever before.<br/>
We on the Conservative Benches should like a fresh look at, perhaps, a partnership between the present basis on which the Health Service is run and more private intervention. That would assist in creating the sort of service that would give everyone in the country the treatment that he or she requires.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) was a member, or supporter, of an Administration that looked after the affairs of the Health Service for almost 12 of the past 15 years. The Health Service was run during that time on exactly the basis set out in the amendment to the motion. It is fair to ask what has been achieved by running the Health Service in that way. What sort of Health Service did this Administration take over?<br/>
The Royal Commission commented on that, but its comments are not such that they can be unreservedly accepted by the Conservative Party or those who work in the medical profession. The commission does not say that it is the finest health service in the world&#x2014;and in these days we do not even hear that from the Labour Party&#x2014;but it rightly pays tribute to its emergency care and says that it is splendid. However, people are not looking only to emergency services. A hernia can have an intensely debilitating effect on one's ability to lead a full life, to work and to contribute to society. During the time that the right hon. Member for Salford, West and his right hon. Friends were in office, people suffering from such painful conditions had to wait longer and longer for treatment.<br/>
On its view of the morale of Health Service workers, the commission totally underestimates the blow to morale, particularly of professional workers, of deteriorating working conditions and remuneration.<br/>
Whether one likes it or not, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and dentists are in no way satisfied with the conditions under

which they operate within the National Health Service. Very little attention is paid to the debilitating effect of conditions in the Health Service on the willingness of qualified personnel to work within that Service.<br/>
I have extracted some figures about the number of doctors who have left this country over the past 15 years. In 1964 more than 1,000 doctors left Britain, and that figure was repeated throughout the next 11 years. Therefore, up to 1975 we had a total outflow of 11,000 doctors who qualified in England&#x2014;</p>

<p>Even if the hon. Gentleman is right&#x2014;andI do not know about that&#x2014;it still means that there was an outflow of nearly 7,000 doctors who qualified in England. That is hardly a satisfactory state of affairs in which Labour Members can take any pleasure. How many of their constituents in the inner city areas have complained about GP care? How many of them would have been much happier had all those doctors stayed and worked in the National Health Service?<br/>
The figures from 1975 are not available because they have not been collated. Is that because the Department is embarrassed about collating the figures of doctors who have left the country? There can be little doubt that the figures would show a dramatic increase as a result of the malignant interference in the affairs of the medical profession by the former right hon. Member for Blackburn, Mrs. Barbara Castle.<br/>
When one considers the number of doctors who have come to this country, one is still left with a dramatic shortfall in staff, particularly when one takes account of the recent regulations on the re-examination of doctors coming from overseas. The position is hardly satisfactory. I am sure that Labour Members, who care so much about the Third world, do not really think that it is right that we sohuld have to rely so extensively on doctors from the Third world to keep our Health Service going. The fact is that we are unable to provide a Health Service in which thousands upon thousands of our doctors, qualifying in England, are prepared to work.<br/>
How can we rectify that position? The right hon. Member for Salford, West talked about more money. He said boldly&#x2014;as Labour politicians always do after an election&#x2014;that this meant increased taxation. Yet he fought the election alongside his right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East(Mr. Healey), who claimed that Labour, too, could cut taxes.<br/>
When in the last 11 years of Labour Government was there ever satisfactory funding of the National Health Service totally from the State? When did we have adequate funding that enabled nineteenth century hospitals to be cleared away and provided nurses to staff all wards? I remember wards in hospitals in my constituency being operated at 75 per cent. capacity because the nurses were not available to staff them. When will we reach that golden age when funds will flow from the Treasury to enable us to do all the things that appear in the windy speeches of Labour Members?<br/>
The answer is, of course, not until the economic base of this country has been restored. We all know that that is never likely to happen under a Labour Administration. Even under this Administration it will take a long time to achieve because the rot has set in so far.<br/>
What are we left with? How can we restore our constituents' belief that they will get a Health Service worthy of them in every respect? The answer must be that people should be encouraged to recognise that while they make their contributions to the Health Service through taxation, the prudent ones among them will ensure that they are protected against the sort of illnesses with which the National Health Service, as presently constituted, cannot deal. I am referring not to emergencies, with which the Health Service deals adequately, but to debilitating long-term conditions. A person suffering from such a condition may find, if he is not properly insured, that he will have to wait for a year, two years, three years or even more before a necessary operation can take place.</p>

<p>The hon. Member erects a haystack and then fires his rather rusty blunderbuss at it without paying any attention to the point that has been made. I am not suggesting that everyone would necessarily want or be able to afford insurance. But those who can afford it should do so, and by affording it and taking themselves out of the system they make it easier for those who cannot afford any additional contribution to get treatment. Obviously, there are some darknesses that no light could ever penetrate, and from the look on the hon. Member's face it is obvious that my argument does not persuade him. But we live in hope.<br/>
In this country now, private insurance companies are capable of providing additional cover for the vast majority of working people at prices they can afford. If only the TUC would take a more sensible attitude to such negotiations forming part of wage negotiations, it would give a lot more benefit to its members, particularly those who, while protesting loudly, have access to a private hospital when it is needed. For the cost of a holiday in Majorca, any family can obtain the best insurance policy from either BUPA or Private Patients Plan.<br/>
In a civilised society, it is the height of irresponsibility to encourage members of the public to throw away their money on bingo and gambling and not to encourage them to use it on the provision of elementary health cover for their families against the evil day that may dawn. I hope that during the course of this Government's tenure of office it will be possible to evolve successful partnerships between the private medical insurance companies and the National Health Service, with, perhaps, the shared use of smaller hospitals.</p>

<p>Has the hon. Gentleman considered seriously the question of insurance? Let us consider motor insurance, for example. Each year costs rise and the cost of the premium rises in proportion. That will happen in the same way in the kind of scheme that the hon. Member is suggesting.</p>

<p>I suspect that I have considered it at least as seriously as the hon. Member has. I can obtain private


health insurance for myself and my wife for &#x00A3;150 a year. I do not think that there are all that many people, considering present industrial wages, who could not contemplate that amount, provided that they thought it important enough to let it take precedence over certain other things. I am saying to people "For heaven's sake be responsible about your health, because nothing is more important."<br/>
It is very important, notwithstanding the enormous difficulties facing Ministers in trying to bring the Health Service back to acceptable standards after a substantial period of Socialist Government, that we should look creatively at the possibility of recognising the truth of the proposition that, essentially, health care in the future for the vast majority of people must depend upon their paying taxes and dealing with the NHS to some extent, and also on making creative use of the private insurance companies and their facilities. I hope that the use of shared facilities will be examined, because this represents a way forward which will enable us to get out of the cycle which enabled a Labour Government&#x2014;notwithstanding all the cant and hypocrisy that they bring to bear on this subject&#x2014;to close no fewer than 280 hospitals during their last five years in office.</p>

<p>I wish that I could make some complimentary remarks about the speech which has just been delivered by the hon. Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor). Because he disagreed with so many of the Royal Commission's conclusions, he decided that he would disparage those who had reached those conclusions. That was absolutely without justification.<br/>
I quote the views expressed by Jean McFarlane, who has subsequently been ennobled in another place. She pointed out that some people who did not like the

conclusions had referred to the commission as an unbalanced or a Socialist commission. She said:
<q>Members had a wide experience of the service as consumers, members of health authorities, health professions and trades unions and there was a full spectrum of political allegiance.</q>
The allegation that it was in some way an unbalanced commission simply does not stand up to examination.<br/>
In my period as Secretary of State, I very often heard the present Secretary of State&#x2014;I am sorry that he is not now in the Chamber&#x2014;talk of low morale in the NHS. He was not entirely wrong. As part of our struggle to bring down inflation, which the present Government have obviously totally given up, I was obliged to run the NHS on a tight financial rein. In recent months I have had many frank and informal discussions with people working in all fields in the NHS&#x2014;not least in my own hospital, which I have to visit far too often for my liking. I tell the right hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends, who may be misled by their pundits, that morale is now much lower than it was.<br/>
I find that people in the NHS deeply resent the failure to adjust cash limits to cover the penal level of value added tax, with all its consequences. They face with horror the misery of grossly inflated gas prices. I hope that when he replies to the debate the Minister for Health will tell us what estimate he has of the effect on the NHS of the announcement of gas price increases over the next two years.<br/>
People in the NHS resent the new levels of prescription charges. Also, they face with horror the Chief Secretary's proposals for new charges, which would undermine the principles upon which the NHS is based.<br/>
I saw what was said by the Prime Minister yesterday, but I know what she said during the election campaign. She was asked about prescription charges. She said:
<q>I have no plan to increase prescription charges.</q>
She then worked out a plan and increased them twice. I hope that we shall press to ensure much fuller certainty that we shall not see new charges introduced.<br/>
I support the Royal Commission almost entirely in its conclusions. I merely say that I wish that it had been able


to report 12 months earlier. It would have meant setting it up 12 months earlier in order that it could have reported in July 1978 rather than in July 1979. From my point of view when Secretary of State, it was intensely frustrating to be constantly waiting for this report and to be held back from some actions that could have been initiated earlier.<br/>
I should have liked to set out, well before the election was upon us, our Labour proposals for structural reorganisation to undo some of the damage of the Joseph L. McKinsey reorganisation, on which eventually we shall see legislation. Some people have said "Why did you not do it when in Government?" We set up a Royal Commission for that purpose. If anyone thinks that we ought either to have stopped the decision already taken or in mid-term, before the Royal Commission had reported, thrown the NHS into another reorganisation, clearly he does not know what he is talking about.<br/>
For all those reasons, I should have liked to have also the commission's robust defence of the NHS and its principles and achievements, as outlined by my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme), before the nation in 1978 to set in some balance the sort of criticism that we have now from the Conservative Party. I should have liked to see the proposal that the TUC should initiate discussions for a procedure for dealing with national disputes in the NHS. That might have influenced the situation of a year ago. I wish that that proposal had been made.<br/>
No less do I wish that the Royal Commission's clear, concise rejection of proposals to finance the NHS by insurance payments had been published before the present Secretary of State and his Conservative colleagues became as committed to that concept as they were before the election and as they are clearly committed now.<br/>
The commission was set up by a Labour Prime Minister, and it reported to a Conservative Prime Minister &#x2014;one who is in principle dedicated to private enterprise as opposed to public enterprise and private expenditure as opposed to public expenditure. The report has come at a difficult time, when the squeeze is

on and is affecting the health authorities, faced with the dramatic implications of VAT at 15 per cent. and cash limits tied to a long-past 8&#x00BD; per cent. inflation rate. It has come at a time when social services are being slashed by local authorities, all of them putting new pressure upon the NHS.<br/>
Speaking consciously as one who carried the responsibility of Secretary of State for three years, I want to comment on four aspects of the report: the state of the NHS, its structure, its source of finance, and finally&#x2014;it will have to be quickly&#x2014;industrial relations.<br/>
Naturally, of course, I profoundly agreed with the commission's conclusions about objectives, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West outlined. I thought that it was the best possible definition of how our NHS should be structured and of its aims and objectives. I am glad, therefore, that we tabled the amendment to the motion. With no less conviction, I agree with the commission's careful assessment that
<q>although there is room for concern we do not believe that the NHS is on the point of collapse as many of our witnesses would have us believe.</q>
Let us note that most of the gripes came from those who worked in the NHS. I do not blame them all. They were perfectionists. They wanted to see the NHS improved. The gripes were not mainly from the public. There never has been a more popular public service than the NHS.<br/>
I also shared the views of the right hon. Member for Down, South (Mr. Powell)&#x2014;it is easier to say it out of office than in office&#x2014;when in his book "A New Look at Medicine and Politics", published in 1966, he said that those who worked in the Service had
<q>a vested interest in its denigration",</q>
presenting what must be
<q>the unique spectacle of an undertaking that is run down by everyone engaged in it.</q>
I hope that some people will learn some lessons from this.<br/>
I think that the Royal Commission did a good job in speaking up for the general quality of service provided by the NHS. That is not to say that many criticisms are not justified. There are strong feelings that we must find ways to improve


industrial relations. There are the under-financing of the NHS and the feeling that it is over-administered and that too often decisions are taken by people who do not really know the issues at stake. Those are issues which we shall try to put right as we work our way through the Government's proposals.<br/>
However, the report puts many of the moans into proportion by showing, first, what very good marks the NHS gets from its consumers and, secondly, that we get good value for money as compared with what is available in most other advanced industrialised countries, some of which&#x2014;the United States and Germany are good examples&#x2014;spend much more and in many important respects do less well.<br/>
That does not mean that the quality of our NHS is the envy of the world. It is not. But the principle still is the envy of the world&#x2014;the principle so clearly set out in the report. The commission concluded that there was no need for Britain, as the Secretary of State said, to feel ashamed of its Health Service&#x2014;nor should we. There are many aspects of it of which we should feel justly proud.<br/>
The report says:
<q>we must say as clearly as we can that the NHS is not suffering from a mortal disease susceptible only to heroic surgery".</q>
I think that what was in mind was some of the heroic surgery of the present Secretary of State for Industry, the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph), when he created so many of the problems that we are now trying to put right.<br/>
That brings me to the central issue&#x2014;the structure of the NHS. Merrison examined and discarded a number of heroic ideas&#x2014;for instance, that there should be a public commission to run the NHS and that the NHS should be put under the direction of local authorities. I think that the commission was right to reject these conclusions. It was rightly convinced by the massive weight of evidence that the 1973&#x2013;74 reorganisation created, in most places, one tier too many. But, thank heavens, the commission was not as dogmatic as the Secretary of State, who, when in Opposition, talked about abolishing the area tier as if there was not to be flexibility. I am glad that he has learnt some lessons.<br/>
Professor Kogan's research paper, commissioned by the Royal Commission, got the mood right when he reported that there was
<q>a great deal of anger and frustration at what many regard as a seriously over-elaborate system of Government, administration and decision making. The multiplicity of levels, the over-elaboration of consultation machinery, the inability to get decision making completed nearer the point of delivery of services&#x2026;were current themes in most of the areas where we worked.</q>
These are problems that have beset the Health Service during the whole of the last five years. They will go on besetting the Health Service until we have got its structure right.<br/>
Regions have to start looking as quickly as possible at improvements that they can make in the creation, for instance, of single-district areas. Some two-district areas were merged into single-district areas with my approval as Secretary of State. When it became clear that the Royal Commission was to report in a few months&#x2014;and it was not known what it would say&#x2014;I had to stop taking some of the actions that it has recommended. It commended the methods that I was using at that time. Some flexibility is needed. It makes no sense to have five separate districts in Birmingham without some co-ordination at city level. Flexibility will need to be considered carefully in dealing with structural points.<br/>
I was disappointed that the Government rejected so many of the methods put forward for achieving savings. A lot of savings could be made on drugs. The recommendation of the commission for a selected list to try to ensure that too much is not spent on drugs is important. I am sorry that the Secretary of State seems to have pushed the recommendation aside. I am sorry, too, that the right hon. Gentleman has turned down the proposal to end the separate family practitioner committees. I am sure that his action followed pressure by the medical profession, which has never understood the problems of financing the National Health Service. The profession has always believed that it has total freedom and that it is the task of others to show responsibility in terms of saving. This is a responsibility of all who work in the National Health Service.<br/>
The most acute subject of controversy in the debate and in the Merrison report itself is the financing of the Service. The


commission has made many recommendations which, both in the short and the long terms, may have results. I was disappointed at the attitude that the Government took today to fluoride. People ask why I took no action. The answer is simple. It became clear only a few months before the election that area health authorities had the power to require water authorities to do what health authorities had decided. It became clear only at a late stage that legislation was required. The best time to take controversial bold decisions is during the early life of a Government. Such a decision could be taken on fluoride, on smoking, on drinking and driving, and on the wearing of seat belts.<br/>
There are further methods of saving with which I do not wish to deal at this stage but which must be examined on another occasion. The real argument about financing relays not to charges&#x2014;a minute part of NHS revenue&#x2014;but to whether the Government are to make a fundamental change in moving to a two-tier service by introducing a scheme of medical insurance.<br/>
Almost two years ago, the right hon. Gentleman who is now the Secretary of State asked:
<q>Must we cling dogmatically to the concept of a service always free at the point of use?</q>
The commission gave its answer unanimously. It said "Yes. We must stand by that principle." It warned the Government bluntly against any attempt to introduce a health insurance scheme. I add any weight that I possess, small though it may be, to the recommendation of the commission that if the Government proceed down this road it will lead to great problems and big dissensions in the National Health Service. As proposed, health insurance would be bought in the same way as people buy houses or motor insurance. There would be competition between companies. There might be a compulsory minimum level of health insurance, much as owners of motor cars are obliged to take out third party cover. There would be good risks and bad risks among users, and premiums might vary accordingly.<br/>
We know that those who look to the Health Service most are the bad risks&#x2014;the elderly, the disabled, the chronically sick and children. They are the bad

risks. They are too poor to pay the high premiums. Sixty per cent. of National Health Service expenditure is currently accounted for by the elderly, the mentally ill, the mentally and physically handicapped and children.<br/>
Any insurance scheme that offered a range of benefits according to ability to pay would inevitably favour the wealthier members of society. This is the fundamental principle. Facing up to this principle, the Royal Commission, consisting of people of different parties and backgrounds, business men as well as those in the National Health Service, said unanimously to the Secretary of State for Social Services "That is not the route down which to proceed." If the Secretary of State discards the main recommendation of the Royal Commission and introduces the insurance principle, he will plunge the National Health Service into a new, tragic, unnecessary and agonising conflict.<br/>
I turn now to the difficult issue of industrial relations. This was examined closely by the Royal Commission. It saw that the issue was closely linked with the whole question of morale and identified four factors which, to a varying extent, influenced the attitude of workers in the National Health Service. First, it identified the short-term effects of reorganisation. There is no doubt that morale was affected by the tragedy of the reorganisation forced upon the Health Service by the previous Conservative Government.<br/>
Secondly, the country's economic difficulties had an effect on the pay expectations of staff. Public expenditure restraint had implications for staffing levels and buildings. That applies even more now than during the past four years. People are asking whether their jobs will be safe and whether the hospital in which they work is to remain open. They wonder whether the hospital will be able to provide a casualty service. The uncertainty in the Health Service is greater than ever.<br/>
Thirdly, there is the changing attitude of Health Service unions. Apart from the increasing use of industrial action by several different groups, there has occurred what the Commission calls
<q>the growth in influence of nurses and other groups in decisions about the management of services and the treatment of patients.</q>


Fourthly, there is the continuing criticism of the National Health Serivce, which feeds on itself, panders to the press and makes people feel insecure and unsettled but determined in the sense that they intend to prove themselves.<br/>
The commission welcomed the proposals that I had made for dealing with local disputes. I hope that the Minister for Health will explain what has happened to those proposals in the last six months. They were carefully worked out in my room, around my round table, with leaders of the medical profession, leaders of the medical unions and management. We had started discussions on how to improve industrial relations at national level on issues related to Whitley and general conditions of work. What progress has been made? What consultations has the Minister been holding?<br/>
I am glad that the TUC has responded immediately. I wish to know whether the BMA and other bodies have responded and whether the Secretary of State has taken any initiative. It is my view that the decision of the previous Government to establish a system of comparability, so that nurses, as well as doctors, feel that their interests are properly looked after, will improve their feeling of confidence in the National Health Service.<br/>
It might be worth reflecting what might have been the effect on subsequent events if this recommendation of the Royal Commission had been made 12 months earlier. The commission said:
<q>We think it essential that a procedure should be worked out for resolving national disputes about pay. This will involve a review of existing pay arrangements, including the role of the Whitley Councils. It will take time and patience. We think the initiative can best come from the TUC. In due course proposals should be put to the Secretaries of State and the NHS management interests.</q>
If that proposal had been made a year ago, and if the TUC had responded as generously as it has today, we might have avoided some of the miseries&#x2014;and perhaps the Secretary of State felt the hurts even more than anyone else&#x2014;of what happened just a year ago.<br/>
Inevitably, when in Opposition, the right hon. Gentleman formulated many ideas of his own, and he has got himself stuck on the belief that one can create an insurance base for the National Health Service, in the face of all the evidence

against it. I hope that he will take seriously the recommendations of the Royal Commission and the advice of my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West not to proceed down that route.<br/>
I believe that if the Secretary of State were not to be so persuaded he would make the biggest single contribution to the breakdown of morale in the National Health Service. So long as morale is as low as it is, we shall inevitably find difficulties that blow up into issues that cannot easily be resolved. Let the Secretary of State and his ministerial colleagues not be so doctrinaire as they are now proving themselves to be in terms of the financing of our National Health Service.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1714054" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-01-23a.500.0" hansard_membership_id="4551" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15031" speakername="Mr. Nigel Forman" colnum="500" time="18:20:00">
<p>I share the view that it is broadly right to finance the National Health Service mainly out of taxation and that, when somebody is really ill, there must be no means test effectively on essential treatment. To that extent, I agree with the right hon. Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Ennals).<br/>
But there are many run-of-the-mill cases where people feel the need for medical treatment or medical consultation of some kind or require drugs, and in these cases I think it fair and right for the community to expect that a certain portion of the money involved in meeting those costs should be raised directly from the people so applying. That is the argument for prescription charges, and it is the argument for seeking to keep them at realistic and sensible levels at times when inflation is taking its toll of charges which are in no way indexed.<br/>
We can readily envisage what would happen if the right hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) were free to put his first principles into effect. I refer to his first principles when in Opposition rather than to his second thoughts when in Government. If those first principles were put into effect and all such charges were abolished, the right hon. Gentleman, were he in a position of responsibility, would have to find roughly an extra &#x00A3;200 million to meet the cost.<br/>
Furthermore, there is no evidence from public opinion&#x2014;in fact, quite the contrary&#x2014;that the public as a whole in this country are necessarily frightened of the principle of contributing directly themselves to some of the costs of medical


care. One has only to look at the figures for BUPA and other such organisations to see that there are now more than 1 million subscribers, representing a total of nearly 2&#x00BD; million people in 1978, who in some way or other are involved in schemes, whether private or group schemes. I am sure that the Opposition recognise that this is a strong growth area now in general health care.<br/>
In my view, our response on this matter should be non-dogmatic. The Opposition should realise that there is a place for sensible and realistic charging, just as I and, I am sure, others of my hon. Friends will agree that the vast basis of the NHS must continue to be financed out of taxation. That is not only the humane way to do it, but there is some evidence from other countries that one gets better value for money and a better chance of containing overall health costs if one proceeds in that way rather than by placing excessive reliance or relying almost wholly on an insurance basis. For those reasons, I hope that hon. Members on both sides will look at the matter in a balanced fashion.<br/>
I agree with those who have said that this is a useful report&#x2014;it is certainly a large one&#x2014;and I agree with the view expressed in paragraph 22.4 that
<q>the NHS is not suffering from a mortal disease susceptible only to heroic surgery".</q>
I noticed that the right hon. Member for Norwich, North quoted those words, and I also picked them out. I believe that that point is worth stressing.<br/>
It is well for the House to remember that the Health Service&#x2014;the point is made in paragraph 22.7&#x2014;
<q>reflects the society around it&#x2014;both society's aspirations towards good health and its careless attitudes towards bad health".</q>
I shall have something to say later about my view of the importance of preventive medicine in all its forms.<br/>
The background which my right hon. and hon. Friends have to consider when pressing for an efficient and effective Health Service is bleak. The objectives set out in paragraph 22.10 of the report have to be fulfilled, or the Government have to attempt to encourage the various health authorities to fulfil them, against a fairly bleak economic background, which, I hasten to add, is largely the legacy of the previous five years of

Labour Government. However, whatever the history of the matter may be, I hope that this Government will strive to protect what I would call the solid core of the National Health Service, however bleak the economic climate may become over succeeding months and years.<br/>
I am sure that hon. Members will agree that Britain is still a good country in which to live, and, to my way of thinking, one of the reasons is that we have the National Health Service. I put that on a par with our system of justice, with all its faults, and I always think that the way to put the question to oneself about other countries is to ask "Is this a country in which I would not mind being critically ill or standing trial?" If those questions can be answered in the affirmative, one can take it that any such country is a fairly good place in which to live. As I say, on those two important criteria Britain still does rather well.<br/>
I said that I would touch on the importance of preventive medicine. I am glad that the Royal Commission laid such stress on the importance of sensible measures against smoking, measures to help smokers kick the habit, on sensible measures for the prevention of road accidents and on measures to combat and control the growth of alcoholism, and called for more emphasis generally on health education. I am delighted by what my right hon. Friend said about health education and his determination to safeguard the Health Education Council from the effects of any quango hunt.<br/>
I think it particularly important to give priority to those preventive measures which the Government can support and which could be done in such a way as to reduce the overall NHS costs. It is freely admitted in the report that the bulk of its recommendations would entail increased expenditure were they to be implemented, but there are some measures, such as vaccination on the preventive side, which could be strongly backed by the Government and which would have the effect of reducing costs overall. In this context, I commend paragraph 5.12 to my right hon. Friend. I hope that we shall hear something positive about that in the winding-up speech from the Government Front Bench.<br/>
It is important also for Government policy in other respects to be supportive


of preventive medicine and not to undermine it. There is a lot that we can learn in this respect from the Norwegians and what they practise rather than what they preach in agriculture and food policy. The Norwegians are well aware&#x2014;there have been articles in <i>New Scientist</i> about it&#x2014;of the links between agricultural policy, food policy and diet and the effects which they can have on people's health. They are well aware that the way people live and the signals which they get through the price mechanism in respect of different forms of food can have an influence on their state of health.<br/>
If the House asks me for a specific example, I point out that Norwegian agricultural policy includes a deliberately calculated price policy which is biased to discourage the consumption of, for example, saturated fats, which, it is well known&#x2014;I see the right hon. Member for Norwich, North nodding in agreement&#x2014;have some connection with various forms of circulatory and heart disease. I commend the Norwegian system to my right hon. Friend. I hope that he will ask his officials to look into it.<br/>
Moreover, I stress the broader point that if the Government's policy is to be serious about preventive medicine, they should look not just to health policies but to policies in other areas as well.</p>

Friend agree that, whether it is in the field of dietetics, dentistry, acupuncture or a number of other important matters to add to those that we have catalogued, a valuable aid would be to use the media to present short films and items of interest to the public? To use the media outside would cost nothing. The Minister should be encouraged to bear that in mind.</p>

<p>I entirely agree with my hon. and learned Friend. I am grateful to him for strengthening my argument.<br/>
I turn to the question of the mentally ill and the mentally handicapped. As a Member of Parliament, I am especially concerned about that issue as many of those who attend my constituency surgery every fortnight have told me of a number of disturbing cases of inadequate treatment. I am delighted that the report paid sufficient attention to that previously

Cinderella aspect of the NHS. I hope that my hon. Friend, when he replies, will say something positive about the Government's intentions to support a sector which has previously languished.<br/>
Those working in that sector are entitled to ask for better treatment and more recognition of their important work. In return, their patients need to be treated in a more humane and understanding manner. Having been told of some examples of treatment, I hope that it would be possible to achieve less over-administration of tranquillising drugs in knockout doses. I hope that there would be less frequent recourse to electro-convulsive therapy and that we arrive at a stage where it will not be used at all.<br/>
I hope that there will be a less cavalier attitude from general practitioners towards the use of section 25 of the Mental Health Act 1959. I hope that any inadequate forms of nursing and supervision in mental wards and mental hospitals will be dealt with and rectified as speedily as possible by the health authorities and the Government. I shall be writing to my hon. Friend on the matter, and I hope that he will be able to give a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>I remind the hon. Gentleman that the great difficulty in the care of psycho-geriatrics is that those who are not totally cured, but partly cured, cannot be discharged into the community. They cannot be discharged into social service homes because of cutbacks in social service expenditure. With nowhere for these patients to go, the consequence is a cluttering up of our psycho-geriatric hospitals. It is not the over-use of tranquillisers or the over-use of ECT that is the problem but the cluttering up of psycho-geriatric beds because of cutbacks in social service expenditure.</p>

<p>I agree that the psycho-geriatric services should receive a higher priority within the total provision available for the Health Service. I shall not make a recommendation to my right hon. Friend that there should be more health spending because of that particular cause, however worthy it may be. If the Government are honest with the country, they have to state their priorities. I wish that the Government would give a higher priority in the order of batting to mental health.</p>

<p>I have great sympathy with many of the arguments deployed by the hon. Gentleman. Does he not agree that it is unfortunate that the Government have decided to abolish, as one of the quangos, the National Development Group for the Mentally Handicapped, which has been performing an invaluable service in giving advice to mental hospitals and area health authorities on how to improve their services? Perhaps he will ask his hon. Friend, when he replies, to deal with that question.</p>

<p>There is an argument for every quango. If I were forced to choose between quangos in this sphere, I would rather preserve&#x2014;and I am glad that my right hon. Friend has done so&#x2014;the Health Education Council. I do not think that the absence of the quango to which the right hon. Gentleman referred would invalidate or prevent my right hon. Friend, health authorities or anybody else from taking the necessary measures to give the whole sector of mental health a higher priority.<br/>
I turn to the important issue of the attitude of those working in the NHS towards patients. I hope that the hundreds and thousands&#x2014;indeed, I believe it to be more than 1 million&#x2014;who work in the Health Service always remember the admonition in paragraph 1&#x00B7;7 of the report that the NHS is a service to patients. I hope that that is engraved over all the mantelpieces concerned.<br/>
Patients must be given fuller information about their condition. They should be allowed to see their medical records, with proper safeguards for the privacy of records in the light of the use of computers in that sector. They should be treated as individual human beings and not as mere numbers in some data bank. We all remember the recent tragic case in Coventry of somebody dying as a result of an operation that he should never have had because he was confused with another patient.<br/>
There should be more certainty and clearer explanations to patients about waiting times. Waiting lists for hospitals&#x2014;always a politically sensitive issue&#x2014;can be a red herring. They can be as much of a red herring as council house waiting lists. It all depends on how people are

placed on the list, how they come to be there and the precise reason for that. As the report points out, it is the waiting times that matter. It is important that people on waiting lists should have some degree of certainty about how long they will have to wait. The health authority concerned should be able to give them promises that can be delivered.<br/>
It is vitally important to do everything possible to preserve small community hospitals where both patients and their relatives feel at home and confident of the atmosphere. One of the better aspects of these hospitals, such as the Carshalton War Memorial hospital in myconstituency&#x2014;and I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend for his constructive and positive reply about that hospital in November 1979, to which I intend to hold him&#x2014;is that they are run and supervised by the matron and doctors concerned. Worried patients and their relatives feel that when they go to these hospitals they can speak to the people who really matter.<br/>
I put in a plea for small hospitals throughout the country. I was delighted to hear the remarks of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on this subject this afternoon.<br/>
I welcome the Government's intention to concentrate on the regional tier of administration of the NHS and to move towards a slimming down of tiers beneath that level. I hope that that will happen. I was as alarmed as anybody by the 28 per cent. increase in administrative and clerical staff between 1973 and 1977. I note the remark of the Royal Commission that that was not necessarily related to the 1974 reorganisation of the NHS by the last Conservative Government and that there may well have been other factors that contributed to the increase.<br/>
I hope that the Government will learn from experience and take on board the lesson that, whereas there may be economies of scale when making plastic ducks, there are seldom economies of scale in administration. It would be an advantage to find means of directly controlling administration which could be implemented by those responsible for giving the services to the patients.<br/>
It is obviously disturbing, as paragraph 22.83 of the report makes clear, that the NHS will have
<q>to spend about I per cent. more each year merely to provide its existing standard of service</q>
because of demographic projections and the growing number of elderly people. In those circumstances, and bearing in mind the bleak economic climate to which I have already referred, I suggest that the flexibility of response, which is one of the last points which is made in the report, should be one of the key elements of the Government's policy in future. That implies the encouragement of units of various sizes and categories within the Health Service, not all constructed on the principle that larger is better. It should also imply the judicious use of volunteers in the Health Service wherever and whenever that is appropriate.<br/>
The events of last winter showed us what a fund of good will exists at all levels of the voluntary sector to help the NHS. I hope that we shall be able to introduce some of that voluntary effort in quieter times, not when industrial disputes are taking place, so that those who work in the Health Service can get used to the idea of working alongside these well-intentioned people who want to help, often in a part-time capacity.<br/>
Fundamentally, the NHS will be only as good as it can be made by the dedication of those who work in it&#x2014;I pay my warm personal tribute to them&#x2014;and by the Government's success in creating the necessary climate for future economic growth in which we can pay for, and make realistic, the aspirations that I am sure all hon. Members share.</p>

<p>I welcome the Royal Commission's report. There are many items in it that one would like to discuss. First, however, I place on record my belief in a taxation-based NHS. Indeed, it is for that reason that I shall support the Opposition amendment, because it is wise to place on record our belief in such a Service.<br/>
I should like to discuss prescription charges. If we cannot have their abolition, I plead with the Government at any rate seriously to consider extending the

exemption list from those prescription charges. I have recently had correspondence with the Minister about cystic fibrosis, which requires the use of many drugs. One hopes that that sort of disease, even at this stage, may be granted exemption from prescription charges.<br/>
I could comment at great length about the fluoridation of water. Frankly, I welcome the Minister's statement today on that subject because I am against the compulsory fluoridation of water. That does not mean that I am against the fluoridation of water. However, I believe that those who are to be subject to the treatment ought perhaps to be consulted first. If a local referendum, or something of that type, took place which indicated that it was the will of the people that the water should be so treated, I would go along with it.<br/>
I could also comment on smoking and industrial relations. I want, instead, to confine myself to one aspect of the report. Indeed, it is an aspect that has hardly been touched upon as yet. That is the section of the report dealing with the allocation of resources which begins on page 344, paragraph 21.38 onwards. I do so because this is important from a constituency point of view. It is even more important from the point of view of residents in the North-West region, in which my constituency is based. So far as I am concerned, that is the most important aspect of the report, because the North-West region is undoubtedly in need of special help and special allocation of finance even within the existing finance that is available. In other words, I am saying that the Minister should discriminate positively in favour of the North-West.<br/>
Paragraph 21.35 of the report speaks of
<q>our belief that the NHS ought to aim to provide equal access to health services for those equally in need"&#x2014;</q>
and these are the words&#x2014;
<q>irrespective of where they lived".</q>
I hope that the Minister will note those words in particular.<br/>
On 21 March 1977, I initiated an Adjournment debate on this very subject. The debate is fully reported in the <i>Official Report</i>from column 1042 onwards. Frankly, I could make almost the same speech today. The aim is to ensure that Ministers continue to make the same response as the Minister made to that


Adjournment debate. At that time the Minister was the right hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Mr. Moyle), whom I am glad to see in his place.<br/>
I concede that this afternoon the Minister gave some indication that it is the Government's policy at present to continue to have some regard to the principles of the RAWP in the allocation of finance. I welcome that statement. I am not exactly sure what 0&#x00B7;3 per cent. means in terms of money, but 0&#x00B7;3 per cent. is better than nowt. One hopes that, as the economic climate improves, more money will become available and that 0&#x00B7;3 per cent. will represent even more money.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to the hon. Gentleman to realise that in the 1978&#x2013;79 financial year the North-West received plus 4 per cent. and not plus 0&#x00B7;3 per cent.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that interjection. I was not sure of the figure and was frightened that if I went out to get it I would lose my speaking place in the queue. I suspected that it was much greater than 0&#x00B7;3 per cent., and I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his interjection. I must tell the Government that while the North-West is always grateful for small mercies, we believe that a much greater share of the cake must go to that region.<br/>
Even taking into account the increases that have been made over the last three years, the present allocation to the North-West is still grossly unfair to that region and discriminates against it. That even takes into account the increased allocations that have been made since 1977. For a few minutes I should like to give some illustrations why I believe that to be a statement of fact.<br/>
The RAWP report clearly showed that the North-West region was the most deprived region of the country, and in a moment I shall try to give some statistics to prove that. Before doing so, I should like to make one other point. Rumours are floating around&#x2014;I accept that at the moment they are no more than rumours&#x2014;that a move is afoot by the Government to switch from capital expenditure some of the finance to cover revenue expenditure items. If that course of action takes place, it would also add to the discrimination against the North-West. I do not accept, nor do members of the North-West re-

gional health authority, of whom I am not one, that that is a solution, even a temporary one, to the region's present difficulties.</p>

<p>I am following the hon. Gentleman's argument on behalf of the North-West. Will he take it from me that with the current rates of increase it will be the year 2000-plus before the North-West achieves anywhere near equality?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1714066" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-01-23a.510.1" hansard_membership_id="12251" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28998" speakername="Mr. Smith" colnum="510" time="18:42:00">
<p>That is certainly the fact. Perhaps I can now give some statistics to try to back it up. For example, the scars of the Industrial Revolution are there to be seen. Many of the buildings, including hospitals, date back to the period of the Industrial Revolution, and that includes some hospitals in my own constituency of Rochdale.<br/>
In the North-West region, 35 per cent. of Health Service buildings were built before 1900. A further 40 per cent. were built between 1900 and 1948. Therefore, the switch from capital to revenue expenditure would discriminate against the North-West. The North-West needs revenue cash but it also needs capital expenditure. The strategic plan for the North-West, published in 1974, pointed out that for the region as a whole the quality of life was not
<q>in balance with the rest of the country".</q>
A person living in the North-West has an expected life span of at least two years less than the average for England and Wales. He will be more at risk from certain diseases. Statistics indicate that the North-West region experiences more deaths from all causes than any other region, and the North-West certainly has the highest ratio of diseases of the circulatory and digestive systems. Perinatal mortality rates in the North-West region have been consistently worse than the average for England for each year from 1973 to 1977. My hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Wainwright) received disturbing and revealing answers to parliamentary questions on the infant mortality rate when he raised the matter in November 1979. It might have been expected that a realistic attempt would be made to compensate for the high incidence of disease by allocating to the region a higher proportion of the resources available, in order to try to maintain and improve health.<br/>
Life in Rochdale is just as precious as it is in Redbridge. The revenue expenditure per head of population for the Rochdale area in 1978&#x2013;79 was &#x00A3;91, compared with &#x00A3;136 for Redbridge. There can be no argument that the Health Service should provide the same health cover for people in Wigan as for people in Westminster, yet the revenue expenditure per head of population was &#x00A3;90 in Wigan and &#x00A3;287 in Westminster.<br/>
Even as late as 1979&#x2013;80, the North-West region is still funded to only 91&#x00B7;95 per cent. of the target allocation which was postulated in the RAWP proposals. I referred to the need for adequate capital expenditure as well as for revenue. That is obvious, because buildings need to be improved. It is essential that the increased capital allocations notified for planning purposes should be maintained. Any attempt to switch from capital to revenue expenditure will be disastrous for the North-West region.<br/>
I mention that again because it leads me to my last point&#x2014;the inadequacy of existing buildings and its effect on staff recruitment problems. It is particularly difficult to recruit paramedical staff, such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists. But the situation is even worse in the North-West. There are 35 consultant posts vacant, 19 of which are due to retirement and resignation. Six consultant posts are filled by consultants who have agreed to stay on beyond retirement age because replacements have not been found.<br/>
Last November my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley pressed for statistics about people on waiting lists in his constituency. The figures were alarming. The hon. Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman) said that numbers did not matter; what mattered was how long people had been on the waiting list. The waiting time for many people is 12 months, two years or three years. Many people in my constituency are receiving cards giving them appointments to see consultants&#x2014;for a diagnosis, not for treatment&#x2014;in 1982. That is what is happening in the North-West region. People who live in the North-West believe that that is partly due to the poor conditions of the buildings, which can be remedied only by a special allocation of capital re sources.<br/>
The Royal Commission, in chapter 7 of its report, deals with the role of the general practitioner in the provision of primary care. It stresses that
<q>It is impossible to over-rate the importance of the quality of and easy access to services of this kind.</q>
Even in that field, the North-West region lags behind. In 1977 there were 2,415 patients per general practitioner in the North-West, compared with an average of 2,331 patients per general practitioner for England as a whole. In the North-West, 46 per cent. of general practitioners have list sizes of over 2,500 patients, whereas the national average is 38 per cent. It does not matter what criteria are used, the North-West is disadvantaged. It deserves a fairer deal.<br/>
The Royal Commission focused attention on the particular problems of inner cities and on the issue of urban decay. The right hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) referred to it. The North-West experiences real problems in that connection. I echo the sentiments of the Royal Commission that added incentives should be provided to improve the relatively poor standard of health care provisions in these areas and give impetus to the development of services.<br/>
It may not be possible to increase the size of the Health Service cake, in real terms, because of cuts. I was intrigued to hear the Minister say that the Government had had to fund many wage increases. I spent a considerable time in the Christmas Recess meeting many representatives of the Health Service, including the chairman of the area health authority and its officers Because two hospitals out of four in my constituency are to be closed at the end of March I went into the statistics at great length. I was told by area health authority officials that last year, if additional wages as a consequence of national wage negotiations and the increase in VAT payable by the health authority were taken into account, Rochdale was short-funded by &#x00A3;70,000.<br/>
It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that the Government have funded many wage settlements. They have not done so. Some area health authorities have not had the extra money given to them in order to pay those increases and are, therefore, faced with hospital closures as the only way in which to finance the Service in its present state.<br/>
I very much hope that, even if it is not possible to increase the size of the cake, and even if there are cuts in real terms, resources which are available will be directed towards the areas of greatest need. One of the objectives of a National Health Service, as defined by the Royal Commission&#x2014;that there should be equality of access to health care&#x2014;will then become a reality.<br/>
The North-West region has been deprived for far too long. It must now be allowed to make real progress towards the standard enjoyed for many years by other regions. I therefore urge the Government to think seriously about their allocation of funds and to use on the basis of need the funds that are available. The North-West region is undoubtedly at the head of the league table of need, regrettable though that is to those of us who are Northerners. I look for some positive response to my plea when the Minister replies to the debate.</p>

<p>I welcome many of the recommendations of the Merrison report. I am fortunate enough to be a member of the new Select Committee on Social Services. I know that the Royal Commission recommended the setting up of such a Committee, and I hope that we shall live up to its expectation.<br/>
I welcome also the suggestion that increases should be made in preventive medicine and health education. I hope that the Select Committee will do valuable work in these areas. I particularly welcome the fact that the Commission believes that bureaucracy should be streamlined and that the Minister is sympathetic towards this suggestion.<br/>
However, I must oppose the Opposition amendment, because the most glaring weakness in the report is that, while it suggests increased spending in many directions, including increased hospital building and more help for inner city areas, it does not say where this money is to come from. Increased life expect-

ancy means an increased need for services for the elderly, and yet I know that in my own constituency a hospital is threatened with closure before there is adequate replacement. This is not a new phenomenon, for throughout the National Health Service the total number of hospital beds has been reduced since 1965 by about 44,000.<br/>
We have heard this evening about the North-West region, but my Derbyshire area is also a Cinderella of the Health Service. In fact, it would seem that the commissioners live in a dream world with regard to economics. They even recommend the abolition of all Health Service charges. Even more importantly, they rule out any alternative funding of the National Health Service. They say that all finance should come from taxation and that the Government should not look at other methods of raising funds. They take no account of the fact that Government funds are stretched to the limit and that no country can afford a totally free and comprehensive service from direct taxation. No other country, apart from Italy, attempts to provide a service in this way.<br/>
I welcome the idea of holding lotteries, in spite of the reservations in the report, in aid of the Service. I hope that this will prove popular and will harness the British people's gambling instincts to this worthwhile cause. But, of course, no lottery can raise the vast amount of money required by the National Health Service. Even before 1976, when the International Monetary Fund ordered that economies should be made to bring sanity to our economy, the Health Service was in severe financial difficulties.<br/>
Britain spends less on its Health Service than do most Western industrial nations. For every &#x00A3;100 spent per head in Britain, the Netherlands spends &#x00A3;147 and West Germany &#x00A3;158. The report states&#x2014;and I think everyone would agree&#x2014;that in spite of this the National Health Service gives as good a service as anywhere in the world for acute illness. This has been mentioned already in the debate. It was also stated that anyone with a hernia, varicose veins or osteo-arthritis of the hips has to join a long queue for surgery. Waiting lists have risen by 50 per cent. to over 750,000 in the last five years. As has already been said, this uncertainty is very unsettling for people.<br/>
The public feel that the money paid in taxes goes into a pool and is not being allocated to improve our depressing, outdated and shabby hospital buildings. Studies have suggested that two-thirds of our hospitals should be replaced.<br/>
The Government should ignore the advice of the Royal Commission and continue to investigate ways of raising money by other methods, possibly by the introduction of a national insurance fund. Note should be taken that this is the way in which most other countries fund their health service and that they have had better results and are able to spend more money per head. The Government must, of course, still accept the responsibility of ensuring that people with low incomes can afford their contributions.<br/>
The Royal Commission places much stress on the fact that an expanding economy will give increased resources for health. The aim of the Government is expansion, but this may take some time to achieve as the first priority is to control inflation. During two of the four years in which the commission sat, there was no growth.<br/>
The commissioners have not taken into account that insurance schemes are able to increase their revenue more easily than Governments can because the people who put up the premiums do not have to be re-elected. Nor have they recognised that people will be prepared to give a larger share of their income if they know that it is going directly to health care.<br/>
We know, as the right hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) said, that the heaviest users of the Health Service are the old, the poor and the chronically ill. They will still have to be provided for and the Government will have to take responsibility for them. But that is not a good enough reason for allowing the present position to continue unchanged.<br/>
The level of expenditure on health, as a proportion of total public expenditure, has hardly risen over the last few years, and yet people are spending more of their income on holidays, entertainment and consumer goods. If this situation is allowed to continue, people will take the law into their own hands and decide that

they will give a higher proportion of their income for health provision for their families. This is already reflected in the increasing number of people joining private insurance schemes, the number of which increased to 2,388,000 in 1978.<br/>
The Royal Commission has underestimated this phenomenon. People are joining these schemes so that they can choose the time of their entry into hospital and have a choice of surgeon. As I have already said, while they know that National Health Service treatment may be as good as any in the world while they are acutely ill, they do not want to recuperate in overcrowded wards in old buildings or to seek to regain their health on what is very often unappetising food.<br/>
The 2 million people who are joining the schemes are not necessarily wealthy. Firms are taking out insurance cover for their members because they cannot afford to have their employees losing working time. Indeed, 40,000 members of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication and Plumbing Union have negotiated with the British United Provident Association to provide medical care. Even more surprisingly, 1,300 members of the Transport and General Workers' Union at Bass Mitchell and Butlers have defied their union and joined a scheme. The commission is blind to the fact that the discomfort and inconvenience in our National Health Service will result in our having two completely different health services. In that way, dissension will be caused in the country. In a free country, we cannot and must not stop people spending their money as they wish. The standard of comfort and care that people give their families in time of sickness is of great importance to them.<br/>
Medical science and techniques have developed at a rate never envisaged when the National Health Service was founded. We have the best trained doctors, the best trained dentists and the best trained nurses in the world. We must also acknowledge the work done by the auxiliary services. But none of those groups is satisfied with its present remuneration or conditions.<br/>
I urge the Minister to ignore the Royal Commission's financial directives and to continue to look at and examine new ways of financing the National Health Service.</p>

<p>For the sake of brevity, I shall deal mainly with those aspects of the report which relate to Northern Ireland, although the lessons to be derived there from are not of exclusive interest to Northern Ireland.<br/>
It is very interesting to see how much has changed since the Royal Commission was established, and even since we put forward our own views in the form of a submission almost three years ago. The hon. Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman) may be interested to read the paragraph relating to the subject of voluntary help in the Health Service and in hospitals, in which we said:
<q>The present complicated organisation is not clearly understood by the general public and the process of making contact with the appropriate section is a hit or miss affair. As a practical step we suggest that in each unit, however small, there should be one member of staff who, in addition to basic (or normal) duties, would be charged with channelling and encouraging voluntary aid and clearly identifiable to the general public as the individual responsible.</q>
I am not sure that the Royal Commission paid any great attention to that suggestion. Perhaps we could, with the help of the hon. Member, persuade the Secretary of State and the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office, who are present this evening.<br/>
Chapter 16 of the report, entitled "The NHS and Local Authorities," and particularly paragraphs 26 to 28, is, I believe, worthy of special attention. Those paragraphs concern Northern Ireland Members but they should not be overlooked by the House in general. They must also concern many members of local authorities and others who are interested in the relationship between the National Health Service and local authorities.<br/>
Paragraph 26 sketches the history of the integrated structure in Northern Ireland embodying health and personal social services. I shall not rehearse the reservations that we expressed in debates in 1972 and 1973. The House will recall many of them. Paragraph 27 admits that at that time there was criticism. It says that there was a fear that there would be
<q>a de-personalisation of social work.</q>
The Royal Commission, unfortunately, does not say whether that fear was justified.<br/>
In my view, the fears expressed in 1973 were based on far wider considerations. The fears of "de-personalisation" were not confined to the social work sector alone. Most people in the integrated structure, at various levels, would today confess that "de-personalisation" has to a great extent gummed up the works, slowed up decision-making and damaged communication between those who eventually take decisions and those who execute those decisions.<br/>
The report makes the point that the full potential of this experiment in Northern Ireland had not, when the commission considered the matter, been fully realised. It quotes Professor Rea and Dr. O'Kane in paragraph 28. They found that
<q>While some respondents considered that the system was not working as well as it should, nevertheless, the impression gained was that integration was inherently beneficial with, at its best, an improved continuity of care between hospitals and community for all patients and special care groups.</q>
Right hon. and hon. Members will have noted the words "at its best". On those three words depends the beneficial result which might be expected to flow from the change to an integrated structure. Since perfection in this wicked world&#x2014;as implied in those three words&#x2014;is unlikely ever to be achieved, I am afraid that we must be content with something less than what the report refers to as "improved continuity of care".<br/>
Only when the system is working at its best&#x2014;I use those three words again&#x2014;can it be considered superior or even equal to the present system in Great Britain. On that ground alone, this Government&#x2014;indeed, any Government&#x2014;ought to distinguish between the recommendation in the report that
<q>in Northern Ireland the present integration of the health and personal social services should be encouraged and further developed</q>
and any step which would tend to make permanent the integrated structure without modifications in Northern Ireland in contrast to the pattern which the report has recommended for Great Britain.<br/>
Those who take an interest in Northern Ireland affairs will wish to give some thought to the problems which will have to be faced&#x2014;sooner rather than later&#x2014;when local government is restored to Northern Ireland. There will be great difficulty in putting the NHS elements


under local democratic control as opposed to appointing local representatives to hospital boards.<br/>
In such a situation there would be no financial responsibility. All net expenditure would be borne by taxes. It would be desirable, on the other hand, that there should be, as in the rest of the United Kingdom, a local democratic responsibility for the personal social services which are partially borne by the rates. That might be a powerful reason for the Government not to accept uncritically the recommendation of the Royal Commission. The Government ought not to suggest that it should remain permanent without modification.<br/>
The amalgamation in 1973 did not derive from Health Service considerations. It was a by-product of the centralization of nearly all local government functions in the hands of the Northern Ireland Government. That almost accidental development has over the years aggravated the defects and the teething troubles inherent in the changes within the original structure.<br/>
There is the completely separate consideration that there ought to be reforms of social security. Such reforms should produce advantages, both of centralisation and decentralisation, which are presently lacking. District managers are excellent at handling and advising on supplementary benefits. But when other benefits&#x2014;for example, the family income supplement, attendance allowances and other benefits&#x2014;are considered, the picture becomes confused. A bewildering variety of central agencies becomes involved.<br/>
The Social Security Bill now before the House will help by restoring ministerial responsibility for supplementary benefit. It could be argued, however, that the process should go further. I should like to see the link between personal and environmental health matched by a social security structure which would enable all the circumstances of a family&#x2014;mental, physical, environmental and financial&#x2014;to be examined by officers operating at the same level.<br/>
It will be noted that the district general hospitals&#x2014;or, as we would refer to them in Northern Ireland the area general hospitals&#x2014;are dealt with in chapter 10. In paragraph 41 of that chapter attention is drawn to the contrast between England

and Wales, on the one hand, and Scotland and Northern Ireland, on the other. In that paragraph the report appears to indicate that the flexible approach in Scotland and Northern Ireland to this question is to be deplored. It seems to indicate that in Northern Ireland and Scotland we should be expected to fall into line.<br/>
I understand that in England and Wales a good deal of flexibility has crept into the original 1962 hospital plan. We hope that flexibility will be maintained and encouraged. For that reason, the Ulster Unionist Party welcomes the Secretary of State's announcement that there is to be a review of the role of small hospitals.<br/>
We shall work closely with the Northern Ireland Office. We shall co-operate and contribute to the review to ensure that a sensible balance is achieved between the need for general hospitals, which provide a full range of specialist treatment, and the equally important but not conflicting need for small local hospitals with a limited range. We shall bear in mind that our objective is not to produce a master plan which looks impressive on paper but to provide an efficient service for patients&#x2014;the most important factor in our calculations.</p>

<p>As I listened to the hon.

We all believe that our own area is the worst funded. Surely, the Trent regional health authority is the worst funded.</p>

<p>I agree. I was making a debating point. We all feel that we are deprived.<br/>
The Merrison report is thorough and workmanlike. It has come up with no shattering conclusions, but that does not diminish the effort involved. It is a commentary on there being nothing fundamentally wrong with our National


Health Service. All hon. Members who visit the hospitals in their constituencies will have that impression. We have the finest generally available health service in the world. The dedication of the doctors, nurses and anciliary staff is beyond praise. It cannot be bettered.<br/>
Those who awaited the report with bated breath were unrealistic to expect radical recommendations for a shake-up in the Service. The issues remain as they were before the report was published. The better organisation of the patients' comfort and personal arrangements when in hospital and reorganising the structure and management of the Health Service are of prime importance.<br/>
On page 2, the report states:
<q>Our work has been informed throughout by the idea that the NHS is a<i> service to patients.</i></q>
The December consultative document is called "Patients First". Many hon. Members wish to speak in the debate, and I shall comment briefly only on one or two aspects of the report which strike me as important and which have not been dealt with in the debate. I was glad that the report devoted a section to wakening times. Anyone who has been a patient in a general ward of a hospital, as I have, knows that wakening times are a prime example of the philosophy of "patients last". The report states that 44 per cent. of patients are wakened before 6 am and 76 per cent. before 6.30 am. That borders on the inhumane.<br/>
By definition, a patient is a sufferer and finds it difficult to sleep at night at all. He has no exercise during the day. He is in discomfort and cannot get to sleep until the small hours unless he has the benefit of sleeping pills. By the time he drops off, he has only an hour or two's sleep before he is awakened again. He is not refreshed, dozes fitfully through the day, and by night he cannot get to sleep. Lack of proper sleep during normal sleeping hours cannot be in the best interest of a patient who is recovering from an illness. I hope that all health authorities will review their practices, as recommended in the report.<br/>
The report also deals with the question of privacy. Mixed sex wards do not appeal to most people. Least of all they appeal to the middle aged and elderly, who were brought up in an era when modesty was more the order of the day

than it is today. In hospital things are done to, and by, a patient which, ideally, should be done in total privacy. They can be done&#x2014;but only just&#x2014;when people of the same sex are around. For the elderly it is humiliating and degrading if they are done in the presence and hearing of people of the opposite sex. Mixed wards should be a rarity. As the report recommends, patients should be given the choice before they are put in such a ward.<br/>
Mental health was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman). The commission deals with mental health in some detail. However, it does not mention housing the mentally ill with the mentally handicapped. There is a proposal to erect a medium secure unit for the mentally-ill at the Balderton complex for mentally handicapped people. Such a development would be a disaster for a hospital for the mentally handicapped such as Balderton.<br/>
The proposal is causing alarm to the parents of mentally handicapped children who are patients at that hospital. It cannot be in the interests of mentally handicapped people. Nearly 100 per cent. of the people living in the area are against the proposal and are alarmed about it. I am sorry that the commission did not find time to deal with that recent development, but we shall hear a great deal about it in the coming months.<br/>
The report contains a section on complaints within the National Health Service. It states that in England and Wales complaints about general practitioners, dentists, opticians and pharmacists must be made in writing to the family practitioner committee administrator within eight weeks of the event which gave rise to the complaint. Hands up those hon. Members who know that. I warrant that possibly only 50 per cent. of hon. Members know of that requirement.<br/>
If only 50 per cent. of Members of Parliament know what to do&#x2014;and, by definition, they are people who go about the world and understand what should be done&#x2014;how can people with no great education or influence know what to do? Not one person in a thousand has ever heard of a family practitioner committee, and not one in ten thousand knows where the administrator operates from. Even if a person knew both those things, he could not know that there was an eight-week time limit from the date of


the event which gave rise to the complaint. Sometimes we in this place overestimate the ability of the ordinary citizen to find his way through the web of bureaucracy to get his rights. This is so also in the National Health Service.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has just made an important point. When the patient finally knows that he can go to a family practitioner committee to complain, he has to present his own case. He can take a friend, as long as that friend is not legally qualified, but the friend has to whisper in his ear to tell him what to say in answer to any questions. Therefore, even if the patient understands the procedure, it is made difficult for him.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Member for that helpful intervention. I entirely agree with him.<br/>
The way in which we deal with complaints can be considered at a later date. If we must have a complicated and obscure system of complaints through family practitioner committees, we should at least extend to six months the time limit for making the complaint, as recommended in the report.<br/>
I have adhered to the instruction to be brief. I trust that my remarks will fall on receptive ears and will be dealt with by my right hon. and hon. Friends.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Newark (Mr. Alexander) will forgive me if I do not take up his points, but I also want to be brief.<br/>
I am not without a little knowledge of the National Health Service. I believe that the Merrison report is a truly great report. Since the inception of the Health Service we have had dozens of reports. I believe that this report compares favourably with the report of a quarter of a century ago&#x2014;the Guillebaud report. That report was commissioned by a great Conservative parliamentarian, the late Iain Macleod. I say that Iain Macleod was a great parliamentarian because he was prepared to accept the recommendations of that report, and until 1976 the Tory Party followed the general consensus of opinion that came out of that report. I hope that the present Government will follow that

example. The pattern set by Iain Macleod was a good one.<br/>
This report gives a number of signposts which are the result of careful study. Athough the commission gives no answers, it at least has charted the way for a Government to move forward. The House knows how complicated the NHS is, because it has so many sectors. The commission has gone into each of those sectors in depth. So, whichever sector of the NHS one looks at&#x2014;I am not talking here about geographical regions&#x2014;it has been studied in depth by the commission. The report will be a valuable source of information for action by all Governments of the future.<br/>
The course has to be followed by the Government. Priorities for action have to be selected by them and the responsibility is theirs. Nevertheless, the Merrison report will go down in history and could well shape what happens during the next two decades. The most important aspect of the NHS with which the commission dealt, which overshadowed even the reorganisation and almost every other aspect of the Service, was resources. This has again emerged in the debate in practically every contribution.<br/>
The value of the Merrison report is that it shoots down a lot of the fallacies, false dawns and things that were thought possible. What the report does so effectively is to show why such matters were peripheral and did not deal with the basic problem. There is no other alternative than that a public service such as the NHS should be paid for by the public. Whatever form of semantic labels we may choose, whatever pattern we like to put forward, it boils down to a system&#x2014;or systems&#x2014;of taxation. The Government have no money. They have only the money given to them by the taxpayers. If the NHS is to be a comprehensive service, the public must provide the money.<br/>
Present funding, under which 87&#x00BE; per cent. of the cost of the NHS comes from rates and taxes in the year 1977&#x2013;78, is social justice. The higher taxes a person pays, the more he pays for the NHS for the benefit of his fellow man. The poor and the elderly pay nothing at all. Surely there is not a more humane way of funding NHS resources. However, a massive increase in funds is now urgent and vital. Unless the Government do something to


provide additional finance, many of the recommendations of the report will be impossible to fulfil, even with the best of intentions.<br/>
The Secretary of State might consider approaching Saatchi and Saatchi, which has some fame in the selling of products. The NHS needs to be sold to the general public instead of being denigrated in the newspapers day after day. It is about time someone started shouting about what is right with the NHS. If the public are to be asked to pay more, they must know what they are paying for. The NHS is the best bargain in the world for a family. It is worth paying for.<br/>
I recently had the opportunity to study the health service in France. I know that the Minister of State is keen on that country's system. I can assure the Minister that we are still head and shoulders above the French when it comes to health care.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Pavitt) accept that in France there are no waiting lists for hospital treatment, whereas we have the longest waiting lists in Europe?</p>

<p>I looked not only at the hospital service but at domiciliary care. Additionally, the French did not have a consultants' strike as we did a few years ago, which added to the waiting list. The French do not have the same system of employment. The Minister knows that if one is seriously ill there is no waiting and one is admitted within 24 hours. As I told the House last time I spoke on the subject, there is no waiting list for an urgent case in this country any more than there is in France.<br/>
The first thing I urge the Secretary of State to do is to make a clear designation of the payment we make to the NHS through taxation as distinct from national insurance and the social security scheme. Most of my constituents are of the opinion that a deduction is made from their wages for the NHS. In fact, only a small percentage of that deduction goes to the NHS. It is almost negligible. If the public are to be expected to pay more&#x2014;as I believe that they should&#x2014;they will do so more generously if they know how much they are paying and what their

payment buys. Perhaps the door may be opened to more generosity.<br/>
I have time only to touch on three of the particular points of the report. The first is one that has dominated this debate so far, and that is the question of NHS charges. Many hon. Members will remember that the greatest vote against my own Labour Government was when I divided the House on this issue some years ago and took most of my hon. Friends on the Back Benches into the Lobby with me.<br/>
Incidentally, may I put the record right on some of the dates that have been bandied about today regarding prescription charges? These charges were not imposed by a Labour Government. They were imposed by the Conservative Health Minister in 1952, the late Iain Macleod. I do not know that this is relevant, because had the Labour Government won the election they might well have done the same. However the Labour Party did not win the election. The Shadow Opposion spokesman at that time was the late Hilary Marquand, who gave a pledge on behalf of the Labour Party that when it returned to office it would do away with prescription charges. That pledge was honoured on 1 February 1965 by the then Minister, Mr. Kenneth Robinson.<br/>
There were no prescription charges for a year. Exactly a year later, on 1 February 1966&#x2014;I know the date, because 1 February happens to be my birthday&#x2014;under the pressure of the Treasury, as ever, they were reintroduced by Kenneth Robinson. The various changes in prescription charges since then have occurred under both Governments. The report states that there is a good case for their gradual but complete extinction, and the commission so recommends.<br/>
Prescription charges remain economic, ethical and clinical nonsense. If I had more time, I could show precisely why. I quote as my authority a previous Secretary of State, the late Dick Crossman, who declared in a Fabian lecture that the first thing he would do in 1970 was to eliminate prescription charges. I regret to say that it was not because of the eloquence of my arguments or those of my colleagues on Socialist or ethical principles that he did so. It was purely because of economic facts. He found that charges were nonsense. They cost more


to collect than they were worth and involved a great deal of trouble. Every year that prescription charges have risen, so has the pharmaceuticals bill, for some of the reasons already given in the House. Of 296 million prescriptions last year, 63 per cent.&#x2014;188 million&#x2014;were free.<br/>
What is so unjust is that the charges mean double taxation. Everyone pays once, but only the sick pay twice. Only those whom a qualified doctor declares to be in need of medication pay a second tax. The average taxpayer pays 80p a week, year in and year out, for medicines whether he consumes them or not.<br/>
Let us take a hardy and healthy group, such as the Lobby correspondents, who are probably rarely ill and who probably pay higher taxation than most. They are paying all the time, but if their wives or children want medicine they pay a second time. That is unjust in terms of taxation, because the whole purpose of the Health Service is that the healthy pay for the sick. The prescription charges and other Health Service charges mean that those who are sick contribute to the healthy.<br/>
The greatest sin of the Secretary of State and this Government was their Scrooge act of last July, when they decided that all those under 60 who suffered from Parkinson's disease, congestive cardiac complaints, hypertension, arthritics, thyroid sufferers, those with emphysema and all other chronically sick people entitled to a season ticket should pay an additional charge. The six-month season ticket was doubled in price, by &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50, and the 12-month season ticket went up by &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;50.<br/>
Do the Government really need to tax the chronically sick to raise a total of &#x00A3;670,000? Do thy need to tax the sick to the extent of 0&#x00B7;007 per cent. of the NHS finances in order to find more money to give away for tax relief for the wealthy? I cannot conceive that that is in any way compatible with a humane society.<br/>
My second point has also been covered by the hon. Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman). I refer to the holy grail that we are everlastingly pursuing, and on which the Royal Commission has a first-class chapter&#x2014;prevention rather than cure. Paragraph 22.14 of the report says:
<q>government action could produce rapid and certain results: a much tougher attitude towards

smoking&#x2026;a clear commitment to fluoridation and a programme to combat alcoholism".</q>
The Secretary of State has already told us that the negotiations with the tobacco industry will be completed by March. I urge him to be really tough. If he wants further factual information about the way in which he could get tough, I ask him to look at the article in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 17 January.<br/>
We assume that when the present negotiations with the tobacco industry finish we shall have a statement. I urge that it should be made not on a Friday but when hon. Members have a chance to discuss it.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has backed down on fluoridation. I do not believe that he wants to introduce it. As it is a controversial issue, and as hon. Members on both sides of the House may have reservations about it, would it not he possible for the Leader of the House to find time for a Private Member's Bill on the subject, letting the House decide? If the Government cannot, and if the Opposition have no right to decide, why not let the House decide?<br/>
My third comment is mixed with gratification, in that the evidence that I submitted on possible radical changes within the dental service has been the basis of many of the recommendations in the report. Paragraph 9.73 says:
<q>The prevention policies which we recommend for the future offer a real and attainable&#x2014;perhaps unique&#x2014;improvement in public health.</q>
The country spends &#x00A3;238 million a year on dental treatment, yet toothache, caries and the use of dentures could be as extinct as the dodo by the end of the century. We now know how to prevent dental decay, yet, in spite of the comprehensive dental service, the incidence of oral diseases has risen dramatically. In 1969 there were 19,430,000 courses of treatment. In 1976 the figure had risen to 26,277,000. We know how to stop putting china into people's mouths and how to preserve their teeth, but it means spending a little more money. It means an increase in public expenditure, but services for the people in need can be increased only if that is done communally, by the country at large. Public expenditure on these matters means a long-term saving. It is an investment. It does not mean that we are throwing money away.<br/>
The second paragraph on the dental services to which I draw attention is paragraph 9.75(<i>b</i>), which responds to some of the suggestions made to the Royal Commission that there should be an experiment
<q>with alternative methods of paying general dental practitioners".</q>
I believe that dental graduates could be given a choice of two kinds of career structure. One would be precisely as it is now, with a Dental Estimates Board and all the present complications.<br/>
If a graduate wished to keep to the present old-fashioned system, he should be allowed to do so. But he should be offered the alternative of a more rational approach, in which prevention takes its full part in the service that he gives. Unlike the present system, under which he earns his maximum income at the age of 30 and receives less the older he becomes, this approach would make it more likely that his experience would be well rewarded, as it is in every other profession, including the medical professions, the older he became. The Secretary of State could well experiment with other systems which could overcome the difficulty that the more teeth the dentist fills, the more money he receives&#x2014;the greater the incidence of illness, the higher the income. That leads to all kinds of problems.<br/>
I offer the Secretary of State and the Minister of State my sympathy. Thinking voters will add to their judgment of this Tory Government an assessment of their compassion and humanity. I believe that the right hon. Gentleman is a lone voice crying in the icy wastes of the Cabinet against all the economic, financial and selfish interest that seem to motivate the present Government. I wish him well in what he is trying to do but feel sure that he will be outgunned. I look to the next Labour Government to use the Merrison report&#x2014;paragraph 22.2&#x2014;it is invigorate the NHS and to restore morale, particularly of nurses, doctors, ancillary workers and those to whom all of us owe such a great debt.</p>

<p>In the conclusions and recommendations of the Merrison report to re-enliven and restated that

<q>no matter what the topic",</q>
the commission examined it and asked itself
<q>Will our recommendations help the patient, and help those who serve him to do so more effectively?</q>
It is against that background that I shall speak for a few minutes.<br/>
Is the Health Service responding in too much of a big brother manner, a bureaucratic manner, to local demands? The Secretary of State and the Minister for Health have made it clear on many occasions that the Government want to respond to local demands to provide a local service.<br/>
I shall describe briefly some local matters in Chorley that raise doubts in my mind whether we are providing a locally responsive service. I have written to and spoken to my hon. Friend the Minister for Health about the casualty service at Chorley hospital. It has been the subject of a petition containing 20,000 names and a march by 7,000 people in pouring rain. There is tremendous local demand. All that is wanted is one senior registrar, one consultant or one house officer to supervise the extension of casualty hours beyond the nine-to-five five-day service that is now provided. Surely that is not asking too much.<br/>
I direct my remarks, secondly, to the local ambulance service. A few years ago the casualty service was restricted. A Lives in Danger organisation was established. It ran an ambulance service by means of voluntary help. It operated a car that carried specialist equipment. The car was used to take people to hospital. Among other things, it carried resuscitation equipment.<br/>
We were supposed to have an extension of two ambulance bays as a step towards an expansion of the hospital service. That has now been turned down. Did we respond to the show of voluntary service? I do not believe that we did. Has the National Health Service taken advantage of that voluntary effort?<br/>
Pat Seed has been present in the Strangers' Gallery for most of the debate. In the North-West she has raised about &#x00A3;2 million towards the provision of an all-body scanner at the Christie hospital, Manchester. Within that funding she has paid for 10 years of its operation. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for


South Fylde (Mr. Gardner) and I have been pressing the Minister to ensure that the unit will operate. It has taken several weeks or months for the regional health authority chairman to urge that on the Minister. It has been necessary to make those representations even though funding has been available. I am pleased to announce that in the past 24 hours the Minister has relented. It has been made possible to man the scanner outside the NHS by something to do with the University of Manchester medical school. That is the first sign of a chink of light. It is the first sign that perhaps we are not too much of a bureaucracy.<br/>
I sympathise with the Minister for Health and the Secretary of State because they are responsible for a huge number of people throughout the country. However, I ask them to ensure that we carry out our policies of responding to local demands and combining the best of voluntary help and funding with the provision of the NHS. Surely it is best to carry both forward and thereby improve the NHS.</p>

<p>I shall be brief, because I hope that all my colleagues will have a chance to participate in the debate. I identify myself with the hope that has been expressed by several hon. Members that the deprived areas will be given much greater resources. If greater resources had been made available to such areas, the appeal made by the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Dover) would not have been necessary on behalf of the North-West. I commend Pat Seed on her wonderful and valuable efforts.<br/>
I was delighted to hear the Secretary of State say that the Government would be giving priority to perinatal care. The campaign was led by the Spastics Society. I have been actively involved. Since the campaign was launched, the figures have tended to improve. I feel that they have improved primarily because people have become aware of the problem. It is significant that those who now occupy the Front Benches are among those whom I have plagued over the past two and a half years on the issue of perinatal care. The first results are appearing, but they are the results of awareness and not so much those of extra funding.<br/>
I give notice that I intend to make the Minister aware of another problem. However, with his background the hon. Gentleman does not need me to do so. We should devote much more time to the rehabilitation services. In the decade that has recently ended, we had four reports on rehabilitation, namely, the Tunbridge, Mair, Sharp and Snowden reports. In the commission's report there is an appendix on rehabilitation.<br/>
I shall speak briefly on rehabilitation and its impact upon the elderly. There is an assumption that we grow old and that there is not much that can be done for us. It is assumed that at the end of the day we shall be tucked away in a geriatric ward to absorb vast quantities of National Health resources. That is a fallacy. I ask the Minister to consider allocating extra funds to the rehabilitation of the elderly.<br/>
We make an assumption that as we grow old there is not much that can be done for us. That is unfair to those who work to rehabilitate, such as the staff at the Lady well hospital, in my constituency, and Dr. John Wedgwood, the consultant physician in geriatric medicine at the Middlesex hospital. These people prove conclusively that there is a tremendous amount of rehabilitation that can be done. It requires team work and the efforts of those in the medical profession who want to specialise in that sector. It requires the efforts of nurses and those in the remedial profession, such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists and social workers.<br/>
Much has been said about queues. When considering the elderly, the problem that we must face is the immobilisation syndrome. I shall give a classic example of the syndrome as an illustration before returning to the elderly. Dr. Wedgwood, in an illuminating address to NAIDEX, referred to the man aged40 who, at the request of his parents, was visited by a geriatrician. The geriatrician found that the man had had his appendix removed when he was 19. Apparently he had been told to go to bed. He did so, and he stayed there until he was 40. The geriatrician and the rehabilitation staff worked hard on that man, and after five years they succeeded in making him only partially mobile.<br/>
That is an unusual and exaggerated case, but I am sure that it falls within


the experience of the Minister that an elderly person in need of treatment for a disease who has to wait for treatment and has to stay within his home, or in bed, quickly becomes highly immobile. The initial cause of the immobility, coupled with the delay in treatment, leads to a person going into a geriatric ward much earlier than would otherwise be necessary.<br/>
On the evidence that I have, tens of thousands of NHS beds are occupied by elderly people who have not received treatment early enough and are suffering from the immobilisation syndrome. If resources could be devoted to intelligent rehabilitation in our society within the NHS, I am sure that many of those now in hospital would not be there. That would result in substantial savings to the Health Service, better living conditions and better standards for those involved, and fewer demands being made upon our social services. It is right to do that. To use a phrase that is often quoted,
<q>The intelligent use of rehabilitation will not of necessity add years to the life of people, but will add life to their years.</q>
That is the function of the National Health Service when caring for the elderly.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Member for Eccles (Mr. Carter-Jones) will forgive me if, in view of the time, I do not take up his speech.<br/>
The Royal Commission was charged with the task of finding better uses for the financial and manpower resources of the National Health Service. The Government were elected&#x2014;and pledged in their manifesto&#x2014;to find a better use for existing resources. I can suggest one way in which millions of pounds might be saved each year for our hard-pressed National Health Service. My suggestion does not involve recourse to the taxpayer. I suggest the greater use of private contractors and private enterprise in the ancillary services that hospitals require.<br/>
I declare an interest in the Pritchard Services Group, which is a large company operating in a number of fields all over the world. Until recently the company was sited within the boundaries of my constituency. The Crothall company is a subsidiary of that group and it offers

domestic and ancillary services to hospitals throughout the world. Most of that company's work is carried out abroad, where there is a much greater use of private contractors, who compete with each other within the health services.<br/>
According to figures that I obtained from the Ministry under the previous Labour Government, about &#x00A3;250 million a year is spent by the Health Service on domestic cleaning services. That figure may be higher now because of inflation. Of that sum, about 1&#x00BD; per cent. is undertaken by private contractors.<br/>
I approach the issue in three ways. First, there is a question of standards. Some people believe that the standards rendered by private contractors would be lower than those of direct labour. However, that is fallacious. The right hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Mr. Moyle) is on record as saying that the services rendered in one particular hospital&#x2014;where services had been criticised&#x2014;were of the highest order. In 1980 the standards in the hospitals where direct cleaning labour is involved are deplorable.<br/>
Close to the boundaries of my constituency lies Northwick Park hospital, which was built in 1971 and was opened by Her Majesty the Queen. It was intended that it should be one of the best hospitals in Europe. However, some time ago I went to visit constituents in that hospital. I got into the modern lift, which had been built only in 1971, and I found graffiti all over the walls, cigarette ends in the door runners and stale food on the floor. Months later, I visited the hospital again and I used the same lift. The food had gone but the graffiti remained. As far as I know, the same cigarette ends were there. I was told that it was almost impossible to keep such places clean and to remove such dirt. If that is the standard in our hospitals, something must be done.<br/>
Secondly, it has been suggested that industrial relations are worse in hospitals where private contractors undertake ancillary work. However, that can be disproved by the last winter of discontent. During that period, industrial unrest was worst where labour was carried out directly by the hospitals. There was virtually no trouble in hospitals that had used private contractors.<br/>
Finally, I turn to the question of saving resources. Where private contractors have been used for ancillary services, it has been found that a saving of nearly 10 per cent. has been achieved without any diminution in standards. I have given documentary evidence of that to the Minister and his Department is aware of it.<br/>
Let us assume that, without any reduction in the labour force and without any reduction in wages&#x2014;because the same firms and unions are involved and the same negotiations take place&#x2014;savings are achieved by skilled management. If private contractors were used throughout the whole of the Health Service&#x2014;as other countries use them&#x2014;on the basis of a cost of at least &#x00A3;250 million each year and on the basis that a 10 per cent. saving can be achieved, there would be a saving to the National Health Service of about &#x00A3;25 million a year. An even greater saving might be achieved if greater competition were allowed.</p>

<p>A new hospital is being built in Ealing by private contractors. Its cost has increased because of delays and the absurdity of the contracts that were made. As a result, the district has lost a lot of money.</p>

<p>I am not concerned with that, because it concerns the building of a hospital and does not involve the supply of ancillary services. I am not associated with any firm involved with that hospital, and my constituents do not go into that area.<br/>
It would be possible to achieve savings of &#x00A3;25 million on the basis of figures that I have given to the Minister. I urged the Labour Government to encourage the use of private enterprise, but the answer was always that this was a matter for the health authorities. That is fair enough, but it does not go far enough. In November. I asked the Minister what action he had taken to encourage greater competition in the supply of ancillary services. He replied:
<q>Health authorities have discretion to put a wide range of services out to contract, and it is for them to decide in the light of local needs and circumstances whether services can be provided more effectively and cheaply by this means. I should be glad to see them use this discretion more freely"&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 5 November 1979; Vol. 973, c. <i>52.</i>]</q>

That is progress in the right direction, but it does not go far enough.<br/>
What can the Minister do to push the authorities&#x2014;I am not suggesting legislation&#x2014;into the greater use of private enterprise? Private enterprise would lead to higher standards and to a substantial saving of money. It would be possible to buy a lot of kidney machines and essential medical equipment with that money.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1714092" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-01-23a.536.0" hansard_membership_id="1778" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31093" speakername="Mr. Ronald W. Brown" colnum="536" time="20:08:00">
<p>In many regions private contractors are used for a whole range of work, and their track record shows why their work is poor. They have to undertake fixed contract prices, and the Minister knows that. As long as fixed contract prices remain, there will be a problem. When hospitals employ labour to do a job, that labour is under better control. The building management may be wrong. It is up to the hospitals to find better building management. That does not alter the fact that it is not correct to say that private contractors would bring about an improvement in the Health Service. That does not accord with the facts.<br/>
I support the general theme of the commission's report. The reorganisation of the Health Service in 1974 produced the chaos and difficulties that we are now in. We opposed the reorganisation and tried to point out to the "Mad Mullah" who is now the Secretary of State for Industry that he was on a mistaken course, as he was in 1962 when he destroyed London, but he would not listen. We tried to explain that, with his restructuring, unless the Health Service continued to be funded on a growth rate of 4 per cent. it was bound to be destroyed. He would not listen and argued that as long as the structure was changed the money would take care of itself. We are now in the position that we warned him about many years ago. It was an inevitable consequence. The previous Conservative Government caused the problem, and they are now trying to tell us that they do not want to put it right but want to bring in private enterprise as an alternative.<br/>
Between 1956 and 1974 the National Health Service enjoyed an annual growth rate of about 4 per cent., whereas it now absorbs only about 5&#x00B7;5 per cent. of the gross national product, compared with 5&#x00B7;6 per cent. in 1975 and 1976. It is


clear that the proportion of the nation's wealth spent on the National Health Service has been effectively frozen for five years.<br/>
It is impossible to freeze the NHS. It moves backwards. It cannot stand still. The Secretary of State talked about increasing problems. He mentioned the burden that elderly people put on the Service. To countenance a freeze is to say that the Health Service will grind to a halt.<br/>
It was the limit when the Secretary of State said that the problem with the Service was the patients. In identifying the problems of the Health Service, he said that it was all down to the patients. That was his first point. He did not go on to say "By the way, we shall have to re-educate patients." The main thrust of his argument was that the patients were the real problem. If the Government could get rid of the patients and their demands, they would have a wonderful Health Service. It is scandalous that that was the sum total of the Secretary of State's contribution.<br/>
The Secretary of State's skill was that he enunciated that fact as if it were some new dream&#x2014;this is the millennium. It was in the Conservatives' manifesto. He is right, but it was their nineteenth century manifesto. That was what they did in those days. Even after the war we had the HSA, the HSF and the Manor House hospital. People could not afford to pay for hospitals and doctors, and because they could not afford to buy them they used to make up their own treatments for coughs. That was how it was. It would seem that the Government would like to wipe the slate clean and return to that position. When people were poor, the Tories were compassionate. They built a home and called it a workhouse.<br/>
In my constituency the other day I was delighted to see one of the DHSS buildings being painted. I thought that rather strange. It looked as if it needed pulling down, but it was being painted. I suddenly realised why. Over the entrance it said "Office for the relief of the poor". Having listened to the Secretary of State this afternoon, I am sure that the order has gone out to repaint those offices. The right hon. Gentleman will not get a very

good reception from the people in Hackney for the idea of having an office for the relief of the poor. No doubt he calls that forward planning, but he is arguing to turn the clock back.<br/>
Patients are demanding. The Secretary of State claims that old people do not visit a doctor so often. They are more discriminatory. It is the young people who use the Health Service more frequently. However, the young people are told by the medical profession that they would rather they came to see them earlier, before it was too late. If a young mother worries about her baby and does not go to see a doctor for a long time, when she eventually goes and the doctor finds that there is nothing wrong he does not tell her that it is marvellous that she has saved the Service a bit of money. He tells her that she is a silly girl and should have come earlier. He tells her that he is there to give advice. The Secretary of State is wrong to suggest that the young mother is a disgrace to society because she takes her child to see the doctor when she is unsure about what is wrong. Young mothers should not listen to the Secretary of State. They should go to their doctor and see that their child is properly cared for. It is outrageous for the Secretary of State to argue that it is an exercise to save tax.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman mentioned drugs but said not a word about the pharmaceutical industry and the vast sums of money that it milks from the Health Service. He appeared only to be saying to doctors that they should not prescribe these drugs because they were too good for the workers; they should be saved for those cared for by private enterprise. I hope that he will produce a circular that can be handed to all my constituents by their doctors. It will say to the patients that they should have a certain drug to help them get better but that the Secretary of State says that it is too expensive. The right hon. Gentleman cannot leave it to the doctors. If he gives that instruction and takes away a doctor's clinical judgment, he must put it in writing so that we know at whose door the blame rests.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman's advice to doctors is that under the National Health Service they must not prescribe drugs


that ought to be prescribed. He says that they are too expensive. If people have sufficient money for private medicine, he will allow them to have whatever drugs are available and the necessary help. People can have good help if they pay for it, but if they cannot pay for it it is the knacker's yard for them. That is the point made by the Secretary of State.<br/>
Years ago, before he was Secretary of State, I told the right hon. Gentleman that one of the greatest problems in the Health Service was that the largest part of the bill in a teaching hospital in London was for drugs. No matter what measures are taken, the pharmaceutical industry will always get round them. The Secretary of State should have told us what his proposals are to cope with that problem.<br/>
The Secretary of State, as a London Member, acknowledged that London had problems, but he went no further than that. He leaves it to three highly specialist inquiries, one of them by a university and not even by his Department. He said that he would examine the London problems in the light of those specialist investigations. He knows that that is wrong. Until we have an independent inquiry to examine all the facts, we shall never get it right.<br/>
As I have said before, the hospital service in my constituency is in a chaotic state, and we shall not solve the problem unless we have an investigation. A teaching hospital in the district covering my constituency takes about 65 per cent. of the district money. To find that money, four hospitals in my constituency are being closed. That would not be so bad if all the people in that hospital came from my constituency, but only 15 per cent. of the patients in that teaching hospital come from the district, even though they pay 65 per cent. of the charges. The other 85 per cent. come from all over the country&#x2014;from the North-West, the North-East, the South and Scotland. Therefore, it is quite unreasonable to close all these hospitals in my constituency simply because of the money needed for the teaching hospital. I underline the fact that these hospitals are not being closed for medical reasons. They are being closed on a financial basis, namely, that &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;5

million must be found, and the only way that this can be done is through closures.<br/>
I am staggered to hear the Secretary of State gloss over the London problem. The Royal Commission felt that the problem was too big even for it to handle. That was why it recommended an urgent inquiry. There is a definite problem here which must be resolved. Certainly the funding of teaching hospitals is an issue which must be resolved. It is not sufficient for the Secretary of State to leave it alone.</p>

<p>I am grateful for that assurance. I should like to discuss this matter in depth. It is a tragedy that we have so short a time in which to make our contributions on this excellent report. My right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, East (Mr. Moyle) has just thrown down a challenge to the Secretary of State. If we are prepared to do it, why will the Secretary of State not review his position and undertake an urgent look at the London situation&#x2014;not because the Government are bureaucrats, but because people are suffering?<br/>
In my constituency, people are not getting treatment. I was assured by the Minister for Health, who was kind enough to come to my area, that Hackney people would have prior rights to go into the teaching hospital. That assurance was given in front of the consultants of the teaching hospital. Last week one of my constituents was referred to the teaching hospital by her doctor, but when she was seen at the hospital the doctor there told her that she was not really serious enough to be in that hospital and he suggested that she should go elsewhere. Therefore, there is clear evidence that the teaching hospital will not be used as a district hospital.<br/>
I hope that the Secretary of State will really pull his socks up. He was a pretty poor performer today. A real difficulty faces us, and we want a man-sized answer to the problem.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown) knows much more about the Health Service than he has revealed tonight. He ranted and raved in a way that really does not become his expert knowledge about the Service. He and I are the only two hon. Members who for the past five years have served on regional health authorities. I am sorry that he injected so much politics into his otherwise sober and sensible reflection of the real problems facing the Health Service. The real problems are not political but economic. There is a shortage of money. The real problem is finding enough money by some means or another. That is really what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has tried to do, and the Opposition, for quite good and fundamental reasons, object to it. I do not blame them for arguing on that score.<br/>
The hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch spoke about people coming into his area to go to one of the London teaching hospitals. In the jargon of the Health Service, this is called "cross-boundary flow". There is an advantage in being able to go to hospitals in my area, for example. I have an interest to declare in that I am a member of my regional health authority. Also, I have an interest in the pharmaceutical industry. That would come out&#x2014;it always does&#x2014;but am not worried about it because everyone knows. I believe that there is a real advantage in being able to go to one's GP and say "I want to go to Bart's" or King's or Guy's. There is a great advantage in the GP being able to say to a patient who lives 70 miles from London "The best man for you is at Guy's".</p>

<p>I do not want to dwell too long on that point. I agree that there is a case for the teaching hospitals, whether they are in London or in any other great city. Merrison did not spend long enough looking at the problems of these hospitals. He quite properly described the teaching hospitals as "centres of excellence". That is true.<br/>
They are seen to be such, not only in this country but abroad as well. I am glad that they sustain and maintain their excellence. But that costs money. I liked Merrison's suggestion that there should be an inquiry&#x2014;at least in London.<br/>
I go along with the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch in believing that there is a strong case for an inquiry into the situation in which the 12 teaching hospitals are concentrated&#x2014;unnaturally in this day and age&#x2014;in a small area around London with its diminishing population in the centre. Nevertheless, to let these hospitals wither in any way at all would be a disaster. Also, to let them become so involved with other NHS responsibilities of primary healthcare that their specialist provision was diminished in some way would be a tragedy. These hospitals are in such a special position that they merit a further inquiry.<br/>
The House knows that I have never descended to the argument about the sale of drugs in the Health Service. It would be almost improper for me to do so. However, as the matter has been raised, I should like to comment on the cost of drugs. Let us get this in perspective. Out of a total cost of the NHS of &#x00A3;8,000 million, the total cost of drugs is &#x00A3;500 million. The real cost of the Health Service which comes from taxpayers' money is the 70 per cent. of &#x00A3;8,000 million which goes in wages and salary.<br/>
Merrison mentioned drugs in his very thorough report. He examined health services around the world and ways in which we could keep down the cost of drugs. He pointed out that in some countries&#x2014;in Australia, New Zealand and Denmark&#x2014;there is a limited list of drugs recommended produced by the Governments of those countries. The drugs that are recommended by bureaucrats and officials are prescribed free. If a consultant thinks that there is another drug which is an advance on the limited list, that drug must be paid for at the going rate. I do not deny that drugs are very expensive. I think that the limited list idea is appallingly bad&#x2014;not for any vested interest of mine, but because some people might be denied the best drugs and the best developments in medical science. That would be terrible. The Health Service was set up in 1948, and


ever since it has maintained the free availability of the very best&#x2014;of surgery, medical treatment and drugs. We must never lose that in this country, because it is important. I mention it only because it is mentioned in the report.</p>

<p>In a way, it is almost helpful that the hon. Member has mentioned that, because all of us in this House have to learn that the profits are determined by the Minister. They were determined by the hon. Gentleman's right hon. Friends until a few months ago. Now it is the turn of my right hon. Friends on the Front Bench. The profits of the industry and its costs are determined. No industry in Britain is more closely controlled by the Government than the drugs industry. I would be the first to support that Government action in so controlling profits. It is absolutely right.<br/>
I say one special thing to my right hon. Friend. This afternoon he talked about regional health authorities, saying that they would remain and would have a strategic planning role. It is important that they continue to have that role rather than lean over the backs of the stronger district authorities that are to be established, telling them what to do in the tactical sense. They are allocating their resources and letting district authorities get on with the job, and the delivery of the health care and the decision on the spot is up to the people nearest the point of delivery of health care.<br/>
As regards membership of the authorities, here I speak with a vested interest. My right hon. Friend should look very carefully into his thought that he might seek to pack RHAs in future with district membership, and no more than district membership. Certainly let us have representation on the RHAs of the district team view, but let us also have some other voices there that are not at the district level and are thinking strategically as well. In that way, I think that my right hon. Friend would get what he really wants&#x2014;the best decisions.<br/>
I want to speak on only one subject that arises from Merrison. Merrison has commented that the NHS is a service for consumers and that we must always start by considering the patient that it is intended to serve. But for once I want to speak not of patients but of the workers in the industry&#x2014;1 million of them. I want to deal with one aspect of the report which is very important indeed. That is chapter 12 concerning the industrial relations problem.<br/>
We have seen emerging in the last few years, particularly since 1973, strangely&#x2014;although perhaps it is not so strange&#x2014;an industrial relations problem in the NHS which was almost foreign to the Service hitherto. We have not expected to see certain reactions on the part of people in a dedicated Service. Be they consultants, nurses, ancillary workers, porters or whatever, we have expected them to be so dedicated that they would not react in a way which would do anything to injure their own dedication to their patients. Yet that situation has arisen. In the NHS, industrial relations are as important for the patients as they are for the workers.<br/>
We should also be reading, in conjunction with Merrison, Lord McCarthy's report on the working of the Whitley Councils. It is absolutely essential reading, together with the report we are debating. Lord McCarthy carried out a review of the work of the Whitley Council system. He then said that what the Government needed to do was to ensure that the review recommendations were carried out. It is one thing to write a report; it is another to see that a review&#x2014;and that means a change&#x2014;takes place.<br/>
Another thing which arises from the Merrison report is appendix H to chapter 12&#x2014;the evidence of ACAS. I go along with every word of that evidence. I quote from paragraph 39 of the ACAS evidence:
<q>Unless effective remedies are introduced urgently, we can see little prospect of avoiding continued deterioration in industrial relations&#x2026;and noticeably poorer quality patient care.</q>
ACAS has been called in far too much to put out the fires in the Health Service in recent years to treat the symptoms. But no one has got down to treating the causes of the problem. Where we have industrial relations problems in the NHS


and disgraceful occasions such as we saw at the Charing Cross hospital&#x2014;behaviour which we all condemn&#x2014;there is something more than a symptom; there is always a cause. We must find out the cause and devise policies to put matters right.<br/>
A better system of industrial relations management is needed. Is the Whitley Council system good enough? Lord McCarthy asked this question. Are the reforms that he suggested good enough? Lord McCarthy, like the Merrison report, suggests that the Whitley Councils are never independent of the Government. The commission says in its report:
<q>the government apparently acts as both judge and prosecuting counsel in such disputes".</q>
The question arises whether an independent commission should be established to help solve industrial disputes in the Health Service. Should there be a review helped them very much. What about body? One element, the doctors and the dentists, have a review body. It has others who work in the Health Service? Do they need help from someone like Clegg? Or must they rely on a rather antediluvian Whitley Council system? The commission says:
<q>We hope that Lord McCarthy's review will lead to improvements. As pay negotiating bodies, the Whitley Councils are weakened by being insufficiently independent of government.</q>
Health workers, like anyone else, are affected by the disastrous impact of inflation. They are also affected as employees of the biggest employer in Britain, a massive, impersonal organisation called the National Health Service. Those workers&#x2014;whether they are consultants or porters&#x2014;have grievances from time to time. They feel that the system for dealing with such grievances is, to say the least, a bit sluggish. It does not always appear to hear them, let alone understand them. In short, the system for coping with their problems is inadequate. ACAS has found this to be so. Its report referred to a lack of industrial relations expertise in management. It found that personnel officers had no past experience in industrial relations. Even more startlingly, it found that there is no statutory duty for personnel officers to be appointed, let alone have a voice in the decisions of the district management teams. Those personnel officers tend to be non-committal. They tend to have little effect.<br/>
Management must show its readiness to listen and its competence to make decisions in industrial relations matters. Another fault in the management structure is failure to operate effective line management. Decisions in industrial relations are all too often passed upwards. That is a sure recipe for dissatisfaction and frustration. Problems should be settled at the point where they arise&#x2014;on the shop floor, at the point of delivery. There must be more delegation and decentralisation. There also needs to be clarification of who manages whom.<br/>
There are too many separate organisations within the Health Service. The man or woman with a grievance does not know who can settle the question. Lord McCarthy was concerned about the absence of professionalism in industrial relations at the grass roots. So am I. Lord McCarthy thought that Whitley Councils could still do a useful job if they were reviewed. I believe that they should be reviewed. I am not sure that they should not be replaced by something better.</p>

<p>I should be glad to take up the remarks of the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch) on industrial relations if I had more time, but in the circumstances I shall concentrate on certain specific questions to the Minister and raise one matter which, I believe, was not covered by the Royal Commission in any satisfactory fashion.<br/>
First, I put my questions to the Minister. In the so-called trade-off between the level of service which the patient can expect and the level of wages which employees in the National Health Service can expect, what absolute level of wages is he prepared to allow the employees to sink to in order to preserve the structure of the NHS? That question arises at once from the logic of what Ministers are saying, and I shall be grateful if the hon. Gentleman will be more specific about it in his reply tonight.<br/>
Second&#x2014;very much on the same issue&#x2014;there is the financing of the nurses' pay settlement arising out of the Clegg recommendation. Will the Minister give a specific assurance that the Government will finance every penny of whatever settlement is negotiated on the Nurses and


Midwives Council and give that money to the area health authorities to pay out? The answers on that question which we have had so far have not been entirely clear.<br/>
I come now to the big problem with which the Royal Commission did not deal, namely, the problem of control and of power within the National Health Service. Who controls the National Health Service? Is it Parliament? We vote the money for the Service, but in no sense do we control the day-to-day delivery of the services. Nor do we control the level of aggregate spending, since that is the job of the Executive and, in particular, of the Treasury.<br/>
Does the DHSS itself control the National Health Service? Again, I think that the answer must be "No" because of the way in which the Treasury dominates macro-decisions about the level of health spending. The DHSS has some power over internal relativities and over internal methods of allocating resources to different sections of the Service, but again there is no real power over day-to-day delivery of health services.<br/>
Is the Treasury in control? This is the crunch question in the context of public expenditure. The Treasury controls in direct fashion all the spending in the NHS, and hon. Members need no reminding of that.<br/>
Are the area health authorities and regional health authorities in control? I argue that they, too, have no direct control over delivery of services, which are primarily the responsibility of doctors, whether in hospital or in the community, and aggregate spending at that level is determined by, so to speak, social factors through RAWP and other mechanisms.<br/>
Is it the doctors who control the NHS? My answer is "Yes, partly it is", because they control the day-to-day delivery of services through key aspects such as prescribing habits.<br/>
Is it the public who determine policy in the National Health Service? Again, I say that it is not, since the public have no direct control over the membership of the area and regional health authorities as they are at present constituted.<br/>
Finally, one must put a big negative against the possibility that control is exer-

cised by workers employed in the National Health Service, whatever their level or responsibility may be.<br/>
The real power structure of the National Health Service is therefore poly-centric, with power being exercised by the Treasury on macro-issues, by the doctors on day-to-day delivery aspects of the Service, and by Civil Service mandarins in the DHSS and elsewhere over the internal shares of the NHS cake.<br/>
The distribution of power within the Service is profoundly unsatisfactory, and the Royal Commission did not address itself to this issue in a realistic fashion. There are no recommendations for democratising our National Health Service, and I regard that as a deplorable failure on the part of the Royal Commission.<br/>
In company with many hon. Members&#x2014;the point was made by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) earlier in an intervention&#x2014;I believe that there should be a more direct method of election by which people at the community level could determine for themselves who would sit and represent them at district health authority level and regional health authority level. Only in that way will the system really serve the purposes of the NHS by reflecting the needs and aspirations of the public as a whole in the 1980s.<br/>
From the point of view of a Labour Back Bencher, therefore, I believe that we must do more than just regard Merrison as defending the National Health Service at this time and defending it against the iniquities of the present Government's policy. We have to strike out in advance of the Merrison proposals and argue for fundamental democratic changes within the NHS to make possible greater control by the public, by health workers and by the House of Commons. These changes are necessary because of the manner in which the Treasury, the Civil Service mandarins and the doctors presently control the NHS.<br/>
There is another argument to support my belief that the Royal Commission is important but not crucial. What would happen if all the commission's proposals were implemented overnight? There would be high public expenditure and a great improvement in the Service in many areas. However, the crucial test is that


the implementation of the report would not protect the NHS one iota from monetarism, control by the Treasury or domination by the doctors.<br/>
The debate, important though it is, has to be set in that wider political context. The implementation of the report's recommendations would not protect the NHS from the problems foisted on it by the policies of the Treasury, the Prime Minister and the Conservative Party.<br/>
When discussing the need for fundamental changes of that character in the scope of the NHS, it is important to recognise that the NHS will never be the same again. Following reorganisation in 1974 and the imposition of public expenditure cuts by successive Governments, in no way would the public or the workers in the NHS accept continued domination of the Service by those presently in control. Nor will they accept, on a continuing basis, the method of financing that is presently ruining the Service. I am referring not to the basic principle of financing by general taxation but to Treasury control.<br/>
We need to open out decision making to a broader, democratic group of elected representatives. We must return to the House a number of important decisions about aggregate spending in the NHS that are currently glossed over.<br/>
The position is clear. As the hon. Member for Canterbury intimated, in no way can the industrial relations position return to what it was before 1973. We must determine that there will be better industrial relations within the NHS based on clear integration of ancillary and nursing staff in decision making. If we ignore that, we will be putting forward a prescription for total disaster inside the NHS, which is something that no hon. Member would wish to see.</p>

<p>The saddest part of the Merrison report is its unequivocal endorsement of compulsory fluoridation of the public water supply. I wish to devote my short speech to that subject because, as hon. Members will know, I am chairman of the all-party Anti-Fluoridation Committee.<br/>
We are committed to stopping the artificial fluoridation of public drinking water, and 83 hon. Members have signed early-day motion 93 to that effect. No

doubt a number of my right hon. and hon. Friends who are in the Government would sign the motion but for the rule of practice which prohibits the signing of early-day motions. I hope that a number of hon. Members will still sign it.<br/>
It is well known that the reason why no Government have legislated for fluoridation is that such legislation would not get through the House. The majority of hon. Members on both sides feel strongly that, whatever the medical argument for or against fluoridation, to force every citizen to drink water that has been medicated in accordance with the wishes of so-called experts, whether or not they need it and wish for it, would be a gross deprivation of personal liberty. It would be a betrayal of one of the fundamental justifications of our presence in this place, namely, to protect the individual against the insidious incursions of the collective State and its bureaucracy, especially since that State's record of being right in things medical is not entirely without blemish.<br/>
Those who advocate mass medication do so in contempt of individual freedom. I can understand why some people in power or influence think that freedom is less important than saving life, which is why I can understand the argument for stopping cigarette smoking or making seat belt wearing compulsory. But I find great difficulty in understanding their preoccupation with fluoridation, which does no more than delay the onset of dental caries in children's teeth by a year or two. It does little or nothing to stop the decay once it has started. A reduction of dental decay in one tooth for a year or two is no solution to the problem of tooth decay and is certainly not worth mass medicating for. The authority for that is the Department of Health's own report in 1969 on "Fluoridation studies in the United Kingdom and the results achieved after 11 years". That report is available from Her Majesty's Stationery Office.<br/>
Quite simply, I want to demonstrate to the House not the question of freedom but the scientific aspect of fluoridation. I want to show how grossly irresponsible and misleading the Merrison report is in recommending fluoridation on the assurance that it is completely safe. I do not know whether it is endorsing fluoridation safety in ignorance of the evidence or with knowledge of it and in order to


deceive. Of course, I prefer to believe the former, although I fail to understand how the Merrison Commission can possibly be ignorant of the evidence as it is now receiving such widespread circulation.<br/>
Either way, no credit is due to that body for its irresponsible judgment in that regard. The apt slogan is perhaps that none are so blind as those who will not see. The commission relies upon the 1976 report of the Royal College of Physicians, which said that there was no relationship between cancer mortality or cancer incidence and fluoride levels in water supplies. To ordinary people, those words mean that no one has come forward with any evidence. If that is too narrow an interpretalion of the phrase, at any rate ordinary people would understand it to mean that there is no reputable evidence of any harm from fluoridation. Either way, that assertion is bogus and it is quite terrifying, as the evidence is that many people may be dying from drinking artificially fluoridated water.<br/>
Let me present some of the evidence. My point is merely to show that there is a doubt about its safety so that the House can consider whether that is so and whether there is justification in the sentence in the Merrison report on page 119, paragraph 9.59, that
<q>the safety of fluoridation in recommended quantities is no longer in doubt.</q>
To begin with, there is the evidence and studies of Dr. Aly Mohammed, professor of biology at Missouri university, that sodium fluoride in a concentration of one part per million produces genetic damage to mice. There is the evidence of Dr. Donald Taves, associate professor of toxicology at Rochester university, that if it is shown that fluoride is a mutagen, it would increase the probability that there is a causal connection between it and cancer.<br/>
There are the studies of Drs. Hershkowitz and Norton, of the department of St. Louis university, that fluoride induces tumours in fruit flies. There is the evidence of Dr. Marvin Schneider man, chief statistician of the National Cancer Institute in America, that a substance tending to cause tumours would probably be a "red flag" for cancer. There are the studies of Drs. Taylor

and Taylor of Texas university showing an increase in tumour growth rate in mice fed on one part per million of fluoridated drinking water.<br/>
There is the evidence of Dr. George Waldbott, an eminent United States physician, who has personally examined 400 patients suffering from fluoride poisoning, that fluoride in drinking water at one part per million gradually causes cancer death in sensitive individuals. There are the studies of Okanura and Matsuhisa showing positive correlations between food fluoride levels and stomach cancer. There are the studies of Litvinov and others, showing a possible correlation between airborne fluoride and lung cancer. There are the studies of Klein and others indicating that fluoride at one part per million interferes with the repair of DNA and the availability of the chemical-building blocks of DNA and RNA.<br/>
There is the evidence in 1975 and 1976 of Messrs Burke and Yiamouyiannis in the United States that the 10 largest fluoridated cities in America compared with the 10 largest unfluoridated cities show such a sharp increase in cancer mortality after a period of fluoridation that between 10,000 and 35,000 people may be dying each year as a result of drinking artificially fluoridated watered. Yiamouyiannis has compiled a collection of studies, 12 of which show a possible relationship between fluoridation and cancer once they have been corrected for errors and omissions.<br/>
Most of that evidence was considered in a court case in the United States last year. The decision of the judge, after hearing five months' evidence, was:
<q>Point by point, every criticism that the defendants made of the Burke Yiamouyiannis study was met and explained by the plaintiffs.</q>
The plaintiffs were the citizens of the town trying to stop the fluoridation. The judge went on to say that
<q>often the point was turned round against defendants. In short, this court was compellingly convinced of the evidence in favour of the plaintiffs".</q>
He went on to refer to significant evidence. The climax of that evidence was the answer by one of the witnesses, Dr. Taves, on behalf of the defendants, to the question whether it was his testimony that he would recommend fluoridation in public water supplies. He said:
<q>I do not want to state on that.</q>


How can it possibly be said, by any stretch of reasonable analytical objectivity, that there is no evidence? That there is evidence that is disputed is one thing, that there is no evidence at all is quite another. But when a court of law considers both sides of the evidence&#x2014;witnesses giving evidence on oath&#x2014;and reaches the conclusion that, point by point, all the anti-fluoridation arguments have been upheld, how can it still be said that there is no evidence?<br/>
When the Sub-Committee on Social Services and Employment considered the question of preventive medicine, we received a letter from a university lecturer who said that he had been growing watercress in fluoridated water. He said that the fluoride concentrated in the watercress, putting man at the end of a poisoned food chain. There is much evidence, stretched across the continents of the world, to the effect that fluoridation is a dangerous way of curing anything.<br/>
A professor of chemistry at Kansas university, having reviewed the evidence of fluoride's contribution towards kidney disease and bone disease, concluded:
<q>Despite whatever reduction in tooth decay can be achieved by fluoridation, there is a steadily growing amount of solid evidence showing that fluoride in drinking water at the officially recommended concentration of 0&#x00B7;7 to 1&#x00B7;2 parts per million causes serious harmful effects to its users.</q>
That is not all. In 1977 the government of Quebec, before fluoridating their water compulsorily, set up a high-powered committee to look into the subject. It was not made up of cranks. It was made up of high-powered scientists, upon whom the government of Quebec placed their reliance. On the question of the effects of fluoride upon the ecology, the committee concluded:
<q>Although there is a lack of information regarding the effects of accumulation of fluorides along the food chains, there is enough evidence to conclude that the actual presence of fluorides above certain levels in the aquatic environment is causing important biological damage to both the plant and animal systems.</q>
On the question of cancer it concluded:
<q>What is implicit in this study is that fluoridated organic compounds and the fluoride ion may be as potent carcinogens as chlorinated organic compounds.</q>
It went on to say:
<q>The possibility of formation of fluoridated organic compounds either during the water

treatment process in public waterworks or during later use by industry&#x2026;should be of utmost concern to all who are interested in public health.</q>
The decision of the Quebec government was to recommend an indefinite moratorium on water fluoridation for the province, that there should be basic and applied research in the area of fluoride intoxication, that the fluoride levels in the environment should be monitored, and that fluoride levels in food should be monitored to determine the exact level that is digested by people. It is no use adding one part per million to the water supply if one has not the faintest idea how many parts per million the ordinary individual has in his system already.<br/>
Recently the figures for Birmingham and Manchester have been published. An analysis shows that for the period 1953 to 1963, before fluoride was added to Birmingham water, the cancer death rate had risen more slowly in Birmingham than in Manchester. But Birmingham water was fluoridated in 1964, whereas Manchester water was not fluoridated, and during the period from 1965 to 1967 there was an 8&#x00B7;2-fold increase in the cancer death rate in Birmingham as against only a 1&#x00B7;5-fold increase in Manchester.<br/>
How can it possibly be said that there is no evidence and no doubt? If responsible scientists are in dispute, there is a doubt, regardless of which side is right. It is, therefore, of small wonder that practically every other country in Europe, with the exception of Ireland, has either stopped fluoridating its water or has never fluoridated.<br/>
For goodness sake, let the Government stop saying that they support fluoridation. For goodness sake, let them remove from their mind any possibility of legislation. For goodness sake, let us have a moratorium on fluoridation until the matter has been more thoroughly investigated. If we cannot trust the scientists to make an unbiased judgment, let us have a proper committee, supervised by a High Court judge.<br/>
The British people do not want fluoridation. They can remember how they were betrayed on numerous occasions, and most significantly on the question of thalidomide, by the scientists. I earnestly ask the Government to reconsider their whole attitude to this subject, whatever their scientific advisers may say.</p>

<p>I want to return to the problem of the inner city, because it was that which the Royal Commission report described as deserving of the most immediate and urgent attention.<br/>
As an inner city Member, I am dismayed by the Government's indifference to the problem, as revealed by the Secretary of State's speech today and in their document "Patients First". Perhaps they spelt "patients" wrongly, because what they are asking us to do is to wait and wait and wait. My feeling is not just one of dismay; it is one of great disappointment that I express on behalf of people in an area such as mine who are having to face tremendous misfortune and hardship.<br/>
I should like to illustrate, as quickly as I can, some of the problems as they have been presented by the community health council in my area. The Secretary of State has put great emphasis on the need to develop community care. I agree with that, but we need more than words.<br/>
There should be 66 health visitors in Hackney; there are 41, and 10 students. There should be 79 district nurses; there are 46, plus six in training. There should be 17 community midwives; there are only 11. General practitioners are expected to maintain in Hackney a list size of 2,500, so technically Hackney is over-doctored. It is, therefore, extremely difficult for new GPs to work in Hackney and no allowance is made for the fact that in a district of high morbidity and poor social conditions 2,500 may be too big a list.<br/>
I ask the Minister whether he will consider trying to work out a system of payments which takes account of the difficulties of inner city areas. It is one very good reason why urgent attention should be given to the problems of London.<br/>
When we turn to the maternity service, we find another sad and sorry state of affairs in Hackney. I illustrate it by reference to a submission made by the community health council to the area health authority and to the regional health authority about the inadequacies of the maternity service. At the Mothers' hospital, clinics are grossly overcrowded. There is no privacy in the booking clinics. Mothers, many of them suffering from high blood pressure, must wait far too

long. Indeed, a two-hour wait is common at the antenatal clinic.<br/>
The district management team considers that seven minutes is adequate for first appointments and five minutes for follow-up appointments. Doctors must see between 80 and 100 women in a morning, and no effort is made to ensure that patients see the same doctor on each visit. Those problems are faced not only in Hackney. They are faced in many inner city areas but particularly in London. There is need for an urgent inquiry into these matters.<br/>
The Minister should know that Hackney has a poorly developed community midwifery service and that there is a particular problem affecting Asian mothers. There are no facilities for interpretation, although almost 25 per cent. of births are to Asian mothers at the Mothers' hospital. It is not good enough to tell those mothers that they must bring an interpreter with them. It is often the husband, who has to take time off work, or an older child who has to interpret. How embarrassing that must be for those Asian mothers. I believe that interpreters should be made available at clinics at certain times. Those are some of the practical problems.<br/>
The members of the community health councils are dedicated and caring people who express great concern for our problems and have done an enormous amount of valuable work in alerting our communities to these problems. They have tried to find solutions. Yet there is a guillotine poised over the heads of community health councils, as we note from the document "Patients First". The Government say that authority members will be less remote from local services than many of them necessarily are today and that the need for separate consumer representations in these circumstances is less clear.<br/>
There is no evidence to support the proposition that community health councils should go. They are an invaluable watch-dog, and that has been proved in practice. I believe that, although this Government may be afraid of the role played by community health councils, the case for keeping them is overwhelming.</p>

<p>I was pleased to hear my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State say


that he will continue with the redistribution of health care resources and that he will give twice those increases to the less-well-off than to the better-off. That is of tremendous help to the North-West. Our region is at the bottom of the poll if we consider all health items together and has been so for many years.<br/>
At the rate of redistribution of resources under the last Government, it would have taken the North-West a quarter of a century to catch up with the South-East. The announcement, in July, of a &#x00A3;172 million hopsital&#x2014;the biggest hospital programme ever undertaken in the North-West&#x2014;will accelerate our rate of catch-up.<br/>
I always believed that coterminosity in health care anywhere was a mistake, but in my area it was a disaster. Until 1974, hospital services in Kendal and Lancaster were integrated, and despite reorganisation nobody has succeeded in reversing that happy relationship. Senior medical staff in Kendal are appointed to the Lancaster group of hospitals and the majority of their contracts oblige them to work both in Kendal and in Lancaster. There has been a history of affiliation between our hospitals for many years and the flow of patients is naturally between Kendal and Lancaster. There has been a close relationship between the hospitals, and even the plan for a new 300-bed hospital in Kendal&#x2014;costing &#x00A3;11 million&#x2014;still envisages that 50 beds will be provided in the Lancaster hospital for the treatment of patients from Kendal.<br/>
The towns are only 22 miles apart, which in rural terms is not much, and it is, therefore, quite easy to live between them and be within reasonable reach of either. Many of the consultants from Lancaster live across the Cumbrian border.<br/>
The Lancaster hospital pathology department provides a range of services unequalled anywhere in the North-West that is fully available to patients from Kendal. The Kendal service is completely integrated with that of Lancaster, and it is absolutely vital that this is considered when decisions about the structure are made. That is the natural patient flow, and we hope that the Secretary of State will take that into consideration when making his decision.</p>

<p>I welcome back to our debates the hon.<br/>
Member for Reading, South (Dr. Vaughan), who missed the Second Reading of the Health Services Bill because of ill health. I am pleased to see him back on the Front Bench.<br/>
I shall not deal with organisation or pay beds, because we gave those issues a good run when we discussed the Health Services Bill. We shall press for a debate on London's health services as demanded by my hon. Friends the Members for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown) and Hackney, Central (Mr. Davis) and the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Crouch), not only on teaching hospitals, but on the shape of the London regions and the inner city and other problems which must be discussed.<br/>
The Royal Commission did a first-class job. Most hon. Members agree with that. I thank Sir Alec Merrison and his colleagues. They have served the nation well. That does not mean that we agree with everything that they said. Their views on mental illness hospitals are controversial. I agree with my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) and my hon. Friend the Member for Wood Green (Mr. Race), who said that the commission produced an "on the one hand, and on the other" approach to local democratic control. The idea of making regional health authorities responsible to a Select Committee is a little wide of the mark. The two Front Benches agree about that.<br/>
To the extent that Ministers agree with the Royal Commission, they will forge a health service which is of inestimable value to the British people. To the extent that they depart from it, they will run the risk of inflicting damage on one of our most highly regarded institutions.<br/>
I am pleased that the opportunity has been taken by hon. Members on both sides of the House to refer to prevention. The Royal Commission was clear about that. In chapter 5, paragraph 3, on page 41 of its report the commission states:
<q>it must be understood that many of the main improvements in the health of the nation have come not from advances in medical treatment, but from public health measures, better nutrition and improvements in the economic, social and natural environments.</q>
One of our most important tools in prevention is the immunisation programme. For years children and others have been immunised with increasingly


beneficial results. The trouble is that a decreasing number of children are being immunised because of parental anxiety about the possible detrimental effects of immunisation in a few cases. That anxiety applies in particular to the whooping cough vaccine. We should sympathise with and help to allay those parental anxieties.<br/>
There is little doubt that a proper compensation scheme has a part to play in restoring health and improving our immunisation programme. However, the Government have said that they will not introduce a proper compensation scheme for vaccine damage. That is appalling and regrettable. We support the sentiments of early-day motion 325.<br/>
[<i>That this House deplores the Government's refusal to establish a compensation scheme for vaccine-damaged children; endorses the view of the Pearson Royal Commission that there is a special case for paying compensation for vaccine damage where vaccination is recommended by public authority and is undertaken to protect the community; recognises that the Vaccine Damage Payments Act does not purport to provide a compensation scheme; and calls upon the Government to introduce a compensation scheme as favourable to vaccine-damaged children as the industrial injuries and war pension schemes are to the industrially injured and war disabled.</i>] We urge the Government to think again.<br/>
The Vaccine Damage Payments Act provides &#x00A3;10,000 compensation for vaccine damage to children as an interim measure.</p>

<p>I am in total agreement with the Secretary of State. He must have misunderstood me. The &#x00A3;10,000 was an interim payment.<br/>
If the Government are not now to introduce a full vaccine compensation scheme, another issue arises. All those children who have been considered for the &#x00A3;10,000 scheme will have to have

their cases reopened and reconsidered with a view to the possibility of their receiving more compensation.<br/>
The honour of the Government, irrespective of party, is involved in this issue, and I hope that the Government will look into it. We believe that Mrs. Fox, in her campaign for justice, is entirely right and her case must be conceded.<br/>
The Secretary of State made a fairly pathetic contribution on the subject of fluoridation. He is obviously not going to do anything. This is a serious matter, and if we had been returned to office we would have legislated by now because there is a gap in the law. My right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Mr. Ennals) explained clearly that the law allows water authorities to fluoridate the water if the area health authority wants it done. The difficulty is that few water authorities believe that they have the power to do this without legislation. So legislation is required to solve this problem.<br/>
The Minister will find that if he does not legislate he will get nowhere. The minority represented by the hon. Member for Burton (Mr. Lawrence) will have won, once again, during another Parliament. I sincerely ask the Minister to take that matter in hand or to take up the idea of my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Pavitt) and support a Private Member's Bill.<br/>
Smoking is another important issue. I accept that there are two major constraints on smoking policy. First, a number of people, in good faith, have put their skill into the industry in times past and they must be allowed to adjust to new Government policies. Secondly, smoking is a difficult habit to break, as I know, having been a smoker myself. This fact imposes its own restraints on any action. As the Secretary of State said, the biggest avoidable cause of ill health today is smoking.<br/>
The Government are now embarked on further negotiations with the tobacco industry aimed at restricting further the possibility of damage to the nation's health from this cause. As the Minister who negotiated the current agreement, I have no hesitation in saying that the new agreement must be tougher than the last, and each succeeding agreement should form part of a continuing progression of toughness in the future. I shall put for-


ward five principles on which I suggest the new agreement should be based.<br/>
First, cigarette advertising should be restricted as close to the point of sale as possible and should be aimed at giving information about tar content and other such matters.<br/>
Secondly, the health warning should be placed on the front of the packet and it should be tougher. What about "Danger. Government Department Health Warning. Cigarettes cause bronchitis, heart disease and lung cancer"?<br/>
Thirdly, no new brand of cigarette should be introduced with a tar content in excess of 15 milligrammes and a special tar-related tax should come in at that level. This means extending the two-year derogation from the EEC on tobacco taxation and increasing its scope. I believe that the Government must do this because the lives of our people are at stake. In this area, as in so many others, Common Market regulation is becoming the enemy of good government in this country.<br/>
Fourthly, why not make it compulsory to record on the packet the carbon monoxide emission of a cigarette? After all, we all want freedom of information these days, and that would be a contribution.<br/>
Fifthly, should not the same principles inspire the whole of Government policy, whether it be the Department of Industry's grants, the Department of Trade's attitude to exports, the Department of the Environment's sponsorship of sports, the Chancellor of the Exchequer's level of taxation or even the Prime Minister's attitude to recommending people for honours?<br/>
If we could get all this into the new agreement, there would be advantages in allowing it to extend to four years rather than the three years of the current agreement. This is a concession I would be prepared to make.</p>

<p>That is so at present because only a minority of adults smoke.<br/>
I turn now to the question of the social services. So far this issue has not been mentioned in the debate, although it is crucial to any discussion of the Health

Service. The Royal Commission said at page 258 of its report at the beginning of chapter 16:
<q>it is essential to have the easiest and most efficient collaboration between the NHS and local authorities.</q>
But perhaps we have a straw in the wind. The Secretary of State is to close down the Personal Social Services Council from 31 March. I do not know why. It consists of eminent and respected people in the social services. Who on earth would not want the advice of Mia Kellmer Pringle, for example, on children in such a context? The council always gave me and my right hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North very good advice. The Association of County Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities both gave substantial support to the continuation of the council's work.<br/>
Is the council to be closed because it was monitoring social service cuts? If that is the object, it is a busted flush from the beginning, because the Social Priorities Alliance will be monitoring them. I imagine that the Association of Directors of Social Services will. In any case, we shall.<br/>
I hope that, as with the Central Health Services Council, much of the valuable work will be continued. I think of work on such matters as ageing in later life, collaboration in community care, intermediate treatment on which a consultative group has been set up, a code of practice for voluntary private boarding houses and fire precaution problems in the same sort of institutions.<br/>
Why should we look for the straws in the wind when the gale is already blowing? I have already said, when I spoke in the Budget debate last year, that the NHS was probably being undermined by cuts in the social services which were looming. Now, the Secretary of State for Social Services has made his own contribution. In a press statement of 1 November last year, he called for a 5 per cent. cut in the personal social services. He has been trying since to repair the damage done by that statement, saying that it is entirely up to local authorities where they cut.<br/>
But the message has gone out, and all the other departments in local authorities now realise that there will be no penalties to pay to the Government if they cut the social services budget by 5 per cent.


or more. So, when the NHS is under greater pressure than it has been under for years from the financial point of view, it is being put under increasing pressure again because the social service budget, which takes a great deal of the load off it, is also being savagely cut, more savagely than any other aspect of Government expenditure.<br/>
What will this mean? Elderly people will be unable to leave hospital&#x2014;they will be left bed-blocking, which is more expense for the NHS&#x2014;because there will be a lack of support for them in the community. There will be a lack of meals on wheels, or they will be more expensive, and a lack of home helps, or they will be more expensive. There will be a continuing dearth of day centres, my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Mr. Carter-Jones) might like to note. There will be a lack of home visiting support. Elderly people will also be retained in the community, unsupported, when they should be in hospital.<br/>
What is to happen to the mentally ill, left in the big isolated mental hospitals? That will be more expensive for the NHS. The hon. Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman) mentioned the large mental hospitals. They will be around longer and will be under more strain. There will be less care of the mentally ill in the community.<br/>
What is to happen to the Jay report, with its carefully postulated scheme of community care?<br/>
I am sure that it is politically astute to cut social services. Their clients are the most inarticulate section of the community. That will also mute the people who speak on their behalf in social services departments. That is what the Government's policy will lead to.<br/>
I turn to the problem of charges. All the Opposition Members who took part in the debate referred to it. The hon. Member for Canterbury thought that it was not politics to talk about it. Of course it is. Raising money is bound to be politics. We are still left with the following problem. Will prescription charges be increased yet again beyond 75p in the coming year, and will the exemptions be restricted? The Financial Secretary to the Treasury has said that he would contemplate that. The Secretary

of State has not denied it, nor has the Prime Minister.<br/>
Why is this happening? The Royal Commission and the Government part company here. The Royal Commission has already said that it recommends the abolition of charges. Nevertheless, prescription charges are going up, by about 300 per cent.<br/>
On top of that, the road accident charges are going up by between 500 and 600 per cent. I have never heard of anyone volunteering to take part in a road accident.<br/>
Why are charges going up? Is it to educate the public on the matter of costs? It cannot be that, because the public use the Health Service only on the basis of professional judgment. If professional people do not recommend the public to use the Health Service, the public, generally speaking, will not make use of it. Is it a means of raising more money? It cannot be that, because we all know that to the extent that money is raised in that way the Treasury will reduce its central grant.<br/>
These are all reasons why I contend that charges are totally inappropriate. In addition, charges breach the principle of taking care of people free at the point of use. So long as we have a charge, that charge can be increased. We are receiving a first-class demonstration of that by the Government. The charge that was levied by the Labour Government, which was being phased out by inflation for over five years, has increased twice. There is a threat that it will increase a third time. It is proposed to levy a road accident charge. Once a charge exists, there is no argument in principle for not increasing it until the pips squeak. That is what the Government are doing.<br/>
The Secretary of State is advocating an insurance scheme. I do not have time to make detailed criticism. The right hon. Gentleman thought that he had pulled out a brilliant rabbit from the hat when he talked about going to a Belgian hospital and finding only two people in charge of issuing bills.</p>

<p>If there were two such people employed in every hospital in


England, there would be an extra 5,000 Health Service employees at a time when we are trying to cut the cost of administration. If the right hon. Gentleman's example were implemented throughout the United Kingdom, there would be more people employed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the same basis. That would add between &#x00A3;25 million and &#x00A3;35 million to the National Health Service's wage bill.<br/>
There is no point in commisioning a study of insurance funding of the NHS, because all the information is available to the Secretary of State. It is readily understood by even the simplest intellect. There are only two conclusions that the right hon. Gentleman can reach. He can reach them now without more ado.<br/>
If a patient is a drag on the economy&#x2014;that is what the Government seem to be coming more and more to accept&#x2014;he is no less a drag if the money for his treatment is raised by a source other than general taxation. If the country is to continue to care for the sick&#x2014;no one has suggested that it should not&#x2014;the economic burden must be met. If it is not met by general taxation, the cost must be met in some other haphazard and inefficient way. I take it that no one is arguing that we should stop looking after the sick.<br/>
On the basis of morality and efficiency, the best course for the NHS is to raise money by general taxation and to spend it comprehensively on a service for the nation that is free at the point of use.<br/>
For the reasons that I have outlined, I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote in favour of the Opposition's amendment.</p>

<p>First, I thank the right hon. Member for Lewisham, East (Mr. Moyle) for his kind remarks. It is good to be back in the Chamber again and good to be able to listen to the right hon. Gentleman's thoughtful comments. It will cause him no surprise when I say that I do not agree with the mojority of them.<br/>
The debate has ranged extremely wide. It is right that it should have done so. As the hon. Member for Brent, South (Mr. Pavitt) said, it is difficult to think of any aspect of health care that has not

been commented on in the report of the Royal Commission.<br/>
I add my tribute to that of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to Sir Alec Merrison and his colleagues for the work that they have done that went into the report. I do not think that our appreciation of the devoted work that is carried on day after day by NHS staff has come through in the debate to the extent that I know it is felt in the House.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State opened the debate with characteristic authority. He gave the Government's overall view on the Royal Commission's report, and particularly the Government's overall view of the financial situation. Therefore, I do not propose to go into that in detail again.<br/>
I shall concentrate almost entirely on the points that have been raised by hon. Members. I find it extraordinary that the Opposition have put down any amendment. It has at once introduced, once again, a quite unnecessary party conflict on the subject of the Health Service. We deeply regret that. I should have thought that we could have at least one debate on this subject without such an amendment. There is no escaping the fact that the Labour Party has used the Royal Commission as an excuse. Year after year it has used the Royal Commission as a cover for drift. It has regularly criticised the reorganisation of 1974, but it did absolutely nothing about those things that it criticised.

<p>I know that it is unpleasant and uncomfortable, but I am putting the facts as we have found them. Labour Members know that these facts are true. They are the unpalatable features that have led us to receive the recommendations of the Royal Commission. We have had five years during which waiting lists have risen by 170,000. We all know what that means in terms of personal tragedy for thousands of sick people. Nearly 750,000 people are on our waiting lists. That is the highest figure on record in this country. It is the highest figure for any part of Western Europe or for any civilised country. Those are the problems.<br/>
While the numbers of general staff within the National Health Service rose by about 12 to 13 per cent., the administrative staff were increased, under the previous Labour Government, by just on 30 per cent., from 90,712 to 117,743.</p>

<p>Many hon. Members have spoken and, as I said, I wish to take up the individual points that have been made.<br/>
During that period, morale in the National Health Service throughout the country fell to a level that we had never known before. That is so much so that various professional bodies find it necessary to draw special attention to it in their reports. We have had five years of a series of the most damaging industrial actions against patients, culminating in the appalling strikes of last winter. More recently, who can forget the horrifying spectacle outside Charing Cross hospital?<br/>
I hope that instead of scoring party political points Labour Members will recognise that health care should not be a battleground for political parties. We should work together to raise standards and bring about the kind of Service that we all want.<br/>
I was reminded just now that one in20 of our working people are employed within the National Health field. It is therefore not surprising that, as my right hon. Friend reminded us, even a 1 per cent. wage increase costs &#x00A3;37 million, which is equivalent to the treatment of 80,000 patients, 2,000 hospital beds or the dialysis machines that my right hon. Friend mentioned.<br/>
I was also astonished, on coming to office, to realise that over the past few years there have been procrastination, dither and delay in making decisions. I know it can be explained why that occurred, but it has been extremely damaging to the Service. That is why one of our first actions, for example, has been to issue a clear guide to management for handling industrial upsets. It is available to management and staff. We have sent it out with a request that all people working within the health field should have it available to them. It is most important for all the staff to know exactly where they stand. Unashamedly, we have said in that document that patients must be safeguarded at all times. That must come first.<br/>
That is the background against which we have received and examined the Royal Commission's recommendations. It is one reason why we have not come forward with detailed proposals for action on every one of the 117 recommendations,


even if we agreed with them all. We do not believe that at this stage the National Health Service can stand changes other than those that are essential. That is why in "Patients First" we have gone for a philosophy of making the Service more local&#x2014;more responsible to local authorities within each individual unit.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme), in a rather passionate opening, made great play of prescription charges. He knows that every, time the Labour Party has been in Opposition it has promised to abolish those charges. Every time it has been in Government it has reintroduced them or put them up. We have already had information on that.</p>

<q>When the service is short of funds for priority tasks, there is no case for holding down prescription and other charges.</q>
That is a direct quote from "The Right Approach" in 1976. Let us hear no

more about all these hypothetical charges which people throw at us for party political purposes.<br/>
Let us recognise that there is a finite limit to the amount of money that any nation can make available for a health service. That has been said by Aneurin Bevan, by the right hon.

<p>That is why I was so sad when I listened to the remarks of the right hon. Member for Norwich, North about private practice. Labour Members are still obsessed by the private practice aspect of health, even though the Royal Commission said that it is an insignificant part of health care in this country.<br/>
I make no apology for the fact that, although we see a need for a thriving and viable NHS which is available to everybody who needs it, we also feel that we must look at health care in this country generally. We see a need to bring extra resources into health from whatever source is willing to make them available. That is why we talk of developing the private sector in partnership, and not in conflict, with the NHS. That is why this morning at Stoke Mandeville I was with Jimmy Savile in his appeal for money to rebuilld that special centre for spinal injuries.</p>

<p>I quote from a speech made by the right hon. Member for Huyton in this House in October 1975 when the Royal Commission was being set up. He said that it was inevitable that there


were limits to what the taxpayers could provide, and later he said:
<q>I must also make it clear, as my right hon. Friends have already made clear, that the Government are equally committed to the maintenance of private medical practice in this country and we intend to guarantee this in the legislation we propose."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 20 October, 1975; Vol. 898, c. 36]</q>
The right hon. Member was quite clear on that, and so are we.<br/>
A number of hon. Members have spoken, quite rightly, of the problems of inner city areas, and the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Mr. Brown) said that patients had suffered. This is something to which we are giving great thought.<br/>
The Royal Commission, while supporting, in a slightly lukewarm way, the concept of health centres, also said that it would be quite wrong to press doctors into working in health centres against their wishes. I would agree that that is wrong. It also pointed out that it is possible for doctors, nurses, health visitors and so on working in a community to work in close conjunction with each other&#x2014;not in local authority planned centres but in group practices and the like.<br/>
Therefore, we have been looking very carefully at the way in which the health centre programme has been developing in this country. We have concluded that health centres should continue to be developed&#x2014;for example, in some inner city areas in places where there is a clear benefit to the community by having a health centre&#x2014;but not in the face of opposition by the local general practitioners. It is a disgraceful waste of resources to have, as we have now, at least two health centres which areempty because doctors will not work in them. That makes no sense to anyone.<br/>
We are, therefore, looking at the other tack. In the Health Services Bill, which is about to be considered in Committee, there are proposals for increasing the amount of money which can be loaned to doctors through the General Practitioner Finance Corporation, increasing the borrowing power by four times, to &#x00A3;100 million, and at the same time, for the first time&#x2014;this is very important&#x2014;enabling the General Practitioner Finance Corporation to lease premises to general practitioners. We are looking at the possibilities of extending the opportunities

to undertake some private practice from health centres&#x2014;which is permitted at present but is not always easily available.<br/>
Finally, the right hon. Gentleman referred again to the problem of industrial relations. I was glad to hear what he said about the subject of industrial disputes holding back the regional secure units. This is something about which we, too, are very concerned. I am glad that there is agreement between the two sides of the House.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Mr. Mellor) made a very constructive speech.</p>

<p>I happen to know that my hon. Friend is deeply concerned with a number of problems of health care in his constituency. No one could accuse him of not having a genuine anxiety to do what he can to help in the health field. He was talking about the value of insurance. We recognise this. My right hon. Friend has already referred to it.<br/>
I must be honest. It was very good indeed to see the right hon. Member for Norwich, North so obviously in better health these days. However, I was disappointed that he did not face more squarely the very difficult situation which developed under his hands. He talked about the need for better industrial relations. He asked what progress was being made on procedures at local level for handling industrial disputes. This matter is being pursued. The General Whitley Council is well advanced in its discussions between the management side and the staff side. We are looking forward to receiving agreed conclusions very soon. No doubt the right hon. Member will make comments on them when they come.<br/>
The right hon. Member also asked what effect on the NHS any increase in gas prices would have. All that I can say is that he has obviously forgotten the words in "The Way Forward", where the problems of fuel, fuel costs and the likely difficulties are examined on page 41, as are the difficulties ahead that we may well face. It is not only gas prices but increases in the prices of all kinds of fuel that have to be taken into account. It is sad for me to find these days the number of hospitals, newly built, that are costing over &#x00A3;1 million to heat and ventilate


because they were not designed in a way that is economic in fuel use.</p>

<p>I was obviously referring to the recent Government announcement under which gas prices are to go up dramatically. The document to which the hon.

<p>I must move on rather rapidly. My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton, in a most effective speech, talked about the value and importance of preventive medicine and the Health Education Council. We have been having discussions with Dr. Lloyd, chairman of the Health Education Council, to see how the council's work can be made more effective and whether it might be advisable to reduce the range of work it devotes to health education in order to increase its work in other areas. My hon. Friend also mentioned the question of vaccination. This was also raised by the right hon. Member for Lewisham, East. I shall return to the matter in a moment.<br/>
While on the question of preventive medicine, I believe that we could totally eradicate in this country the problem of rickets. It is a disease that is extremely damaging to young children and also presents a major problem to certain mothers when they are feeding their babies. This condition was virtually eradicated until the late 1960s and the early 1970s. At the moment, it is almost entirely a problem of immigrants. I shall not go into details. We are having meetings with the leaders of the immigrant community to see how best we can bring the education aspects of this matter to the attention of members of immigrant groups. I believe that this will be success-

ful and that we shall see the end of rickets in this country once again.<br/>
My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Thanet, West (Mr. Rees-Davies) made an important comment when he referred to the use of the media in carrying out this kind of health education. That, again, is a matter that we have been discussing.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton also mentioned the subject of mental illness. We give it great priority. We hope to bring to the House shortly the long-awaited updating of the 1959 Mental Health Act. We hope to place provisions for the mentally handicapped in a separate section.</p>

<p>We are also working rapidly on that.<br/>
The hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux) made a short and constructive speech. My hon. Friend the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office came into the Chamber to hear the speech and asked me to say that he will take up the points that were put. I cannot resist the comment that the hon. Member made on the importance of small hospitals, but I will not pursue that now.</p>

<p>I shall write to the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Newark (Mr. Alexander) referred to the problem of mixed sex wards. This practice has been spreading steadily throughout the Health Service. It is not a desirable practice. It is forced on hospitals by the difficulty which they sometimes have in making the best use of their beds. We are having discussions about it.<br/>
One thing that has been made clear to me&#x2014;it is understandable&#x2014;is that patients will come into hospital, they will not comment on what happens, but they resent it very much and will comment afterwards. We have been receiving a number of letters from patients who were apparently happily looked after in hospital but who were not in fact so happy. It is particularly the lavatory and bathroom provision which worries them. I assure my hon. Friend the Member for


Newark that we have taken the matter very much on board.</p>

<p>I should like to reply to the important points raised by the hon. Member in a written answer. I say that because they raise the whole question of RAWP and resource allocation and the way we propose to see that a larger allocation&#x2014;not a very big one; I do not want to raise the hon. Gentleman's hopes&#x2014;goes to the parts of the country which are in greatest need.<br/>
The hon. Member for Brent, South spoke about fluoridation, and I hope to come to that in a moment.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Dover)&#x2014;I must refer to this in passing&#x2014;spoke of what is happening in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for North Fylde (Sir W. Clegg). I pay tribute to the work which Pat Seed does there. It took a little while to arrange, but through the local health authority we have now managed to arrange for the staffing&#x2014;that was the difficulty; the extra member of staff needed&#x2014;to supervise the running of that important scanner.<br/>
A number of hon. Members have spoken about London, and I respond to them in this way. We have had a series of inquiries on London. What we need is some action. There are at present two inquiries in progress&#x2014;the university inquiry under Lord Flowers and the</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Lewisham, East made a very thoughtful speech, although I could not agree with all that he said. Without doubt, there is some misunderstanding over the vaccine damage scheme. I should prefer to deal with this on another occasion, but I must make clear now that at no time has the &#x00A3;10,000 payment been regarded by the Labour Government or by ourselves as compensation. In my view, that would be quite wrong. But the right hon. Gentleman is quite right in saying that this is a matter which we cannot brush on one side, and we are looking at it. More important, I think, is to ensure that the assessments and payments are made more rapidly than they are at present.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That the draft European Communities (Definition of Treaties) (Multilateral Trade Negotiations) Order 1980, which was laid before this House on 15 January, be approved.</q>
This order, laid under section 1(3) of the European Communities Act 1972, constitutes an important step in the implementation of the agreement reached in the Tokyo round of the multilateral trade negotiations. The negotiations started in 1973. There can seldom have been less promising circumstances for the world's trading nations to be discussing the reduction of barriers to trade and the reduction of tariffs than during the last six difficult years.<br/>
It is a matter of pleasure that the negotiations were brought to a successful conclusion when participants from the main developed nations signed an understanding in April 1979. Subsequently, in July, the detailed results of the tariff negotiations were set out in a tariff protocol. Taken together, the Tokyo round agreements constitute the first general revision of the principles governing the conduct of international trade since the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade came into force 30 years ago.<br/>
The House debated the Tokyo round package on 29 June 1979, and I explained then the Government's support for the agreements which have been negotiated. The period since 1973, following the Middle East war and oil price rises, has not been a good time for this type of negotiation. But both the present Government and their predecessor have, nevertheless, sought a positive and successful outcome to the Tokyo round.<br/>
A country as dependent on exports as is the United Kingdom would have been very ill placed indeed to cope with a general increase in protectionism which. I believe, could well have been the outcome of a failure in the Tokyo round negotiations. The positive outcome which has been achieved should, on the other hand, provide increased opportunities for export sales of which competitive United Kingdom firms will be able to take advantage.<br/>
When the negotiations were concluded last summer, the focus turned from negotiating to the implementation of the results of those negotiations. I think it would be true to say that the United States implementing legislation, to fairly widespread surprise, was passed quickly into law in July 1979. On 20 November last year, the EEC Foreign Affairs Council accepted a proposal by the Commission&#x2014;which had been examined by the Scrutiny Committee of this House in the usual way&#x2014;that it should agree to conclude the agreements on behalf of the Community. The Government supported this decision; indeed, we would have preferred the decision to be taken earlier. Following the Council's decision in November, the Community was able to join with the other main industrialised participants in signing the negotiated agreements.<br/>
Signature took place in Geneva on 17 December, that is, shortly before most of the agreements came into force on 1 January 1980. Countries which, like ourselves, had not completed their parliamentary procedures signed the agreements subject to their subsequent approval through their various constitutional processes.</p>

<p>Precisely who was involved in the negotiations on behalf of the EEC? Was it officials of the Commission, or did the Commission recruit a team of persons from the Governments of the member States?</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1714173" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-01-23a.582.1" hansard_membership_id="3748" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19327" speakername="Mr. Parkinson" colnum="582" time="22:12:00">
<p>As the hon. Gentleman knows, the Commission negotiates on behalf of the member States, but I think it would be true to say that at every single stage of the negotiation the Commission was being watched and guided by representatives of the member States. The United Kingdom Government were very well represented at every stage of those negotiations and at both official and at ministerial level the direction of the Community's negotiations was settled by the member States.<br/>
The bulk of the implementing action is being undertaken through Community legislation&#x2014;for example, new regulations on countervailing and anti-dumping, new customs valuation regulations, the new Community tariff for 1980, and so on. The drafts of all these, and the Government explanations of them, are being


brought before the Scrutiny Committee in the usual way, and the necessary action has been completed on the agreements which came into force at the beginning of this year. The House has therefore had several opportunities to consider these documents.<br/>
In the White Paper we put forward the Government's view on the agreements. In the debate tonight, the House will have a chance to comment. But every agreement listed in the order will be translated into Community legislation. The draft directive will be brought before the Scrutiny Committee. The Government have been very anxious to make sure that the House has had a chance to consider these measures. The House, rather unusually, will have had no fewer than three separate opportunities to do so.</p>

<p>Is is correct to say that these treaties will be brought before the Scrutiny Committee? The position of the Scrutiny Committee at present in relation to the definition of treaties is indeterminate. As the House knows, there was a resolution of the Procedure Committee which has not yet been carried out.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1714175" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-01-23a.583.1" hansard_membership_id="3748" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19327" speakername="Mr. Parkinson" colnum="583" time="22:12:00">
<p>May I say to the hon. Member, who has taken on one of the most important jobs in the House in chairing the Scrutiny Committee, that tonight we will approve the agreements in this order as they were signed on behalf of the Community and its member countries. However, each of those agreements in detail will have to be translated, by directives, into Community law. Each of them, in turn, will come before the Scrutiny Committee&#x2014;a number have already done so&#x2014;so that that Committee may examine them and decide whether it is happy to see them adopted by this House.<br/>
Within the United Kingdom, an order under section 1(3) of the European Communities Act 1972 is necessary so that multilateral trade negotiations agreements should have full effect in United Kingdom law. Last year there was only a short time in which to do this between the approval of the negotiated agreements by the Foreign Affairs Council at the end of the year.<br/>
This House approved a draft order similar to the present one on 10 December, but the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments was unable, for very good reasons, to complete its consideration of the order in time for it to be approved by the House of Lords and made in 1979. So the Government withdrew the draft 1979 order and have instead brought forward the present draft I am glad to say that the 1980 draft order was cleared by the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments at its meeting yesterday.<br/>
No practical difficulties will result from the short delay necessary for Parliament to give proper scrutiny to this order. However, it is important that the present draft order be made reasonably soon so that the United Kingdom's reserve on its signature can be removed.<br/>
Three agreements in the MTN package are not proposed for specification in the order. The supplementary tariff protocol and the two agreements relating specifically to the agricultural sector do not need to be specified in the order either because they have been signed by the Community alone, and not by the United Kingdom, or because they are not of such a nature as to have a direct effect.<br/>
All the other agreements negotiated in the Tokyo round have been specified for the reasons set out in the explanatory memorandum. In general, these reasons are that the agreements concerned have been signed both by the Community and by the United Kingdom and they contain provisions which we judge might be held to have a direct effect. The nine agreements are covered in one order since they are closely related in their subject matter and have been negotiated as one package.<br/>
The various agreements specified in the order have been described in detail in the White Paper on the Tokyo round, Cmnd. 7724, which was published in October and their texts have been published as Command Papers. Tonight I can touch only briefly on each agreement and shall concentrate on their effects in the United Kingdom.<br/>
The tariff negotiations, whilst not necessarily the most important part of the package, were amongst the most difficult to conclude. No firm, for understandable reasons, likes to see the tariff protecting its home market being reduced. Each


party to the negotiations naturally tailored its cuts to the circumstances of its own industry so that the cuts are balanced overall, though not necessarily product by product.<br/>
Nevertheless, I believe that the Community's tariff cuts are being implemented in an acceptable way for United Kingdom industry. That was an important part of the objectives of the United Kingdom in settling the negotiating mandate for the Community. The EEC's common external tariff on manufactured goods is being reduced in annual stages between 1980 and 1987 from an average level of 9&#x00B7;8 per cent. to an average level of 7&#x00B7;5 per cent. That represents an average reduction of about 0&#x00B7;3 per cent. a year.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend introduces an Adjournment debate on that interesting range of subjects, which demands much homework and time, I shall be happy to take part. Of course, we constantly examine the basis of our trade performance and the effect on our performance of tariffs, other countries' tariffs, non-tariff barriers and technical tariffs. Those are debated regularly in the Department. As usual, my hon. Friend the Member for Carshalton (Mr. Forman) has mentioned an important issue. I hope that he will write to me. I shall welcome the opportunity of debating the issue with him.<br/>
Additional assurances have been provided to the textile and paper sectors which were particularly anxious about the prospects of increased competition from imports. The Community has reserved its right to stop the tariff-cutting process after five years if the economic circumstances require it. The reciprocal tariff cuts of other participants in the negotiations will yield worthwhile export opportunities for a range of industries. That will apply particularly to our producers of chemicals, ceramics, wool textiles and various types of engineering products. The distinctive feature of the Tokyo round was its emphasis on tackling the non-tariff obstacles to trade which have

caused much anxiety to our exporters and have been reflected often in our discussions in the House.</p>

<p>I thought that the Minister said that the Community reserves its right to withdraw from the textile tariff concessions after five years. The White Paper, Cmnd. 7724, states that the Community has reserved its right to withdraw its textile tariff concessions when the present multi-fibre arrangement expires at the end of 1981. Has the position changed since the publication of the White Paper?</p>

<p>I shall be straightforward with the hon. Member. After five years we have the right to review the tariff-cutting process. If I am wrong, I shall deal with the question later.<br/>
The distinctive feature of the present round&#x2014;and the achievement of it&#x2014;is not the tariff cuts but the attempt to re-create a new set of rules for world trade and to tackle some of the non-tariff problems which have become a more obvious barrier to trade in some areas than tariffs. A number of agreements are aimed at dealing with those problems.<br/>
The customs valuation agreement and its protocol lay down detailed rules on the valuation of imports for duty purposes. Valuation is normally to be based on the price paid, or payable, for goods. Certain alternative methods are specified in order of precedence, for use in circumstances where this criterion cannot be applied. The agreement will require some changes in our Customs valuation methods, which will result in small decreases in duty paid in some cases, though in most&#x2014;the overwhelming majority&#x2014;the duty paid will be the same as at present. Our exporters will, however, gain a greater predictability and fairness in the valuation applied to their products, and hence in the duty paid, in some foreign markets.<br/>
The agreement on subsidies and countervailing duties elaborates the existing GATT rules on the imposition of countervailing duties against subsidised imports. As a result of the agreement, the Community has made some changes in its regulations on the imposition of such duties, designed to make them more precise. These changes will not impede the Community's ability to take action in defence of its industry. Signatories are


also committed to certain general principles about seeking to avoid subsidies that cause adverse effects for the trades of other countries with them.</p>

<p>Will the new rule that my hon. Friend is speaking about make it easier to take rapid action on such matters as dual pricing in America so that we do not have that tremendous drag on our trade?</p>

<p>What the agreements should do is to establish a set of rules and a way of enforcing them, or monitoring them, which I believe should benefit the United Kingdom. I believe&#x2014;and it is a widely held belief in this country&#x2014;that there are non-tariff barriers erected by other people to an extent that we do not erect them. Therefore, a fairer set of rules, cleaning up the rules of world trade, making sure that non-tariff barriers are in effect outlawed, and that there is a system for monitoring the agreements that countries will have signed of their own accord, must benefit us.</p>

<p>Does the fair set of rules that the Minister mentioned for controlling export subsidies apply to export subsidies on food exported by the EEC?</p>

<p>I can see myself ending the debate with a set of the parliamentary equivalent of IOUs. I should love to debate that subject again with the right hon. Gentleman.<br/>
I believe that the Community has been a force for liberalisation in the Tokyo round negotiations, but that it is an Achilles heel of the Community that we maintain the common agricultural policy in its present form, because it rather smudges our credentials as a force for liberalisation in world trade.<br/>
I should like to conclude what I was saying about the agreement on subsidies and countervailing duties. Under the agreements, we have gained the acceptance of all participants&#x2014;including for the first time and most importantly the United States Government&#x2014;of the GATT material injury criterion under which countervailing duties can be imposed only if the subsidised imports can be shown to be causing material injury to a domestic industry as a result of the subsidy. That is a major gain from the negotiations.<br/>
The existing GATT anti-dumping code, which dates from 1968, has been updated to bring its provisions into line with those of the subsidies and countervailing duties agreement. The Community will continue to be able to take the necessary action to protect British industry against dumped goods.<br/>
The agreement on import licensing procedures is designed to ensure that the ways in which import licensing schemes are administered do not cause unnecessary difficulties for traders. It requires no change in our practice, but it might require changes in some other countries' practices.<br/>
The agreement on technical barriers to trade is concerned to alleviate the difficulties that exporters can face from product standards and certification systems in force in the importing country. Under the agreement, an authority establishing a new or revised standard is encouraged to adopt an international standard where that is appropriate and to follow certain notification procedures before laying down a national standard when no suitable international standard exists.<br/>
The agreement also provides for improved information for exporters on existing standards, and improved access to certification schemes. The British Standards Institution and other bodies concerned with standards in the United Kingdom are encouraged to follow these practices, while our exporters should benefit from similar practices in other countries participating in the agreement.<br/>
An agreement has also been reached on the liberalisation of Government purchasing other than the defence purchasing of warlike stores. The agreement does not apply to nationalised industries. After the agreement comes into force in 1981, the procedures under which tenders are invited must be made public. Most contracts over &#x00A3;100,000 must be advertised in advance in specified journals. These and other provisions are designed to ensure that the purchasing authorities within the agreement's scope do not discriminate in their award of contracts.<br/>
Many of the procedures to be established by the agreement are similar to those contained in the EEC supplies directive 77/62, which came into force in July 1978. As a result, it is expected that the existing departmental arrangements under the supplies directive will largely be able


to continue on much the same basis as before.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that the United Kingdom was following the rules laid down in the directive and advertising public contracts throughout the EEC, and that in stark contrast the other EEC members were making only nominal gestures? Does the Minister agree that there were about 250 United Kingdom advertisements as opposed to 20 or 30 from the other member States?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is right. In the initial stages the United Kingdom adopted the directive and implemented it earlier than other member States. I am pleased to say that there has been a change. There is a growing proportion of advertisements from other countries and a diminishing proportion of advertisements from Britain. The figures for the last month that I checked revealed that France had an overwhelming number of advertisements. I accept what the hon. Gentleman said. The directive was slow to get off the ground in other countries. Britain's implementation was quicker. It now seems to be operating more fairly. A growing proportion of the advertisements is from countries other than the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>I had lunch yesterday with a United Kingdom supplier who is providing uniforms for staff of the Paris Metro. We might both ask ourselves, so what?<br/>
Finally, the section 1(3) order that is before the House specifies the agreement on trade in civil aircraft. The agreement provides for duty-free trade between signatory countries in aircraft, aero engines and some aerospace equipment. It also lays down certain general principles relating to Government support for pro-

jects, purchasing of aircraft by airlines, and other matters. The elimination of tariffs has not affected the Community's tariff on large aircraft, which is already suspended at zero, while the general principles are designed to help establish a modus vivendi with the United States, which is of major importance as a producer and increasingly, in a welcome fashion, as a purchaser of civil aircraft.<br/>
I hope that hon. Members will be able to see from that brief explanation, and from the extremely detailed documents that have been provided for the debate, that none of the obligations that the United Kingdom is assuming under the Tokyo round agreements is unduly onerous. The main agreements provide for a committee of signatories to oversee the operation of the agreement concerned and ensure that its provisions are complied with. I believe that we and the Community have sufficient influence to use that machinery effectively to make sure that the agreements are implemented in a balanced way between ourselves and the other participants.<br/>
Before concluding, I should say a brief word about one matter that is still outstanding in the negotiations and which the right hon. Member for Lanark shire, North (Mr. Smith) and I discussed in the debate in June. I then reported that the Government were committed to a successful outcome to the negotiations for a safeguards agreement. Unfortunately it was not possible to reach agreement within the time scale of the remainder of the negotiations. Negotiations on a code are, however, to continue within the GATT. The working party that will undertake these discussions is required to report back by the end of June 1980. I regret the delay, but I welcome the general willingness among participating countries to seek an agreed solution of the difficult issues involved.<br/>
In the meantime, our ability to protect the interests of United Kingdom industries remains as it was. While negotiations continue, article 19 action remains fully available to the Community, and the Government, while rejecting policies of general import controls, are, as in the past, prepared to consider the possibility of import restrictions where excessive imports are, in particular cases, threatening otherwise viable industries. As for selectivity, the EEC Commission has


indicated a willingness to consider requests for future safeguard action on the same basis as they have done in the past. That history includes the fact that article 19 has been used selectively by the EEC.<br/>
Apart from the outstanding issue on safeguards, the main aspects of the Tokyo round negotiations have been brought to a successful conclusion, and, I would suggest, a conclusion broader in scope than at one time seemed possible. I believe that the Tokyo round has been a most ambitious venture by the world's trading nations. At a time of great difficulty, they have turned their backs on protectionism and decided that the way to improve the standard of living of the people of the world is to expand world trade and liberalise the system.<br/>
In the agreements listed in the order we have set out to deal with problems such as technical barriers to trade, which are of themselves extremely difficulty to pin down. However, I feel that a worthwhile attempt has been made. We must now begin the big job&#x2014;that of implementing these agreements. We must make sure that the ambitions and objectives that the world's trading nations have defined for themselves are carried through in practice. These new rules, as defined, must be implemented and made to work. I believe that we shall all be the better for it, if we are successful in that large and difficult venture.</p>

<p>The House is grateful to the Minister for his explanation of the conclusions of the Tokyo round. We discussed the matter fully in June last year, and there is only one point in the hon. Gentleman's analysis on which I take slight issue.<br/>
I am flattered by the idealism that the Minister injects into the conclusions negotiated by the Labour Government. Those, like myself, who participated heavily in the negotiations would be wary of injecting too much idealism into them. The Tokyo round was a success because adjustments were made between a number of the negotiating parties. It was not always done in the idealistic spirit of liberalising world trade and the negotiations were certainly not always conducted idealistically.<br/>
I do not want to traverse the ground covered in June. It is important that the Tokyo round negotiations did not fail. A failure to agree the proposals set out as a result of the round would have set world trade back considerably, but we did not achieve a tremendous amount and some of the difficult issues, such as safeguards, have been put to one side.<br/>
I was pleased to note that the Government are adhering to the selectivity that the Labour Government argued was inherent in article 19. That view is not shared by all the rest of the world&#x2014;the developing countries would certainly dispute it&#x2014;but I hope that the Government will adhere to that view.<br/>
I wish to refer to the problem of textiles and dual pricing. I wrote to the Secretary of State some weeks ago and have not yet had a reply.</p>

<p>I hope that it is better than the draft that was probably put before the Secretary of State. It is not a joking matter, because it is of major importance to our man-made fibre industry.<br/>
The facts are simple. The United States gets an enormous price advantage out of the fact that its man-made fibre producers get their energy feedstocks at much lower than the world price. That deliberate policy of the United States gives a great advantage to its manufacturers.<br/>
During the multilateral trade negotiations the previous Labour Government were alive to the problem and the Council of Ministers decided on 3 April last year that, in the event of the dual pricing system giving rise to disruptive effects on Community trade, the EEC would not hesitate to take appropriate action by way of quotas or countervailing duties. Since then there has been a signal lack of action by the Community. The Government drew the matter to the attention of the Council of Ministers too late and the matter has been postponed, month after


month, to the February meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers.<br/>
Not only can the Council of Ministers take action, but the British Government can act to deal with the problem, and I suggested in my letter to the Secretary of State that they should not hesitate to take action. It would strengthen their negotiating hand within the Community and would make clear to our EEC partners and to the United States that we mean business.<br/>
There are a number of rumours from the Community that the United States is deliberately stalling. Every month in which the Community does not take action is another month in which the British market is penetrated by the unfair trading advantage of the United States'man-made fibre producers. It is time that effective action was taken. It has nothing to do with free trading, but a lot to do with fair trading.<br/>
I hope that the Government will not hesitate to take action. I understand that they are waiting for the February meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. I hope that the result is not some feeble application of countervailing duty of a few percentage points to make it look as if the Community is taking some token action. Nothing less than effective action will do to protect the man-made fibre industry in this country. We link this matter to the tariff-cutting process. As my hon. Friend the Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) rightly pointed out, the tariff-cutting process has a break at the end of five years. The whole process can be linked to progress on other matters. I hope that the Government will take much firmer action. This can be taken collectively. But if there is no action collectively, the capacity exists within the rules of the European Community for a sovereign Government to take action, at least on an interim basis, on their own account. I hope that the Government will take action and that the Minister will say that he expects real progress at the meetings on 4 and 5 February.<br/>
We have asked previously how these negotiations were proceeding. The report that the House received was in the form of an omnibus report from one of the Foreign Office Ministers. That was not satisfactory. I put the Minister on notice that, after the 4&#x2013;5 February meeting of the Council of Ministers we shall expect

the Secretary of State for Trade or himself to give a full report to the House on what has happened in the negotiations. These are of fundamental importance to the man-made fibre industry in this country. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will be able to announce some success in the negotiations. If not, he can expect round criticism not only from the Opposition but from some of his hon. Friends.</p>

<p>This is an ideal document. In an ideal world it would be just what many manufacturers are looking for. It is a first-class package. I am sure that it will be welcomed by all. The background supplied to the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments in paragraph 3 says that the idea is
<q>to provide a more secure framework of rules and procedures to encourage the continued expansion of world trade.</q>
My constituents and I agree, but we realise that an expansion of world trade does not necessarily mean an expansion of trade in the United Kingdom, especially in textiles. I am glad that the Minister had so much to say about textiles, especially wool textiles. I hope that he is certain that our share of world trade will expand. I think that it will if all EEC members and the other signatories stick to the agreement.<br/>
Paragraph 9 of the same briefing document, in a sentence which I do not fully understand, says:
<q>It is considered that each agreement contains provisions which may be directly applicable within the United Kingdom, although such questions can only ultimately be decided by the European Court.</q>
Are we to infer from that sentence that EEC countries, anxious not to abide by parts of the agreement when it suits them, can kick back the whole matter to the European Court and waste time? Will we be in a French lamb situation? The old GATT rules had no authority to impose sanctions. Nor were there any sanctions to impose. Has that changed?<br/>
I have read the documents carefully. I should like to refer to those on countervailing duties and anti-dumping. I understand that under the last GATT regulations on dumping and subsidisation it had to be proved that dumping was taking place, that the action was causing material injury to Community industry,


not simply to our industry, and that the imposition of duties would be in the Community interest and not just ours. Do the new rules change that situation? Are we the signatories? Or is the EEC? A footnote says that "signatories" means parties to this agreement. Is that the United Kingdom? Or is it the EEC? If it is the United Kingdom, so much the better.<br/>
The first few articles in each agreement, while setting out procedures, highlight the built-in delays. For instance, article 2.14 of agreement 7658 says that one year may be taken to reach an agreement. Although article 2.10 mentions provisional measures, no time scale is laid down in that article, or in the article contained in the anti-dumping measures, that gives us a hint of how quickly we or the Community can act. Throughout that article the term "speedy action" is used. But how speedy is "speedy"? If I have read the documents aright, we cannot interfere with goods already in Customs.<br/>
The definitions laid down defining injuries caused through subsidisation and dumping are clear. However, may we be told whether damage to domestic producers covers not only their loss of trade in this country but the knock-on effect and the subsequent damage to their export potential? May we also be given clarification of exactly how a third non-signatory country is involved? For example, when clothing is imported into this country from Hong Kong via Italy, how do we intend to deal with the third country? We cannot do it at present. Perhaps the Minister will explain how that can be done.<br/>
Somewhere in the document I read that we have to discover and prove our competitors' manufacturing costs. Is any information forthcoming from the Government to assist private firms to cost their competitors' textile goods? The Wool, Textile and Clothing Action Committee is at present investigating the cost of imported suits, which will cost &#x00A3;75,000.<br/>
Finally on these two agreements, what are the Minister's thoughts about how he will deal with a cargo of, say, yarn or golf balls that has been dumped and which is far outside an equitable share of world trade by any yardstick? Such a cargo having been dumped, the trade cannot be retrieved. Once the toothpaste

is out of the tube, how do we get it back? Will industry be allowed to exclude cargoes that have been dumped until the damage done to trade can be repaired?<br/>
I want to say a word about the technical barriers code, contained in agreement 7657. It is industry's opinion that the opposite of what is laid down in that code happens. Others will be able to quote examples from their own constituencies. I shall mention only fire extinguishers.<br/>
In Sowerby there is a firm called Nu-Swift, which exports fire extinguishers that are produced to a high technical standard. The experience of that firm is that there is manipulation of technical standards in Community and other countries. I believe that the experience of that company is common<br/>
I am told that the technical department of Nu-Swift has been negotiating with the French for five years, seeking approval for the company's products, and has met with delays and deliberate procrastination. The Danes have apparently carefully written a new technical standard which is different from any other in the world to protect that country's industry. The Germans, Italians and French; who voted in favour of a defined EEC standard, have as yet given no indication of adopting that standard and that code.<br/>
If article 5 is accepted by all Governments many of the troubles will be swept away, but will foreign industry allow foreign Governments to adopt this code? Will other countries besides Canada, the United States of America and Japan accept the tariff protocol?<br/>
My correspondent quotes Australia, Brazil, Malaysia, Equador, Venezuela, New Zealand, Kenya and South Africa as countries with negligible tariffs against goods coming to this country but punitive tariffs and restrictive licences in the other direction. If these measures do not work, manufacturers in this country will press for counteraction of the sort that I know the Minister deplores.<br/>
My last point relates to Government procurement agreements. The hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer), who carefully read the speech that I made on 13 November, has made some of the points that I wanted to make. I am glad to hear that the situation with regard to advertising has improved. What happens when our manufacturers reply


to those advertisements? In one case, where a manufacturer replied to a German police tender he was told curtly not even to send representatives. In other cases, manufacturers have deliberately been misled and messed about.<br/>
These documents would be first class if we could be sure that they will be implemented in other EEC countries as fairly as we know they will be in this country.</p>

<p>I agree with the Minister that we must welcome the successful result of the Tokyo round. I also agree that it has to be launched at a remarkably unfavourable moment in world trade as a whole.<br/>
However, there are some points which the Minister did not make entirely clear. I asked whether the subsidy rules applied to food exported from the EEC, and I take it that the answer is "No". If I am incorrect, perhaps the Minister will let me know later. Secondly, although he spoke on the legal aspects of this order, which, after all, is a definition of treaties order, I was not exactly clear whether he was saying that these tariff changes are already in force in the United Kingdom, whether this order brings them into operation in the commercial as well as the legal sphere or whether some further step is to come. May we know exactly when the changes are to be made?<br/>
Thirdly, the Minister did not say much about some of the wider applications of the results of the Tokyo round. Presumably, the changes generally will lower United Kingdom tariffs on imports from sources outside the EEC. I presume that that is one part of the operation. However, apart from Japan, it is not so much imports of manufactured goods from outside the EEC but rather imports from within the EEC that are now causing so much trouble to British industry.<br/>
In 1979 our deficit in visible trade in manufactured goods with the EEC Six was nearly &#x00A3;4 billion, and any discussion of our present trading situation which ignores that fact is a little unreal. The fact is that something must be done to correct it if British industry is to survive.<br/>
I have recently heard a good deal of discussion in all sorts of quarters about the economic and trading consequences if the United Kingdom were to withdraw

from the EEC. There is no harm in having a little discussion about that. It seems to me that the tariff reductions and, indeed, the other changes made in the Tokyo round should enable us to examine this issue rather more clearly.<br/>
Some people imagine that United Kingdom trade has been so drastically switched and redistributed by EEC membership that if we withdrew there would be a major upheaval and all sorts of markets would be closed to us. But, interestingly enough, the figures&#x2014;which the Minister did not quote, and I do not complain of that&#x2014;show that that is almost totally untrue. Although our membership has imposed an enormous balance of payments burden on this country, it has not switched our trade geographically nearly so far as many people seem to believe.<br/>
Figures quoted in <i>The Economist</i> on 17 November 1979 show that whereas in 1972, before entry, Britain took 68 per cent. of its total imports from the non-EEC world, in 1978 it still took 62 per cent. That was no violent switch. In 1972 exports to non-EEC countries accounted for 70 per cent. of total exports, and the figure was still 62 per cent. in 1978. We are still doing over 60 per cent. of our trade with the non-EEC world. That should be the background to the debate.<br/>
It is rather surprising that we still took 75 per cent. of our total food imports by value in 1979 from sources other than the old EEC Six. It follows that withdrawal from the EEC would not mean as major an unheaval as some seem to think, but a gradual shift back of the percentages to the more natural and less distorted figure that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s.<br/>
Withdrawal would do something more important in the trading sphere. It would give us the option of imposing these new and more moderate Tokyo round tariffs on manufactured imports from the rest of the EEC, as well as from the rest of the world, if we so wished to do. It would not compel us to do so, but it would give us that option.<br/>
I hear much talk in the Palace of Westminster and elsewhere about import controls. I would have more sympathy with those who advocate import controls if they frankly advocated outright withdrawal of Britain from the EEC. We cannot impose import controls on EEC goods


unless we withdraw from the EEC. It is no good putting import controls on Japan without putting import controls on the EEC, because Japanese imports would, in many cases, be replaced from the Continent.<br/>
Three or four years ago I would have advocated that if we withdrew from the EEC we should rejoin the EFTA group&#x2014;which has done remarkably well outside the EEC&#x2014;and practise, as Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and Austria now do, industrial free trade with the rest of the EEC as well as EFTA. We could have done that in the early 1970s.<br/>
In view of our trade deficit in manufactured goods, and because EEC membership has done so much damage to British industry, especially the motor car and steel industries, I am afraid that for a time we would have to adopt the alternative of imposing these new Tokyo round tariffs on manufactured imports from the EEC if we were to withdraw from it. That would not be such a terrible reversal of policy, considering how low the tariffs are at present. It would mean that the other EEC countries would impose corresponding tariffs on Britain. I believe that we have reached the stage where we would gain by that double operation.<br/>
We also hear talk from time to time about a siege economy for this country as the alternative to EEC membership. That sort of philosophy seems to spring from a certain amount of ignorance about the facts of international trade, because to impose the now very moderate Tokyo tariffs on manufactured imports from Germany, France and Italy&#x2014;the same tariffs that we are imposing anyway on imports from Japan, the United States, Canada and many other countries&#x2014;would be to adopt not a siege economy but a very moderate policy for this country, and would indeed extend the normal way of conducting international trade.<br/>
As an illustration of what this sort of change would involve I should like to ask the Minister one concrete question. Can he tell us what is the present EEC common external tariff, after the Tokyo round, on motor cars on the one hand and on manufactured steel goods on the other? That would show the sort of changes that would be involved.<br/>
All that I want to do, apropos the order, is to ask hon. Members to start

examining these options seriously in the light of the changes now being made, so that we may have some intelligent view of what would be the economic consequences of withdrawal, because we shall never have any real economic recovery in this country until we free ourselves from these restrictions.</p>

After all, the Tokyo round staggered to a conclusion last year after six years. It was because it came to a conclusion that, as the right hon.

If all the agreements are implemented there will be a degree of greater liberalisation of trade, and to that extent we can congratulate those who were responsible.

<p>By the time the subject comes to this Chamber we are in the difficulty that the experts have worked it out in two arenas, and the Government must surely be satisfied that what has been obtained is the best that could possibly be obtained. Perhaps the better Committee to discuss the merits of these agreements and their implications for British trade and industry would be the Select Committee on Industry and Trade rather than the Scrutiny Committee. The agreements represent a degree of progress in the area of international trade, and I welcome that.<br/>
With regard to the anti-dumping provisions, there are notable improvements in the system that will apply henceforth.<br/>
There are greater powers on the part of the Commission. The fact that to institute a dumping complaint one does not need to show even a prima facie case, but merely sufficient evidence to be accepted by the Commission, is a great advantage to British industry, because as from that point the Commission takes over and has a duty to investigate, get at the facts, and pursue the case.</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that this Parliament now has no anti-dumping powers against the EEC in terms of Community obligations?

<p>That is not true. In its wisdom this Parliament decided that the best way of tackling this problem was by concerted action with the other members of the EEC. By that concerted action we expect to get better results, and I am sure that that will be the case. It is a good thing that the Commission should, in future, be responsible for pursuing anti-dumping complaints and carrying, one hopes, its action to a logical conclusion.<br/>
The point has been made concerning Government procurements that there should be a fair balance and that the list which the Government have as a result of the agreement&#x2014;there is provision for adding to it&#x2014;should be such that we are not at a disadvantage compared with those industries on lists submitted by other countries. I am sure that the Minister will keep a close eye on that to ensure that there is reciprocity and a fair balance.<br/>
This is a complicated subject and the issues involved are extremely important to trade and industry in this country. Because we now have additional powers, additional opportunities for trade and additional weapons to defeat the scheming of foreign competitors outside the EEC who do not observe the rules, it is important that our industries should be well advised about the tools available.<br/>
I hope, therefore, that the Department will make sure that there is wide propagation of information about the opportunities now available as a result of our adoption of these provisions.</p>

<p>I am delighted that as a result of the careful scrutiny of the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments this instrument is once more back on the Floor of the House of Commons for examination. It is a slight document, covering a massive range of negotiations. It cannot be faulted technically, but it behoves all Committees of the House to look at every document with great care, otherwise things which are far more important than hon. Members realise will slip through.<br/>
I want to speak briefly about the textile industry. As a background to the present condition of the industry, the draft annual report of the Bradford chamber of commerce states:
<q>Nowhere are these problems more acute than in the wool textile industry, which still comprises a very important proportion of the membership of the Chamber. That this industry is basically a well equipped, modern and efficient industry is beyond doubt, but the adverse factors enumerated above, sharpened by the difficulties caused by subsidised and dumped imports, are causing serious concern.</q>
It is natural, therefore, that when we examine something as wide-ranging as this instrument&#x2014;which involves a reduction in tariffs&#x2014;we should do so with a close and critical eye<br/>
Can the Minister say how, under the subsidies and countervailing duties agreement, the Commission will determine the principles for deciding injury? Can duties be imposed only when subsidised imports cause injury to domestic industry? Some people would argue that the textile industry has already suffered a significant degree of injury, and that often the Commission delays action until the damage has been done and cannot be remedied<br/>
As has been mentioned already, the idea of having technical regulations and standards is all very well when it is universally applied. Britain does not apply technical regulations and standards to imports to a significant degree. For example, the Health and Safety Executive does not examine imports. I asked a question about that some time ago. We have those powers under section 6 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act. Safety standards are specifically exempt from the non-discriminatory arrangements. I ask the Minister to consider the universal application of safety standards to imports of manufactured goods.<br/>
I turn now to the anti-dumping agreement. We have no anti-dumping powers. I hope that the anti-dumping arrangements will be applied effectively and that the Minister will bring pressure on the Commission to apply those powers. An anti-dumping unit is maintained by the Department of Trade. It was originally maintained by the previous Labour Government. However, it is virtually impossible to prove dumping. There is no reason why the Government should not consider changing the onus of proof. The importer should have to prove that the goods that he is importing are not being sold at dumped prices. The industry should not have to prove that they are. It is difficult for a manufacturer to gain access to the documents which may prove dumping.</p>

<p>The issue is more complex than that. Anti-dumping does not have to affect any one place, such as Sowerby, but damage to the industry in the Community must be proved. Therefore, an industry in one part of the nation can be wiped out so long as production continues in another part of the Community. In that case, anti-dumping orders are irrelevant.</p>

<p>The wide definition of "industry" creates the difficulty. By virtue of our membership of the Community we are not able to take effective action against other members or the Community. If we suffer from any blemishes in the Tokyo round, we shall be at a further disadvantage because of opposition within the EEC.<br/>
I have reservations about Government procurement. The agreement's aim is to ensure the principle of non-discrimination between domestic and foreign supplies. That is nonsense. It is a waste of energy for uniforms for the Paris Metro staff to be manufactured in Britain and taken to France, and for a French manufacturer to make uniforms for the London police and cart them here. That is an absurd waste of energy. That is called trading, but we must understand that thousands of jobs are lost in the textile industries every month. Preferential procurement by the Government and local authorities by massive contracts for all types of services can save those jobs. It seems daft to put people on the dole in York-

shire while contracts for uniforms go to other Western European countries, such as Germany, which do not depend on the textile industry as much as we do.<br/>
This is not simply a matter of saying that it is trade. We must discriminate. The view of the Labour Party and the TUC is that if we are to solve the problem of deindustrialisation we must exercise discrimination through quota and import controls, and that is right.<br/>
I entreat the Minister to clear up a consequential matter that has been raised tonight. The basis of the debate is also Cmnd. 7724&#x2014;the White Paper on the multilateral trade negotiations 1973 to 1979. Paragraph 22, entitled "Staging of Tariff Cuts", states:
<q>The Community has reserved its right to stop the tariff cuts after five stages in 1984 without proceeding to the last three stages, if it judges that the economic or other circumstances at the time require this.</q>
That is straightforward, but paragraph 18, which I quoted earlier, under the general heading "Textiles", states:
<q>In addition, the Community has reserved its right to withdraw its textile tariff concessions in the absence of a mutually acceptable arrangement regarding international trade in textiles. This relates to the continuance of acceptable arrangements after the present Multi-Fibre Arrangement expires at the end of 1981, and parallels a similar reservation in the US textile offer.</q>
That seems specifically to spell out that there is a reservation in the tariff concessions applicable at the end of 1981. Will the Minister confirm that that is so? Will he also confirm that the Government are committed to a renewal of the multi-fibre arrangement? If so&#x2014;this is an opportunity to do that and it is relevant to the debate because it is in the White Paper&#x2014;the industry will have some element of improved confidence. The industry is in need of a fresh injection of confidence. The Minister's earlier remarks and the remarks of the Secretary of State have not injected confidence about the future of the textile industry, which is facing a number of problems. If the hon. Gentleman could answer those questions and affirm clearly and unequivocally that the Government are committed to extend and improve the multi-fibre arrangement. it would be very useful.</p>

<p>I am concerned about the remarks made by the hon. Member for


Keighley (Mr. Cryer) vis-a-vis uniforms crossing the Channel in each direction. If I interpreted his remarks correctly, he was implying that we should be self-sufficient in all products. This country has always had to export or die. In order to export, surely we must specialise. That is the basis of our international trade and of our successes in latter years.</p>

<p>I think that the opposite has been implied. I should like to come back to this point and tie it in with the need for greater efficiency in many of our industries, which protection does not help in many instances.<br/>
I welcome the Minister's statement in the context of the interests of the Midlands, Coventry, the South-West in particular, and almost anywhere where engineering takes place in the United Kingdom.<br/>
Engineering is a harassed and beleaguered industry and it has often felt that, while this country has played the game in terms of international trade, other countries have not. Therefore, measures on anti-dumping, on the harmonisation of international or national standards, on Government purchases, and particularly on non-tariff barriers, are to be welcomed.<br/>
If, in current circumstances, I were to look at the main candidate for antidumping treatment, I should look to the COMECON bloc. In particular, I should look at the Lada car, which many people strongly suspect is supplied to purchasers in this country at a price which, by no stretch of the imagination, can cover the costs of manufacture and transportation. In the current political climate, at which the very top of this Administration is looking, this may be an economic measure which has a political as well as a fair trading basis. I should record that 22,000 Lada cars are imported into this country each year. This is more than the number of cars imported into this country by companies such as Mercedes

or Lancia, which operate from Common Market countries.<br/>
Turning to national standards, I am reminded of an amusing, if not farcical, situation which arose inside the EEC. Manufacturers of fork-lift trucks in this country were amazed to discover that the European standard for this vehicle had been changed to incorporate a detachable fuel tank, a feature in which French manufacturers specialise. It happened that the French lobbying inside the EEC had been exceedingly effective, to the disadvantage of British, German and Scandinavian manufacturers. I hope that the measures announced tonight, dealing with national standards and the harmonisation of international standards. will have the desired effect.<br/>
When we consider the measures concerning Government purchases, we have to remember that no agreement can deal with the "nods and winks" factor. I suppose that if I were looking for a villain here I would have to cite the Germans who are very clever at nods and winks, as any prisoner of war during the last war will know. The "Buy German" policy does not need description in legislation. It does not need abolition by agreement. It simply occurs. As someone who, commercially speaking, was weaned in the computer industry, I wonder whether we are as tough as the Germans when it comes to buying our own products. Consequently, I welcome the clearer phrasing in the provisions dealing with Government purchases.<br/>
The part of my hon. Friend's speech which will delight people all over the West Midlands was that in which he said that he would be prepared to consider the possibility of import restrictions where excessive imports were threatening the viability of indigenous industry. That will be interpreted in engineering companies all over the country as at least a declaration of intent that the Government will not be messed around and will not be hoodwinked, as their predecessors were.</p>

<p>A number of points have been raised in this relatively short debate, and I hope that the House will forgive me if I am unable to reply to all of them. If I miss any major points I shall write to the hon. Members concerned.<br/>
I begin by referring to the remarks of the right hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North (Mr. Smith). He talked of the dangers of idealism. Perhaps if we described the motivating force behind our negotiations as enlightened self-interest some of the difficulties would disappear. The truth is that it is not because of idealism that we want to see the world trading system kept open. It is simply because we export 33 per cent. of everything that we manufacture. We have a vested interest in having access to other people's markets for our goods. That is why the Government, and the right hon. Gentleman, supported the move to keep the world's trading system as open and fair as possible.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman asked about textiles, in particular synthetic fibres. I have a sad piece of news to impart to him. He seems to be the only person who remembers that statement in Brussels in April. Every time I mention it people look slightly baffled. Certainly none of those whom I have met left that April meeting feeling in any way committed to taking action.</p>

<p>May I suggest that those who have difficulty in recalling this matter read the official record of the Community? I have checked it. The Minister will find that that was the decision reached. If he was doing his job he would have pointed this out to the other countries a little more emphatically than he seems to have done.</p>

<p>We have been pointing it out very emphatically. One of our problems is that the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues cried wolf so often that they rather devalued Britain's complaints. Britain established a reputation as a full-time bleater, and when we have a real problem now we find it difficult to get proper recognition of it.<br/>
The Commission is committed to bringing forward specific proposals for action which will be decided at the February Council. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, these Councils are officially Foreign Affairs Councils. A wide range of subjects is discussed, and the Lord Privy Seal normally reports to the House on behalf of all Ministers about the results of those meetings. At the last meeting textiles, steel and a wide variety

of things were discussed. That is why one departmental Minister, namely, the senior Minister from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, reports on the proceedings.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Sowerby (Mr. Thompson)raised a range of specific and detailed problems, and I shall write to him about them. He asked two questions. The first was whether we would be in a position to take effective and speedy action against dumping. We were not satisfied with the arrangements that we found when we were appointed to office. My right hon. Friend and I went to Brussels. We pressed the Commission. The anti-dumping unit has been strengthened, and I believe that it is now more effective. We have retained an anti-dumping unit here. We have issued an advisory document on how to take advantage of the procedures. We remain available to back up British industry if it feels that it has a complaint, and we shall do what we can to speed up the procedures.<br/>
My hon. Friend then asked whether we could reckon on the rest of the world implementing the various codes as we will. A committee of signatories on each code has been established to monitor how the code works. We shall take advantage of those committees and press to make sure that other people, who have voluntarily signed these agreements and committed themselves to implementing them, and have established the procedure for monitoring that implementation, do the same.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) raised a number of interesting points. He asked about agricultural subsidies. I am advised that the rules have been refined, but there has been no major change in them. I shall write to the right hon. Gentleman on the other details of his question.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman also asked when the tariff cuts come into effect. With the exception of textiles and steel, which will take effect in 1982, they came into effect on 1 January of this year.</p>

<p>The agreements were signed by the Commission and by the Government, but, for the reasons that I


have explained to the right hon. Gentleman, because of a procedural snag there was a delay in their being approved by the House. The agreements came into effect, and were signed to come into effect, from 1 January.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman, in a persuasive fashion, developed his theme that the answer to our problems is to leave the EEC. I do not share that view. I think that it would be wrong to raise artificial barriers against people with whom we do 50 per cent. of our trade. Whichever way the right hon. Gentleman tries to talk, the fact is that the figure is edging towards 50 per cent. Let me give the right hon. Gentleman some details. Germany has overtaken America as our major trading partner. France is our third, Holland our fourth, Benelux our fifth, Denmark our ninth and Ireland is our sixth. The right hon. Gentleman is saying "Raise tariffs against all our major trading partners" as an answer to our trading problems. It is nonsense.</p>

The right hon. Gentleman said that the EEC had damaged our motor car industry. That is absolute rubbish. What has damaged our motor car industry is our own inability to perform and to compete. The sooner the right hon. Gentleman and his friends start telling their friends the truth, and stop misleading them into thinking that there is an easy way out of our problems, the better for all of us.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman asked what the tariffs on steel and cars were. An exact figure is not available, but the answer is between 8 per cent. and 11 per cent. It is a range of tariffs.<br/>
The hon. Member for Keighley (Mr. Cryer) raised a number of subjects and repeated a number of his deeply held and totally misguided beliefs. The answer to one of his questions is that there are two specific let-outs on the textile tariff cuts. First, if there is not an MFA&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am delighted to have a chance tonight to start a short debate on the report of the Ordnance Survey review committee. I realise that this does not appear to interest many of my constituents, nor millions of people in the country. However, I stress that good maps are important to a large number of people.<br/>
Administering a modern State would be almost impossible without good maps. Equally, a steadily increasing number of people use maps to increase the pleasure they obtain from their sport or recreation. Therefore, it is unfortunate that there has not been much more debate and public discussion of the report. It is particularly unfortunate since Sir David Serpell and his committee did such a first-class job and produced such a good report. I congratulate them. However, why the report had to be priced at &#x00A3;20 I do not know, unless the Government wanted to discourage debate on it.<br/>
Tonight, my main concern is to ask the Government to make clear their attitude to the recommendations in the report and to tell us when they will give the Ordnance Survey, a clear remit for what it is expected to do in the next 20 years. The first question to which I should like to refer is one that is raised in considerable detail in the report&#x2014;that of digital mapping. It has become fashionable to suggest that microprocessors or computers will take over increasing areas of our life, but it is clear that they could have far-reaching effects on map making.<br/>
The review looks very carefully at the Ordnance Survey development of digital


mapping and notes that so far it has had few advantages over conventional methods. It may have been an interesting experiment, out the costs are often higher and often it takes just as long to produce a map. However, it looks as though there is the possibility that future developments will bring substantial advantages and that digital mapping may very well be very attractive, particularly for such bodies as the Land Registry. the local authorities and the public utilities. There are possibilities that a digital system can offer specialist leisure users, particularly walkers, climbers and similar groups, much better maps.<br/>
The report suggests that there should be two data bases, one for small-scale and one for large-scale maps. It suggests that the Ordnance Survey should approach this task in two stages. First, it should have from the Government over the next two years perhaps &#x00A3;600,000 so that it can investigate which is the best approach and which of the many systems that are being offered has most attractions. The second stage, which would probably take 10 years to complete and perhaps cost &#x00A3;15 million to &#x00A3;16 million, should by 1984 produce a computer data base for the 1:50,000 scale maps and then by 1993 for the larger-scale maps. Will the Government encourage the Ordnance Survey in that initiative? Will they authorise the first stage&#x2014;namely, to decide which systems to go for? Is it hoped to introduce the long-term objective of getting digital bases for both small&#x2014;and large-scale maps?<br/>
Much concern has been expressed by many charitable organisations and other leisure groups about the attitude of the Ordnance Survey to copyright over recent years. They have felt that the Ordnance Survey has increased its copyright charges too quickly and has discouraged many groups from reprinting all or parts of maps. I have received representations from groups which want to promote orienteering. They claim that it is increasingly difficult to cover the costs of reproducing bits of map for their purposes. I have also received representations from groups which are trying to encourage nature trails. They say that they have found it difficult to meet the costs of publishing booklets as well as providing other information.<br/>
The report makes some good recommendations to the effect that the copyright provisions for the sort of group to which I have referred should be eased. It will be helpful to quote the "Summary of main recommendations". It states:
<q>OS should continue to seek substantial revenue from copyright fees but should adopt a more flexible approach to certain categories of user; in particular, (<i>a</i>) copyright charges should be waived on the publication of research findings; (<i>b</i>) in addition to the existing arrangements for educational users, OS should adopt HMSO's policy of giving a 50 per cent. discount on the normal copyright fee payable by educational publishers in cases where the primary purpose of a publication is use in an educational institution.</q>
The last recommendation states:
<q>OS should waive fees on copying by charitable organisations, up to a specified volume per year (within the size limits permitted by current OS copyright regulations) for a trial period to assess the effect on sales revenue. OS should consider also ways of extending waivers in this area once the effects of the concessions to charitable organisations have been assessed.</q>
Those seem to be sensible recommendations that meet many of the arguments that have been put to me by many of those who want to use maps for recreational and leisure purposes.<br/>
I stress that there are problems concerning charitable organisations. I understand that some organisations which exist merely to promote interest in sport are barred from holding charitable status. I hope that the Minister will indicate that the Ordnance Survey will treat the term "charitable" in a wider context than merely organisations recognised by the Charity Commissioners.<br/>
I turn to the future of the 1:25,000 series. It is often referred to as the old 2&#x00BD;-in map. I understand that it is to be renamed by the Ordnance Survey the Pathfinder map. The report makes a good comment:
<q>OS should continue to produce the 1:25,000 series, as a core activity. OS should market it actively while investigating the scope for less costly ways of meeting user needs, and attempt to increase the proportion of costs covered by revenue while increasing use of the series.</q>
That is a helpful section in the report, and it is worrying that the press release from the Department of the Environment used the phrase "if resources are available". It drew attention to a small section in the report which said that


if resources were not available there were three options that should be considered&#x2014;namely, a reduced rate of provision of the second series, suspension of the second series or an attempt to increase revenue from the 1:50,000 national series to cover the costs.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that any one of the three options would be unfortunate in its effect? Does he accept that the 1:25,000 is a useful map because it is the smallest scale on which field boundaries are easily visible? It is useful for a wide range of purposes because of that facility.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1714230" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1980-01-23a.613.1" hansard_membership_id="1152" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2420" speakername="Mr. Bennett" colnum="613" time="23:42:00">
<p>My hon. Friend takes me on to the point that I was about to develop. It is the essential map for the walker, who does not want to run the risk of being slightly off his path and causing nuisance to farmers by cutting across hedges and fields in the wrong place. For 10 years there have been arguments about this map. Fortunately, on every occasion the Government have come to the conclusion that the series should be continued. We are now approaching the situation where about 80 per cent. of the country is covered by these maps. Having come so close to national coverage, it would be an appalling decision to stop there. It is analogous to building a house with almost everything in it but saying that because the front door is not on it cannot be used.<br/>
The big problem for the Ordnance Survey has been that until it has national coverage it is difficult to run a major publicity campaign, because if someone asks in a local shop for a map of the one part of the country that is still not covered, that results in a backlash. There have, therefore, been great difficulties in marketing. If national coverage can be achieved, many of the problems will be overcome.<br/>
It is also clear from the report that if digitisation is developed we may be able to produce the maps much more cheaply. I therefore hope that the Minister can assure us that the 1:25,000 map will continue to be a core activity of the Ordnance Survey.<br/>
I believe that the sheets should cover rather larger areas, which would cut down cost. I should also like to see the Ordnance Survey develop the policy of

printing sheets on the back and front, as it has done with one or two of the leisure maps.<br/>
I stress that the map is essential for walkers and climbers and is particularly important for mountain safety. It also has great value to farmers. It helps those who use the countryside to make sure that they are in the right place.<br/>
If the Ordnance Survey could improve-its marketing, groups such as the Ramblers' Association and the YHA would do their bit to promote the maps. I hope that the Minister can guarantee that those maps will be available.<br/>
The report suggests that much better survey of coastal&#x2014;bathymetric&#x2014;information would be helpful, particularly for those concerned with coastal or deep sea diving. There have recently been complaints about the way in which the large-scale maps are produced from microfilm. There could be improvements there.<br/>
The report also stresses that the consultative machinery is not as good as it might be and suggests ways to improve it. Finally, it stresses that it believes that the Ordnance Survey could do a great deal to improve marketing. I hope that the Minister can assure us that the report will be implemented.<br/>
The introduction to the report's conclusions says:
<q>OS will be faced during the next twenty years with four major tasks:</q>
<q>to keep the archive up-to-date by a thorough and economic process of revision</q>
<q>to make the information from the up-dated archive available to users promptly"&#x2014;</q>
I stress promptly&#x2014;
<q>and in forms acceptable to them</q>
<q>in an era of technological change, to take advantage of progress (especially in the provision of data in digital form) which enables it to maintain or improve its performance</q>
<q>to continue to transform itself from being a rather inward-looking and conservatively-run organisation into one that looks to the future and is responsive to the change and to developments elsewhere.</q>
That is a useful comment, and I hope that the Minister can tell us that the Ordnance Survey will be given clear guidance to implement the suggestions in the report and also that the Government will guarantee the resources to carry out those suggestions.</p>

<p>I am sure that the House is grateful to the hon. Member for Stockport, North (Mr. Bennett) for providing an opportunity for views to be expressed on the report of the Ordnance Survey review committee. The hon. Member has long displayed a friendly, constructive and knowledgeable interest in Ordnance Survey matters from the map users' standpoint. Indeed, I have read afresh the contribution that he made to the earlier debate on the organisation that he initiated in July 1977, when the study undertaken by the review committee was first being mooted. What he had to say on that occasion was as pertinent as his speech tonight.<br/>
I have taken careful note of the many interesting points that he has made and will certainly bring them to the attention of my right hon. Friend, who is at present considering the review committee's report and the views that have been expressed on it.<br/>
The hon. Member asked me to give a number of assurances. Bearing in mind that consideration of the report is still taking place, there is a limit to what I can say to him. However, I can say immediately that the Ordnance Survey is widely respected in this country, and most of us, at some time or other, have had cause to be grateful for the maps that it provides. The hon. Member is especially concerned with ramblers and walkers, but the list of those who benefit is endless.<br/>
My recent visit to OS headquarters at Southampton unquestionably reinforced my own high regard for the institution and the quality of its work. I have seen the people who work there and the complexities of the job they do. I was particularly struck by the corporate spirit of the department, their pride in their long tradition of service to the community and the pains they have taken to co-operate with the review committee in its examination of their future tasks and how they must adapt themselves to deal with them.<br/>
The OS has been playing a key role in the provision of essential information for the management of this country for nearly 200 years, and I can certainly assure the hon. Member that it is here to stay. Indeed, as the review committee points out, in many modern develop-

ments its future role may be even greater. Of course, the OS will need to adapt to changing needs and fast-developing technologies, and in that respect the report of the review committee has made a most valuable contribution.<br/>
There can be little doubt that the review committee, which was asked to consider and make recommendations on the longer-term policies of OS and ways of financing them, was given an important and formidable task. Those who have studied the report will have noted the thoroughness and care with which it was carried out&#x2014;and the speed with which it was completed. The hon. Gentleman will be glad to know that it has produced a comprehensive document from which the Government can proceed to reach their conclusions, and I should like to take this opportunity to express the Government's gratitude to Sir David Serpell, as chairman, as well as to his colleagues on the committee for the work they have done.<br/>
It is clear from his contribution tonight how much importance the hon. Member for Stockport, North attaches to the services and products of the Ordnance Survey. He referred in particular to the matters raised in evidence given to the review committee by the Ramblers' Association and the Central Council for Physical Recreation. They are two of 450 organisations and individuals who gave evidence to the committee, which shows how important the OS and its future is to many people.<br/>
Both the association and the council covered a wide range of issues of interest and concern to their members, ranging from the availability and coverage of maps&#x2014;and the amount of detail shown on them&#x2014;to broader issues such as the extent to which the OS should be required to pay its way or be treated as a public service. Those were among the questions to which the review committee addressed itself, and it made a number of recommendations on them. The hon. Member will understand that since consideration of the report is in progress it would not be proper for me to anticipate what the Government's conclusions will be.</p>

<p>Can the Minister give us some idea of the time scale in which the report is being considered and how soon he will be able to


give us answers? I am sure that he appreciates that on the digital side the report recommends that action should be taken during this and the next financial year.</p>

<p>That is a fair point. I assure the hon. Member that we are close to arriving at conclusions. Our immediate aim is to settle as quickly as possible the framework of basic decisions from which the OS can proceed. It is my right hon. Friend's intention to make a statement fairly soon.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Newham, South (Mr. Spearing) talked about the 1:25,000 map series. I think that the press release of 30 October 1979 was claimed to be misleading in stating that the review committee had recommended retaining the 1:25,000 map series as a core activity if resources were available. I am sorry if anyone gained the wrong impression. The press release was intended to reflect, in brief, the content of paragraphs 7.28 and 15.30 of the report. Paragraph 7.28, having stated that the committee classified the series as core activity, goes on to point out that it is a costly series, that the value of the series is a long way from being matched by revenue from its users but that it is largely because of the alternatives provided by the 1:50,000 series and the 1:10,000 series that the 1:25,000 must be considered vulnerable. Paragraph 15.31 also makes clear that if, contrary to the committee's assumptions and recommendations, the Ordnance Survey was required to reduce its call on the Exchequer, the committee would expect action in such areas as a reduced rate of provision of the second series of the 1:25,000 series and suspension of the 1:25,000 scale series as a national series. I shall take note of the interesting points made on this matter.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman raised one or two other matters, including the fact that the report costs &#x00A3;20. I assure him that it was not our intention to raise the cost to such a figure that debate would be stifled. This was the minimum amount needed to

recover estimated costs for an edition of 1,500 copies. We thought it right that a proportion should make a contribution towards overheads. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has read the report. It was not a straightforward printing job. It was a complex production that included five colour maps. It could not, therefore, be priced at Her Majesty's Stationery Office standard scales. The basic production cost of the colour cover was about 25p a copy.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman mentioned copyright charges. Looking at the copyright figures, which vary from 0&#x00B7;5p to lop, I hardly find those charges exorbitant. I shall, however, bear in mind the points made by the hon. Gentleman, especially those relating to charities, accepting that word in its widest context.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman raised the question of digital data development. The committee said that there was a strong case, on financial grounds, for authorising the Ordnance Survey to proceed with its pioneering work on the development and introduction of digital methods of map production. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will take this into account when considering what logical extension of the Ordnance Survey's present programme is appropriate. In the meantime, I should like to assure hon. Members that there has been no standstill in the preparatory activity in this area.<br/>
This has been an interesting and useful debate, and I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the points that he has made. I hope that hon. Members will appreciate that the reason why I have not been able to respond on certain matters is that these bear heavily upon the Government's conclusions, shortly to be announced, on the review committee's report. But, as I said, I can certainly give an assurance that what has been said will be taken into account.</p>
