	<p pid="e.342.6/1">The inquiry will look at both the West Midlands SHA and its predecessor bodies. My hon. Friend will know from what I said a couple of weeks ago that proposals for such reconfigurations in the national health service must now answer to the clinical evidence-the clinical base. They must answer to patients-current and prospective patient choice-and to the referral intentions and commissioning intentions of general practitioners exercising responsibility for commissioning. That will change the nature of such decisions from a top-down, unaccountable process to one that is much locally accountable and effective.</p>

	<p pid="e.347.8/1">I have not said that that is the case from today. I have a rather greater belief in the value of Parliament than the last Labour Government showed. Any provisions will come into force only once the Bill has been approved by Parliament and has received Royal Assent. It is after Royal Assent that cards will remain valid for one more month only. I will be writing to all those who already have a card to inform them of the change, so <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40527" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)</phrase> can look forward in due course to receiving a letter from me.

	<p pid="e.348.9/1">If I can just correct a slight inaccuracy of terminology in the way in which the hon. Lady referred to the job losses in Durham, the people concerned were temporary staff on short-term contracts and they have been released early from those contracts. There are implications to abolishing the previous Labour Government's scheme but, as the hon. Lady, may know, we as a Government have considerable proposals for helping people who are unemployed to get into work. Our single work programme, which will replace the previous Government's proposals for helping people into work, will give people much more focused individual help on getting them into the workplace and ensuring that they are retrained and given the skills that they need.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-06-09e.351.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="351"  time="013:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100609/debtext/100609-0007.htm#10060953001065">
	<p pid="e.351.1/1">The point that I am making is a simple one. The last Labour Government claimed that this would be-<i> [Interruption.]</i> A shadow Minister on the Front Bench says, &quot;No. we didn't.&quot; As I had not said what I was going to say the Government had claimed, I suggest that she is being a little premature, or perhaps she is learning the ways of opposition rather earlier than some of her colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="e.351.1/2">Many claims were made at various times about what the Government said. One of them was that the purpose of ID cards was to keep this country safe. The examples that I gave show that ID cards do not keep this country safe and are an intrusion into civil liberties. The imposition of an enormously expensive system, which will be a target for computer hackers, might result in greater identity fraud and would not make us safer cannot be justified.</p>
	<p pid="e.351.1/3">There is one other objection to such an extension of the state's surveillance powers, and it is one that Labour never understood: it is unBritish. We are a freedom-loving people, and we recognise that intrusive government does not enhance our well-being or safety. In 2004 the Mayor of London promised to eat his ID card in front of</p>
	<p pid="e.351.1/4" class="indent">&quot;whatever emanation of the state has demanded that I produce it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.351.1/5">I will not endorse civil disobedience, but Boris Johnson was expressing in his own inimitable way a discomfort even stronger than the discomfort to be had from eating an ID card. It is a discomfort born of a very healthy and British revulsion towards bossy, interfering, prying, wasteful and bullying Government. The coalition Government are determined to do things differently.</p>
	<p pid="e.351.1/6">I pay tribute to all those who have campaigned so vigorously for the abolition of ID cards. They include N02ID, Liberty, and the parties that make up the coalition Government. I am also grateful that Members in other parts of the House, including Labour Members, as indicated earlier, have had the integrity to speak out and vote against the issue and, in the case of Labour Members, against those on their Front Bench. Indeed, Labour Members may even find that voting for the abolition of ID cards curries favour with the next leader of their party although, with the notable exception of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40289" name="Diane Abbott">the hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase>, none of the leadership candidates appears to have taken an interest in civil liberties.</p>
	<p pid="e.351.1/7">Let me read to the House what the hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington said during her impassioned speech against the Identity Cards Bill in 2005:</p>
	<p pid="e.351.1/8" class="indent">&quot;As the evening has worn on, the Government Whips have subjected several of my colleagues to their usual rough-hew methods of persuasion. However, I say to colleagues in the closing minutes of the debate that voting against the Bill would be far from betraying our Government or going against Labour principles, because we would be doing the Government a great service. The more the public hear of the Bill, the less they like it, so the sooner it is stopped in its tracks, the better.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-06-28.1248"><i> Official Report</i>, 28 June 2005; Vol. 435, c. 1248-9</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="e.351.1/9">I could not agree more.</p>
	<p pid="e.351.1/10">I urge Members in all parts of the House to vote with their conscience, and to show their constituents that they stand for freedom, sound expenditure and common sense. The case for ID cards has not been made and will not be. It is an extension of state power that we cannot, in any sense, afford. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="e.361.2/1">My hon. Friend might get an answer to that from the Home Secretary. Perhaps those staff should not have had the temerity to take those jobs, because they should have known that the Conservatives were going to win the next general election. This is the new, bizarre world in which we are living.</p>
	<p pid="e.361.2/2">Abolishing the national identity register would save very little for three reasons: first, all the information held on our existing passport database will continue to be held; secondly, that information will need to be held securely, as it is now; and thirdly, we will still need to collect and securely hold the fingerprints of foreign nationals on a database.</p>
	<p pid="e.361.2/3">The Government's claim that scrapping ID cards will save &#163;800 million in operating costs over the next 10 years is utter fantasy. We always proceeded on the basis of full cost recovery and made it perfectly clear that over 10 years, the operating costs of ID cards would be recovered through fees, so there would no charge on general taxation over that period. However, if there are no ID cards, there is no charge for ID cards, and therefore no way of recovering the costs. By cancelling the scheme, the Government remove the income stream but leave the cancellation costs, which the taxpayer will be forced to pay, and let us not forget the continuing cost to the economy of fraud, abuse of the NHS, illegal immigration and unauthorised working. By cancelling the scheme, the Government will make not a saving, but a substantial loss.</p>

	<p pid="e.367.1/1">I thought I had accepted this afternoon that I and many others got it wrong, but not my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40346" name="Alan Johnson">the Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson)</phrase> or our admirable, and honourable, Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40290" name="Meg Hillier">the Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase>, who did a fantastic job in the time she was in post in getting the message across. I have already indicated that we did not explain the issue. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> illustrates the position extremely well in saying that 50 bits of information were required. If he had gone along and got himself an ID card, he would have realised that that was complete and utter bunkum, but this has been repeated so often that people started to believe it. I challenge anyone who has an ID card, who went along and gave the information to be placed on that database to stand up this afternoon and challenge me. I will give way quite happily if people believe that they can justify the claim that this mega-amount of information had to be provided over and above what was required for the passport.</p>
	<p pid="e.367.1/2">In the end, however, if people believe something in a democracy, that is what counts. I remember saying at 3 am Friday morning after the general election, &quot;If you're defeated, you're defeated.&quot; When defeated, it is right to go back, think again and work out how to develop sensible arguments that protect civil liberties, and protect the nation's well-being as well.</p>

	<p pid="e.368.0/1">I congratulate you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, on your well-deserved appointment, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40281" name="Caroline Dinenage">the hon. Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage)</phrase> on her excellent maiden speech.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/2">I support the Identity Documents Bill, but one of the difficulties is that it should really be called the Identity Documents and Register Bill. It is the register aspect that I would like to concentrate on. Section 10 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 deals with</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Notification of changes affecting accuracy of Register&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/4">The claim that maintaining a database and any changes to it has no cost is ludicrous. There is obviously a saving from not having to change the database.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/5">Under section 10(1):</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/6" class="indent">&quot;An individual to whom an ID card has been issued must notify the Secretary of State about...every prescribed change of circumstances affecting the information recorded about him in the Register&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/7">Under section 10(7):</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/8" class="indent">&quot;An individual who contravenes a requirement imposed on him by...this section shall be liable to a civil penalty not exceeding &#163;1,000.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/9">Essentially, what that means is that once the information dealt with in schedule 1 is on the register, anyone who has an ID card-whether they are compulsory or not-is under a duty to notify and will be fined up to &#163;1,000 if they do not inform the Government of those changes. Perhaps that was the stealth tax that was going to get the Government out of the financial mess the country was in. If we are talking about &#163;1,000 fines for 60 million people, that comes to &#163;60 billion, which is a good start: there is a third of the deficit gone. The reality is that all the debate, on the basis of which public opinion was formed, has been about the card and its cost. Once people start being fined for not telling the Government about changes, the position becomes much more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/10">Schedule 1 of the 2006 Act is relevant to the subject of the 50 pieces of information, although the amount of information required obviously depends on the individual. The requirement for the individual's &quot;full name&quot; is straightforward, but people change their names by deed poll from time to time, and if they do not tell the Government, they must pay a &#163;1,000 fine. Next, the schedule refers to</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/11" class="indent">&quot;other names by which he is...known&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/12">People may have nicknames. If someone fills in an election nomination paper with a name by which he is known, but does not tell the Government for the purposes of the identity card, he will have to pay a &#163;1,000 fine.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/13">There are requirements for &quot;date of birth&quot; , &quot;place of birth&quot; and &quot;gender&quot; to be recorded. &quot;Gender&quot; is an interesting one. Under the Identity Cards Act 2006 (Application and Issue of ID Card and Notification of Changes) Regulations 2009, people can register two genders if they wish. I shall say more about that later.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/14">The schedule also refers to</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/15" class="indent">&quot;the address of his principal place of residence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/16">To be fair, people do need to tell the various authorities where they live, for electoral purposes and the like. However, paragraph 1(g) refers to</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/17" class="indent">&quot;the address of every other place in the United Kingdom or elsewhere&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/18">Someone with a holiday home in France must tell the United Kingdom Government where it is. If he sells it and does not tell the Government where he has moved, he will have to pay a &#163;1,000 fine. It is a good way of raising money. A great many people, including many in the House, have more than one residence-they may have to work away from home-but if they do not tell the Government where that other residence is, they must pay &#163;1,000.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/19">The schedule demands</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/20" class="indent">&quot;a photograph of his head and shoulders (showing the features of the face)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/21"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40527" name="David Blunkett">The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)</phrase> and my hon. Friends the Members for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath) and for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) may wake up one day and decide that they would like to use the razor to a greater extent than usual. If they take such action and do not tell the Government, they must pay a &#163;1,000 fine for not sending another photograph.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/22">The passport system is simple and straightforward. Every 10 years, people must renew their passports and send in a new photograph. At one stage the Government got into a real mess with babies. They required a baby not to have its mouth open when being photographed, and people had to send in 20 photographs before one was considered acceptable. That was a serious problem. Under the ID card system, such people would fall outside the time limits specified in section 10 of the Act, and would have to pay a &#163;1,000 fine.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/23">My daughter decided to dye her hair green. Obviously that is a change, involving not just the price of the dye but a possible &#163;1,000 fine for dyeing her hair green and not telling the Government. Let us suppose that I decide tomorrow to put on a dress and call myself Doris. The statutory instrument requires me to tell the Government that I am calling myself Doris and have an alternative gender. If the day after that I decide to call myself Ethel and do not tell the Government, I will have to pay a &#163;1,000 fine. The Government are definitely making good process in getting rid of the deficit: this is a very good stealth tax.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/24">It is all a question of whether the Government serve the citizen or the citizen serves the Government. One of my constituents was stopped by the police on the Coventry road, which-as those who are acquainted with Yardley will know-is a very big road that, unsurprisingly, leads to Coventry. Everything, including his insurance, was perfect, but the wrong box was ticked on a form, and he was subsequently prosecuted and convicted of an offence that he had not committed. It took a lot of doing for us to reverse the conviction and remove it from the system. That is an example of what can happen when things are done for the convenience of the state rather than the convenience of the citizen. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40346" name="Alan Johnson">The right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson)</phrase> said that this was not Big Brother, but I think that having to tell the Government every time you do something is a bit Big Brother.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/25">During the general election campaign I cut my finger on a piece of paper, and obviously that changed my fingerprint. Schedule 1.2 is headed &quot;Identifying information&quot;, and subparagraph (c) refers to fingerprints. If I had had an ID card and had not told the Government that I had cut my finger, I would have had to pay a &#163;1,000 fine. Members may laugh, but such things happen. The purpose of speed cameras was to make money out of the fines. If a Department is targeted to be self-financing, it will look for solutions such as another change that should have been, but has not been, put on the identity card register.</p>
	<p pid="e.368.0/26">There is no point in my reading out all of schedule 1, which is available to Members, as are the regulations which amend schedule 1. More than 50 pieces of information may be required, but the main issue is the sudden creation of a major duty for the citizen to tell the Government everything that he or she does. We all know how good the Government are at keeping information secure. They can get a little memory stick and lose a number of bank accounts, for instance. There is also the question of access to the information. The Data Protection Act may make it an offence to sell access to any of the databases, but when there is a single database in a single place all the information is tidily collated, and it may be worth someone's while to obtain and pass to someone else information such as where a holiday home is in France, what name a person uses when wearing a dress, the colour of a person's hair, or a national insurance number.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-06-09e.374.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40279" speakername="Richard Graham" colnum="374"  time="015:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100609/debtext/100609-0010.htm#10060953001118">
	<p pid="e.374.0/1">I congratulate you on your election, Mr Deputy Speaker, and thank you for giving me this opportunity to make my maiden speech. I also congratulate the previous maiden speaker, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40081" name="Jack Dromey">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey)</phrase>, not only on his excellent speech but, if I am not mistaken, on becoming the first Member of this House to make his maiden speech while his wife, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40140" name="Harriet Harman">the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)</phrase>, was not only present in the Chamber but sitting before him on the Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/2">It is a big step for anyone to represent his cathedral city in this House. Many previous maiden speakers have alluded to the difficulties of filling the large shoes of their predecessors. In my case, that is literally true as both of my feet would probably fit into one of Parmjit Dhanda's shoes. I pay tribute to him for the work he did on behalf of Gloucester, his great interest in Gloucester City football club and his contribution to the relocation and rebuilding of Gloucestershire college. I also respected his enthusiasm-although I did not share it at all-for the regionalisation of many things, including government, planning, the police and fire control centres. In these respects at least, I hope that small is beautiful.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/3">It is appropriate that I am making this maiden speech on behalf of my Gloucester constituents during the Second Reading debate of the Bill to abolish ID cards, which are certainly a vivid example of the misuse of both parliamentary time and taxpayer money.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/4">The main issue in my city and others like it is not dissimilar to that described by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington: we are a great working city which now has record youth unemployment and too many families with no working role model-in fact, there are occasionally three generations living entirely off benefits. I believe that everyone in Gloucester will support me in our main endeavour today &#8212; to increase business growth in order to generate more jobs, especially for the young, and that this will in turn generate the tax revenues that fund the front-line services that are so crucial for everyone in my city.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/5">Let me try to put our work in context. Gloucester first appeared on the map through two early attempts at European integration: first, it was the Roman colonia of Glevum, and it was then at the forefront of a large Norman military and religious building programme, which has left us with the glories of Gloucester cathedral. However, as Conservative Members know so well, economic development rarely follows Government plans, and our next phase of mass tourism was created by the unfortunate and regrettable homophobic act of regicide against Edward II in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40590" name="Neil Carmichael">the Member for Stroud (Neil Carmichael)</phrase>. The numbers of pilgrims then arriving in our city have only recently been exceeded, with another pilgrimage after the filming of Harry Potter in our cloisters.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/6">Our true business adaptability was shown during the industrial revolution, however, when we created, first, the world's deepest canal, and then Britain's most inland port, to bring raw materials to Gloucester to make things. That is where my city has excelled: we have always made things. We manufactured wagons during the age of the railway to carry everything from coal to maharajahs, with slightly different degrees of comfort, and most spectacularly we built the world's first jet fighter, the Gloster Meteor, which was exported to 14 countries.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/7">Today, we face different times and challenges. Like many other constituencies, our business sector has a strong retail and financial element, but we continue to manufacture despite the large drop in our manufacturing sector during the last 10 years. Some 15% of Gloucester&#8217;s gross domestic product still comes from manufacturing, including health products and large quantities of materials for the aerospace industry such as insulation, coatings and cylinders, and almost every ice cream that every Member has eaten in this country comes from the Wall's ice cream factory in Gloucester.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/8">It is as a symbol that I am today wearing something manufactured in Gloucester. The shirt I am wearing was made two days ago on the Cross in the heart of our city by Gloucester cutters and machinists, and I am proud to say that the company that makes these wonderful shirts will shortly be opening a retail space in Bombay, demonstrating that Gloucester will soon be exporting to India again.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/9">At the same time as this greater diversity in manufacturing and business enterprise, we have seen a growing diversity of our residents. I thought it would be useful as a new Member of Parliament to have lived and worked in 10 countries and to speak the languages of eight of them, but the people of Gloucester speak 46 languages and so, in this as in so much else, I still have a lot to learn.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/10">It will be of interest to Members to learn that many of our residents from overseas come from close to the Indian port of Surat in Gujarat, which was, by wonderful historical irony, the port where Elizabethan sailors from this country first landed in India some 450 years ago. I welcome all my friends from Gujarat, and also more recent arrivals. I am proud to have been invited as the guest of honour at the opening this weekend of the new association for Tamils and also to an event by the Polish community.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/11">Today, the truth is that all of us, whatever our origins, face severe difficulties in handling the record youth unemployment and in trying to re-grow our economy to provide jobs for our young people. That is why all my constituents will welcome measures taken by this Government to stimulate business, which we must remind ourselves is the sole source of growth, providing jobs and then tax revenues for the services that many Members are calling for in our different constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/12">The most famous book written about Gloucester is Beatrix Potter's &quot;The Tailor of Gloucester&quot;. Some Members will remember the sad moment when the tailor runs out of money and finds that there is &quot;no more twist&quot;. In his case, he was bailed out by the mice, who in the dead of night brought both the cloth and the needles and finished his sewing for him, but today we cannot trust entirely to the benevolence of the mice in Gloucester to re-stimulate our economy, and therefore I welcome the changes that I am sure this Government will make in order to bring about that re-stimulation.</p>
	<p pid="e.374.0/13">So I promise the constituents of Gloucester, whom I am so proud to serve, that I will work ceaselessly, especially to help business growth that will provide job opportunities and generate tax revenues. To those ends, I intend to create a new all-party parliamentary group on urban regeneration-which links so many of these issues together-and I shall work with Members on both sides of the House to explore new ways of contributing to the solutions in that area. If we can successfully stimulate micro-regeneration on the streets, as well as macro-regeneration through projects and new investment, it will be possible for the people of Gloucester to take greater pride in our city and for hon. Members and people all round the country to see that, like our cathedral and our rugby club, our entire city belongs to the premier league.</p>

	<p pid="e.382.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. That contradiction was even acknowledged by Labour Front Benchers as being the thing that would do ID cards in. What was the point of them if the scheme was to be voluntary? Could anyone see Mr Terrorist popping off to his post office voluntarily to apply for an ID card? That was never likely to happen. It was a ridiculous idea and the Labour party knew that, as has been acknowledged by its Front Benchers.</p>
	<p pid="e.382.1/2">Labour persisted with the scheme, but that approach and all the talk about the new things that ID cards would do only further confused the already sceptical public about what the cards were all about. The right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle is right that ID cards were quite popular in their early days. At first, about 80% of the public thought that they would be a good thing, but that number slowly went down over the years as the public became familiar with what the cards were to do and as they heard the arguments and saw the costs escalate year after year. What ID cards became for new Labour was not so much some great suggestion that it was bringing to the British people as a political virility signal-something that a dying and decaying Government had to push forward to be seen to do something.</p>
	<p pid="e.382.1/3">When I was preparing this speech, I had no idea what the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle was going to say. I did not know whether ID cards were to be dumped or to be the first inclusion in the next Labour party manifesto. Indeed, I still am not sure exactly what the Labour party's position is on them. We know that it is not voting against the measure tonight. What I have heard from Labour Members so far is that they think that ID cards are still a good idea, but the way that they have described them is like no other description of them that I have ever heard.</p>
	<p pid="e.382.1/4">I had thought that ID cards would be subject to the same sort of revisionism that has been seen with some of the Labour leadership candidates. I thought that they might go the same way as the Iraq war or Alf Garnett's immigration policies, but, no, it seems that they are still to be a feature of Labour's new vision and version to reconnect with the British public. They will be there to try to reconnect with the British public.</p>

	<p pid="e.387.0/1">May I congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on being elevated to your position? I thank you for giving me the honour of making my first speech in the House on today's date, <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-09">9 June</phrase>, which has some significance in my locality. May I congratulate also those other hon. Members who have made their maiden speeches today? They include <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40281" name="Caroline Dinenage">the hon. Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage)</phrase>, my hon.

Members for Finchley and Golders Green (Mike Freer) and for Keighley (Kris Hopkins).</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/2">I particularly welcome the hon. Member for Keighley and his maiden speech, because I know that he, as a former leader of Bradford city council, will bring local government experience to the House, albeit from a different political perspective from mine. Furthermore, Mr Deputy Speaker, you need not worry about me undermining the British film industry by giving away any secrets about the demise of the house elves in my constituency, as happened last week.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/3">It is with enormous pride that I stand here, honoured to represent the people of my home town, Gateshead, where I have lived for more than 30 years. In doing so, I am conscious of the fact that I follow in the footsteps of a formidable predecessor, David Clelland, the former MP for Tyne Bridge, whose constituency formed half the new constituency of Gateshead. The other half of the constituency was represented in the previous Parliament by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40636" name="Sharon Hodgson">the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson)</phrase>, who, I am glad to say, is still with us.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/4">David Clelland was not only an excellent representative of the people of the Tyne Bridge constituency and a first-class Member; he was and remains a personal friend. Having worked with David for more years than I care to remember, first as Labour party colleagues, subsequently together as councillors and, most recently, he as MP and I as deputy leader of Gateshead council, I know all too well the great passion that David has always devoted to representing the people of Tyne Bridge and, in particular, Gateshead. David would be the first to say that his work was both an honour and a privilege. However, I want to place on the record my gratitude and that of the people of Gateshead for David's contribution, both as a councillor and as a Member of Parliament, to making Gateshead an even better place to live.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/5">The mantle of representing Gateshead has now fallen to me. Gateshead is truly a great place, made all the better by the people who live there. The fact that this is a debate on the Identity Documents Bill may be a flimsy pretext for saying that, of course, the people of Gateshead and of Tyneside are very proud of their distinct north-east identity. None the less, it is true-and we do not need any documents to prove it. One of Gateshead's most famous inhabitants in the 19th century-possibly fictitious, but well known-was a young lady by the name of Cushy Butterfield, whose description in song gives us some insight into the Tyneside males' mindset at the time:</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/6" class="indent">&quot;She's a big lass and a bonny lass and she likes her beer.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/7" class="indent">And they call her Cushy Butterfield and ah wish she was here.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/8">At the beginning of my speech I mentioned today's date, <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-09">9 June</phrase>, which has great significance for the people of Tyneside, for it was on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-09">9 June</phrase> that the people of Tyneside went to Blaydon races, in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40095" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr Anderson)</phrase>. And, in the words of the song by Geordie Ridley, the people took the bus from Balmbra's, a music hall in central Newcastle, and proceeded on their way, meeting many trials and tribulations along the road. I shall return to Blaydon races in due course, but I am here to represent Gateshead.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/9">Yes, it is a town-soon to be a city, I hope-that has had many problems. Having been heavily dependent upon primary industries, heavy engineering and manufacturing, the town suffered all the social and economic problems associated with the decline of those traditional industries, yet the resilience and fortitude of the people of Gateshead simply do not allow for self-indulgent moaning. The former Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher, who was spoken about warmly in an earlier speech, once famously described the people of the north-east as &quot;moaning minnies&quot;, but I can honestly say that nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/10">Throughout the 1970s and 1980s Gateshead suffered from some of the worst unemployment rates on the United Kingdom mainland. Educational attainment was to say the least poor, if not very poor, and in every social and economic indicator or league table, if it was good news Gateshead was near the bottom, and if it was bad news Gateshead was inevitably near the top. However, the renaissance in Gateshead over the past 20 years has been remarkable, and a testament to the support of the previous Government and, more importantly, to the clear strategic leadership of my colleagues on Gateshead council.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/11">One example is the rejuvenation of Gateshead quays. Where once there stood derelict warehouses and empty factories, now there stands the iconic Gateshead Millennium bridge, BALTIC, the centre for contemporary art, and the magnificent Sage Gateshead, designed by Sir Norman Foster. To the south of the town centre, and just over the border into the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon, stands Antony Gormley's Angel of the North. We also have, in the ward that I have represented on the council for 27 years, Saltwell park-a shining example of a Victorian municipal park visited by more than 2 million people annually. These are not just glittering buildings and monuments without substance or purpose-no, they are all internationally acclaimed and recognised, part of Gateshead council's vision to transform Gateshead. Indeed, the Sage Gateshead, which I know that many Members have visited for conferences over the past few years, has been acclaimed as one of the most acoustically perfect concert halls in the whole world.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/12">With this transformation we have witnessed an unprecedented reversal of fortunes in comparison with the Gateshead of the '70s and '80s. From being among the areas with the worst educational achievement, Gateshead is now towards the top on many measures. In almost every aspect of life, Gateshead has been transformed. Education, housing, social care and employment-all have been transformed by the support from a supportive Government and with leadership from a truly inspirational council, but most of all by the resilience, fortitude and hard work of the people of Gateshead themselves.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/13">There is still poverty. There is still hardship. There are still too many lives untouched by change. But to anyone who doubts that Britain has got better since we took over from the Tories in 1997, I say this: come to Gateshead and see what the people here have achieved. Those are not my words, but those of the former Prime Minister, the right hon. Tony Blair, five years ago at the Labour spring conference. Indeed, our current Prime Minister was gracious enough to acknowledge that his party had been well received on their visit to Gateshead at the same venue-and yes, I truly would welcome him back to my constituency should he take up my offer to return with his party's conference in the future.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/14">As I consider the task of representing the interests of Gateshead, it is that record of achievement that I will be defending. Having been deeply involved, as the former deputy leader of Gateshead council, in Gateshead's renaissance, I know how substantial the changes have been. However, I also know just how fragile this recovery could be. Gateshead's strength is its people-their intelligence, their hard work and, most of all, their caring and deep sense of community. We are, and will always remain, remote from the economic centre of the United Kingdom and from the European and world markets. In a free-market global economy, Gateshead needs governmental support. In the north-east, more than 30% of the workforce is employed in the extended public sector; in my borough of Gateshead that figure is probably closer to 40%.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/15">Like many others in the north-east, I remember all too vividly the social unrest and devastation that was the 1980s: soaring unemployment, poverty, frustration, increasing alienation and a crippling sense of hopelessness. Gateshead, and indeed Britain today, is a far better place, and it is my duty to the people of Gateshead to ensure there will be no return to those bad days. I will play my part. I will speak up for Gateshead and its people. I will ensure that the interests of the people I represent will not be forgotten or overlooked. I know that my former colleagues in Gateshead council will also play their part.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/16">As for the new Government: be warned, I will be watching. My colleagues and I will no doubt scrutinise every single proposal that comes out of Government. Our aim will be to ensure that the social costs of deficit reductions caused by a recession that was caused by the greed and incompetence of bankers and speculators are not simply passed on to the poorest in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/17">I know that the responsibility of governing is great, and the new coalition will meet its tribulations along the way, but if they follow the example of the Tyneside folk on their way to Blaydon races, they may survive, for a time:</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/18" class="indent">&quot;But gannin ower the Railway Bridge</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/19" class="indent">The bus wheel flew off there</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/20" class="indent">The lasses lost their crinolines</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/21" class="indent">And veils that hide their faces</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/22" class="indent">I got two black eyes and a broken nose</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/23" class="indent">In gannin to Blaydon races.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/24">But undaunted they went on:</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/25" class="indent">&quot;Now when we got the wheel back on&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/26">because the wheel does come off occasionally-</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/27" class="indent">&quot;Away we went again</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/28" class="indent">But them that had their noses broke</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/29" class="indent">They went back ower hyem</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/30" class="indent">Some went to the dispensary</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/31" class="indent">And some to Doctor Gibbs</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/32" class="indent">And some to the infirmary</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/33" class="indent">To mend their broken ribs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/34">But the bulk of them carried on, and went to Blaydon races.</p>
	<p pid="e.387.0/35">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on behalf of the people of Gateshead, whom I am very proud to represent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-06-09e.398.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40048" speakername="Gloria De Piero" colnum="398"  time="016:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100609/debtext/100609-0014.htm#10060953001141">
	<p pid="e.398.0/1">I am very grateful to have been given an opportunity to make my maiden speech in this debate. Whatever disagreements different Members and political parties may have about how to tackle crime, terrorism and identity theft, we can all agree that they are issues of great concern to our constituents, and it is for all of us to address them. I congratulate every Member who has made their maiden speech today. They were truly excellent speeches, which I must now follow.</p>
	<p pid="e.398.0/2">Let me begin by paying tribute to my predecessor, Geoff Hoon, who represented Ashfield for 18 years. Geoff was a barrister by trade but was born and bred into a long line of railwaymen, and I know that the values he learned from his family shaped his political outlook. Above all, he was determined to put those values into practice as a Minister. He spent six years as Secretary of State for Defence, making him the second longest-serving Defence Secretary to date. Much of that is known about Geoff, but less well known is his passion for pop music and his encyclopaedic knowledge of bands of the 1960s and '70s. Geoff Hoon was very serious about his music, and, to be honest, he would probably cringe if he looked at the music on my iPod.</p>
	<p pid="e.398.0/3">Ashfield is a constituency shaped by industry, and proud of it-and those industrial roots have shaped those privileged enough to represent it. Everywhere I went during the election campaign, I was reminded just how large the shoes are that I have to fill-including those of Frank Haynes, who, after years below ground as a miner, represented Ashfield in this House from 1979 to 1992. In doing my research, I learned that Frank was famous for having one of the loudest voices in the House of Commons. When I promised the voters of Ashfield that, if they sent me to Parliament, I would shout up for them, I was speaking metaphorically. Frank clearly promised the same thing, but meant it quite literally. He was loved by many in Ashfield and by many in this House. Everyone tells me how popular he was. His key quality, which I shall always try to emulate, was that he was always himself. I love the image of him asking Margaret Thatcher a tough question at Prime Minister's questions and calling her &quot;duckie&quot;, which is the legendary term of endearment that Nottinghamshire folk use every day. I am assured that the Iron Lady smiled.</p>
	<p pid="e.398.0/4">I am the first Member of Parliament to begin serving Ashfield with no local men underground mining for coal. Our most famous sons were from mining backgrounds. They include Harold Larwood, a Nottinghamshire and England fast bowler who left school at 14, before the war, to work in the mines. His statue still stands today in Kirkby-in-Ashfield. D. H. Lawrence was born in the town of Eastwood and was the son of a miner who could barely read. He called Eastwood &quot;the country of my heart&quot;. It is not only the decline of mining that has hit Ashfield hard. I am delighted to be here as the first woman to represent the constituency, because women played a full part in building Ashfield's prosperity by working in the textile industry, but one by one the textile factories have gone the way of the pits. Yes, new jobs have been created, but too often they do not pay as well or offer the job security of those they replaced, and there are not enough of them.</p>
	<p pid="e.398.0/5">Ashfield could be forgiven for thinking that its best days were behind it, but my mission in representing the people of my constituency in this House is to prove that that fear is misplaced, because the thing that has seen Ashfield through good times and bad is its sense of community. Indeed, I could say that the big society is alive and well there. For us, that is not a smart phrase invented by those from the leafy lanes of Notting Hill: one can smell it in the novels of Lawrence and see it there today. Every village has its community hub: the Stanton Hill community shop, the Huthwaite community action group, the Eastwood volunteer bureau, the Kirkby volunteer bureau, the Acacia avenue community centre and the Friends of Colliers Wood-I could go on and on. We do not just look out for each other in Ashfield; we stand up for ourselves, too, as those involved in the Kirkby and Sutton area residents associations prove every day by trying to keep the green fields in Ashfield green. D. H. Lawrence might be our historical hero, but it is the local heroes who are alive and well today that I want to support and pay tribute to. We can read about them each week in the <i> Ashfield </i><i> Chad</i> and the <i> Eastwood </i><i> &amp;</i><i> Kimberley Advertiser</i>.</p>
	<p pid="e.398.0/6">I came from a pretty poor background, and I believe that it is thanks to my party speaking up for people from backgrounds such as my own that I was able to go to university, have a successful media career and today speak from these green Benches. I believe that Governments can and should help to transform people's lives for the better. Of course it takes individual effort and the support of the family, but there is something else that transforms people's lives, and that is community.</p>
	<p pid="e.398.0/7">I know that it is fashionable for some on the Government Front Bench to talk about community, and I am delighted that they have rediscovered the word-along with &quot;society&quot;-but I am not convinced that they really understand it. They have presented a false divide between the big society and big government. I am arguing for an enabling Government who help people to come together and look after their interests. It is not a matter of choosing between society and the state; it is about binding the two together, for then, truly, the whole is worth more than the sum of the parts. The result is an empowered community and a flexible, responsive, enabling state, working together, rather than one replacing the other.</p>
	<p pid="e.398.0/8">It is ironic that the so-called new politics, which suggests that state and society are somehow opposed and that one can flourish only if the other withdraws, should so precisely mirror the mistakes made by the worst of old Labour which sometimes gave the impression that the state knew best and should dictate what happened. Underneath its rhetoric, the new politics represents the flip side of the same coin. Its adherents seek to trumpet society at the expense of the state, which the Conservative party says should be smaller as a matter of principle. I do not know whether its supposed partners agree with that, but I guess that we will find out eventually.</p>
	<p pid="e.398.0/9">It is dogma to suggest that, if we roll back the state, the big society will flourish in its wake. Places like Ashfield need strong communities and strong government. If that means big government, then that is fine if that is what is needed. We do not need big government for its own sake, of course, but we do need strong and active government, for a purpose. After all, were Sure Start or community support officers examples of big government? Is a Government-initiated apprenticeship one?</p>
	<p pid="e.398.0/10">Today, Ashfield needs a new economic backbone to enable local people to develop their talents and become the D.H. Lawrences and Larwoods of the future. We need it to promote the talents of people who come from Ashfield and ensure that those talents stay in the area to develop its future economic strength.</p>
	<p pid="e.398.0/11">We know that tough economic times lie ahead. Ashfield can cope with a lot, but it is up to Government to help us. Ashfield is a place with a tremendous sense of community, but we need the Government to help us on the way. Ashfield has a big heart and lies at the heart of England. We will be as strong, vibrant and successful as we were in our heyday, but such a renaissance will happen only with a strong state and a strong society working hand in hand. If hon. Members on the Government Benches cannot see that and make it happen, when we get our chance, we will.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-06-09e.418.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40286" speakername="Brandon Lewis" colnum="418"  time="018:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100609/debtext/100609-0017.htm#10060953001161">
	<p pid="e.418.1/1">I echo the comments made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40456" name="Michael Ellis">the Member for Northampton North (Michael Ellis)</phrase> in congratulating all those hon. Members who have made their maiden speeches today. Like him, I remember making mine about a week ago. At the time, I was unsure whether I was more nervous about making the speech or about having to wait so many hours to make it. So I offer my congratulations-and, in some ways, my commiserations-to all those who have had to sit here today waiting for their time to come.</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/2">I also want to echo the comment made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40555" name="Robert Buckland">the Member for South Swindon (Mr Buckland)</phrase> when he congratulated the team who put together the NO2ID campaign. They did superb, ground-breaking work at an early stage in making use of some of the social media sites. As a user of Twitter and Facebook myself, I think that they did a super job in bringing people together and creating a cohesive campaign. It is ironic that some of those same social networking groups have had questions raised about data protection and the data that they hold on people. My core problem with identity cards has always related to data protection.</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/3">When the legislation was first introduced in March 2006, I had an instinctive feeling that it was the wrong thing to do, as I am a believer in small government. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton North mentioned function creep. That and the Big Brother state added to the feeling that this was yet another system that the previous Government were using to gain more knowledge and control over all of us. It is interesting that it moved to being a voluntary scheme, following the initial proposal to make it compulsory. I congratulate the Home Secretary and the entire ministerial team on using one of our first Bills to get rid of this vile piece of legislation.</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/4">I look at the matter quite simply. My decision to speak today is based on my conversations over the past few years with residents in my constituency of Great Yarmouth. I have spoken to tens of thousands of people, and I was wracking my brains today as I worked through the pros and cons of the argument. I wanted to play devil's advocate and produce a strong and positive case for identity cards, yet I cannot remember any Great Yarmouth residents asking me when they could get theirs. Not one person has told me that we should make it compulsory, or that we should hurry up its introduction.</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/5">Residents of Great Yarmouth said many things during the election, but I struggle to remember anyone asking, &quot;Will you please make sure that, if your party is successful and forms a Government, you keep the identity card legislation? I am very much looking forward to getting my card.&quot; That is not a conversation that I recall, although I wait to be corrected by any resident who does recall it.</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/6">A very long-serving Member of this House who is no longer here gave me some advice earlier this year. I was told that, if I was fortunate enough to be elected, I should ensure that I know why I am speaking on an issue in the Chamber, and why I am voting on it. I was told to be aware of the positive impact that any proposal would have on the lives of my constituents and the country. I cannot think of a single thing about the Identity Cards Act 2006 that is beneficial, and so can see no reason to support it. For that reason, I support its abolition.</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/7">Given that my residents in Great Yarmouth do not want identity cards, what is the economic case for them? The figures that I have seen show a set-up cost of around &#163;450 million to bring the scheme in, and that operating it over the next 10 years would cost something like &#163;4.1 billion. We heard at Prime Minister's Question Time earlier today that the interest charge alone on our national debt will cost us around &#163;70 billion a year or more, so it seems to me that we simply cannot afford such a hugely expensive scheme. I have not met anyone among my residents of Great Yarmouth who wants the scheme, although I appreciate that some Opposition Members might have a different view. It is an expensive folly, and I cannot see why we should get involved in something that we simply cannot afford.</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/8">From the perspective of what is good for my residents and what they want, it is clear that they do not want identity cards. Given also that we cannot afford them, why would we consider them? Is it a question of civil liberties? Earlier, one hon. Member mentioned that other countries have identity cards, but is their use forced on those countries' populations? What would be the benefit for us?</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/9">I do not know about other Members of this House, but I have a passport. I also have utility bills and a photocard driving licence. I have credit cards-unfortunately!-and lots of other proofs of identity. I know so many people who also have lots of different proofs that I started to wonder why I would want an identity card as well. What benefit would I get from having one? Again, I cannot think of any.</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/10">Would having identity cards make us safer and protect us against crime and terrorism? Even the now shadow Home Secretary and his predecessors-Charles Clarke among them, I think-have admitted that the identity card scheme would not do much to prevent terrorism. Indeed, the shadow Home Secretary himself said a while ago that he regretted the emphasis that had been put on the card's usefulness in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/11">The reason for that, as was noted earlier this debate, is that the card was supposed to be voluntary. Why would a person considering committing any sort of crime, such as fraud or an act of terrorism, go and get an identity card voluntarily? That is beyond me but, as a new Member, I am sure that Opposition Members will enlighten me in the hours to come, but I cannot see the benefit.</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/12">Certainly, I cannot see that having an identity card would be the first thing on the mind of a person looking to commit a major fraud or act of terrorism. I do not believe that such a person would think, &quot;I can't commit this crime because I have an identity card and the authorities might find out who I am.&quot; At the same, we have also heard that modern electronics such as those involved in computers, printing and so on are so advanced that it would not be difficult for anyone who is criminally minded to find a way around the system, falsify the documents and create a false identity card. That would give us another problem and a real issue to deal with, because a black market would thus be created whereby people make fraudulent documents to sell to people who want to commit other crimes.</p>
	<p pid="e.418.1/13">Some of my local residents in Great Yarmouth have concerns about antisocial behaviour. Our local police are working hard to improve the situation and some of their thinking outside the box has done a phenomenal job. They have also cracked down on under-age drinking. We all want that to happen, and we have heard much talk of that across the House and in the press over the past few months. A substantial black market in creating false identity cards would receive a hugely beneficial financial boost from under-age drinkers who want to obtain such cards in order to buy alcohol. That shows that we could be walking a hugely dangerous tightrope in future, and I have not yet got too far into dealing with worries about a Government who have a database that contains 50 pieces of information about everyone in the country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-06-09e.430.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="430"  time="018:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100609/debtext/100609-0019.htm#10060962000107">
	<p pid="e.430.1/1">I am afraid that the hon. Lady did not leave me enough time to give way to her, as she overran her time.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/2">Let me start with what the shadow Home Secretary said. He gave a completely bravura performance. It was entertaining and funny, and it was particularly good from someone whose heart, I felt, was not really in it. I do not believe that he is a fully paid-up member of the authoritarian tendency on the Labour Benches. The fact that his speech was so good disguised the central incoherence in it. He said that he wanted ID cards to be voluntary, and his speech also contained a long, passionate passage about how they would be effective in the fight against terrorism. He can either hold the view that we need compulsory ID cards to fight terrorism, or he can hold the view that we need voluntary ID cards, but he cannot hold both at once. He knows as well as I do that a voluntary card system would have no effect on terrorists, criminals or benefit fraudsters, who would not sign up to a voluntary scheme. That was the central incoherence in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/3">May I correct one example that the right hon. Gentleman gave? He said that France had a national identity database. It does indeed have a national identity card scheme, but the cards are issued, and the accompanying register held, at local level. There is no single French identity database, so he was wrong about that.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/4">Like others, I pay tribute to the many good speeches that we have heard. I say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40040" name="Richard Shepherd">the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Mr Shepherd)</phrase> that it was a privilege to hear his magnificent speech in favour of freedom and Parliament's essential role in defending it. I now move on to the many hon. Members on both sides of the House who made their maiden speeches. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40281" name="Caroline Dinenage">the Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage)</phrase> gave a stirring defence of naval tradition of which I believe Lord Palmerston, one of her distinguished predecessors, would have been proud. It was a delight to hear the maiden speeches of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40081" name="Jack Dromey">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey)</phrase>, who will clearly be a strong champion for Birmingham, and of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40279" name="Richard Graham">the Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham)</phrase>, who gave us a fascinating and educational tour ranging from Piers Gaveston to Harry Potter by way of Beatrix Potter.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/5">I sympathise with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40177" name="Susan Elan Jones">the hon. Member for Clwyd South (Susan Elan Jones)</phrase>, who said that the size of her constituency was 240 square miles. Until a recent boundary review mine covered 220 square miles, so I know that she has a lot of travelling to do over the next few years. I join my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40261" name="Mike Freer">the Member for Finchley and Golders Green (Mike Freer)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40290" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> in using this occasion to pay tribute to Rudi Vis, who died last week and was a friend to many of us on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/6">I was delighted to learn from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40338" name="Kris Hopkins">the Member for Keighley (Kris Hopkins)</phrase> that the village of Oakworth is the Notting Hill of the north in providing a tightly knit group of massive political talent. I was also educated by hearing from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268" name="Ian Mearns">the hon. Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)</phrase> that the most famous running of the Blaydon races was on today's date, <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-09">9 June</phrase>; I will store that fact away. Similarly, I learned from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40245" name="Alec Shelbrooke">the Member for Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke)</phrase> that Elmet was the last Celtic kingdom in this country-another fascinating fact for everyone. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40523" name="Nigel Adams">the Member for Selby and Ainsty (Nigel Adams)</phrase> told us that he is the grandson of a miner. He might not know that the Government Chief Whip was a miner himself, so if I were him I would concentrate on emphasising that fact. It could be career-enhancing.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/7">To stay with mining, it was a delight to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40048" name="Gloria De Piero">the hon. Member for Ashfield (Gloria De Piero)</phrase> make her maiden speech. I was delighted to hear that the big society is clearly alive and well in Ashfield. Many of us will have woken up with her on many occasions when she was on GMTV, and it is a great privilege to have her here in the House in person.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/8">There were also speeches from those who were recently elected but were not making their maiden speeches. It was a particular delight to hear from my hon. Friends the Members for South Swindon (Mr Buckland) and for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab), both of whom are clearly great new fighters in the House for liberty and freedom. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40209" name="Charlie Elphicke">the Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke)</phrase> gave a fascinating speech, and I can assure that him that the current Home Office Ministers will not try to strong-arm their staff into buying identity cards.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/9">I wish to address some of the specific points that the hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch and other hon. Members made. I was slightly shocked to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40527" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)</phrase> say that the British passport was easy to forge. As a former Home Secretary, he knows that it is actually a secure, high-integrity document and very difficult to counterfeit or forge. I do not believe that when he was Home Secretary he told the House or anyone else that it was easy to forge.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/10">In response to an intervention, the shadow Home Secretary made a point about the biometric residence permit and minority communities. It is clearly nonsense to suggest that the permit, which has to be held by people who are living in this country because they want to work here, could in some way be used to revive the sus laws. He knows as well as I do that no one is required to carry it with them at any time. Frankly, it is an insult to the police to suggest that they would behave like that.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/11">Many interesting points were made by the former Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>. In particular, he speculated on how we might destroy the national identity register when the time comes. I suspect that the Home Secretary, other ministerial colleagues and I might bend our minds to find the best and most dramatic way of striking that blow for freedom.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/12">The right hon. Gentleman asked a number of detailed questions, including one about the number of cards that had been issued. As of <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-27">27 May 2010</phrase>, the number of ID cards issued was 14,670. He also asked what is happening now and whether people can still apply for a card, and therefore waste &#163;30. We have adopted a common-sense approach to that, so staff at the Identity and Passport Service inform any potential applicants that it is the Government's stated intention to scrap ID cards, and then ask them whether, in that light, they want to reconsider going ahead with the application. The Government have taken a common-sense attitude, but I have heard some anecdotal evidence that some journalists are desperate to be the last person to buy an identity card so that they can write an article about it. I am not sure whether any normal citizens, as it were, are continuing to apply.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/13">The right hon. Gentleman asked about biometric residence permits. Since <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-25">25 November 2008</phrase> the UK Border Agency has issued 188,000 residency permits. The attempt by the previous Government to rebadge those as ID cards for foreign nationals, in an attempt to make more acceptable a scheme that was clearly unacceptable to the British people, was pretty disingenuous, and it clearly failed.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/14">The right hon. Gentleman asked what happens when people have applied but not yet received a card. When a person has made an application but payment has not been made, they are informed of the coalition Government's policy and the introduction of the Bill, because we want to save their time and money, and we request that they hold off their application pending the outcome of parliamentary consideration of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/15">The decision to scrap the scheme is mainly about stopping the state snooping into the lives of innocent people. We would have introduced the measure even if we were not saving significant sums of money by doing so, but a lot has been said in the debate about the expense. Even though this measure is a matter of principle, it is a happy coincidence that in putting our principle of freedom into practice, we are saving the British people hundreds of millions of pounds. The previous Government planned to spend &#163;835 million on ID cards over the next 10 years, even after they had stripped out the costs that they were loading on to the IPS.</p>
	<p pid="e.430.1/16">The previous Government claimed, as shadow Ministers have today, that the whole scheme would cost nothing, because the money would be recovered from charges. I have got news for those former Ministers: it is the British people who would have paid those charges. Whether the Government take money from people as a charge or a tax, that is still taking away people's money. By that measure, this Government are leaving in the pockets of the British people &#163;835 million that the previous Government would have extracted for their terrible scheme.</p>

	<p pid="e.436.2/1">May I, through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, thank Mr Speaker for allowing me this evening's debate. It is pleasure to see you in the Chair on what I think is your first day. I believe that this is the first time that I have addressed the Minister from the Opposition Benches, and I am very pleased to do so. I assure him that it will not be the last time that we will be engaged in these conversations.</p>
	<p pid="e.436.2/2">From this Adjournment debate on alleged fraud in the Wirral hospital trust, I am looking for three things. First, I am sure that I am not exceptional in the number of constituent cases about alleged fraud that I refer to the relevant authority. In every case I have passed on, whether it be to the Department for Work and Pensions or to the Department of Health, I have never had a satisfactory reply that I could then refer to my constituent. I would not disclose the information, but if I had such a reply, I could say that I had been able to read the papers and assure constituents that they were mistaken in alleging fraud. I could say that a proper investigation had been carried out and we could leave the case there. As I say, however, that has never occurred. One thing I am looking for this evening, then, is for the Government to consider the particular role in which elected representatives sometimes find themselves in handing to the Government alleged cases of fraud, yet never being able satisfactorily to report back to their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="e.436.2/3">Secondly, I have tried to use the Freedom of Information Act in order to gain the information that Wirral hospital trust denied me. I was refused on the basis that disclosure of the information would provide me with sensitive personal information such as the name of the person against whom the allegations of fraud were made. However, given that everybody involved in the case knows the name of the doctor, although I have never used it in public, it seems somewhat farcical to use the Freedom of Information Act in this way to prevent my gaining access to reports that have been commissioned.</p>
	<p pid="e.436.2/4">Thirdly, this saga has been going on for a long time, and I have no intention of letting go of it, so I hope that the Minister might be able to advise me on the next best steps to take to resolve the issue. Through you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to remind the House of what happened.</p>
	<p pid="e.436.2/5">All too long ago, one of my constituents was sitting in the surgery at their doctor's. The doctor was engaged in a telephone conversation with one of his patients, who turned out to be a private patient. During the conversation, for reasons that I cannot possibly explain, the doctor assured the person that they had been treated as an NHS patient although they were being charged as a private patient.</p>
	<p pid="e.436.2/6">I started to look into the case. I asked both the primary care trust and the hospital trust-Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust-to investigate. I had a meeting with the hospital trust at which the chairman and the senior directors were present, as well as the locally based official who was in charge of countering fraud in the health service. At that stage the doctor admitted that, as a result of an error, he had put through as NHS patients about 180 patients whom he was charging as private patients, but who were being given tests as NHS patients.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2010-06-09e.437.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" speakername="Frank Field" colnum="437"  time="019:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100609/debtext/100609-0020.htm#10060962000115">
	<p pid="e.437.3/1">I strongly agree, and I hope that at some stage the medical profession will give serious consideration to how the interface between the public and private sectors might be policed in the context of health.</p>
	<p pid="e.437.3/2">As the fraud officer present said that it was quite reasonable to undertake the next stage of the inquiries, I left the meeting, only to find that later the chairman of the hospital trust and her senior executives had said that no such investigation would take place, and that I would not have access to their reports on this case of alleged fraud unless I was prepared to sign a document saying that after reading the information I would never use any of it in public debate. I was not prepared to sign such a gagging clause.</p>
	<p pid="e.437.3/3">I appealed for access to the documents concerned under the Freedom of Information Act. Because the hospital trust is not known for its efficiency, it applied to block my appeal under the wrong section of the Act. When I appealed to the commissioner, he had to point out to the trust that if it wanted to block my original appeal it would have to use another part of the Act, which of course it then did.</p>
	<p pid="e.437.3/4">I then appealed to the tribunal, which ruled that I should not have access to the document, or documents, because if I had such access I would gain sensitive personal information to which I was not entitled, such as the name of the person against whom the allegations were being made. As at every stage everyone who was in that room has known the name of the doctor concerned but none of us has made it public, it seems bizarre that it was on those grounds that I was denied access to the counter-fraud report which is alleged to have been undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="e.437.3/5">Since the attempts to grapple with that individual case of fraud, the same hospital trust has had to repay more than &#163;1 million to what was the primary care trust but is now Wirral Health, because it was found to be fiddling its accident and emergency figures. Quite how that came about and how it was decided that the fraud amounted to &#163;1 million-plus I do not know, but that money has been repaid. I allege that there is a culture of fraud in that hospital trust, which is not being taken seriously by the chairman and the directors of the trust. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>
	<p pid="e.437.3/6">One last point concerns the Freedom of Information Act 2000. I am well aware that the Government have their own legislative programme, but I would be grateful if the Minister would take back the fact that there may be problems in two respects where MPs refer fraud cases to the administration for investigation. One is the one that I touched on at the beginning of my remarks. As elected representatives, we are never put in a position to report back fully to our constituents. Obviously, we deny them any sensitive personal information, but we cannot say that we have read the relevant papers and we would like to be able to assure them that their concerns about fraud are unfounded.</p>
	<p pid="e.437.3/7">Secondly, I took up the case only because a constituent referred me to a case of alleged fraud. The doctor admits that somehow in 180-odd cases he happened to tick the wrong boxes, claiming the people concerned were NHS patients, rather than private patients. It seems wrong that I am denied access, as the elected representative of an area, to the counter-fraud allegations that have taken place.</p>
	<p pid="e.437.3/8">There are two issues, and I would be grateful if the Minister reflected on them with his colleagues, although he may wish to comment on them in the debate. The case has dragged on for some time, but as I have said- I know the Minister is convinced of this-I am not going to let it go yet. I would be interested to hear how the Government think that we might take the case forward to a successful conclusion. I wait to hear what the Minister says.</p>

	<p pid="e.438.0/1">I add my congratulations on your elevation, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is warmly welcomed by me and I imagine by many right hon. and hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase> on securing the debate on detecting and dealing with fraud in Wirral NHS foundation trust. I know from the research that I have done that he has had a long-standing interest in the case. In certain areas I can appreciate his frustration as a constituency MP seeking to represent the interests of his constituents and to get to the bottom of a problem. Fraud in the NHS is totally unacceptable, but before I move to the specifics of the case that he has raised, I would like to explain the processes and institutions involved in the detection, investigation and prosecution of fraud in the NHS, although I promise to keep it brief.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/3">Fraud and corruption in the NHS is dealt with by the NHS counter-fraud service. Since the NHS anti-fraud initiative began in 1998, counter-fraud service investigations have led to 551 successful prosecutions, with a 96% conviction rate, 773 civil and disciplinary sanctions and the recovery of more than &#163;59 million in cash. Under &quot;Secretary of State Directions&quot;, all NHS bodies nominate a local counter-fraud specialist, who reports to their director of finance and works with counter-fraud service staff.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/4">Because of their independent status, foundation trusts are not, however, bound by Secretary of State directions. Clause 43 and schedule 13 of the standard NHS commissioning contract, under which foundation trusts operate, regulate anti-fraud requirements and mirror those in Secretary of State directions. Local counter-fraud specialist staff investigate allegations or suspicion of fraud. Where fraud is suspected, all appropriate disciplinary, civil and criminal sanctions are sought.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/5">Through a quality assurance programme, the counter-fraud service works to ensure that all NHS organisations apply the highest standards to their anti-fraud work. A self-assessment process, managed by the counter-fraud service, helps NHS organisations identify and improve any areas of weakness. The assessment rated trusts on a scale of 1 to 4, with level 1 indicating that adequate performance had not been met and level 4 demonstrating that the organisation was performing strongly. In 2009, Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust achieved a level 2 rating, indicating that its performance was &quot;adequate&quot;. The counter-fraud service is continuing to work with the trust to improve its performance and to ensure that it meets the highest possible standards.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/6">I understand that the right hon. Member for Birkenhead has been concerned about this particular case of alleged fraud since 2007, when a constituent anonymously alleged that fraud was being committed by a general practitioner. The allegation was that the GP was using NHS blood service facilities at Arrowe Park hospital for his private patients but not declaring them as such. The case was first referred to the primary care trust by the pathology laboratory manager in January 2005. Following some initial inquiries, the PCT referred it to the trust local counter-fraud specialist in January 2006. The trust began its investigation in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/7">I understand that the right hon. Gentleman wrote to the trust's chief executive in March 2007, asking what actions had been taken to investigate such a serious allegation of fraud. The trust explained that an investigation had taken place. The trust's local counter-fraud service was provided via a contract with Deloitte. This is common practice among NHS trusts.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/8">In the report into the case, published in October 2007, the investigation found that while there had been inaccuracies in the documentation, there was insufficient evidence that the GP had intended to defraud the hospital. The GP accepted that he had made mistakes, but refuted any suggestion that he had intended to deceive or mislead the trust. The investigation report concluded that there was insufficient evidence on which to charge and prosecute the GP concerned. The investigation reached this decision partly because of a lack of clear instructions to GPs on how to complete referral forms, and partly because of the potential ambiguities on the forms themselves, such as a lack of a declaration on the form.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/9">I understand that the GP repaid the money to the trust for the work done and that the trust chief executive wrote to the right hon. Gentleman to explain the outcome of the investigation. Separately, between December 2007 and February 2008, the Mersey internal audit agency investigated concerns over the use of NHS services on behalf of private patients. The review found no evidence of fraud.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/10">I know that the right hon. Gentleman has met representatives of the trust and the counter-fraud service to discuss his concern that the investigation was not sufficiently robust. It is vital that hon. Members and the public have full confidence in the ability of the NHS to identify and root out any examples of fraud. So that I may satisfy myself and the right hon. Gentleman-I hope-that the original investigation was indeed sufficiently robust, I will ask the departmental sponsor at the Department of Health in Whitehall for the NHS counter-fraud service to work with the managing director of that service to review this case and report to me directly on their findings. I will then write to the right hon. Gentleman on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/11">The second issue concerns the right hon. Gentleman's requests for information on the investigation. I understand that on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-30">30 November 2007</phrase> the trust offered him a copy of the investigation report subject to a confidentiality agreement, which he rejected. While accepting the good intentions of the trust, this offer was, to my mind, a mistake. While the trust's intention was to be as helpful as possible, it was required to protect the GP under the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/12">I have noted the right hon. Gentleman's observations about the workings of that legislation vis-&#224;-vis the work of Members of this House in pursuing their constituency duties, and I will certainly give him a commitment that I will pass on his concerns to my relevant ministerial colleague, so that this can be looked at. I make no other promise or commitment on that, but I do give an assurance that it will be passed on to be considered, without any ties as to what the ultimate decision might be.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/13">In January 2008, the right hon. Gentleman submitted a freedom of information request to the trust, asking for information on the investigation. Legal advice was sought by the trust. It was advised that it was legally required not to comply with the right hon. Gentleman's request, as the release of the information in question would have been considered personal and in breach of the legislation that I have just mentioned. However, it was felt appropriate to disclose limited information from the investigation report that dealt with improving trust practices, such as the weaknesses in procedures that had been identified.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/14">I understand that the right hon. Gentleman then sought the assistance of the Information Commissioner's Office on this matter. The commissioner upheld the trust's decision not to provide the GP's sensitive personal data, and advised the trust that it should not take any further steps in relation to the request. Finally, the right hon. Gentleman appealed to the Information Tribunal, which also found that the trust had acted properly on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/15">I understand that, at that point, the right hon. Gentleman agreed to the trust's original proposal to sign a confidentiality agreement, so that he could see the original report. However, following the decision of the Information Commissioner's Office, the trust was legally unable to disclose that information. As I said, I feel that it had been a mistake to make that offer to the right hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/16">I wholeheartedly share the right hon. Gentleman's concern about any possibility of fraud in the NHS. If there is ever any suspicion of fraud, it must not only be investigated thoroughly, but be seen to be investigated thoroughly. That is why I have asked the responsible Department of Health official, in conjunction with the NHS counter-fraud service, to review this case and the investigations that took place. I hope that that will clearly demonstrate to the right hon. Gentleman that the Government and I take issues of fraud in the NHS very seriously indeed. When it is committed, it must be rooted out. Equally, when an innocent party is accused, they must have every opportunity to clear their name. When the review is complete, I will write to the right hon. Gentleman with its findings. I hope that he will be satisfied with that approach to what has been a long, complex and sometimes perplexing problem.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/17" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/18" class="italic"> House adjourned.</p>
	<p pid="e.438.0/19">Correction</p>
