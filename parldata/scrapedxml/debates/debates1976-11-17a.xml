<p>Does the Secretary of State realise that while the talks in Geneva appear to be approaching a state of collapse the Soviet Union is apparently increasing its supply of arms to the guerrilla forces in Southern Africa? Will he therefore consider flying to Geneva, if that becomes necessary to save the talks, and make it clear to the nationalists that if the talks collapse at this stage many people in the world will see it as a result of their intransigence and their refusal to take "Yes" as an answer?</p>

<p>I am prepared to go to Geneva if by going I can save the conference from collapse. There can be no doubt of that. We have made it clear that, whilst the talks are going on, both sides should do all that they can to de-escalate the guerrilla warfare that is going on. I do not think that the talks are now on the point of collapse. It is far too early, and it is too much of a hypothetical matter, to say upon whose shoulders such a collapse would lie.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend not agree that a major stumbling block to the continuation of the talks appears to be the understandable distrust that the African leaders have of Mr. Smith? Will he give an assurance that during the period of the transitional Government ministerial control of the police and security forces will not remain with Mr. Smith or any of his associates who participated in his illegal racialist r&#x00E9;gime?</p>

<p>There are 101 stumbling blocks to an agreement at the conference. The one that my hon. Friend mentioned is a major one, but not the only one. Responsibility for the armed forces, security forces and law and order will constitute a central aspect when the conference gets round to discussing the question of interim government.</p>

<p>Is the Secretary of State aware that the Opposition fully share his desire to see a successful outcome of the conference but that we are deeply concerned about the lack of progress at the present stage? It is difficult to understand why it was considered wise to tackle the date for independence first. Does the right hon. Gentleman not agree that it seems unwise to settle the date of arrival before knowing the route by which one gets there?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his opening remarks. Starting with the date and time required to reach independence was a tactical decision. I have no wish to criticise Mr. Ivor Richard on the tactics that he chose. It seemed to him that the date would be an easier matter to settle than, for instance, the question who should be responsible for law and order and the armed forces. The date for independence should have been easier to settle, and it is a disappointment that a difference of


three months is proving such an important obstacle.</p>

<p>As it is nearly two months since the Kissinger agreement was reached, and now that the Rhodesian delegation is playing its part at Geneva, what is the point of maintaining sanctions if, in the meantime, we do not directly administer the territory?</p>

<p>We passed the sanctions order in the House only a few weeks ago and it was approved in another place only on Friday. I have made it clear that we shall move quickly to lift sanctions once an interim Government has been agreed.</p>

<p>Does the Minister not agree that it is dangerous to try to renegotiate the Kissinger package and to lift sanctions before there is an agreement? Are we not faced with two potentially fatal ambiguities? First, the 21st September telegram from Dr. Kissinger in Dar-es-Salaam could mean that agreement on defence and security questions had actually been secured, or, alternatively, that these matters should be placed on the agenda for discussion. Secondly, what does Mr. Smith mean by majority rule? Does he mean what the rest of us mean by majority rule, or does he mean a qualified majority rule? Does the Minister agree that until we get those ambiguities removed we shall not be able to negotiate on equal terms with both sides?</p>

<p>I agree that it is dangerous to lift sanctions before agreement is reached. The matter that the right hon. Gentleman has raised will be under discussion at the Geneva talks, and I do not wish to pre-empt those discussions.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend not find it astonishing that some of the most vociferous of the self-appointed guardians

of law and order are advocating that we should cease to sustain our action against the most outrageous act of illegality that has ever been perpetrated in a British territory? Would that not play into the hands of those who perpetrated that act? Should we not uphold law and order by continuing sanctions?</p>

<p>We must uphold law and order by maintaining sanctions. Some of the remarks made by those who want to lift sanctions before a settlement is reached and an interim Government has been arranged imply that they support the legalising of an illegal r&#x00E9;gime.</p>

<p>I refer the hon. Member to the answer that I gave to the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Blaker) on 11th November. As the Belgrade Review Conference approaches, we shall of course intensify our consultations with our partners and allies. We are, moreover, maintaining a careful record of the degree of progress on implementation achieved by the participating States, with a view to making a full contribution to the Review Conference.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for that reply. Is it the Government's intention to press that the Belgrade Review Conference be held at a political level and not just at civil servants' level? In his preparations for the conference, what consideration is the hon. Gentleman giving to the arguments increasingly heard that the transfer of Western technology and expertise to the Soviet Union enables the Soviet Union to free other resources, which can then be used for purposes hostile to the West?</p>

<p>The Government fully recognise the political importance of the Belgrade meetings. However, it is too early to think of formulating negotiating positions. We are in close touch with many other participating States in order to monitor progress and closely examine areas in which further


progress can be made. It is too early to be talking about the detail of the negotiating mandate.</p>

<p>As the Government are rightly monitoring progress, can the hon. Gentleman confirm that the Prime Minister received by hand a letter from Mr. Andrei Sakharov relating the conditions in which Mr. Vladimir Bukovsky is being kept in prison in Russia? What reply does he propose to give to that letter or, even better, what pressure does he propose to bring upon the Soviet Government to release Mr. Bukovsky?</p>

<p>I am not in a position to confirm details about a particular letter, but I can make clear, as I have before, that over the past year we have on a number of occasions raised individual cases with the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. Those concerned have been left in no doubt about the strength of feeling which rightly exists in the House and the country on all these matters, which will continue to be pressed on every possible opportune occasion with the utmost vigour.</p>

<p>In addition to our frequent consultations with the other CSCE countries, to which I have referred, we have in particular recently notified a military manoeuvre&#x2014;"Exercise Spear-point", in the Federal Republic of Germany&#x2014;and we are taking action in a number of fields to develop contacts with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. We have made clear on a number of occasions exactly what needs to be done to facilitate freer movement of people between countries.</p>

<p>In view of the hon. Gentleman's answer about individual cases will he confirm that the Government have received the same response as we on the Conservative Benches have had when we have put individual cases to the Soviet authorities&#x2014;namely, complete silence?</p>

<p>I am not in a position to confirm that. There have been a num-

ber of exchanges of view, some of which have been more successful than others. I do not consider it a laughing matter. Every opportunity has been taken to put individual cases as forcefully as possible, so that nobody can be left in any doubt about our feelings. Some approaches receive more response than others.</p>

<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for that rather laconic answer.

<p>There is undoubtedly a closer relationship than there has been in


the past between the United States and Egypt, but that goes for the United Kingdom and Egypt. One of the important and hopeful signs for the whole of the Middle East is that good contacts are being pursued by all the parties outside the region. That means that they will have more influence on the parties to the dispute when it comes to a discussion, but essentially the will for a settlement must come from the parties to the dispute.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir; I confirm that that is our intention. Indeed, the fact that we have stuck to that intention has been one of the complications in the disagreements of the last few days.

<p>Returning to the answer given to the hon. Member for Norfolk, North-West (Mr. Brocklebank-Fowler) on Question No. 13, may I ask my right hon.

<p>It depends what is meant by "any responsibility". What I said in answer to that earlier Question was simply that, if that responsibility involved British armed forces being sent to Rhodesia, Her Majesty's Government would not accept that situation&#x2014;nor, I believe, would any Conservative Government dream of accepting it.</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary may have seen a report by a responsible commentator at the beginning of the negotiations suggesting that the British delegation appeared to have gone out of its way to insult Mr. Smith and his delegation.

<p>I try to read as many responsible commentators as I can, but there are quite a few of them to read every day. I do not recall such a suggestion, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that the British Government's negotiators in Geneva do not&#x2014;I repeat "not"&#x2014;believe in exchanging insults. In the last few days the main insults have come from Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>If the talks are to be successful, will my right hon. Friend reconsider the urgent necessity of accepting Britain's responsibility in a colonial ter-

<p>I repeat that Britain has never exercised full colonial responsibility for Rhodesia since 1923&#x2014;nor indeed before, for quite different reasons. As for the institution of a governor-general, the extent of British involvement will have to be decided in the light of whatever agreement is reached. But I wish to make it clear that the Government rule out in all circumstances any dispatch of British armed forces. As for an international peacekeeping force under the United Nations, the Commonwealth or the OAU, I shall bear that suggestion in mind, but the great objection to such an international force is that it would take an immense amount of time to organise and to get to Rhodesia. It would take a very long time and a great deal of negotiation and bargaining to get this force there. Whatever presence we have must be there from the beginning, which I hope will not be a very long time away.</p>

<p>That is a very acute danger indeed.

<p>I attended the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 15th and 16th November. On the external relations side, the main items were the reply which the Community should return to the

Council for Mutual Economic Assistance proposals received earlier this year, which is the subject of the next Question on the Order Paper, and agreement on the Community's Generalised Scheme of Preferences for 1977. The Council also considered a wide range of other external relations questions, on which I shall circulate a statement in the <i>Official Report.</i><br/>
Commissioner Gundelach reported to the Council on his talks in Iceland on 12th November. We emphasised once again the great importance which Her Majesty's Government attach to arrangements that will allow us to continue fishing in Icelandic waters after the expiry of the provisional agreement. We also urged on the Council the need for a cutback in third country fishing in Community waters from the beginning of 1977.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Secretary of State for that short statement. Does he net believe that it should have been a statement at the end of Questions, as has been the custom, or are we to conclude, from the fact that it was only an answer to a Question that I happened to have on the Order Paper, that nothing very important was achieved at the conference?<br/>
Among the subjects thought likely to be discussed at the meeting held earlier was that of EEC passports. May we have an assurance that, if we are to have them, they will be additional only for people who want them&#x2014;I cannot imagine why&#x2014;and that they will not be compulsory for people who do not want them?</p>

<p>With regard to the first part of the question, I have looked into this, and I find that there is no rule of procedure that makes it mandatory or even a matter of courtesy that an oral statement should be made each time a decision is taken. I hope it is accepted that good will and fair judgment are exercised each time on the question whether the business of the Council justifies a statement, bearing in mind the crowded nature of our business.<br/>
As for the question of the common passport, I have a great deal of personal sympathy with the hon. Gentleman, being on this kind of subject, like him, an old-fashioned patriot. Nevertheless, the view has been taken that in the interests of


Community unity there would be advantage in having at any rate a greater degree of uniformity in the passport. This will be compulsory rather than voluntary, but I can assure the hon. Gentleman, having examined possible samples, that at the end of the day the British passport will remain highly recognisable.</p>

<q>The Council meeting spread over two full days. I attended the first day, accompanied by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, who both represented the United Kingdom on 16th November. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland was present for discussion on fisheries matters.</q>
<q>On the external relations side the Council made good progress on the Community's 1977 Generalised Scheme of Preferences, which will continue the process of improving the preferences offered by the Community to developing countries on a wide range of industrial and agricultural products. Emphasis was put on the need to improve the scheme in the interests of all the poorest countries. After the President of the Council had reported on his meeting with the President of the ACP countries, Ministers discussed briefly new accessions to the Lom&#x00E9; Convention. The Council defined the Community position in preparation for the November session of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation and it was agreed that this issue would be further discussed at the European Council on 29th and 30th November.</q>
<q>The Council agreed the Community's offer for the second EEC/Greece Financial Protocol and that formal negotiations should be opened with Iran for the conclusion of a commercial and economic co-operation agreement. The Council approved in principle the results of the negotiations with the Mashraq countries and Israel. The agreements with these countries are expected to be signed early next month. The Council also had a further useful discussion on ways in which the Community's links with Yugoslavia could be strengthened.</q>
<q>There was no discussion of the uniform passport but I expect that Foreign Ministers will consider it at the December meeting. The Council approved the text of a draft declaration which is proposed for issue jointly by the Council, the European Assembly and the Commission affirming their respect for fundamental rights in the Community.</q></q>

<p>The Community's reply to the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance's proposals which were received earlier this year is being handed over today to the President of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance Executive Committee in Warsaw.

<p>Will the Minister of State assure the House that there is no proposal for the Community to extend to the Soviet <i>bloc</i> even easier credit terms than those which exist at present?

<p>I am in some difficulty, because it is impossible, while negotiations are still taking place, to answer detailed questions on the position of the Community in these negotiations.

<p>I certainly agree to the extent that I hope it will not become a subject of dispute between the two sides of the House that we should trade with COMECON countries. This would be a totally new attitude for the Opposition

<p>The hon.

<p>Is the Foreign Secretary aware that there is concern in the inshore fishing industry because too much attention is being paid to the Icelandic situation and the position of third countries? We are equally concerned with the piratical practices of some EEC countries in fishing, and this


emphasises the need for exclusive limits for our own fishermen. Is the EEC taking a more sympathetic view in terms of the negotiations for an exclusive limit of at least 50 miles for our fishermen?</p>

<p>I am aware of the anxiety felt among coastal fishermen. The reason why more attention has been paid to Iceland and third countries is that these agreements had to be negotiated by 1st December and the end of the year, respectively. There is no doubt about the critical importance to our country of coastal fishing belts. On the question whether an agreement is likely, some work has been done in the Commission. It has not proceeded very far, because of acute differences of opinion among Community nations about the size of coastal belts. However, we have not changed our negotiating position in the slightest degree since my statement of our definitive position on 4th May.</p>

<p>The fishing community will be grateful for those assurances that safeguarding the position of our inshore fishermen is "critically important". Is the Foreign Secretary aware that there is mounting anxiety about both timing and enforcement? Can he give any date for the end of the negotiations for 50-mile limits, and can he say what preparations have been made to police these limits'?</p>

<p>I cannot give a definite date. On the question of enforcement, I can confirm that an enormous amount of work has been done on the question how to police and enforce whatever quota arrangements exist in coastal belts. No set of arrangements that exist on paper are worth the paper they are written on unless there is some policing.</p>

<p>I accept that the issue of limits&#x2014;whether they be 12, 50 or 200 miles&#x2014;is a most complex matter, but does the Foreign Secretary agree about the despondency felt in the fishing industry, particularly on Humberside') If the EEC negotiations with Iceland break down will we, as a nation, be able to conduct bilateral talks with Iceland?</p>

<p>Every time we have a question on fisheries we go through this farcical process, in which I am asked whether I am aware of the feelings on

Humberside. I am as familiar as anyone else with those feelings. As for what will happen if the negotiations with Iceland fall down, I shall not answer hypothetical questions. I have good hopes that an agreement will be reached, although I have no intention of speculating about its content.</p>

<p>The immediate problem facing the Devon and Cornwall fishermen over mackerel concerns the Soviet trawlers.

<p>Is it not a mistake to suggest that there is a conflict of interest between deep-sea fishermen and inshore fishermen?

<p>I hope that I did not give the impression&#x2014;I had no intention of giving it&#x2014;that there is a conflict of interest between the two sections of the industry.

<p>Order. Before we enter upon matters of privilege I have an important statement to make to the House.<br/>
Later on today we shall be considering the Lords amendments to the Rent (Agriculture) Bill. If previous experience is any guide there will be some close votes. At the same time, as the Leader of the House explained yesterday, there will be a mass lobby in progress.<br/>
I must make it clear to the House that the responsibility lies on Members themselves, if they are not actually in the Chamber, to make themselves available in the Division Lobbies if and when a Division takes place. That is their responsibility and not mine or anyone else's. I am sure that all concerned will do all they can to provide easy access to the Chamber, but in the last resort it is a Member's duty to be here.<br/>
I do not in any way discount the vital importance of a Member's duty to his constituents, but in my view his duty to this House comes first. That is why his constituents sent him here.<br/>
I wish to inform the House, therefore, that in no circumstances whatsover will I entertain a request today that a Division be held again on the grounds that a Member or Members could not reach the Chamber in time. If Members cannot be here within the allotted time&#x2014;and I intend to allow the full time, as extended by my predecessor, before I order the doors to be locked&#x2014;their votes will not be counted.</p>

<p>The question of privilege which I wish to submit to you, Mr. Speaker, has much in common with that raised by the hon. Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham) yesterday. You may therefore find it convenient to consider the two cases together.<br/>
I refer to a Press handout widely reported in today's newspapers and released yesterday by the Socialist Democratic Alliance which describes itself as
<q>Labour's moderate grass-roots organisation".</q>
In Chapter 10 of "Erskine May" there is included among the breaches of privilege and contempts listed on page 153:
<q>Reflections on the motives of a Member or a group of Members".</q>
The document issued yesterday must qualify time and again under that description. The handout is entitled "Labour's Fifth Column". It describes itself as "A documented study". Its first three pages are not strictly relevant to my case in that they deal with such extra-parliamentary bodies as the National Executive Committee and the trade union leadership.<br/>
I turn straight to page 4 where under the heading "Parliamentary Labour Party" one reads&#x2014;and I shall quote in full since I am advised that you can take account only of what is actually read out in the House, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;as follows:
<q>It is sad for democrats in the Labour Party to have to face the fact that many of the political sympathies displayed by members of the NEC and top trade union leaders are also reflected amongst Labour Members of Parliament.</q>
<q>We do not argue, as did George Orwell over 30 years ago, that there are 'underground Communists' in Parliament. We do however argue that there are Labour Members of Parliament whose views and actions would lead a reasonable man to believe that they have sympathies with the varying shades of totalitarian communism.</q>
<q>Indeed, Sir Harold Wilson was more specific. He argued, in an interview in <i>The Times</i> (2 Aug., 1976) that the Tribune Group of Labour M.Ps was very different today than it was in Nye Bevan's time. Incredibly and significantly he went on to allege that 'different forms of what are called Neo-Trotskyites, and Marcusism, and Maoism, IS (International Socialists) and all the rest.. some of those are represented in the House'.</q>


<q>This is a very serious allegation by a former Leader of our Party. We in the SDA do not know who the Maoist, IS, or Neo-Trotskyite MPs may be. Nevertheless, we feel that Sir Harold should tell us.</q>
<q>For our part the SDA intends to be more judicious and precise. We believe that Labour MPs should draw a clear distinction between democratic socialism, as we have known it in Britain, and ideas and organisations of the marxist totalitarian left.</q>
THEY SHOULD, IN OUR VIEW, NOT WRITE FOR, NOR CALL FOR FINANCIAL. ASSISTANCE FOR, NOR SPEAK AT THE RALLIES OF, THE COMMUNIST <i>MORNING STAR;</i> NOR SHOULD THEY WRITE FOR OR SUPPORT THE COMMUNIST PUBLICATION LABOUR MONTHLY; NOR SHOULD THEY ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH COMMUNIST FRONT ORGANISATIONS LIKE THE WORLD PEACE CONGRESS; NOR SHOULD THEY ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH TROTSKYITE AND NEO-TROTSKYITE ORGANISATIONS SUCH AS THE INSTITUTE FOR WORKERS' CONTROL.<br/>
The following Labour M.Ps, all of them intelligent enough to understand how their actions may be interpreted, have nevertheless chosen"&#x2014;</p>

<q>CONCLUSION: We believe that all these developments mentioned above, within the NEC, amongst trade union leaders, and in the PLP, provide evidence of a devastating shift of allegiance from democracy towards totalitarian leftism within a major wing of our party. Jim Callaghan, as Leader, should insist that fraternisation between the NEC and Communist Parties, both at home and abroad, should stop. He should condemn the party to party contacts mentioned above. He should demand of the 33 MPs mentioned that they cease to write or lend aid and comfort to Communist or Trotskyite organisations and newspapers. He should instruct the members of his Cabinet named above to do likewise. He should insist that Mr. Jones retract his appalling words in Moscow.</q>
The document speaks for itself, Mr. Speaker. I await your ruling.</p>

Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham) and that in consequence it might be convenient to consider the two cases together. I cannot do that.<br/>
Questions of privilege are of such formal importance to the House that no occupant of the Chair ought to depart from the acknowledged practice. Therefore, I shall rule upon the hon. Gentleman's complaint tomorrow.</p>

<p>I must now rule on the question of privilege raised yesterday by the hon. Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham). I have given his complaint the most careful consideration in the light of rulings by my predecessors in cases of this kind. In referring to the rulings of

my predecessors, I am choosing my words with care.<br/>
I am aware that Committees&#x2014;and, in particular, the Select Committee of Parliamentary Privilege of 1967&#x2013;68&#x2014;have from time to time suggested that other rules might be applied in deciding such matters. These reports have never, however, been fully debated, still less agreed to, by the House. The House has never, therefore, changed its rules, and the only guidance on which it is proper for me to rely is that of the practice of my predecessors.<br/>
I must make it clear that my ruling will be confined to the question whether the complaint of the hon. Member for Paddington shall be given precedence over the Orders of the Day. I am in no way passing judgment on whether the complaint constitutes a breach of privilege or contempt. Others will decide that.<br/>
I have come to the conclusion that this is a matter on which the House should have the opportunity to express an opinion. I am therefore prepared to give precedence over the Orders of the Day to a motion concerning the complaint.<br/>
Before any such motion is moved, may I remind the House of our time-honoured convention that when a complaint against a Member is considered he should first be given the opportunity to be heard in his place and then withdraw. If the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) is present and rises, he will catch my eye. If, however, he is willing to submit himself to the judgment of the House without making any statement, I must ask him to withdraw now.</p>

<q>That the matter of the complaint be referred to the Committee of Privileges.</q>

<p>The Lord President is extremely sensitive this afternoon. I thought that the hon.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Before the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) proceeds too far down any road which he is going to travel, I should like to ask you to make one point clear for the record. I am grateful for your ruling. However, are you able to confirm that that which you have suggested should have precedence for referral to the Committee of Privileges is the matter submitted to you in so far as it may be a breach of privilege or a contempt of the House?<br/>
I ask this so that you may be able to put on record that any question of defamation or personal damages regarding individual Members named is a matter on which the Committee of Privileges will not be asked to pronounce, but on which individual Members may, if they choose, seek redress in the courts.</p>

<p>Any action that right hon. or hon. Members may take in the courts is, of course, their concern.<br/>
My predecessors have often used the expression "There is a prima facie case of a breach of privilege and, therefore, it should have precedence." I have used the expression that it ought to have precedence. I feel in no way inhibited from saying that there is a prima facie

case and that the matter should be given precedence.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. I think that this is terribly important, because no Member would wish to be guilty of any kind of contempt of the House or discourtesy to yourself. What I am asking is whether you can make absolutely clear that the terms of reference of the Committee of Privileges relate to matters referred to it in so far as they may be breaches of privilege or contempts of the House, and would not deal with an issue of personal defamation or damages that Members might seek.</p>

<p>All that I can do is to say that this question has precedence, and the Committee of Privileges has very wide powers and will no doubt want to go into the question in some depth. But I cannot decide what the Committee of Privileges will do.</p>

<p>In no sense do I wish to suggest that the Committee will come to one decision or another, Mr. Speaker. I merely comment on the decision of the Leader of the House to refer this matter by moving this motion. I think that it is questionable when moved by one who himself in past days has questioned similar motions. In this case, although I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that you are entirely right in the ruling that you have just given, it suggests that it may be that the rules are a little out of date, and perhaps if the Leader of the House had been on the mark over the time that he has occupied that high office he would have moved to change those rules a little. It seems to me that what my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) has said is no more than fair comment and in many respects may well be entirely justified.</p>

<p>Order. Perhaps I may intervene, by courtesy of the House, for one moment. I hope that the House will


bear in mind that there is a long programme of business before us. [<i>Interruption.</i>] The House will know whether it wishes to go on to debate this matter. It will know that it is up to me to draw the attention of the House to the condition in which we find ourselves.</p>

<p>I intend to be brief, Mr. Speaker. However, I believe that these points should be put. I must, first, reply to the hon. Member for Nottingham, West (Mr. English). It is the present Leader of the House who has the greatest reputation of any Leader of the House for challenging privilege cases. It is the fact that he of all people should have been prepared to move this motion that brought me to my feet.<br/>
However, to return to my argument, I quote from <i>Hansard.</i> My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South is alleged to have written:
<q>The aim of these people is to turn Britain into the equivalent of a totalitarian East European State."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 16th November 1976; Vol. 919, c. 1128.]</q>
Well, it is. There is nothing wrong in that they should have it as their view. Are they ashamed of it now? Are they retracting from it? Why are they so sensitive about it? If they have spent the last few years proclaiming up and down&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. There is no reason why we should not behave with common sense over this question. The question before the House is the motion of the Leader of the House, that this matter be sent to the Committee of Privileges. Naturally, the Committee itself will be debating these issues.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1343.4" hansard_membership_id="11415" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30568" speakername="Mr. Ridley" colnum="1343" time="">
<p>I am merely seeking to argue, Mr. Speaker, that the Leader of the House should not have moved this motion. I am adducing reasons why I think he was far too sensitive in his desire to shut up my hon. Friend the

Member for Aberdeen, South and to put this matter under the carpet by sending it upstairs. After all, as I say, it is fair comment.<br/>
I was surprised that the Leader of the House should seek to argue that we should not discuss the merits of this matter. But if the House is to claim as one of its privileges that no hon. Member or other person may pass aspersions upon the political intentions of some hon. Members, the very essence and substance of political debate itself is impossible.<br/>
To hear the right hon. Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay) on a point of order trying to suggest that this matter, delicate though it is to the Labour Party, should not be discussed, that it is hurtful and wounding that it should ever be discussed at all that the fact that I should seek to raise it makes him feel that I should be shut up seems to show just that very intolerant attitude towards free speech which is at the very heart of the nature of East European States.<br/>

<p>Order. What the House is deciding is whether it supports the recommendation that I made. The question is not the merits of the case that is to go to the Committee of Privileges if the House so decides. We are not going to get into a state of untidiness on this question. The issue before the House is quite clear. I have stated that in my judgment precedence should be given. Following long tradition, the Leader of the House has moved that the matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges. We do not have the main debate before the Committee of Privileges has considered the matter.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Am I right in saying that it is normal on these motions to be able to debate whether it


is right that the House should refer a matter? For the House to decide whether it is right to refer the matter one must, with respect, as I ask you to rule, Mr. Speaker, be able to debate whether this is a matter worthy to be referred.<br/>
I think that on previous occasions over the last few years I have heard the Leader of the House himself argue on many occasions when a similar motion has been moved by other Leaders of the House that the matter should not go to the Committee of Privileges because it did not justify being sent to the Committee. Surely, on that basis what my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) is saying on the merits must be relevant.</p>

<p>On the same point of order, Mr. Speaker. Is it not the case that on these questions in the past we have often had full debates on the merits of the matter, and after full debates on the merits it has happened that the motion to commit the matter to the Committee of Privileges has been withdrawn because the feeling in the House on the merits was that it should not go upstairs?

<p>I do not know about that. Perhaps I may just say that I want to observe the rules of the House and in no way to restrict speech, but what I hope we shall understand is that the hon. and learned Member for Runcorn (Mr. Carlisle) was quite right in the point of order that he submitted to me. The question is whether the matter shall go to the Committee. All that I am hoping is that we shall avoid the untidiness of just going

over and renewing charges that are to go to the Committee of Privileges, and that hon. Members will, in general, address themselves to that issue.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. For our guidance could you inform the House how it is possible to debate whether the motion should be accepted and the matter go to the Committee of Privileges without our going into the background of the case and deciding whether, in the view of the House, it is important that it go to the Committee? You have asked for restraint, Mr. Speaker, and I understand that perfectly well, but I feel that it is very difficult&#x2014;I am certain that the Leader of the House, from his previous experience when in Opposition, will agree&#x2014;to debate these matters without taking into account the background of the case as a whole.</p>

<p>I have no desire, Mr. Speaker, to judge the merits of the case. Nor have I the slightest quarrel with your ruling&#x2014;far from it&#x2014;which, I am sure, is entirely right in accordance with the precedents. I merely make the point that the option before us, your having ruled, is whether the House should accept the motion, and that is something which


we must consider because the nature of a breach of privilege is quite rightly laid down in our precedents, but the actual fact of this incident, in my opinion, does not merit that it be referred to the Committee at all.<br/>
I am seeking to show that it was just fair political comment, and, although I am sure that, technically, it comes within the scope of our rules, I think it a mistake for the Leader of the House to suggest that it should go to the Committee of Privileges. It seems to me that it is a matter of general public comment. There have been a good many comments in speeches and in articles over many years referring to the fact that there are a large number of Left-wing elements in the Government party.<br/>
I think that I can claim as evidence for that statement the fact that the right hon. Member for Newham, North-East (Mr. Prentice) and the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (Mr. Sandelson), as well as other hon. Members, have had trouble as to their continuing candidature for the Labour Party. I am sure that it is in no sense a breach of privilege to suggest that there are persons in the country who are seeking to replace them with other politicians&#x2014;other candidates&#x2014;of other political views.<br/>
As I see it, all that my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South did was to suggest that there are in the Labour Party people of political views or colours totally different from the right or left of the Labour Party. That is well known to be the case.<br/>
What I find so extraordinary is that the hon. Member for Paddington should feel so sensitive about it. Surely, he is proud of his extreme Left-wing tendencies&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] He proclaims them in this Chamber in speech after speech. Other hon. Members&#x2014;I cannot claim to know entirely who are in this glorious list of 30&#x2014;have been proclaiming those very views day after day in debate after debate in this place. I do not understand why they should now say that it is a grievous insult and that they are thoroughly affronted when my hon. Friend says&#x2014;in tamer language than they have often used themselves&#x2014;what they know to be true. I had thought that they were proud of it.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) has stated as a fact that hon. Members named in the list given by his hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) have expressed certain points of view. That is what he has just said. I think that many of my hon. Friends would deny that very strongly, and, in these circumstances, as I understood it, it was to be the business of the Committee of Privileges to investigate this aspect of the problem.<br/>
I should be most grateful for your guidance, Mr. Speaker. Could you help us by explaining whether it is in order for hon. Members to make statements in the House imputing to other hon. Members here points of view which are to be the subject matter of consideration by the Committee of Privileges before the Committee has had an opportunity to discuss those matters?<br/>
If you rule, Mr. Speaker, that it is in order for hon. Members to impute points of view to others in the House, would it be in order for an hon. Member on this side to seek by means of analogy to question the points of view of hon. Members on the Conservative Benches and to make suggestions that those hon. Members have affiliations with other organisations&#x2014;I am not making suggestions; I am asking you to rule&#x2014;with the Fascists and the National Front?</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. Are we not in danger of falling into the error of thinking that the House has decided to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges when it has not so decided? This debate is about whether it should so decide. We cannot, I submit, assume that it will so decide and therefore argue that we must not ventilate the matters which are relevant to the question whether it should go to the Committee of Privileges. To endeavour to restrict debate on the motion, which you have ruled should have precedence over the Orders of the Day, would be to deny the House the opportunity of forming a considered view on whether the Committee of Privileges should be put to these pains.</p>

<p>Order. Second, the hon. Member for Tiverton (Mr. Maxwell-Hyslop) is right in suggesting that it is in order for hon. Members to make out a case showing why the matter should not go to the Committee of Privileges, perhaps because they do not think that it is worth it, or to argue that it should go to the Committee of Privileges. On this the House must trust me to keep as careful a line as I can. But there is no firm line in a debate of this sort.</p>

<p>To bring my remarks to a conclusion&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS "No".]&#x2014;I would like to respond to the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens).

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. [HON. MEMBERS: "Speak up."] Rather than tell me to speak up, hon. Members should shut up. I want to ask you, Mr. Speaker, for your ruling in relation to a matter that arose in my submission to you yesterday. You will recall that I explained that, although the names had been included in the document, the Press&#x2014;so far as I can establish, on the advice of their legal advisers&#x2014;refrained from publishing the names that had been included. If there are certain things which may be libellous if said outside the House, I would ask whether you feel that the protection of parliamentary privilege within the House should enable an hon. Member deliberately to make available names so that it then becomes permissible for the Press,

on the grounds of reporting, to perpetuate a libel against individual Members of this House? I raise the point now, in the middle of the sincere exposition by the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley), because I suggest that there is at least one Conservative Member waiting to interrupt his hon. Friend with a list of names which he wishes to state so that the laws of libel outside the House should be overcome. I invite you to rule whether you think that an abuse, or a proper use, of parliamentary privilege.</p>

<p>The ruling which I gave today was on the basis of what the hon. Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham) read out yesterday. I have to say that it is an undoubted right and ancient privilege in this place for hon. Members to speak in a way in which they would not be free to speak outside this House. If in the course of the debate hon. Members feel that the rest of the speech to which the hon. Member for Paddington referred is relevant to their argument, I cannot rule it out of order. If it is relevant to the argument that they are advancing, it must be heard. The hon. Member for Paddington yesterday read part of the speech and I ruled on it accordingly.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I hope that all that you have said will be accepted by every hon. Member in the House, and always will be. The difference is between the use of a reference to a speech made by an hon. Member outside this House by the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) and what the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is now doing. He said that he presumed, because my hon. Friend the Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens) had risen on a point of order to defend his hon. Friends, that he was one of the people on the list. I submit, Mr. Speaker, that that is the beginning of the regression from the gutter down to the sewer which is invited by permitting hon. Members to use their reference to speeches as the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is now doing. Would you please rule on the question of an hon. Member making a presumption about another hon. Member


on the basis of that hon. Member's attempt to defend his hon. Friends from what he considers to be a calumnious attack.</p>

<p>Surely both these lists have been published and, therefore, if hon. Gentlemen opposite consider that they have been maligned they have a proper redress, if that is what they seek, in the courts?

<p>Order. I said earlier that I deprecate any imputations, but I must say to the House that once we embark on this sort of debate, which is raised by privilege, the two sides of the argument must be allowed to be expressed and, further, that hon. and right hon. Members, as long as they are not breaking the rules of the House, take responsibility for their own statements here. I do my best to guard against any charge against an hon.

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. May I ask for your guidance in this matter'? You have said that you have to protect the House against abuse.

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. The imputation being made against some hon. Members, whose names we do not know, and some whose names we do know, is of various kinds of treachery&#x2014;treachery as hon. Members of this House, treachery as Members of the party to which they belong or treachery to their constituents to whom they have submitted themselves as members

of a particular party. I put it to you, Mr. Speaker, that discussions in this House which include attacks on hon. Members who are unable, in the context of points of order, to reply are abusing the privileges of the House.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Speaker. The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury said that he presumed that I was one of the people named in the list. The hon. Gentleman then went on to state that he had not read the list. Does that not mean that the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury has come before the House without any knowledge of the list, or the speech, and is prepared to get up in this House and impute motives, and points of view of other hon. Members, when he has no right, on the basis of the statement he has made, to say anything? Is it not in order that you should rule that the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury is not entitled to impute motives to other Members or, if he does, is this not a case of McCarthyism, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mrs. Miller) made reference?</p>

<p>I thought that I had made it clear that imputations are deprecated. I am sure that the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury, if it is felt that he has made an imputation, will act accordingly. We cannot avoid a debate in which both sides will be heard in the argument whether the matter should go to the Committee of Privileges.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. What is arising now has a considerable bearing on the rights of a number of hon. Members. I raised with you earlier&#x2014;you were kind enough to say that you would give a ruling tomorrow&#x2014;the question of what individual Members should do in terms of their legal rights outside the House while the matter is with the Committee of Privileges, if it goes there.<br/>
But another question now arises which concerns your duty to protect hon. Members. Were legal redress to be sought against individuals concerned with the statement issued yesterday, how far would proceedings in this House today, in which names were given, which would then be a matter for the courts, diminish the rights of hon. Members outside the House? I am sure that you will see the


point that I am making. Leaving aside for a moment what it is all about, I would merely put it to hon. Members opposite that there is a real problem here. Every hon. Member has a right to go to the courts outside. What is done here must not prejudice what happens in the courts, and this clearly has some relevance to what is happening at the moment.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Further to your ruling in response to the request of my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanark (Mrs. Hart), may I confirm that if any hon. Member reads names which were on the document which was read to you yesterday by my hon. Friend the Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham), the effect of reading it in this House would be that any redress for anyone who may be on the list would not be available in the courts?

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. May I draw your attention to two aspects of this problem which do not seem to be receiving quite the attention they should from the Chair&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."]&#x2014;if I may say so with respect? First, you have clearly ruled that this is a prima facie breach of privilege&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."]&#x2014;and that it should be sent to the Select Committee for that examination. The hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) seems to be calling in question your decision in that respect.<br/>
Second, it seems to be verging on an abuse of the House when, simply by quoting names at random which are supposed to be on these two lists, certain Opposition Members are doing as much damage as they can by sweeping as wide as they can with a dirty brush, throwing doubts on hon. Members, such as my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, North (Mrs. Miller), who we on this side all know could not be more loyal to this country.</p>

It surely cannot be contended that it is unimportant to hon.

When a similar point of order was raised just before the House debated whether matters concerning Mr. Stonehouse should be referred to the Committee, my recollection is that your predecessor, Mr. Speaker Lloyd, replied that with no amount of notice could he from the Chair give a ruling on whether what went on in the House would preclude an action&#x2014;in that case a criminal action&#x2014;outside.

I do not intervene to take part in the debate but, if you will permit me, Mr. Speaker, to make a personal statement. I have the honour to have been selected by the House as a member of the Select Committee of Privileges. I believe that I am the only hon.

<p>The whole House will unite in one thing and that is in sympathy with yourself, Mr. Speaker. You find yourself in an incredibly difficult situation.<br/>
I recognise that when accusations of this kind are made it is almost certain that strong feelings will be aroused. You earlier called attention to the unhappy condition in which we find ourselves. The condition has been getting steadily unhappier since then, but I may be able to help the House by saying that my right hon. Friends and, I hope, my hon. Friends on the Opposition Benches will wish to support the motion and to send the matter to the Committee of Privileges. [Holy. MEMBERS: "No."] I am sure that my hon. Friends will accept that, if serious accusations are made by Members of Parliament against their colleagues, or if those accusations which were not intended to be too wounding are taken as being wounding, there should be some inquiry into them in a less passionate atmosphere than the one we have engendered this afternoon.<br/>
Perhaps the Committee has a useful contribution to make. My hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) was absolutely entitled to make the speech he made this afternoon and I am grateful to you, Mr. Speaker, for having supported his right. There can be no question of Governments moving motions like this and expecting them to go through on the nod, whether or not objections to the motion are regarded by the Government as reasonable.<br/>
In view of one remark made by an hon. Member opposite, I should say that my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) made the speech which has been complained of outside this House and it was published. I saw it in at least two newspapers. I think the complaint that these names have somehow been withheld is not justified.</p>

<p>I would rather not name the newspapers, but I will communicate

with the hon. Gentleman afterwards. My recollection is that at least two newspapers carried the names.<br/>
I do not wish to raise the temperature of the House, but I think that my hon. Friends have some justification for expressing surprise that the accusation of Left-wing loyalties should be considered by so many people to be so wounding. That is what is stirring up feeling on this side of the House.<br/>
We accept the motion and we shall support it. It would be in the interests of the House to dispose of it as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>What the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) has said could be of great help to the House. I certainly think that no hon. Members can complain because a motion of this character has been moved by the Leader of the House in accordance with the normal system of the House.<br/>
When the Speaker has ruled in the past as he has today, in most cases the Leader of the House has moved the motion which I moved earlier. I certainly cannot complain that hon. Members have sought to continue the debate, because I have on numerous occasions in the past sought to continue such debates.<br/>
I was a member of the 1968 Committee of Privileges which investigated the question of privileges and made recommendations for alterations in our procedure. But these did not commend themselves to the House and they have never been carried into practice. Therefore, we are operating under the old system.<br/>
I have followed exactly the precedents&#x2014;as you have, Mr. Speaker&#x2014; and hon. Members are entitled to engage in debate. I have no power or authority to ask them to curtail the debate, but I think that those who have listened to the discussion so far&#x2014;and I am not reflecting on any hon. Member&#x2014;would conclude that we could get into a discussion which would not be beneficial to the House.<br/>
We are not ruling out a debate when the Committee of Privileges has reported to the House. The difference is that when we have that debate the facts will have been examined and conclusions reached by the Committee. The House will then be able to pass judgment without necessarily accepting what the Committee has


said. I think that is the best way to proceed.<br/>
If any hon. Members decide to continue the debate, it is not for me to be censorious, because I have done the same myself on previous occasions. Maybe on those occasions, in my belief, the cases were much more dubious, but that is a matter on which the Committee will come to its own view.<br/>
In response to what the right hon. Member for Yeovil has said, and in the circumstances described by my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanark (Mrs. Hart)&#x2014;that action may be taken outside and nothing which happens in the House impedes action outside&#x2014;it would be better for us to come to a fairly early decision. We should avoid a major debate which would not be easy to stop and which would not be conducive to the best settlement of this matter.</p>

<p>Many of us listened to what my right hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) said about voting for this motion, but can the Leader of the House answer two simple questions') Will the Committee sit in private or in public in view of procedure adopted in other Select Committees which might be relevant? Who, if anybody, will be invited to give evidence?</p>

<p>The Committee will act in the same way as all previous Committees of Privilege in such matters. There are ample precedents. They normally sit in private and the decision as to who is to appear and how is a matter for the Committee. It will take precedent into account.<br/>
I can see that some of my hon. Friends may legitimately feel that statements have been made by hon Members opposite which they have had no opportunity to rebut. I can understand their feelings, but we shall have a later opportunity to discuss this.<br/>
I have no power to end this debate, but I very much hope that we can make it brief. I hope that my hon. Friends will take into account the fact that the proposal for the submission of this matter to the Committee was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Paddington (Mr. Latham). It was on the basis of that submission that I proposed the motion

to the House. We have some very important other business and I hope that this debate will be brief.</p>

<p>I am reluctant to intervene following what the Leader of the House said about the desirability of curtailing the debate, but there are certain points which must be viewed in a broader context before they are put to the Committee.<br/>
When this Chamber was destroyed by enemy action, there was considerable discussion about the form in which it should be rebuilt. There were many who favoured the introduction of a circular or semi-circular Chamber such as those in many Parliaments overseas. It was Sir Winston Churchill's view that we should stick to the rigid division which exists today. I cannot help thinking that although at the time I entirely subscribed to his view, perhaps he was mistaken. The spectrum of our views is much more circular than it is divided between one side of the House and the other.<br/>
Here we come to the nub of the problem which is to be put to the Committee. My hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) alleged that there were hon. Members and perhaps right hon. Members on the other side of the House who, in a sense, defrauded their constituents by standing on the Labour manifesto while taking views which are far to the left of it. It could also be said that there are Members on the Government Front Bench who have taken views to the right of the manifesto. I do not wish to go into that topic, but there is clearly a problem whether some hon. Members represented themselves as belonging to an association&#x2014;the Labour movement&#x2014;and yet were pursuing views which were not in keeping with the officially pronounced views of that movement. We must consider whether that is an appropriate position for hon. Members or whether it amounts to a defrauding of the electorate.<br/>
The second issue is more difficult and delicate. My hon. Friends and I represented that there were hon. Members on the other side who were acting for alien interests. I understand that in law one is supposed to have willed the things that one would normally be intending to will. Some hon. Members on the other side, in


the general view of many of us, have objectively put forward views which are contrary to the consensus of what opinion in the House would regard as the national interest. I do not say that they did it in the service of an enemy or in any way as a deliberate act of treason. Nevertheless, there may be a case for believing that the views to which they subscribed were in themselves injurious to the interests of the country. We have not had a situation such as this since the Jacobite situation at the end of the seventeenth century when hon. Members of the House, as it was then constituted, believed that the higher interest of the country was contrary to what could be called the interest of the State.<br/>
These questions should be put to the Committee of Privileges and I shall support the motion so that the problem can be referred to that Committee and investigated in some detail</p>

<p>I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House, but I find it regrettable that the matter should have been brought before the House at all. I have never liked the idea of matters going to the Committee of Privileges. But I recognise&#x2014;and I have argued this in the House&#x2014;that if one is a poor man about whom untrue statements are made, and if one cannot take on the Press barons or those with large incomes, one has no alternative but to ask for the protection of the House. There are, therefore, certain circumstances in which it is right to refer matters to the Committee of Privileges.<br/>
I am not particularly happy with this case because politicians live with smears and slanders throughout their political lives. I was a member of the Communist Party and was expelled. Some people have never understood that I was expelled and some people have never understood any of my writings. That is their fault, not mine. But it becomes a serious matter if my constituents, or those of any other hon. Member are told that because we have Left-wing political views we are masquerading in the Labour Party and are Communists, Trotskyites, members of the International Socialists or some other organisation. That is then

serious, as it would be if we on this side of the House said that hon. Members with whom we totally disagree on many issues were members of the National Front or a similiar organisation. That would be wrong and intolerable, and that is the point that worries me this afternoon.<br/>
I am worried at the frivolity with which the matter has been treated in the House today. I appeal to hon. Members and warn them that if we go on like this we shall undermine our democratic rights and principles and perhaps undermine the House of Commons. I believe in the House of Commons. I believe in parliamentary democracy. We should be careful of anything which undermines that parliamentary democracy. There are people outside the House who do not believe in it and who are only too keen at all times to chip away at the basic rights that have been built up by the people of our country.<br/>
I was worried about what the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) said. It is legitimate for hon. Members to say that a point of view that I or other of my hon. Friends put forward could, in their opinion, lead to the type of system that exists in Eastern Europe. In the same way, I could say that the arguments of the right hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Sir K. Joseph)&#x2014;with whom I have been having a discussion in a well-known national newspaper&#x2014;could lead to the type of military dictatorship that exists in Chile.</p>

I do not believe, for example, that Opposition hon. Members who are passionately concerned with the defence of the capitalist system believe that they should turn to a dictatorship to reach that end.

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for his courtesy in giving way. I accept that he genuinely believes in parliamentary democracy, but does he not realise that the people who do not believe in parliamentary democracy, to whom he referred, are working within the

<p>The intervention by the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Lawson) was typical of the sort of statement we are hearing at the present time. It is wrong for hon. Members to impute that other hon. Members are actively working for alien interests, outside forces or countries outside the United Kingdom.<br/>
We can all bare our breasts about our patriotism. I get very angry when I sometimes hear hon. Members talking about the patriotism of Labour Members. We all have war records, or most of us have. We have all played our part, as did our fathers before us. But that is irrelevant. What is important is that we should distinguish between the argument that we believe that a certain point of view can lead to something and actually saying that hon. Members were acting on behalf of alien forces and belonged to political organisations other than the one to which they said they belonged. That was what worried me about the speech of the hon. Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury. He did not draw that distinction. This afternoon I have seen too many other hon. Members failing to draw the distinction, and that is very worrying for the future of the country.<br/>
The House must begin to cool it, and I mean cool it. We must have rational, reasonable and serious discussion on the issues. It will sometimes be heated, but that is where we must be. If we step over that line, we shall do considerable harm to the country's future, to democratic rights and principles and to the democratic system.<br/>
I am not very happy about the motion. I am sorry that the matter ever came up in this way, but now that it is here we

had better send it to the Select Committee. Therefore, I ask hon. Members to support the motion, but I again appeal to them to cool it, because the position is getting too dangerous and too serious for the future of our country.</p>

<p>I would agree with part of what the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Helier) has said if we were talking about alien interests, but the words used were "alien creed". That brings us very close to the relevant matter. I am against the matter's being sent to a Committee, because I ask myself "What will the Committee do with it?"<br/>
It has been suggested that certain hon. Members on the Government Benches are Marxists or crypto-Communists and that they aim at a totalitarian society. I understand from "Erskine May" that my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) is fully entitled to plead justification and to seek to prove his allegations. Suppose he does. Is the Committee then to take a deep breath and sit for months and months, hearing arguments and perhaps evidence&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is a name, anyway.<br/>
Is the Committee then to report to us on the state of mind of 10 or perhaps 30 hon. Members opposite, saying "Yes. So-and-so aims at a totalitarian society, but such-and-such a Member does not", or "In the case of X we do not find it proved beyond reasonable doubt that he aimed at a totalitarian society, but in the case of another chap we do", or "It is half true of So-and-so"? The situation is ridiculous.<br/>
The question of privilege may reasonably be raised, and a matter go to the Committee, when the suggestion is that somebody is working for an outside interest, that he has accepted money improperly or behaved in a corrupt manner. But when the argument is about political opinions and objectives, how can one use privilege, and what sensible use can one make of the Committee of Privileges?<br/>
The hon. Member for Walton said that we must cool it, and have rational discussion. That is an excellent aim. People


have been saying that for a few hundred years. It usually has some effect, for about five minutes. It is like passing a crash on the road. Everybody drives more carefully for anything up to two miles after that, and then one gets back to the old competitive operation. The hon. Gentleman who says "Cool it" may tomorrow, on some other subject, be quite warm in his denunciations and defences. If I may say so with great respect to him, he is not the most icy-cold Member in debate. He feels his politics passionately sometimes, and why not? So do we all. We would not be in this House if we did not care rather strongly about our politics. Therefore, we cannot cool it. What we must do is to keep within some undefined limit&#x2014;one which I think we all sense or understand, even if we cannot define it. One goes to a certain point.<br/>
We all know that there is an element of truth in what is said, in as much as certain hon. Members on the Government Benches are a great deal further to the Left than are others. But the question for the Committee would be how much truth and how much exaggeration there was in what my hon. Friend said. When the report came back, we would all have our individual views about the rights and wrongs and value of the report.<br/>
It is not for me to advise the House. This is just a debate where we put forward our own views. But I do not think that I shall be helped at all by a Select Committee. This is politics. We are all politicians, and have our own judgments. If someone overstates a case, he weakens it. If someone understates a case, he lends strength to his argument. Can we not leave the matter there?<br/>
I have no doubt that prima facie this was a case of breach of privilege. There have been many such cases in the past where Mr. Speaker has rightly ruled that prima facie there was a breach of privilege, and the House, after debate, has not disagreed but has said "Yes, but we do not want to do any more about it because there is no point". That is exactly what I feel about this matter.<br/>
After all, some very harsh things are said. "Communist" is perhaps the epithet that tends to be thrown in the direction of the Labour Benches and "Fascist" the epithet that comes in this direction. It does not mean very much.<br/>
I have been called a Fascist many times, but I am always borne up by the thought that the present Chancellor of the Exchequer has been called a black Fascist pig. I do not know why "black". It should perhaps have been "Red Fascist Pig".</p>

<p>I shall not give way. I think that my hon. Friend has had his ration of interventions.<br/>
Until one has been called a Fascist pig, one has not thrown a six and cannot start in the game of politics as it is played nowadays. I say with respect to hon. Members on the Government Benches who have shown themselves rather sensitive that until they have been called crypto-Communists and have been said to be aiming at a totalitarian State they have not been blooded in the political battle. It is no different from hon. Members on this side of the House being called black Fascist pigs.</p>

<p>There is a very serious issue here, perhaps different from the issue that hon. Members opposite think it to be, but nevertheless serious. Lying behind the accusation by my hon. Friend the Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat), which has prompted this debate, is an issue which should not be brushed aside in the frivolous manner that my hon. and learned Friend appears to be adopting.</p>

<p>I must say to my hon. Friend that I am not being frivolous. I am saying that this is part of the rough and tumble of politics. The hon. Member for Walton is part of that rough and tumble. We sometimes use picturesque phrases, and somewhat heated expressions. The question whether that sort of expression should go to the Committee of Privileges is a serious matter because privilege is serious, but otherwise it is not serious. There has been no imputation against the moral character of the Labour Members&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] Some Labour Members are becoming excited and using words that never appeared in the document.<br/>
The charge of political duplicity is made in the House every week. It is part of the ordinary interchange of politics. Ministers are accused of deceiving the public. They are often accused of deceiving the House. That is all part of the debate that takes place. The point to which I return is that nothing is gained by sending this sort of dispute to a Committee. What will it do with it? Will it say "We do not think that there was deception"? This is a matter of political argument and discussion, and we can resolve it on the Floor of the House.<br/>
My view is that we should not disagree with Mr. Speaker if we said that we did not want the matter to go any further. The right hon. Gentleman the Leader of the House is at home with this dichotomy of approach. I can remember the famous occasion when this type of debate lasted for six hours and ended in a Division at 10 o'clock. On that occasion the right hon. Gentleman voted with me and others for the defeat of the motion that had been moved by the then Leader of the House. He did not do that because he disagreed with Mr. Speaker's ruling or because he did not think there was a technical breach of privilege; he did it because he saw no point in sending the question of privilege to the Committee of Privileges. That was a matter of political judgment and that is the judgment to which I invite the House to come, otherwise we shall discredit ourselves a great deal more than we shall repair our credit.</p>

<p>First, I address myself briefly to the contribution of the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton), as I believe it contained the crucial issue on which the decision of the House must centre. I completely dissent from his main point, which he put extremely mildly, but his contributions often go to the root of the matter.<br/>
Having announced that he would call upon his right hon. and hon. Friends to support the motion, the right hon. Gentleman said that he was rather surprised that there should be a number of Labour Members so concerned about being accused of being Left-wing. That is not the issue. I do not know of any Member who would be concerned about being called Right-wing or Left-wing. I know many right hon. and hon. Members who would be quite proud to be called Right-

wing. The hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Bell) is a good example. I have many right hon. and hon. Friends who would be proud to be called Left-wing. That is not the issue, and the right hon. Gentleman, with his experience in politics, knows that it is not. He should not put that on record.<br/>
The issue is far more serious, and it is because of its seriousness that I support the motion. As the House knows, I am not keen on referring motions of this sort to the Committee of Privileges. I have proved that, as has the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield, in past debates and in past votes.<br/>
What is the seriousness of the issue? It is the precise nature of the charges that have been made quite deliberately. They are made more serious because, <i>mutatis mutandis,</i> they are a repetition of a charge made about a week ago by the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mr. Gilmour), who speaks on defence matters from the Opposition Front Bench. They repeat the charge that the right hon. Gentleman made to a Conservative gathering in the North-West. Although the term "Young Conservative" might be applied to the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat), it would he false flattery to apply it to the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham.<br/>
These charges must be taken seriously. I am convinced that behind them is a deliberate campaign to denounce and smear the Labour Party. It is wholly unjustified and based on a tissue of false accusations in terms of the statement that forms the basis of the motion. The charges are wholly false accusations. Therefore, it is necessary to take the proper parliamentary action. It is right that such action should be taken on behalf of the House and the Members who are part of the collective unit. Everything else is for individuals.<br/>
Why is that? Like the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield, I have always taken an extremely narrow view of privilege. I repeated that view the other day when we were setting up the Committee to inquire into corruption. That is still my view. Privilege is not for the protection of Members; it is to safeguard Members in doing their work for their constituents. Only when that work is threatened or likely to be threatened are


we right to invoke the Committee of Privileges.</p>

<p>Did the hon. Gentleman advocate that the Poulson Committee should sit in public? If he did, does he agree that the same situation should apply and that now that a Labour Member has gone to the extent of raising this subject as a matter of privilege in the House and has sought to bring it before the Committee of Privileges, presumably with the object of clearing names, the best thing to do is to proceed in public?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1371.1" hansard_membership_id="9245" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18323" speakername="Mr. Mendelson" colnum="1371" time="">
<p>There is no question of clearing anybody's name. The hon. Gentleman must not put words into my mouth. I could deal with the question whether such a Committee should be in public or in private, but that has nothing to do with the matter with which I am now dealing.<br/>
I take an extremely narrow view of the purposes of the Committee of Privileges. Only where a Member's work for his constituents is affected or likely to be affected is it right to refer any matter to the Committee. That is the effect in this case, because one of the false accusations made in the speech of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South is that certain Members are alleged not to have told their constituents that they are aiming to turn the country into an Eastern satellite. They are alleged not to have told their electors that they intend to work for the purposes of another political party or political grouping. Those are the most serious accusations against the professional ability of a Member to do his work for his constituents. It is on those decisive grounds that we must refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges. It is the narrowest of cases, but the most relevant. It brings to the ground the objections of the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield. There is a clear-cut case for the involvement of the Committee of Privileges.<br/>
I turn to the wider implications. In the hurly-burly of politics, and in the fight, I believe that any political party with great traditions is ill-advised to follow those who might advise it, shortsightedly, to base its political fortunes upon smear campaigns upon the unemployed, upon those who receive some

social security payments for their families, and upon false accusations about the records of its opponents. It may appear attractive at first sight, but the people of this country are too experienced, too honourable, and too far-sighted to listen to those who base their campaign on such considerations. I beg all those who might be misled into that campaign to desist from it.</p>

<p>We have heard a speech of great skill delivered with great compassion by the hon. Member for Penistonc (Mr. Mendelson). It was a speech with most of which most Opposition Members would agree. But it is the very skill and ability with which the hon. Gentleman delivered his speech that leads some of us to wonder whether we have not stumbled into far more serious a situation than even he is willing to admit. He has suggested that it would be wrong for any Member of this House to say that there is a possibility that those who are working against the interests of this country might be elected to this House. That seems to me to be a dangerous denial of our ability to defend this nation.<br/>
Let me phrase carefully what I say, so as not to make any accusations or impugn any motives of any Member of this House. If we were to follow the hon. Gentleman's advice literally, should such a penetration by an agent of an alien power ever take place, no Member of this House could seek to expose it without himself or herself risking an attack for indulging in a smear campaign. It worries me that the freedom of speech on both sides of the House should be thus limited by fear of such accusations or of those agents whom we all know to be operating throughout the world&#x2014;agents of what is now called disinformation and disintegration.<br/>
We have all heard stories spread by members of various intelligence services that Members of Parliament, trade union leaders, industrialists, and others, are in close contact with the agents of alien Powers. Perhaps, sometimes, those stories are true; perhaps, sometimes, they are false and are spread simply to arouse distrust among ourselves, to bring our institutions into disrepute and, perhaps, to create the very scenes that we saw in Parliament this afternoon.<br/>
At first, listening to this debate, I had no intention of taking part and, as the debate continued, I began to think that the right lion. Gentleman the Leader of the House and my right hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) were wrong in seeking to send what at first seemed to be a trivial matter to the Committee of Privileges. But I now think that that is the right course. We must place at least part of the responsibility on that Committee to ensure that we can truly speak freely in this House; so that should this House be penetrated by enemies of our people and our democracy we should he able to point the finger of accusation at them. After all, we allow great liberty at present. It is no crime in this country, thank God, to seek to overturn the existing regime. It is no crime to believe in a totally different form of political system. It is no crime to be a revolutionary. It is only when a foreign Power conies into the matter that there can be any possible question of crime&#x2014;or any democratic objection.<br/>
Let us hope that if we send this matter to the Committee of Privileges its members will have taken note of this debate and will take it upon themselves to consider the activities of those who seek to use parliamentary procedures and parliamentary institutions to destroy parliamentary democracy itself.</p>

<p>Until about half an hour ago I, too, had no intention of intervening, and my intervention now will be brief. If this matter is forced to a Division, I shall vote against its going to the Committee of Privileges&#x2014;for the very reasons outlined by the hon. Member for Penistone (Mr. Mendelson) at the end of his speech. What he virtually said was that the public do not take much notice of what is written in the Press. I am inclined to agree with him. In the past seven or eight months I have had a fair amount of muck thrown at me by various sections of the Press. I have in my hand a copy of one newspaper carrying my photograph, under which is the grave description "The Assassin". That was a caption in a newspaper in May.<br/>
I do not think that anybody takes much notice of what is said in the Press. However, I believe that the visual media have a greater effect on shaping public

opinion than the kind of rubbish written by some of the silly journalists who sit in the Press Gallery in this House and get paid for it.<br/>
I do not understand what some Labour Members are getting so worked up about. People have said these things about Labour Members of Parliament for 20 or 30 years. It has been said at one time or another that Labour Members are all Communists, that there are Reds under the bed, and all the rest of it. Nobody takes any notice of it, and, despite what has been said in the Press, Labour Governments have still been elected. If the proceedings of the House had been broadcast this afternoon in the period from 4 pm. to 4.30 p.m. the public would have had a revelation about their Members of Parliament far more serious than anything that has appeared in the Press.<br/>
I appeal to Labour Members not to get worked up about these matters, because they have been happening for years. Surely it is a waste of time for right hon. and hon. Members to sit in a Committee listening to a lot of silly nonsense. What will happen is that the hon. Member against whom charges are laid will drag the thing out; he will try to make a political meat pie out of it; he will seek to support what lie has said; and then somebody will go before the Committee and seek to put up a defence. We shall have a repetition of what happened this afternoon, with people reading out names in an effort to get them on the record.<br/>
We shall only fan the fire if we send this matter to the Committee of Privileges. My advice is that we should pour some water on the situation and damp it all down, so that the fire cannot be kept alight. I shall vote against the motion.</p>

<p>I have great sympathy with a good deal of the argument advanced by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) and the hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Bell). I believe that one way of ensuring temperate debate in this House and of seeking to deal with matters coolly is to act as mature people and judge issues as they arise, on some occasions by treating them with good humour, on some occasions killing them by jeers, and on


other occasions by deciding the most appropriate way to deal with the situation.<br/>
This issue, however, is different, and it is different partly for the reason indicated by my hon. Friend the Member for Penistone (Mr. Mendelson). Here is a deliberate representation of hon. Members of this House not as Communists, as Trotskyites, as revolutionaries, as anarchists, or as anything else, but as men, and possibly even women, who have contrived and conspired to secure election to this place by defrauding their constituents&#x2014;that was the word used&#x2014;in order that they can have an influence on the conduct of affairs in this country for the benefit of an alien creed, an alien regime, an alien ideology and an alien purpose.<br/>
That is something entirely different, and it threatens the whole basis of the democratic standard on which every single candidate, of whatever party, presents himself for election. I appeal to Conservative Members to understand the implications of this threat. It is the fact that the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Sproat) did not say that some of my hon. Friends were Communists, or any of the other terms that he used, or that they were definitely affiliates or members of political parties for which they did not stand at election. No, he did not say that. He called them crypto-Communists, and used the most grotesque weapon that can be used against a parliamentary democracy&#x2014;guilt by association.<br/>
It was not without purpose that John Kennedy&#x2014;no great Socialist or defender of crypto-Communists, but someone who learned his politics in the age of McCarthy in America, in many respects&#x2014;said that rumour is a greater poison to democracy than the lie.<br/>
The reason that we must submit this matter to the Committee of Privileges for the coolest and most thorough and most rigorous examination by Members from among our body is that they can, item by item, examine the rumour, the guilt by association, the implication, the imputation, and so on.<br/>
None of us in this House can answer the question "When did you stop beating

your wife? "None of us can prove that he was not influenced, in the very conduct of his business and the very pursuit of his ideologies, by those with whom he had to associate.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. This is, with respect, a serious point of order.

The hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield asked what the Committee will do. In answer to the hon. and learned Gentleman, I suggest that the Committee can provide us with another protection against the distortion of democracy that was seen in the Moscow show trials, in the activities of the Nazis, and in the activities of Joe McCarthy.

<p>I beg to move.
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the Firearms Act 1968 with respect to the duration of firearm certificates and shotgun certificates.</q>
I am seeking to introduce this Bill to get the Government out of a serious difficulty in which they find themselves. Lord Harris wrote to me on 15th October saying:
<q>The Home Secretary has at present no power to do this under the 1968 Act".</q>
If the Government will accept the Bill and facilitate its passage, they can meet the principal objection of most holders of firearm and shotgun certificates to the substantial increase in fees which they now face.<br/>
I remind the House that in 1969 a firearm and shotgun certificate cost 5s. It was raised to &#x00A3;2 10s. at the end of 1969. It was increased to &#x00A3;3 10s. in 1971, and in 1975 it was increased to &#x00A3;7. In October the Government laid an order increasing the fee for the granting of a firearm certificate to &#x00A3;12&#x2014;an increase of 151 per cent, in the last four years&#x2014;for the renewal of a firearm certificate from &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;50 to &#x00A3;10, and all other firearm and shotgun fees in proportion.<br/>
I am in no way asking for any form of subsidy. The fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Cirencester and Tewkesbury (Mr. Ridley) has signed his name on the back of my Bill in support of it must convince the House that there is no question of the sporting community asking that their firearm and shotgun certificates should be subsidised in any way.<br/>
We accept the argument that the scheme should be self-financing. I am glad that the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department is in her place. I think that the hon. Lady and the House are aware that the Long Room Committee, on which all users of shotguns and firearms are represented, under the chairmanship of my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr), has expressed grave doubts about the way that police costs are made up. We have seen references in <i>Hansard</i> to police

costs of over &#x00A3;50 for checking the renewal of one firearm certificate in the Greater London area. Many of the owners and users of firearms question the extent of the checking which seems to be necessary and the amount of police time which is now spent on it. Many perfectly honourable and honest citizens, when they come to renew their certificates for sound sporting reasons, find themselves subject to a whole host of questions and inquiries which they feel are a waste of police time.<br/>
It has been estimated that these new fees put a burden of over &#x00A3;1 million on the sporting community. I fear that the expenses now&#x2014;&#x00A3;12 for a firearm certificate&#x2014;will put a premium on having an unlicensed weapon in one's possession. I am sure the House does not want that.<br/>
If we double the fee, the only way to reduce the cost to the individual is to double the time for which the certificate is issued. That is what this simple Bill would do. It seeks to extend the period from three years to six years for the granting of these certificates. A driving licence is far more lethal than a shotgun certificate. For the total sum of &#x00A3;5, one has a licence to slaughter on the roads until one is senile or dies.<br/>
We are asking the Government to follow up the sympathy they have expressed about this problem by facilitating the passage of the Bill or by giving an undertaking that, when the Criminal Justice Amendment Bill comes before this House in the next Session, they will at least agree to extend the period for shotgun and firearm certificates.</p>

<p>The House is very well aware that my right hon. and hon. Friends are thoroughly dissatisfied with the manner in which the Bill has been handled in every conceivable way. In due course, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall wish to move a manuscript amendment to the motion. However, at the outset I wish to say that we are extremely unhappy about the way in which we are being treated on the Bill. We do not think that we have been given adequate notice or that proper parliamentary time intervals and procedures have in any way been adhered to.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) has just mentioned the difficulties over the list of amendments selected. However, you will notice yourself, Mr. Speaker, that all the Government amendments on the Amendment Paper are starred, indicating the fact, of which we are all aware, that until last night no one in the House knew that this business was to come before the House today.<br/>
We have felt all along that the guillotine originally proposed on Report and carried by the House was completely

mencement of the Bill this afternoon. If we had not had the prolonged debate on the privilege motion, which has put back the time of commencement of these proceedings, those of us who are interested in these amendments would have had only about half an hour to absorb your selection. With respect, that is not fair to Members of Parliament on both sides. There are no fewer than 137 different amendments in 49 groupings. It is not adequate for hon. Members to have only about half a hour to consider how these debates should take place.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has a legitimate complaint, and I apologise to him and to the House. I was in some difficulty. I do not want to go into it in too great detail. I appreciate that the notices should have been posted earlier. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman for the inconvenience he has suffered.</p>

<p>unjustified. There had been no delay of any kind in Committee. The Opposition had been fulfilling their role with reasonableness and fair play, and there was proper progress. The thanks we got for that was the knife brought down by the Leader of the House. There was no parliamentary case whatever for a guillotine at that stage.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1388.3" colnum="1388" time="">
<p>The Bill is inimical to agriculture. The only possible gain from the Bill is Socialism. That is something that we are against, and it is quite wrong to guillotine that. Under that guillotine there was no discussion whatsoever of Clause 30. The manuscript amendment relates to advancing Clause 30 to an earlier stage in the Bill. Since the guillotine on Report we have seen another guillotine introduced in a way that can only be described as thoroughly hostile to another place, because the knives were brought down before another place could even conclude its consideration of the amendments, so that we had no idea what decisions their Lordships would come to. Only last night did we hear that their amendments would be taken today.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1388.4" colnum="1388" time="">
<p>When my hon. Friends sought to obtain details of the Government's


reaction to their Lordships' amendments, they were unable to find that out until five minutes to one o'clock this morning. The list of amendments that their Lordships passed comprised nearly 100 Government amendments and 32 other amendments&#x2014;more than three times as many Government amendments. When one hears something of the things said by the Government Front Bench about the way their Lordships have handled the Bill, it is right to draw to the attention of this House the fact that in Committee in another place there were 40 Government amendments and only 18 Opposition amendments, and that on Report in another place there were no fewer than 60 further Government amendments and only 21 Opposition amendments.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1389.0" colnum="1389" time="">
<p>In the event, however, there are five really significant and important changes that another place has introduced into the Bill. The first is an amendment to Clause 1 relating to the definition of agriculture and, in particular, livestock. The second is on the forestry side. The third concerns the responsibility of local authorities to rehouse those who previously lived in tied cottages; that is what is known as the "best endeavours" clause. The fourth concerns the qualifying period; that is, the length of time a worker must have been involved in agriculture and in a particular farm before he can qualify for the privileges afforded to certain persons under the Bill. The fifth concerns the circumstances surrounding the dismissal of a man for misconduct.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1389.1" colnum="1389" time="">
<p>What was the Government's attitude to their Lordships' decisions? We did not know yesterday. We did not know until today. All the amendments that the Government have tabled for us to consider this afternoon are starred. I think that that is a parliamentary disgrace. It bears no relation to any kind of reasonable procedure that anyone has ever known. In view of the fact that we treated the Bill, although we were against it, in the way in which we did, it absolutely offends us that we should receive the treatment that we are receiving.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the Leader of the House is remotely interested in what we understand as parliamentary government. He wants simply to railroad Socialism through this machine. In view of all the

things he used to say when he sat below the Gangway, it is a fantastic disgrace that he has the presumption to bring this matter before the House today. I am sorry that he is not in his place. He ought to be in his place. We know that he has had another problem to deal with today, but to try to treat the House in this way is a complete disgrace.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1390.0" colnum="1390" time="">
<p>For example, the Government have an amendment of their own to Lords Amendment No. 86. The Government amendment appears to be helpful, but, as it was only in the small hours of this morning that we had notice of it, how in all fairness can we take the legal and proper advice from people who are skilled, informed and expert in these matters in order to know whether it is really helpful? That is one obvious example. Another example, about which my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) feels particularly strongly, is a Government amendment to Lords Amendment No. 77, which appears on the last page of the Amendment Paper. It is a very technical amendment. It deals with a point concerning the Rent Acts not entirely directed to agriculture, apparently. My hon. Friend would have liked much more than a few hours to study the significance of the amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1390.1" colnum="1390" time="">
<p>That brings us to Clause 30, the " best endeavours " clause. This was never reached on Report because of the knives. It will not be reached today if the motion is carried. It was not reached on Report and it will not be reached now. I thought that the House of Commons was all about airing grievances. What we are now involved in is an exercise which can be described as a hush-up, and my right hon. and hon. Friends and I resent it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1390.2" colnum="1390" time="">
<p>Therefore, Mr. Speaker, with your permission, I beg to move, as a manuscript amendment to the motion, in line 2, after 'Schedule 2', insert 'Clause 30'.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1390.3" colnum="1390" time="">
<p>There are two other manuscript amendments which are consequential. They are: in line 3, at the end, insert ' to 29 ': in line 4, at the beginning, delete first' to ' and insert 'Clauses 31 and'.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1390.4" colnum="1390" time="">
<p>The net effect of the amendment to the motion would be that after considering Clause 1 and Schedule 2 we would then consider Clause 30, which is not the only really important clause in the Bill but is certainly one of the important


clauses. It would be quite wrong if we went through this business today without giving time to consider that clause. Therefore, we move those amendments not because we think that they make a slight adjustment to something of which we approve but as an absolute protest at the way in which we have been treated.</p>

<p>I have not given permission yet, but I am about to do so. I am about to accept the manuscript amendment. The right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) will understand that I accept the manuscript amendment, in line 2, after ' Schedule 2 ', insert ' Clause 30', with which we may discuss the other manuscript amendments, but he will appreciate that at this stage he moves only one amendment.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) has taken the opportunity of this discussion on a procedural matter to attack the Bill as a Socialist measure. We plead guilty to that charge. This is a Bill that will bring social justice to the agricultural community. It will give farm workers and their families a security of tenure and a protection against eviction which is long overdue. Therefore, we are in no doubt that this is a very basic and radical reform, and one of which the present Government are proud.<br/>
Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman took the opportunity to attack my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House. I rebut&#x2014;[HON. MEMBER: "Where is he? "] My right hon. Friend has had a great many demands put on his time, coming very shortly after an illness and caused to a large extent by the confrontation that has taken place between the Conservative-dominated second Chamber and the House of Commons.

<p>I shall come to that point very soon. I do not want to take up valuable time. We have a full six hours

on this measure, and I for one should like to see the time used constructively. Hon. Members must be aware that hours and hours have been spent in debating this measure in Committee and in the other place, and now, as a result of their Lordships' amendments, we are to spend another six hours. I acknowledge that it is an important measure, but it has been debated at great length.<br/>
I come now to the point raised by the right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire. I think he can reasonably argue that he and his hon. Friends have been subjected to an element of inconvenience as a result of the Government deciding to bring forward these proceedings by one day. That is the complaint, as I understand it&#x2014;that the right hon. Gentleman expected this debate to take place tomorrow but it is taking place today. I am glad that he acknowledges that.<br/>
Let me make our position clear. We recognise that there is an element of genuine inconvenience here, but I think that all hon. Members have been aware that we are not in a position to predict precisely what will be the business in the Commons at present&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: " For how long? "] I think that that is a fair question. For how long depends, among other things, on the attitude of the leadership of the Conservative Opposition and the other place. For how long shall we carry on this Session? I do not know the answer to that.</p>

<p>That is a monstrous thing to say. The Government sent a whole host of major Bills to another place very late in the Session, creating a log-jam the like of which has never been known before, and to say that the responsibility for that lies with another place is quite wrong. It is the responsibility of the Leader of the House and the Government's business managers for arranging their legislative programme in this way. The Treasury Bench must take its responsibility.</p>

<p>I shall proceed to demonstrate, when we come to debate it, that the first amendment is a wrecking amendment. The right hon. Gentleman knows that. That is what this is about. It is about an attempt by their Lordships to frustrate the Government's intentions here. They have sought to wreck this measure, and the Government, quite


rightly, are using their majority and the votes which they can command in the House of Commons to redress the damage. That is what this is about.<br/>
I come now to the right hon. Gentleman's proposal, because we genuinely want to have a debate. There is no question of that. The Government want to use the six hours to debate the issues of substance and importance&#x2014;debating them, I may add, in some cases for the third and fourth time, since that is what it will amount to. These points which have been raised by the other place are not new great points of substance. They are wrecking amendments in some cases, and in some instances they are straight decisions going against decisions reached in the Standing Committee.<br/>
I have to tell the right hon. Gentleman&#x2014;this is genuinely meant to be helpful to him&#x2014;that we are not prepared to accept his manuscript amendment but we are prepared to facilitate his objectives. We are anxious to move on, and I noted his particular reference to Clause 30. We are anxious to conduct our affairs in a way that will enable us to move on quickly and avoid any undue delay on some of the matters arising earlier, certain of which, I agree, are important.<br/>
Therefore, I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will be able to respond to our offer and accept that we proceed in the order which we propose, on the understanding that we shall seek to facilitate a debate on the particular matter on which he wishes to spend some time.</p>

<p>Would the Parliamentary Secretary be so kind as to give his views on Lords Amendment No. 77, which introduces New Schedule 1A? Does he not agree that this constitutes a fundamental redrafting of Clause 2? Does he not recognise that it comprises some 75 lines of vital redefinition of sections of the Rent Act 1968? Does he acknowledge that this first became available to the House at noon yesterday, and does he think that this is a satisfactory way of legislating?</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary cannot be allowed to get away with what he said. In effect, he was complaining about the existence of the other place. He should

recall that the other place exists in its present form because of the opposition to reform which came from the present Leader of the House. Therefore, to complain now about the other place carries no weight whatever. If the hon. Gentleman had read the newspapers and used his ears in recent weeks, he would have realised that many of their Lordships think that it is high time that reform took place. If it has not, the only reason is that the present Government are concerned with irrelevant and unimportant matters. Moreover, the Parliamentary Secretary cannot use the illness of the Leader of the House as an excuse for the right hon. Gentleman not being here now to deal with complaints against his performance today.<br/>
The short notice given to the House of the debate on this measure is a disgrace. Once again, two things are poved: first, the incompetence of the Leader of the House in the way he organises his business, and, second, the fact that the Leader of the House believes that the Commons, let alone the other place, should be used as a rubber stamp to push Government legislation through without argument and as quickly as possible.<br/>
The only happy thought left with us about the way the Government have dealt with business today is the knowledge that in the not too distant future the Leader of the House will once again be in Opposition. We shall then recall his performance as Leader of the House, and we shall realise that the great flights of oratory in which he will then indulge will be no more than a mass of meaningless rhetoric, without integrity and implying no more than a desire on the right hon. Gentleman's part to impress us with his words.<br/>
What has happened today is a disgrace, and I hope that the country, and the farming industry in particular, will take note of it.</p>

<p>I felt angry enough before the Minister replied, and I feel more angry now. If he really wanted to meet our grievances &#x2014;I assure him that they are sincere and honest&#x2014;he could have done so easily by accepting our amendment to the procedure motion. We could then have debated Clause 30, which both Ministers


know touches matters of profound importance on which we must have a discussion. I have never been one to raise points of order in the House, and I hope that I am regarded as a fair and modest man, but I am extremely angry at the way the House has been treated. The Government's behaviour is thoroughly shabby.<br/>
The Minister referred to the debates in Committee. We tried to be constructive throughout. I certainly did, and sometimes I agreed with the Government. We had excellent relations in the Standing Committee. There was no filibustering of any kind, and there was no guillotine. But when we reached Report in this House there was no meaningful discussion whatever and no opportunity to discuss the many amendments still to be dealt with.<br/>
Those of us who took an interest in the Bill in Committee and who spent quite a lot of time trying to study these matters were hoping to play a useful part in the debate now to follow. But we must have proper warning in order to prepare our speeches on these complicated amendments, and we have had no warning of any kind. How is it possible to make a sensible contribution if the Government announce their business in this way at the last minute? It is no wonder that people outside Parliament are utterly disillusioned with the way we handle our affairs. It is a mockery. If the Minister genuinely wanted to help us, he could have accepted our amendment. I regard his rejection of it as outrageous, and I wish to record my disgust and protest at the way we have been treated.</p>

<p>I rejoice that on this occasion I have an opportunity to speak, because I was not able to do so at an earlier stage. I put it to my hon. Friends on the Front Bench that, as I see it, the right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) put a very fair point. Sweeping all the verbiage away from it, he said that there were four or five main issues which he wished to debate. That is fair enough, but there is

no point in the right hon. Member complaining of injustice or waxing eloquent, because most of these things have been discussed before.<br/>
If all that the amendment seeks is to have a debate on one of these five matters before the others I hope that will be possible. I do not think my hon. Friends would have any objection. There can be no objection, and I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to consider the matter in that light.</p>

<p>We are all glad that my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis) is in a position to participate in these proceedings. I am sure that even Opposition Members would want to pay tribute to the contribution that my hon. Friend made in Standing Committee as a Government Whip. Like him, I regret the rather provocative manner in which the right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) introduced his remarks.<br/>
We want to make progress. It is not our purpose to frustrate the debate on these issues. I tried to emphasise that at the outset. As a gesture of our genuine attempt to have a constructive use of these further six hours on the Floor of the House, we are prepared to accept the right hon. Gentleman's amendment.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Minister for at last acceding to my right hon. Friend's request. It is a pity he did not do so earlier. There is one point that I should like to take up with him&#x2014;that is, his remark that the House has suffered inconvenience because the Bill was brought on much earlier than hon. Members anticipated.<br/>
It goes far beyond inconvenience. It is a profound discourtesy and contempt of the House and of hon. Members in this House. I shall give as an example how I was placed in respect of this matter. During the latter part of yesterday evening I happened to be in my constituency. I returned home at about 11.30 last night to find a massage from my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) telling me that the Bill was coming on today. Since we were both concerned with handling the Bill for the Opposition in Committee, we were very much concerned about this.<br/>
I repaired at once to the House and arrived here at about a quarter to midnight to discuss with my hon. Friend what these amendments were. May I say in passing that I did not receive the customary courtesy either from the Minister or from any member of his Department advising me that the Bill was coming forward earlier than had been intended. Nor was any communication delivered about what would be the Government's attitude to the Lords amendments. That is normally a courtesy which is extended between the two Front Benches, but no message was received by me or left anywhere for me.<br/>
The consequence was that I came to the House, and through the kind offices of the Public Bill Office I was able to&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall come to that matter, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I shall also make another application to you about the nature of the starred amendments. If I may develop my argument, you will see that at the end I shall make a request to you, with your leave.<br/>
Through the courtesy of the Public Bill Office, I was given a list of the proposed amendments and the provisional scheduling of them. There were 129 amendments. As hon. Members know, if one is to do this matter properly one has to compare the Lords amendments with the text of the Bill to see how relevant they are. One must then refer back to the Lords <i>Hansard</i> to see exactly what the debate was and what the amendments are all about in order that we may form a judgment on whether to agree or disagree with the Lords amendments.<br/>
On the basis of only 10 minutes for each amendment, that is 21 hours' work. That is the burden which was imposed upon us last night. It is absolutely impossible&#x2014;</p>

<p>Order. Let us deal with one matter at a time. That is much simpler and clearer to the House. I should like to hear any argument why Clause 30 should not be placed in the position in which it would be if the amendment were carried.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1398.1" hansard_membership_id="4206" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/20268" speakername="Mr. Rossi" colnum="1398" time="">
<p>I shall enlarge upon the amount of time to consider these matters and you will notice, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that Clause 30 is dealt with by Lords Amendments Nos. 45, 46, 47, 48 and 49. These are two-thirds down the page. Would you like to make a calculation of 10 minutes per amendment in considering what is listed on the Amendment Paper before we reach the amendments to Clause 30? That is the point I have been putting to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if you heard what I was saying.<br/>
This is relevant to the order in which we take these matters and the amount of time that the Government have allowed to consider them. On the whole, we have not been given the time to consider these matters as we should. My right hon. and hon. Friends behind me did not sec what these amendments were until 2.55 this afternoon, when the list was put in the Lobby. That is not the way in which the House should be treated or the way in which hon. Members should be asked to consider important and serious matters. It is a contempt of the whole parliamentary system.<br/>
I appreciate that what I am saying puts the Chair in an extremely difficult position. But these are starred amendments. It is within the discretion of the Chair to decide whether or not they should be selected for debate. That is the normal procedure of the House. It is within your discretion, Mr. Deputy Speaker, to consider whether any starred amendments should be selected for debate. The list before us is a provisional selection by Mr. Speaker, and there is nothing binding upon you.<br/>
Therefore, in order to protect the House and hon. Members who have not had an opportunity to consider these matters, and on the pure arithmetic with respect to the minutes and hours involved


in considering these matters properly, I invite you, without prejudice to my right hon. Friend's amendment, to say that you do not select any of the starred amendments. It is the function of the Chair to protect the House and hon. Members so that they can do their work properly.</p>

<p>Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman. I have no power to vary the provisional list of selection made by Mr. Speaker. Therefore, the second point that the hon. Gentleman has raised does not arise. The first point is whether Clause 30 has to be placed in the position in which the right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) has suggested. Unless anyone has any objection, I will put that point to the House now.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. That being so, would not the right course be to recall Mr. Speaker so that he may hear this argument about whether the starred amendments should be selected? I am sure you will recognise that it is the whole truth that those of us who expected to be able to have a discussion as a group today about the debate tomorrow have come here with no chance of being able to read or to appreciate the amendments. It was after 3 o'clock today that this matter was first drawn to our attention.</p>

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. The hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) has made a proper protest and we understand the difficulties in which the House has been placed in recent days. I was surprised that he made an attack on a Minister&#x2014;whether my colleague or myself I do not know. The timing of a debate is not usually a matter for discussion between the Minister and the Shadow Minister. This was discussed through the usual channels. I apologise. I recognise the hon. Gentleman's frustration and the inconvenience he has suffered. It was very proper to make the protest that he did. However, we have taken about 40 minutes of the six hours allotted to an important Bill. I therefore suggest that we now proceed, since we have accepted the reasonable amendment of the right hon.<br/>

<p>This first group takes us straight to the heart of the matter. The scope of the definition of "agriculture" has already been debated at length. Lords Amendment No. 1 is important because it reveals the attitude of a majority of the Members of another place to this Bill: it is a wrecking amendment.<br/>
The National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers has campaigned for many years for the abolition of the agricultural tied cottage. In the course of my interest in these issues, which goes back a number of years, I have discussed them with farm workers throughout the


country. Some of them have been remarkably conscious that the Bill would have to be passed not only by this House but by the other place. They were aware, and more of them than ever are now aware, of the anachronistic composition of the second Chamber, which gives landed gentry the power to dominate its decisions. An overwhelming majority of the peers who voted for this wrecking amendment are hereditary peers&#x2014;perhaps not surprisingly, since they number over 800, as opposed to 295 life peers.</p>

<p>We could have a great debate about the various proportions of different parties who voted on this amend ment, but I am making one central point of which farm workers have been very conscious&#x2014;that there is a particular interest in this measure in the other place precisely because it is a basic advance and reform in the countryside&#x2014;</p>

<p>It has been said that to extend security of tenure to workers in sectors of agriculture involving livestock, and particularly to dairy stockmen, would damage the industry. The Government have argued that that is without foundation. There is no justification for speculating that the rehousing obligation in the Bill will not work and that livestock farmers will not be able to regain possession of their cottages if they need them for essential incoming workers. Nor have hon. Members or noble Lords been able to bring forward any convincing evidence to support that view. It is merely alarmism and has done nothing to further constructive debate on the Bill. By agreeing to these amendments the Lords have deliberately sought to deny the Bill's protection to the largest single group who should be eligible for it.<br/>
This means that they would have no protection. It is still not widely appreciated in the country at large, or perhaps by hon. Members&#x2014;it is certainly not

appreciated by urban electors&#x2014;that the farm worker and his family have no security whatever in their agricultural tied cottage; that if a farmer or a landlord takes a worker to court to get him out of the cottage, as the law stands the court has no alternative but to grant possession to the farmer. All that it can do is delay the process for a short time. It does not matter whether the farmer wants to leave the cottage standing empty, to sell it or to use it as a second home. That is irrelevant. If the amendment stands, this important section of the agricultural labour force will continue to have no legal protection in the occupation of their dwelling-houses.<br/>
A high proportion&#x2014;about 76 per cent.&#x2014;of stockmen are housed by their employers and their houses account for about a quarter of the total cottage stock occupied by whole-time workers. This is not a small peripheral group: these people are right at the centre. It is obvious that the Government had the particular and often pressing need for their rehousing very much in mind when tailoring the Bill.<br/>
My noble Friend Lord Peart said in another place that the amendments drove a coach and horses through the Bill. So they do, and so they were intended to. I do not see how anyone can refer to amendments which seek to remove such large numbers of people from the Bill as revision. They are wrecking amendments. If the Bill is left as the Lords suggests it will fail utterly to meet our objective.<br/>
Let me briefly rehearse some of the arguments yet again. The Government fully recognise and always have recognised that there are occasions when it is necessary to house the workers on or close to the farm. That is why there are provisions in the Bill for farmers to make applications to rehouse outgoing workers in a way that enables local housing authorities to take into account not only the agricultural need but the urgency of any particular case. We are presently discussing with both sides of industry how best to guide housing authorities and the advisory committees on the weight to be attached to the various elements of agricultural need. The industry is wholly behind us in this exercise and I am confident that sensible and workable criteria will be evolved.<br/>
As my noble Friend the Undersecretary of State for Scotland said on Second Reading in another place, I would expect that those sectors where the welfare of animals is directly involved would merit high priority ratings on grounds of agricultural need and urgency in the advice which local authorities will be receiving from agricultural dwelling-house advisory committees.<br/>
The amendment to exclude the use of land for grazing, meadow or pasture land would exclude both work on land used for the grazing and free running of livestock and land producing grass for subsequent drying or ensiling. It is not acceptable, for the same reasons and considerations as apply to the proposed exclusion of dairy farming and livestock keeping and breeding.<br/>
I have been at pains to express why I believe that it is right and proper for the Government to ask the House to reverse these amendments which strike at the heart of this basic reform. The reform has been campaigned for for many years by farm workers and their families. It is a reform for which the Government received a mandate at the last election. The Bill received a decisive Second Reading in this place. The only people who opposed the measure on Second Reading were either members of the Conservative Party or Ulster Unionists. The measure had a majority of 40 on Second Reading.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for raising that matter. I hope, if I answer it once, that will dispose of it for the rest of the evening. The Government gave a commitment at the last election to farm workers and their families not just in England and Wales but in Scotland as well. When the measure is implemented it will give security to farm workers and their families in Scotland. The Secretary of State for Scotland and his junior Minister have made clear that the Government accept this commitment to Scotland. It is usual for legislation affecting housing in Scotland to be included in a separate Bill. It is right and proper that decisions

on the precise nature of the Scottish legislation and its timing should be a matter for the Secretary of State for Scotland. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Labour Party does not intend to renege on the promise given by the Government to farm workers and their families in Scotland.</p>

<p>I should first like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for agreeing to the adjustment of the placing of Clause 30. I very much appreciate it. At the outset, I declare an interest which, perhaps in the spirit of what the Parliamentary Secretary said, might also be taken as an omnibus declaration.<br/>
The purpose of the amendment is to confine the effect of the Bill more narrowly and to exclude from it one sector of agriculture. Admittedly, that sector is as closely concerned with housing as is any other sector. That is the purpose of the amendment. It is not a wrecking amendment, as the Minister described it.<br/>
At the outset of his remarks the Minister showed incredible prejudice against another place. He talked about debates not being constructive, but has he read the debates in another place? If he does not consider them to be constructive, helpful and knowledgeable debates about agriculture, I do not know what he considers to be constructive debates. I do not think that he has gone into the matter. It is wrong for him to explain the position as he did. He was completely inaccurate, and indicated painfully clearly that he is motivated by sheer prejudice.<br/>
The purpose of the amendment is to leave out one sector of farming. I think I heard the Minister say that the sector


of agriculture affected by the amendment would cover about one-quarter of those engaged in farming. It is not a wrecking amendment, because the other three-quarters would remain.<br/>
Whether or not we agree with the intention of the Bill, the Opposition understand at least one of the Government's motivations&#x2014;that is, to try to deal with evictions that arise occasionally from time to time, and the consequential hardships. My hon. Friends have given no ground in their desire to avoid those hardships. We all want to avoid them, but not by creating a whole range of other hardships. The case that we have been making, and the case made by my noble Friends in another place, is that by doing it in this way other hardships will be created. The Bill singles out agriculture for treatment in this way, leaving 90 per cent, of tied accommodation untouched. It is not the principle of a tied house that the Government are going for here; it is just the agricultural element.<br/>
It is fair for the Government to say that some farm workers want the Bill and always have wanted it. But many do not want it&#x2014;perhaps most of them do not want it. The Bill will put them all in an extremely privileged position. They will enjoy more privileges than will workers in a great many other industries. We question the way in which the Parliamentary Secretary, in his enthusiasm, has sought to bring this about.<br/>
Those in the agricultural world are very interested in the Bill. That is natural. Because of the nature of the work they do, all farmers are worried that their houses may not continue to be occupied by men who work on the farm. Under the Bill there is no certainty when the fanner will get repossession of a house to enable him to offer it to another man who will work on the farm. That is a particularly acute matter for livestock farmers. That is the point of the amendment.<br/>
Livestock farmers have to look after their animals all round the clock. Poultry hen batteries, pig units and dairy herds all have to be looked after all round the clock, and the stockmen have to live on the job or very close to it. Stockmen understand their responsibilities and know that they have to live near the job. It is in their interests to do so, and they

do it gladly. Stockmen do an extremely good job for the industry.<br/>
When there is a change of stockman on the farm, there may be real difficulties. It is all right for a few days, or a few weeks. The farmer can look after the stock himself, if necessary all round the clock. If there is any long-term delay, however, complications may arise, which the Parliamentary Secretary has completely failed to recognise. Some farmers who get into these difficulties will say that the game is not worth the candle and that they cannot go on with it.<br/>
I know that the Parliamentary Secretary brushes all this aside as though we do not know, do not care and do not understand what the Bill says. He takes the attitude that he knows best. My right hon. and hon. Friends do not think that he does know best and we think that he has not thought through the Bill's implications. No one knows how it will work in practice. No one knows how the local authorities will respond to these so-called "best endeavours".<br/>
Therefore, we support their Lordships in proposing a more modest beginning for the Bill. If the Government are so passionate about putting through the Bill they will have their way, but we say that they should recognise that there are difficulties and uncertainties in it and that these exist in the most acute form for the livestock farmer.<br/>
Let the Government implement the Bill on a more modest basis, initially, exclude the livestock farms, and see how it works. If it proves to be anywhere near as successful as the Parliamentary Secretary expects&#x2014;though we do not&#x2014;he can bring forward amendments in a few months' time to include the livestock sector.<br/>
Surely common sense, experience and reason should lead the Government to accept the amendment and to try out the Bill on a more modest basis at first. I shall advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to support the amendment.</p>

<p>A lot of words such as " prejudice " and " privilege" are being flung about the House. I admit my prejudice on the side of farm workers, and I hope that hon. Members opposite will admit the prejudice of another place which is so apparent to everyone.<br/>
Let us examine the antecedents of another place, how many of its Members went to Eton and other public schools and how many are landowners, so that we may see how representative and unprejudiced they are.<br/>
We have been told that the Bill will make farm workers a privileged group. If so, that would be a pleasant change. They are important workers and they have always been a very under-privileged group. Do farm workers want the Bill? I have been a member of the farm workers' union for nearly 30 years and I have never attended a union meeting where there has been a call for the retention of the tied cottage system.</p>

<p>The position in Scotland was dealt with by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary.<br/>
We are told that another place is a revising Chamber, but the amendment not only wrecks the Bill but rips it apart. It comes from people who have never lacked security themselves but who are determined to deny it to farm workers.<br/>
We are told that the inclusion of this group in the Bill would have a damaging effect on the industry. I have been connected with the industry all my life, and I suggest to Opposition hon. Members that the archaic, feudal, out-of-date tied cottage system does the most damage to the industry and means that it has an ageing labour force. The Opposition ought to be as concerned about that as is everyone else who cares about agriculture.<br/>
The real reason behind the wish to exclude these workers is that they are the most difficult to attract into the industry because theirs is a seven-days-a-week job, with long hours and a tremendous responsibility for pedigree herds.<br/>
The argument about evictions has been used again and I repeat what has been said many times before. Evictions are merely the tip of the iceberg. It does not matter whether a farmer evicts a man, his wife and family. What matters is that the power to do it is there.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) said that he wants to avoid hardship. If that is so, he should

support the Bill. To argue that it is essential for stockmen and dairy men to live on the farm is to ignore completely the fact that there are such things as cars and telephones which make it easy for a stockman to reach the farm quickly. We do not live in the era of carrier pigeons; we are living in the twentieth century.<br/>
Let us examine the argument that the industry will be wrecked by the Bill. We were told that the industry would be wrecked when farm workers were given Saturday afternoons off and again when the Agricultural Wages Board was established. Yet the Opposition are now great supporters of the Board.<br/>
Whenever there has been any reform in our society, whether in agriculture or anywhere else, employers have always argued that industries would be wrecked. The real wreckers are those in another place who would have us support this amendment. I know that this House will throw it out.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady is a member of the farm workers' union in the North Riding. She has spoken about cars and telephones but has not mentioned a word about the welfare of stock. The union does not have many members in Wensley-dale and Swaledale, where it does not matter whether a worker has a car or a telephone; the real problem is how to get a worker to the farm in the winter. Will the hon. Lady say something about the welfare of animals?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman says that I know only about Yorkshire farm workers and speak for them. I remind him that I was national vice-president of the union for six years and have held national responsibilities, travelled extensively and met farm workers from all over the country.<br/>
The welfare of stock is obviously important, but it is not more important than the welfare of human beings. I sometimes wonder whether that view is shared by everybody. I remember sitting in a county court during the eviction case of a couple when the farmer said that he must have their house&#x2014;though it then stood empty for two and a half years after the eviction. The judge in that case said that, although it seemed a hard thing for him to say, land was more important than people. He was making


the point made by the hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Sir T. Kitson) that animals and land are more important than people. I believe that people are more important.<br/>
Wensleydale is in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, so he should know about it. I have had many connections with it and it is one of my favourite beauty areas. Nearly every farm there is a family concern, and that is why there are not many members of the union in that area. Consequently, the point raised by the hon. Gentleman in his intervention does not arise.</p>

<p>I support Lords Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 5, which are the crux of the Bill. It is sad that, however cogently arguments are put in this debate, the issue will be decided by the vast majority of hon. Members who have not heard any of the speeches.<br/>
It is difficult when one intervenes at this late stage in the passage of the Bill to put any new angles. Even if there were new angles which might interest the House, putting them would have no effect because of the weight of votes which will be going into the Government Lobby. I wish to raise a couple of points put to me not by the NFU but by a stock farmer and a dairy farmer in the Midlands. They have explained how difficult life will be for them if the amendments are rejected.<br/>
A farmer and his brother who farm on a small scale have told me that, with the aid of a building society Ioan and a county council grant, they have built farm cottages for their employees. If the amendment is rejected, farmers will not bother to do that any more. Although the number involved might not be large, farmers would be made to build cottages for their workers if the Bill were enacted in its present form.<br/>
The other new point relates to the difficulty of possession. If the Bill is enacted as it stands and a farmer finds difficulty in gaining possession of his stockman's house because the local authority cannot provide alternative accommodation, if his employee is incapable of looking after his stock any longer the farmer will think twice before employing again a stockman who does not have accommodation of his own. Some stockmen can travel to a farm every

day from a council house by motor cycle or by car and a farmer will therefore be reluctant to take on a stockman who is dependent on a stockman's house, because of the difficulty of regaining possession. A farmer might be loth, having gone through the difficult process of gaining possession, to let it again, particularly if he can employ a stockman who already has a council house. He would regard that as better than again employing a man who could be a positive disruptive influence on a farming enterprise living in the stockman's cottage but not working on the farm.</p>

<p>I am grateful for your advice, Mr. Deputy Speaker. My interest in this subject is declared in the register, but I shall be guided by your ruling. I understood that once an hon. Member had declared his interest during the passage of a Bill in the House, that was sufficient. I declared my interest both on Second Reading and on Report. It is a waste of time to declare it again, especially as the hon. Member for Derbyshire, North-East (Mr. Swain) was not there at the time.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) referred to the strange attitude of the Government in selecting agricultural tied cottages. That selection has puzzled us, but we have not had a satisfactory answer. Of a national pool of 165,000 tied cottages, only 65,000 are occupied by agricultural workers. The remaining 100,000 are owned by the National Coal Board, the British Waterways Board, the British Steel Corporation and the British Railways Board. It is strange that the Government should single out agricultural landlords. It must be some form of spiteful victimisation, because it can have nothing to do with the record of agricultural landlords. Their record bears comparison to that of all the others.<br/>
It is important for us to accept Lords Amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 5. The Government have been big-headed and have defied the advice of the NFU, the Milk Marketing Board, the British Pig Producers Association, the Country Landowners Association and&#x2014;if they ever read it&#x2014;the excellent independent report produced by Miss Gasson of Cambridge University. The advice given by those bodies reflected the attitude of those who know what the situation is. But their advice has been denied by the Government. They have been steered towards

their target of abolishing agricultural tied cottages by the extreme left wing of their party on whom they depend for remaining in Government.<br/>
Only 2 per cent. of dairy farms in Britain have council houses within walking or cycling distance. The remainder depend on stockmen who live in a tied cottage or on the farmer doing the work himself. Unless the amendments are accepted, grave difficulties will result.</p>

<p>I accept that correction. I misheard my hon. Friend. But the right hon. Gentleman must agree that it is a significant proportion.<br/>
Representing an agricultural constituency, I meet my farmers reasonably regularly. I believe that the views expressed by Conservative Members have been hysterical and&#x2014;to repeat the term used by my hon. Friend&#x2014;alarmist. I have discussed the issue with farmers in my area. I have not found that the problem is uppermost in their minds. That is not to say that they are not concerned about it, or that I do not understand their concern, but they are far more concerned about problems relating to the drought and the green pound.<br/>
When we have discussed the issue I have acknowledged that there are problems, but I have tried to put to them, as my party has tried to put to the nation, that the principle at stake is whether it is desirable that farm workers


should have their working conditions so inextricably tied up with their living conditions. The farmers to whom I have spoken have felt unhappy about this, but have pointed to the practical difficulties raised by hon. Members. However, Conservative Members must accept that a principle is involved and that sooner or later we must stand up and be counted on that principle. That is what we are doing with the Bill.<br/>
A stockman in my constituency came to my surgery and said " I've come to talk to you about the tied cottages Bill. I am not in favour of it. I earn a very good wage. I have free accommodation and a good boss, and I am happy." But then I asked him the question that has been put so often by my hon. Friend: "What happens to you, a hale and hearty worker now, if you fall ill? If you die, what happens to your family?" There was a long pause, as there inevitably is when such a question is put, and no answer could be given. We are trying to deal with that problem, trying to provide a basic security to such men and their families. That is the essence of the Bill.<br/>
At the same time, we are trying to remove from farm workers who face the problem of eviction the stigma associated with going to court. I speak as a lawyer. I do not know how many Conservative Members present have been before a court, or know what it is like to do so. Even if it is merely a matter of pleading guilty or facing a <i>fait accompli,</i> when the individual may have to do no more than to appear before a judge, there is a stigma.<br/>
It cannot be something of which any of us is proud that a significant number of people must appear before a court to obtain housing. We are attempting to remove an objectionable stigma which attaches to those unfortunate enough to be asked to leave their cottage. That is an honourable intention, which I would have hoped Conservative Members would welcome.<br/>
Hon. Members have pointed out the difficulties associated with the stockman and herdsman. I accept that there are difficulties, but let us face the brute fact that even under the present arrangements the farmer cannot get his stockman out of the cottage for a period of six months after he has first taken action.

The farmers are somehow coping with that. Conservative Members have not been honest about the matter. As farmers, they know that that happens and that colleagues of theirs who are farmers have survived the problem.<br/>
The Labour Party is committed to an honourable principle. I accept that in the farming community, including that in my own constituency, there are doubts and fears about the matter, but we have nailed our colours to the mast and said that it is not right that people's work should be so inextricably tied up with their housing. That is an honourable cause, and for that reason I support the Bill.</p>

<p>It is always a great pleasure to speak after the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Watkinson). He presented his case with sweet reasonableness, and there is no doubt that he could be, and perhaps is, a very successful lawyer. But what is important is not necessarily what the lawyers say. What they leave unsaid is even more important. I am concerned about the Government's proposals, and fully support the amendments made by another place. I congratulate it on its careful, positive and constructive consideration of this very important Bill.<br/>
I intervened from a sedentary position in the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary and he indicated that he would mention the industry. Regrettably, he left it and its future out in the cold. He did not mention agricultural production or the damage the Bill may well cause to the livestock industry.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman reads the report of my speech in <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow he will see that I paid particular attention to that point. I discussed the role of the agricultural dwelling-house advisory committees and made clear that the Government had built into the Bill a procedure whereby, if a farmer really needed his house for an incoming worker, the committee would advise that there was agricultural need. We have been over this ground time and again. The committee can even advise that there is not just need but urgency, and the local authority must then respond.</p>

<p>I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman. In my view he did not deal with the point adequately.<br/>
I need not remind the House that calving takes place during the year on livestock and dairy farms. A farmer may have in his tied accommodation a man who is no longer working for him, perhaps because of ill health or because he has taken another job, and night after night the farmer may be forced to spend long hours in helping cows to calve when he should be in bed, because cows do not always conveniently calve between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.</p>

<p>I do not say that it never happens, but calvings do not necessarily take place within a convenient working day. Great strain and pressure can be put upon livestock and dairy farmers at certain times during the year &#x2014;strain and pressure which would not occur very often if the Lords amendment were accepted. The Minister and the Government have not answered these questions.</p>

<p>I have only recently come in, and I apologise to the House for that. The hon. Gentleman knows my normal involvement in agriculture. When the hon. Gentleman's wife is pregnant, does he ensure that the obstetrician remains in his house throughout the period?</p>

<p>I am happy to say that on the three occasions that my wife has been pregnant and produced a fine child for me, I have taken her to the hospital&#x2014;it has always been at night&#x2014;and there has always been someone on duty. There is adequate staffing in most of our hospitals. They have skilled staffs, who realise that they have to work on a shift system. They are not available throughout both day and night, but when I have taken my wife to hospital she has been given the most excellent attention. That disposes of that rather irrelevant question easily and quickly.<br/>
I found it interesting that the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss

Maynard) talked about security. The Government's tax proposals and the other pernicious legislation that they are pushing through the House are undermining the security of certain people who are fortunate enough to live on estates and in country houses which are of great benefit to the nation. Their future is insecure under a Socialist Administration. What security do they have? Likewise, the hon. Member for Gloucestershire, West easily overlooked the pertinent points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr). He spoke about the great number of tied cottages occupied by people within the coal industry and the steel industry, and in the employ of the water authorities and local government. All these people are living in tied accommodation. When will the Government pick upon these other sectors and introduce similar legislation?<br/>
It is perhaps relevant to remind the the House that the Government may think&#x2014;perhaps they are right&#x2014;that a majority of farmers, who are private individuals with private enterprise businesses, vote for a party other than the Socialist Party, and that they can get away with introducing damaging legislation such as this without affecting their electoral chances. I put that to the House because it is a relevant factor.<br/>
I represent an area in Cheshire that has an important livestock industry. Many people have made representations to me&#x2014;for example, members of the NFU Council and members of the NFU locally in Cheshire and Macclesfield&#x2014;expressing grave concern about the problems that they will face as a result of this legislation. Would the Minister be happy to get up week after week during the calving season to assist and attend cows? Would he be happy to get up week after week to attend pigs, or poultry? I have had personal experience of the poultry industry, although I have no interest to declare. When electricity is cut off there are grave problems for those who are responsible for the huge poultry units. What happens when the electric fans go off? The answer is that tens of thousands of birds will be in jeopardy if no one is readily available immediately to open all the accesses to allow air in, or even to switch on emergency equipment. Grave losses could be


sustained if no one were immediately available. Have all these matters been properly considered by the Government?<br/>
In my view, too much legislation is being pushed through the House&#x2014;this Bill is an example&#x2014;that is party politically motivated. The hon. Member for Brightside talked about the poor agricultural worker. I am delighted that the hon. Lady has returned to her seat. There are a few poor agricultural workers, but in one breath she described them as poor and under-privileged while in the next she talked about the same people having cars and telephones. I am not sure that those factors go together.</p>

<p>We are talking about security of tenure, and I was saying that the hon. Gentleman's union insists that he retires at 65. I personally regret that. Back to the amendment&#x2014;surely it is important that a worker who is closely involved with animals&#x2014;unfortunately the welfare of animals has not featured sufficiently in our debates&#x2014;should live close to his work. If he finds that he must leave his job, and the house goes with the job, the house should be vacated. I wonder how many cases of genuine hardship the Minister or Labour Members can put forward in comparison with the total number of agricultural service cottages. I suspect that they could put forward only very few.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough said, this is a politically motivated Bill. Those in another place have done a great service. If the Minister and his hon. Friends had read the <i>Hansards</i> covering the debates in another place, as my right hon. and hon. Friends have done, they would have seen that in no way was the consideration that was

given to this measure dogmatic or bigoted. Indeed, their Lordships considered it diligently and constructively.<br/>
This is not a wrecking amendment. It seeks to exclude from the Bill a vital sector of the agriculture industry that needs its tied cottages and accommodation for those who serve it and the livestock that is the essence of the industry. I have great pleasure in supporting the comments made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr Pym). Once again, I thank those in another place for the tremendous job that they have done in trying to improve this unfortunate Bill.</p>

<p>A matter that must be made clear if we are to have a fair debate is whether the Opposition are against the abolition of tied cottages. If they are, that is a fair point of view. By means of the amendment, however, are they seeking to demonstrate that the provisions affecting livestock are unacceptable while the rest of the Bill is acceptable?<br/>
I believe that we should have a fair debate, and I meet the Opposition by saying that livestock has special needs. The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) has said that we must give special attention to poultry as well as cows calving. He said that if this iniquitous Bill becomes an Act there will be great suffering among livestock farmers. He said that if the fans go off, tens of thousands of birds will be suffocated. Where has he been living lately?<br/>
Modern conditions are such, irrespective of tied cottages, that unfortunately disasters take place almost day by day. If the hon. Gentleman reads the provincial Press in the Library&#x2014;there are not many headlines of this sort in the national Press&#x2014;he will see that they happen frequently. Modern methods of industrial farming, especially in poultry, lead to occasions when breakdowns can result in 50,000 birds being found suffocated. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Devon, West (Mr. Mills) shakes his head in dissent. I have made a considerable study of these matters and I assure him that there is chapter and verse to confirm what I have said.<br/>
Why cannot we see more trends in agriculture in the poultry, beef and pig industries embracing automatic methods


of time switches and automatic feeding? If those systems are to be perfected, the industry should surely adopt the same approach as that adopted by other industries involving men working shifts.<br/>
We hear a great deal from the Opposition about fanners having to stay up night after night because animals calve at such awkward times. Again, why cannot some form of shift work be introduced? Let us apply some common sense to the matter. Therefore, I believe that many of the arguments advanced by the Opposition on the Bill are fallacious.<br/>
Has anybody calculated how many tied cottages are involved on the farms and in the villages? I know from my own observations that farms with stock do not always have a hindhouse. Some farms have such accommodation but others do not. Certainly some farms employ men who live in nearby villages. In other words, arrangements are made to cope with the situation. Therefore, on the basis of reasoning that argument is not a fair runner.<br/>
Labour Members are often accused by the Opposition of being ideological and of adopting a doctrinaire approach. Some of us have lived in these villages. Do any Conservative Members know what it means to live in a house and to know that one day a knock on the door may mean that one has to vacate the premises and find alternative accommodation? We say that that is wrong in all circumstances. It is not good for the man concerned, for the employer or for the industry.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) instances National Coal Board accommodation, but on how many occasions have miners been thrown out of their homes? Many of these eviction cases involve workers on the land. We say that this amounts to a social ill.<br/>

<p>I wish to take this opportunity to declare my interest. Before I entered this House I was a full-time farmer. I now employ four workers, who do an excellent job of work.

<p>I am surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman say that he is not prepared to support the Lords amendment. Perhaps he will explain why the Liberal Party in the other place voted unanimously in favour of it. He may like to know that a total of six Liberal peers voted for it and, indeed, that one of them, Lord Mackie, referred to the amendment as " monumental good 
sense ".</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for drawing my attention to that situation, but I was elected to this House by the people of Cardigan and, as agricultural spokesman for the Liberal Party, I am here to represent my constituents' views rather than the views of noble Lords in another place.<br/>
If the amendment is accepted, I shall have to return to Cardigan and tell my three stockmen that they will not be protected under the Bill, but at the same time I shall be able to tell my tractor driver that he is safeguarded by these provisions. That surely is wrong. I am sure that within a period of a year relationships! on my farm between1 the tractor driver and the stockmen would not go well. There are many farmers in Wales, and, indeed, in other parts of Britain, who employ tractor drivers, shepherds and stockmen.<br/>
In considering this matter, we should examine a former Prime Minister's words expressed only last year at the Royal Show. The right hon. Member for Huyton (Sir H. Wilson) said on that occasion:
<q>The Government's policy is to establish a framework which can give confidence for the future&#x2014;for the consumer and for the producer so that he can plan and invest. At this time above all, we need to make the best and most economic use of our own resources, not only of land but the skills of our agricultural workers and farmers.</q>


A survey was published soon after that speech in which a farmer was quoted as saying:
<q>We would have more confidence in the future if we knew we would be allowed to keep the staff housing we have. This is a key to future confidence. We cannot produce without labour.</q>
I believe that we are not abolishing the tied cottage system, because the staff housing will remain. We must do our utmost to secure staff housing for our stockmen and others. A farm is dependent on the efficient and dedicated efforts of its work force if its output is to increase. We have only to examine the figures over the last 15 years to see how dramatically the work force has declined. In 1960, 505,000 full-time workers were employed in agriculture. At present the figure is only 223,000. If we are to increase production, can we afford a further decrease in the labour force? I believe that if we are to succeed we must hold on to the present labour force and look after those men in the next 20 years.<br/>
I believe that there are many hon. Members on both sides of the House who have no connection with agriculture but who are still worried about the welfare of livestock. Many people believe that stock will suffer, and, indeed, will be neglected, if the Lords amendment is not accepted. However, I do not take that view. I believe that the majority of stockmen will remain in the cottages in which they already live. I believe that the stockmen will not run away but will remain at their work.<br/>
I disagree with the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton), who said that many chickens might be burnt overnight and that cows might not be able to calve. I know stockmen and I know the kind of work force that exists in agriculture. They look after the stock when the cows calve. They will be living in the staff house provided for them by the management. Therefore, there is no need to worry on that score at all. It is our duty as farmers, as employers, to look after the interests of our employees, who have given such excellent service to the industry.<br/>
Whatever we decide tonight, we must ensure that the agriculture industry continues to thrive and that it is not prevented from expanding. We must ensure the health and well-being of livestock and

give every encouragement to producers to increase their production from the land. In my view, therefore, we must not discriminate on behalf of one group of workers against the others. I shall be asking my hon. Friends to vote against the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells), who brings to the debate a combination of knowledge and experience, and a degree of impartiality which, unfortunately, is not shared by the majority of those sitting on the Opposition Benches. I wonder how much real political benefit accrues to the Opposition from seeking to make political capital from the Bill, to the extent that the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) was attempting to do.<br/>
I believe that the Bill is a serious attempt to balance the conflicting problems which have to be faced in this issue and that the amendment which the Lords have introduced would cut a very substantial part of the heart out of the Bill.<br/>
I remind hon. Members that if the Lords amendment were carried, whole villages would be adversely affected. I know one village in Essex where every house is owned by the farming company, a very large dairy organisation catering for a large part of Essex. Every house in the village is owned by that farming company I was parliamentary candidate in the constituency some years ago and found that it was virtually impossible to get a single person to tell me on the doorstep what his political views were because of apprehensions as to the attitude of the employer, the farming company.<br/>
The hon. Member for Macclesfield spoke of the Bill as having been forced on the Government by the militant left-wing of the Labour Party. I do not think that he would describe me as militant Left-wing, but I have spoken of my experience in the constituency, and there is absolutely no doubt of it whatsoever. Those living in tied cottages in agricultural areas feel all through their lives a degree of insecurity. They dare not express themselves politically to their bosses in a way which is fundamental


to the expression of proper individuality and freedom in our society.</p>

<p>If that is the case&#x2014;and I accept that the hon. Gentleman holds that point of view sincerely&#x2014;will he direct his attention to the other large sectors of industry which provide tied accommodation, and indicate whether he would support the abolition of tied accommodation in those industries? Will he say whether the reservations he has expressed about people living in agricultural tied accommodation are also reflected to these other sectors as well?</p>

<p>I was coming to that very point. I greatly welcome the Bill as a first step towards the abolition of tied accommodation in any field. I take the point about the National Coal Board, although I do not think that miners would feel any degree of apprehension about the Coal Board coming down on them if they were to display a Tory poster in a window.</p>

<p>Is my hon. Friend aware that the National Coal Board has already announced that every house in its possession, from the managerial level down to the lowest level, is up for sale to the sitting tenant or to the local authority? In my area alone during the past four years 968 houses have changed hands from the National Coal Board to the local authorities. God bless the Coal Board for selling them.</p>

<p>I am very glad to learn of that progress, but there are many other people involved. There are the school caretakers, employees of local authorities, employees in catering establishments, managers of laundrettes, and so on. There is a very great degree of abuse where the house goes with the job. I shall be very anxious to see the principle which we have started in the Bill extended to cover all these other categories.<br/>
I believe that in the Bill the balance is right and that we have tackled the problem correctly, but it involves a risk that the agricultural tenant who is threatened with eviction will override the priority of other people on the housing waiting list in the area; others on the waiting list will be displeased. Never-

theless, I believe that the balance in the Bill is correct. I remind Conservative Members that, as has been said, at present if a farmer wishes to gain possession of a tied cottage from the family of an agricultural worker, or from the worker himself, there is a six-months' delay. I agree that the real effect of the Bill may well be to impose a duty on the local authority to find accommodation.</p>

<p>I am familial with the words of the Bill. I was present in Committee and the hon. Member was not.<br/>
Nevertheless, a strong obligation is imposed on the local authority, and I believe that the overwhelming majority of local authorities&#x2014;most of them are Conservative-dominated&#x2014;will seek to do what is necessary. I believe that the farmer will find it much easier to get the outgoing tenant or worker rehoused by the local authority, and will be able to get his new employee into the accommodation more quickly than if the Bill had not been introduced.<br/>
The balance of the Bill, I believe, is a fair one. I hope, as I have already1 said, that it will be possible to extend it to a great many other areas, but we have to take note of the fact that we cannot put an evicted laundrette manager straight into council accommodation over the heads of others who have been on the waiting list for some time. This is an experiment, in the sense that we shall be able to see how it works, and then we must learn, from experience with the Bill, how it can be applied elsewhere. Every piece of legislation is to some extent an experiment. The hon. Member for Macclesfield may grin, but every social change involves a degree of experimentation.<br/>
I feel that the Bill is likely to work satisfactorily. If we were to accept the Lords amendment it would mean allowing whole villages to remain subservient to a single employer, with every person knowing that he could lose his home and his job at the same time. If the amendment were to be accepted the Bill would not be worth having. I therefore trust that the amendment will be rejected.</p>

<p>I start by declaring an interest. I have lived in a tied cottage, and I do not think that many hon. Members can say that. I can certainly say that I did not have any problems.<br/>
I take issue with the Parliamentary Secretary when he talks about a wrecking amendment. We do not believe that it is a wrecking amendment in the sense in which he speaks. We are trying to show our concern at what will happen because of these measures. Without being rude, I would emphasise that our concern is based on experience. From my knowledge of the industry and of stockmen generally, I believe that most stockmen want to live very close to their work. The Parliamentary Secretary shakes his head, but this is true. This amendment is not a wrecking amendment, it simply shows concern based on experience.<br/>
8.0 p.m.<br/>
I take issue with the Parliamentary Secretary when he talks about "basic advances in the countryside". This shows how little he knows about the countryside; perhaps he has forgotten. However, that phrase will hang around his neck like a cow's tether in years to come, especially when we see the Bill's result on many stock farms.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary also said that this had been a campaign for many years. I suggest that not every campaign is wise. Some have even proved disastrous. I do not say that this campaign is disastrous, but certainly I believe it to be unwise. We must protect the workers and the farmers, but above all we must protect the agricultural industry as a whole.<br/>
It is very sad that the Government feel that they have to bring in a measure like this to deal with a very small number of farmers who have let down the farming community in this way. It is sad that the Government see fit to bring in a measure of this kind when so many fanners are utterly responsible in this respect.<br/>
It is also important to highlight why the Government have picked on agriculture. We have never had a satisfactory answer to that question. They talk about moving into other spheres. In west Devon, which is truly rural, there is a large number of tied cottages. On Dartmoor, most of the prison officers are in

tied houses. Will the Government extend this principle to Dartmoor? If they do, it will be very difficult to operate Dartmoor Prison from Tavistock or elsewhere. Why should the Government pick on agriculture? If I were told that legislation to deal with other sections of industry would be introduced I might be a little happier.<br/>
The hon. Member for Sheffield, Bright-side (Miss Maynard) said one of the saddest things I have heard in this House for a long time. She said that farm workers were under-privileged. That is an insult to them. I do not believe that they feel under-privileged one little bit. That is not my experience in working and living with them. Generally, I have found them to be a proud bunch of men&#x2014;proud because they know their job. I think that that was a very sad phrase the hon. Lady used.<br/>
The hon. Lady also talked about stockmen always being able to use the telephone. What a remarkable statement. I cannot imagine a cow 'phoning to say that it needs a stockman. The whole trouble is that the hon. Lady and others like her do not realise just how stockmen feel about these matters. The important thing to them is to have that last look around their yards or over their flocks. They are not always paid for it, but they enjoy it. If they see trouble they put it right at once and that saves them a lot of work in the long run. But they must be on the spot. To talk about the telephone shows how little the hon. Lady knows about the real problems of stockmen.<br/>
Being a stockman is, of course, a tie. Some hon. Members in this House have never worked with cows daily, as I have. It means milking them 14 times a week, and very often it means no holidays. Of course it is a tie, and of course it is difficult. Naturally, we want to move towards a time when there is far more active relief for stockmen so that they have more time for their own use, but is it wrong to think that they are not concerned about their stock. In many cases they count their stock as their own, and looking after it is their life. Woe betide the farmer who gives a stockman too many orders, because in most cases it is the stockman who want to run the show.<br/>
This whole business of tied cottages has been exaggerated. If a count were taken of every stockman in this country it would be found that most would say that they want to live near their stock, in order to help themselves. To talk about the telephone shows the poverty of the Labour Party in these matters.<br/>
This is a very sad debate in many ways. I admit that there is a small minority of farmers of whom I am ashamed, but it is a small number, and to bring in a measure like this to deal with them will do nothing but harm to the farming industry, and in particular to stock farming.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member believes that this is such a small minority which is abusing the system, would he agree that only a very small number of farm workers abuse it also? Why should he be apprehensive about a system whereby a farm worker remains in a cottage unless other accommodation is there for him to turn to?</p>

<p>I was brought up among stockmen. I have an interest to declare, in that I managed several estates with tied cottages. This is one of my major interests in Norfolk, where this campaign has been continuing for 40 or 50 years. I appreciate the arguments that have come from Norfolk and I understand them. I would want to see the system done away with if I knew that enough new cottages were available to go around so that an incoming stockman was not put to any great hardship.<br/>
The Government never think of the incoming stockman in the situation that arises when a stockman dies and his widow wants to get into a council house. The incoming stockman is the man who has been employed to look after the flock or the herd and sometimes he cannot take up his duties without the tied cottage system. That is where we find ourselves in difficulty. Quite frankly, I find that there is always one particularly bad tied cottage case in my area which comes up during the General Election period. I wonder whether it is done deliberately by my opponent. Personally, I would like to see the system done away with if I knew that there were enough cottages in the area to go round and that there was a guarantee for the new man of a "cottage on the job".<br/>
The stockman is the salt of all workers, and it is true that the stock is his stock. It was always "my horses", and there have been instances of a horseman stealing from the next-door corn bin to get his horses extra feed.</p>

<p>There is no point at issue between us here. I know of a case in which an employee was not particularly concerned about the wages for himself, but when it was suggested that he should consider cutting down rations for his animals, he was so angry that he left.</p>

<p>I entirely agree with that. As I have said, I should like this system done away with if that were possible. But the venom displayed by the Parliamentary Secretary was enough to make anyone oppose him. However, I have doubts whether it is right to divide farm workers into two classes&#x2014;whether it is right to give stockmen less security than other farm workers. I am worried on that point, and also because it will be extremely difficult for local authorities to carry out the rehousing that the Government envisage. There are already priority lists for people who are without housing. Quite rightly, all the Service Ministries recommend that Service men who have not had the chance to get housing points with a local authority should be given an advantage. The Bill will provide yet a third group of people who will be put ahead of those who, by right of long standing, have a place on the council house list.<br/>
I hope that we shall find sufficient cottages in the right places, because without them this scheme will not work. The incoming stockman who wants to look after his stock properly and to be with them will not get a house, and it is that sort of person that we want to take care of.</p>

<p>I begin by declaring my interest. One thing that has emerged from the debate is the clear indication of the way in which the guillotine has provided totally insufficient time hi which to deal with the Lords amendments. We have seen the extent to which Labour Members have participated in the debate, which has taken a considerable amount of time. My hon. Friend the Member for Devon, West (Mr. Mills) put his finger on the point when he said that this had been a sad debate in some ways. Many of us


have publicly acknowledged that the Bill owes its birth, to a large extent, to the activities of the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard). In her speech today she demonstrated her bitterness and venom, and her reliance on the life-long class warfare which she has carried on, and showed some of the misguided philosophy that lies behind the Bill.<br/>
As we have proceeded further with the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary has shown, as one of my hon. Friends remarked, increased venom in answering the debates on the amendments. Labour Members have clearly shown that the Bill is backed more by their desire to fulfil arbitrary political objections than the effect that it is likely to have on the industry and those who work in it.<br/>
When the Parliamentary Secretary opened the debate he spoke about the amendment's standing between the Government and its political objectives. That clearly summed up the position of Labour Members, whose attitude is far more political than practical. They have spent very little of their speeches discussing the merits of the amendments, the welfare of farm animals, or the convenience of farm workers. All the talk about cars and telephones is just so much nonsense. We know that Labour Members are hell-bent to secure their political objectives. That is clearly demonstrated by their attitude to Scotland. Their only reason for not applying the Bill to Scotland is that farm workers there are against it.<br/>
8.15 p.m.<br/>
Labour Members have this evening tried to dress up their arguments with an attack on the other place. That is totally irrelevant, especially in view of what happened last week on the Dock Work Regulation Bill, on which the actions of the other place enabled us here to think again on those matters.<br/>
I should like to take up what my hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr) said about little attention having been paid to the views and studies that have been produced about the impact of the Bill. The Minister said that the Bill would not lead to a reduction in agricultural production, or have a bad effect on the livestock industry. Let me refer him to page 3 paragraph 7 of the document that Miss Ruth Gasson produced. It stated that:

<q>While livestock producers as a whole have a very good case for requiring workers to live on the premises, pedigree breeders and milk producers were the most insistent that their enterprises would be unworkable without a key man living on the spot.</q>
The Government have not considered sufficiently the effect of the Bill on agricultural production or on their White Paper "Food from Our Own Resources". The Bill will set back further the attainment of the targets in that White Paper.<br/>
The Government have defied the advice of those who know about agriculture. We have seen the totally impractical attitudes displayed by the hon. Members for Brightside and Brigg and Scunthorpe (Mr. Ellis) towards the agriculture industry and those who work in it.</p>

<p>If the hon. Member is suggesting that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) and I are motivated only by prejudice and malice, will he explain why the Conservatives have lost the support of the Liberals? Does he suggest that the Liberals are motivated in the same way?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1430.1" hansard_membership_id="6924" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16703" speakername="Mr. Jopling" colnum="1430" time="">
<p>I could not think of a more helpful intervention by the hon. Member. The Liberal Party in the country is a totally unco-ordinated group, which does one thing in this place and something totally different in another. No doubt we shall see more examples of this nonsense. We do not know what the Liberals are doing, and I do not think that they know themselves.<br/>
We have heard too little from Labour Members about the problems of incoming stockmen, so I believe that we should press the amendments. My hon. Friend the Member for Norfolk, South-West (Mr. Hawkins) expressed honestly-felt doubts about the amendments. I hope that he will recall te opening remark of my right hon. Friend the Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym), that it is surely best, in view of the uncertainties surrounding the Bill, to start with the non-livestock sector. We must try for a few years to see how it works, and deal with the livestock side later.<br/>
I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary intends to reply to the debate. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends will vote in support of the other place on these amendments.</p>

<p>I shall reply briefly, because I understand that the Opposition want to make progress. Indeed, that was why we accepted their amendment to the procedure.<br/>
Virtually all the arguments about this matter have been gone over time and again. The issue is quite simple. The Government believe that a farm worker and his family should have a right to the roof over their heads comparable with the right that is taken for granted by the vast majority of workers and their families.<br/>
This Bill is about security. It is about ending the insecurity of the farm worker with a young family who is worried about the future if he loses his job. It is about ending the insecurity of the wife who sees her husband's health deteriorating while working on the farm and wonders what will happen to the family when he is no longer able to work. It is about ending the insecurity of the old farm worker who goes on working beyond the age of 65 because he does not have a house to which he can retire.<br/>
That is what the Bill is about. That is why the Government cannot accept this wrecking amendment, which would exclude about 25 per cent. of farm workers and their families from coverage of this legislation. They would have no legal protection whatsoever.<br/>
The hon. Member for Devon, West (Mr. Mills) said that there were very few evictions each year. I am not sure how many evictions are carried out. The Tavistock Institute reckoned that there were about 1,200 court orders a year.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary must realise that there are very few real evictions. Many of the court orders are taken out in collaboration</p>

<p>I do not dispute that some of the court orders are taken out in collaboration with farm workers, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucestershire, West (Mr. Watkinson) said, it is somewhat demeaning and unfair that farm workers should be dragged through the courts, even if it is in collusion with their employers, to obtain the offer of alternative accommodation by local authorities. Sensible, progressive, practical farmers welcome this measure because it will end that degrading process, which some of them dislike just as much as their workers.<br/>
The issue is simple. We cannot accept the exclusion of this vast number of workers from the coverage of this legislation. I think that the House was impressed by the point made by the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells), based on his own experience&#x2014;namely, how can we tolerate a situation in which one farm worker is in a cottage and has a basic protection because he drives a tractor, whereas the farm worker in the cottage next door, because he works with livestock, has no legal rights regarding his accommodation when he ceases to work for his employer?<br/>
This is not a question of how many evictions there are or how many court orders are taken out. That is the tip of the iceberg. That is the manifestation of the situation. We believe that it is wrong that a farm worker's accommodation should be dependent on the attitude of his employer. I urge the House to reject the amendment.</p>

<p>All these Lords amendments are concerned with forestry, and the total effect of them, by removing forestry from the list of activities included in agriculture, would be to preclude the application of the Bill at any time to whole-time workers in forestry. This is not acceptable.<br/>
I remind the House that in the consultative document we noted that existing tied cottage legislation would apply to many forestry workers and that
<q>pay and conditions for many forestry workers are subject to the Agricultural Wages Act".</q>
It was clear to us when we came to draft legislation that the links between forestry and the remainder of agriculture were such that forestry was an integral part of the agriculture industry and should be included in the Bill.<br/>
There was a need to improve the information available on the situation in forestry, particularly with a view to being able to give housing authorities a clear indication of their likely obligations towards this sector. A survey is presently being conducted on behalf of the Forestry Commission by the Tavistock Institute to provide this information. The specific reference to forestry in the Bill is provided to ensure that a clear distinction can be made between workers who are covered from the appointed day for agriculture and those who are covered from the later appointed day for forestry.<br/>
I should add that we expect the Forestry Commission, which is the largest woodland owner in the country, to treat

its tied cottage occupants&#x2014;when the legislation is brought into effect for forestry&#x2014;exactly as private forestry landlords will be required to do. Although the Forestry Commission is exempt from a statutory obligation under the Bill, there will be no question of discrimination in practice between the one sector and the other.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1438.0" hansard_membership_id="1183" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31508" speakername="Mr. W. Benyon" colnum="1438" time="">
<p>I first declare my interest as an owner of woodlands and, of course, of the houses that go with those woodlands. In the rest of the proceedings, I hope that my interest can also be taken to apply to agriculture.<br/>
I hope that the Government will think again about this. The forestry situation is most extraordinary. As it stands at the moment, the Bill does not apply to forestry until the appointed day arrives. It will not apply to Scotland if and when the appointed day is designated. From the last debate it is clear that the Scottish Union of Agricultural Workers does not want the Bill to apply to agriculture, and there have been no moves to have it applied to forestry in Scotland.<br/>
The Forestry Commission itself is excluded, with the 1,500 houses that it owns for its own employees. If and when the Bill applies to forestry it will therefore apply to a very small proportion of the industry itself. To date, no previous legislation concerned with agriculture and forestry has defined forestry as forming part of agriculture. Therefore, there is no precedent whatever for including it in legislation such as this.<br/>
The next point is that, by and large, forestry exists in extremely isolated areas. This point was brought out to the full during the debates in the other place. Therefore, the need for employees to be on the spot is absolute. I ask the Minister point-blank whether the advice that he has received from the Forestry Commission is that the industry cannot continue if it cannot be assured of accommodation for its work force within a reasonable distance of its operations.<br/>
This summer has proved conclusively the need for this, because we have had the great menace of fires. I share my own experience with the House, because


I have lost a considerable acreage of young trees. In fact, it was only the heroic efforts of the fire brigade, and my own staff, that managed to stop the destruction spreading further. The same thing happened in parts of Yorkshire and in Scotland. The need for staff to be near at hand in these isolated areas has been proved conclusively during this hot, dry summer.<br/>
The Government would do much better to accept, first, that no demand has been made by the industry and its workers for forestry to be included in the Bill. Secondly, the problems of definition are very great. Most forestry operations combine the growing of trees with the processing of the timber. That is an industrial process, and would have to be excluded from the Bill.<br/>
Thirdly, as I have already said, a large part of the industry is excluded in any event.<br/>
Fourthly, the location and organisation of the forestry industry presents great difficulties.<br/>
It seems that the Government are seeking to save face by delaying the application of the Bill to forestry. It would be far more honest and straightforward, and would benefit the stability and progress of the industry, if they came clean and took forestry out completely. I therefore advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against the motion.</p>

<p>The eloquence of my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) has been so compelling that I would not have ventured to take part in the debate but for the Minister's opening words, which were so disgraceful as to be hardly credible. He said that forestry is an integral part of agriculture. It is, of course, a far more important industry than agriculture.<br/>
The Bill's farcical nature is evident when one considers the balance of forestry among the different parts of the United Kingdom. The major effort in forestry now is in Scotland, but as both Scotland and Northern Ireland will be exempt from the Bill we are really talking about England and Wales. It is farcical to pass legislation applying these provisions only to England and Wales.<br/>
All that my hon. Friend has said about the problems of working in isolated areas and the dangers of fire&#x2014;which were so evident both in 1976 and in 1975&#x2014;needs no further emphasis. But it is difficult to leave this matter without referring to the Minister's extraordinary words about the Forestry Commission&#x2014;that it was to be asked, persuaded or somehow cajoled into treating its employees exactly the same as those employed by private forestry. That gives the ultimate air of unreality to the Government's motion. I have the greatest pleasure in giving my utmost support to my hon. Friend. I hope that the Minister will see sense and decide to withdraw his stupid motion.</p>

<p>I am moved to speak only because of the claim of the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. More) that agriculture is less important than forestry. That might conceivably be true in my constituency, which includes the Forest of Dean and where forestry is a major industry, but it could not apply across the country. I support the motion and reiterate the point which lies behind the Bill&#x2014;that is, that we are determined to see an end to tied cottages generally within the country and particularly in agriculture.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1440.1" hansard_membership_id="9468" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30043" speakername="Mr. Jasper More" colnum="1440" time="">
<p>When the hon. Gentleman says "within the country", does he include Scotland and Ireland?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1440.2" hansard_membership_id="10083" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21942" speakername="Mr. Watkinson" colnum="1440" time="">
<p>We have been through that many times. They are not included in the Bill, as the hon. Gentleman knows.<br/>
There is a principle at stake here. We wish to see an end to tied cottages. The hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon) spoke eloquently about this matter, but I do not think that even he could pretend that the force of the argument used in the preceding debate about the necessity for having dairymen and stockmen on the premises is not weightier than the argument he used about forestry. We all know of the exceptional circumstances this year. In my constituency problems arose from fires, but the hon. Gentleman will have to accept that the most important element in bringing those fires under control was the fire brigade, which in my area had to travel several miles to deal with the fires.<br/>
I welcome the undertaking given by my hon. Friend the Minister to carry


out an investigation of forest tied-cottage dwellings. I shall support him in rejecting the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I should like to respond to some questions which have been asked. The National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers has been consistently in favour of the protection and coverage of forestry workers as well as of agricultural workers. Perhaps I misunderstood the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Benyon), but my impression was that he sought to apply that across the border. We are not discussing Scotland because the legislation does not apply to Scotland. The Forestry Commission has not opposed the implementation of the measure.<br/>
I do not want to be drawn into the argument about whether forestry or agri-</p>

<p>The House will be pleased to hear that the amendments are less formidable than their length would suggest. Their main effect is to transfer the contents of Clause 2 to a new schedule and to deal with two points of substance which were troubling the

Opposition. They were welcomed by spokesmen for the Opposition in another place and I trust that they will be equally welcome here.<br/>
The first point of substance covered in the new schedule concerns board. Out policy intention is that no worker receiving board should be protected, just as under the Rent Acts no tenant who receives board qualifies for protection. Under the Bill in its current form, where a farmer provided a qualifying worker with board but charged him no rent, such a worker would be protected, though a worker who paid some rent in similar circumstances would not be protected. That is not the effect that we set out to achieve. The new schedule sets matters right. It also deals in similar form with attendance. I imagine, however, that in the agricultural world attendance is not likely to loom large, although the question of board could in some parts.<br/>
The second point of substance concerns hostels. The amendments make


sure that occupants of hostels are excluded from protection, which is not to extend to a worker sharing a dwelling for four or more persons where each person has one room, and only one, to himself. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and I have both said that the residual problem of hostels would not be solved easily. The detailed nature of the amendments on the subject&#x2014;amendments that are complicated and technical&#x2014;bear out our warnings, but I am sure that the end result is one on which both the Government and Opposition are agreed.</p>

<p>Earlier this evening I submitted a manuscript to Lords Amendment No. 77. I understand that Mr. Speaker has been kind enough to select it but that it is still being duplicated for circulation to hon. Members. This is part of the problem if the Government are taken unawares, with the result that we have little time to consider these matters. The Government are in as much difficulty now as possibly we were in the early hours of the morning because they brought this matter forward so quickly.<br/>
My amendment seeks to insert in Lords Amendment No. 77
<q>for the purposes of this schedule".</q>
I seek to do so to make clear that the modifications that are being made to Section 2 of the Rent Act 1968 are purely for the purposes of the schedule and for no other reason and that they relate to agricultural tenancies and no others.<br/>
I must confess that when I first read the schedule, which is written in extremely complex and complicated language, dealing with highly technical matters under the Rent Acts, I was somewhat alarmed. If one reads paragraph 3 of the schedule in isolation, it makes the bald statement that Section 2 of the Rent Act 1968 is being modified to a certain extent. That is what the language of sub-paragraph (3) states. I appreciate that the foregoing paragraphs appear to imply that the relevant licence and the relevant tenancy are defined by reference to subsequent amendments in paragraph 3 to which I am referring.<br/>
On one construction of the schedule, it can be said that the only effect of sub-paragraph (3) in law is inasmuch as

it relates to the preceding paragraphs 1 and 2. That is the conclusion that can be reached if paragraphs 1 and 2 are read first. However, if we take sub-paragraph (3) in isolation, someone coming to the Bill for the first time could correctly say that it is a bald statement of law without qualification that Section 2 of the Rent Act 1968 is modified. If that construction can be put on the paragraph the ramifications are enormous.<br/>
It is to ensure that no doubt can arise that I wish to insert the words in the amendment. Unless it is made clear beyond peradventure, doubt could be caused. We start in sub-paragraph (2) of paragraph 3 with the statement that we omit paragraph (<i>a</i>) of Section 2 of the Rent Act 1968. That sub-paragraph of Section 2 of the 1968 Act ensures that tenancies at a low rent are not protected tenancies. If we do not ensure that end by removing paragraph <i>2(a)</i> of the 1968 Act, it could happen that if the wrong interpretation were put on the schedule a person would find that he had let into possession a protected tenant and had been denied his home. That would be the position if he had to leave his house for some time and, in order to prevent squatters moving in, he let it to a friend at a nominal rent&#x2014;for example, &#x00A3;1 a week, a shilling a week or, as is done quite frequently, a case of whisky at the end of six months as payment in kind.<br/>
Similarly, complications could arise in the hotel industry. Hoteliers often acquire accommodation and let it to their work force at nominal rents so that they can attract staff to their hotels. I am referring not to people who reside in a hotel under service occupancies but to staff who are outside the hotel in accommodation provided for them by the hotel at nominal rents. If the Lords amendment remains as it is, unqualified, the danger may arise that those hotels will find that all the accommodation would become subject to protected tenancies. I am advised that the effect on the tourist industry would be considerable and very much to its disadvantage. Therefore, we must make clear that no such suggestion is implied by the legislation.<br/>
9.15 p.m.<br/>
Paragraph 3(4) of the new Schedule 1A could cause considerable difficulty. That provision recasts the conditions under which attendance is taken into account in


deciding whether a tenancy is protected. The Rent Act 1968 contains words to the effect that the attendance must represent a substantial part of the rent paid. That matter has now been determined by the Court of Appeal in the case of Woodward <i>v.</i> Docherty, although in that case the court was dealing with a furnished tenancy. Nevertheless, attendance in terms of furnished tenancies is dealt with in the same sub-paragraph and it was considered in that way by the Court of Appeal.<br/>
The effect of the sub-paragraph is to override the decision of the Court of Appeal. The courts would be thrown back to the somewhat unsatisfactory situation that obtained in earlier years as thrown up by the case of Sagoo <i>v.</i> Goel. The courts were there concerned not with assessing the value of attendance or furniture in relation to rent but with the value of the services or furniture provided to the tenant irrespective of any arithmetical calculation of rent. That would be an unsatisfactory departure in regard to tenants&#x2014;I speak in general terms rather than in terms of agricultural tenants&#x2014;if they were denied the protection given them by the Court of Appeal in the case of Woodward <i>v.</i> Docherty.<br/>
Unless we are careful to ensure that paragraph 3(4) of the schedule relates only to what is contained in the schedule under the kind of construction that I suggest, the implications for the general law of landlord and tenant could be consider able. That is the reason for my amendment. Since the Minister said in opening this discussion that the Government in tended to limit these matters simply to agricultural tenancies and not extend them to the general law of landlord and tenant under the Rent Act, I hope that he will accept this small amendment to make the situation clear beyond any shadow of doubt.<br/>
The other matter I wish to mention concerns the Minister's amendment to Lords Amendment No. 77. As I understand the situation, paragraph 4 of the new schedule is now being deleted. That paragraph gives the concession for which we asked in regard to hostels. Will the Minister in reply explain why, having said that this concession is being given to hostel accommodation, he should now seek to amend the schedule by removing that reference?<br/>
I appreciate that there is another amendment in this group of amendments&#x2014;I think it is Lords Amendment No. 40, to Clause 24&#x2014;in which there is a further provision relating to hostel accommodation. But that again is being amended by the Minister by a further amendment which has appeared on the Amendment Paper, and there must be some watering down of this concession.<br/>
I ask the Minister to forgive me for asking for this explanation of his amendments following his opening statement, but he will appreciate that the Opposition have been put in great difficulty by the shortness of time in which to study these matters. They are extremely intricate and, therefore, I have not readily been able to follow why he should be taking reference to hostels out of Schedule 1 but leaving it in Clause 24 in a form that he is now seeking to modify.</p>

<p>I find this&#x2014;and I am sure other hon. Members do&#x2014;a very technical and difficult matter to understand. I want to make it clear that we do not want for farm workers any more than we would ask for any other group of workers. That applies to farm workers whether they live in hostels or in any other accommodation.<br/>
There was one important admission from the Conservative Front Bench in talking about the accommodation offered in the catering industry. It was said that this accommodation was often offered at nominal rents&#x2014;as, of course, tied accommodation is in agriculture&#x2014;in order to attract labour to the industry. Workers in the catering industry are notoriously badly paid, as are agricultural workers. I have always found that tied accommodation at nominal rent was one way of attracting labour into a low-paid industry. We have had an admission tonight from the Conservative Front Bench in relation to another industry.</p>

<p>I support my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) in his request for an amendment at the beginning of paragraph 4 of Schedule 1A so that the schedule shall only apply to agricultural tenancies. If I may invite the Minister to intervene and say that he accepts that, I need not speak any further.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Minister for that firm assurance. It shortens the debate considerably.<br/>
I declare an interest. Some time ago I wrote a book on the Rent Acts. The more the Government revise the Rent Acts, the more likely are the publishers to ask me for a second edition.</p>

<p>Nobody has ever asked me to write a book on the revision of the Rent Acts, and nobody is likely to do so. I wish, however, to voice a very angry protest at the mode in which this revision of one of the 13 Rent Acts to which we still have from time to time to refer is being made in Amendment No. 77.<br/>
The Rent Acts range from 1915 to 1974. The corpus of law that they constitute is properly described as monumental, but hardly stands as a monument to the limpid clarity of the legislation that we turn out from this House.<br/>
I think it nothing short of a disgrace that we are now, at this short notice, being invited to consider a new schedule that consists of 75 lines of closely drafted amendments to Clause 2, which itself sets out to modify provisions of the 196S Rent Act.<br/>
The Rent Acts to which we now have to refer constitute a kind of archaeological dig. Everyone knows that they are ranged one upon another. Some derive support from those beneath them, and others from those alongside. Therefore, everyone must know the effect on each individual slice of this sandwich cake in order to get accurate advice about the law. Nevertheless, all these acts received proper debate in this House, to the best of my knowledge. None was subjected to a guillotine, and certainly none was subjected to substantial amendments to the extent of 75 lines in a completely new schedule rearranging the definitions, brought forward in a debate that was itself subject to the guillotine, at rather less than 30 hours' notice.<br/>
This House is not just a means of sustaining a Government in office. Neither is it just a means of getting the Government out of an inconvenient spot at any given time. Its function, first and foremost, is to make law. The Minister knows in his heart of hearts that it is quite indefensible to seek to make law by

means such as this amendment. How can hon. Members give their minds satisfactorily to this degree of lawmaking&#x2014;75 lines of new definitions recasting Clause 2 at such short notice? The danger is that the Government will be tempted to think that they can do this.<br/>
The Rent Acts constitute a difficult field of law, and many humble people depend on accurate advice about their real meaning. Here, once again, we are doing an in-defensible thing. We are not taking the trouble to satisfy ourselves that we know that what we are saying is right. If we fail to do our parliamentary job of making law carefully, it costs us nothing at all. We are comfortably protected from the consequences of our own negligence&#x2014;we take great care to see to that. The cost falls upon those people who have the misfortune to be affected by the law that we make so heedlessly and lightly. Other people have to pay to find out the meaning and the effect of the law which Ministers are paid to make clear.<br/>
I dare say that the Minister will claim that this is a tightening-up operation, designed to meet objections expressed here and in another place. But we have not been given sufficient time to discover whether these amendments are sufficiently clearly expressed, or whether they do the job they purport to do. It is the people affected by our laws who suffer. They have to act on the best advice available to them, which later may be held by a bare majority of judges to have been wrong.<br/>
Anyone who has any knowledge of the law of landlord and tenant, and particularly of the Rent Acts, will condemn the Government's action today as an iniquitous scandal and a blatant affront to the law for which, from Clay Cross to Grunwick Laboratories, they have frequently shown contempt.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. and learned Member for Royal Tunbridge Wells (Mr. Mayhew) has used such exaggerated language in giving his proper attention to something which we have not had a great deal of time to consider. I was in some difficulty here because of the manuscript amendment, but I do not complain about it. I thank the hon. and learned Gentleman for the valuable advice he gave me on Rent Act


legislation&#x2014;which is difficult&#x2014;during our deliberations in Standing Committee.<br/>
When I first came to the House, having previously been a schoolmaster, I was determined that any Bill with which I was associated would be made clear to the layman. How foolish I was to think that that was a simple operation! Since then we have been in the hands of the lawyers. Rent Act legislation is complex and difficult. I can assure the hon. and learned Member for Royal Tunbridge Wells that if we discussed the subject from now until next Wednesday the House would not be very full and I do not know that the subject would be much clearer to those of us who were present. That is why we are having a thorough review of Rent Act legislation. I do not accept the criticism that what we are seeking to do in the amendments is scandalous behaviour.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
I must tell the hon. Member for Hornsey (Mr. Rossi) that I am advised that his manuscript amendment is not strictly necessary because paragraphs 1 and 2 of the new schedule spell out the details adequately. However, since his amendment may make it little clearer to those who have to work the Act and understand it, I am prepared to accept the amendment. I am pleased to concede anything that makes legislation clearer, and for that reason I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<p>Thank you for that reminder, Mr. Speaker. I can assure you that I shall bear it in mind. We are thinking of little else in North-West Durham.<br/>
Let me deal with the point about hostels which is dealt with by paragraph (4) of the new schedule in Lords Amendment No. 77. The paragraph was inserted to make sure that the occupants of hostels were excluded from protection. The seven Government amendments to Amendment No. 77, remove paragraph 4 from the new schedule and transfer its effect into Clause 24.<br/>
Government Amendment No. 40 is a matter of drafting. Together, the Government amendments seek to achieve the same effect in a somewhat neater way. There is no watering down of the provisions. The right hon. Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) led me astray many times in the Standing Committee dealing with the reorganisation of local government. Nevertheless, I am grateful for his intervention today. He is an acknowledged expert on Rent Act legislation.<br/>
I must tell the hon. and learned Member for Royal Tunbridge Wells that the whole effect of the Lords amendment is to apply the relevant sections of the Rent Acts to agricultural licensees or tenants not now protected by the Rent Act legislation. It does not have any effect on those already protected by the Rent Acts.<br/>
I am grateful to hon. Member for their detailed submissions on this matter. The complexity of it is one of the reasons why we are now having the full Rent Act review. I hope that what I have said will commend itself to the House.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
There have been lengthy and interesting debates both here and in another place on the question of the qualifying period of work in agriculture. In the Lords in Committee two amendments were tabled, one by the Conservative Opposition calling for two years with one employer or four years in the industry, and the other by the Liberals calling for five years in the industry, of which one year must be for the current employer.<br/>
At that point, the Conservative Opposition said that they believed that their amendment was better than that set down by the Liberals, particularly in the case


of the farm worker who, having worked in the industry for many years, had difficulties with his last employer before completing 50 weeks with him and stood to lose his housing security. This is an important point to which I shall return later.<br/>
The right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) suggested that perhaps I had not taken sufficient interest in the Lords proceedings on these matters. I assure him that I have been extremely interested. Although I resented the wrecking amendment&#x2014;Lords Amendment No. 1&#x2014;I do not mean to imply that there were no interesting debates in the other place on this measure. Indeed, I made a point of witnessing the Lords debate on this issue because it seemed to me that it was likely to arouse further controversy in that place.<br/>
One matter which impressed me was the extent to which Lord Collison, a former General Secretary of the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers, was able to make some impact on a number of Conservative peers. The noble Lord made a number of distinguished and useful contributions to the debates derived from his long experience with the industry and his knowledge of farm workers. The telling point which he made was the position of the old farm worker who had worked for 40 or more years in the industry and who, in his sixties, had to move to another employment. I shall take an exceptional situation where perhaps his employer of long standing went bankrupt, so that the worker had to find another job. If he reached retirement age in less than 50 weeks after moving to a new farm, under the Liberal amendment, which was carried, he would have no protection whatsoever.<br/>
The purpose of this amendment is to make it harder for workers to qualify for housing security. The amendment would extend the qualifying period from two years in agriculture generally to four years in agriculture, one year of which must have been with the current employer. This means that a worker who had already fully qualified for housing security would, if he moved to another farm job and another cottage, be deprived of that security until he had completed

a further year's service with his new employer. The scope for abuse would be large, since a farmer could always sack a worker just before the qualifying period was completed. The amendment thus deprives workers of that sense of security which the Bill is designed to instil.<br/>
It is obviously fair that there should be a qualifying period of service for workers who are to benefit from the security of housing which the Bill's provisions would afford and to ensure that people do not see a brief spell of work in agriculture as a short cut to that security. We have decided on two years, taking account of consultations we have had with both sides of the industry. Two years is a reasonable period in which to prove one's bona fides. Two years is also the period suggested by the Association of District Councils, which is the body intimately concerned with the practicalities of rehousing agricultural workers.<br/>
I hope that I have explained the effect of the amendment sufficiently effectively to ensure that hon. Members who might be inclined to vote for it do so in full knowledge of its consequences. I shall not make any party capital out of this, but I know that there has been a difference of opinion&#x2014;thank goodness for it&#x2014;on some issues with regard to this measure between the Liberal Party in this place and the Liberal Party in the other place.<br/>
I should be very surprised if Liberal Members of this House were able to support this Liberal amendment. Indeed, I should like to think that Conservative Members might have second thoughts about supporting it. particularly as their own leader in the other place was genuinely impressed. I think, by the force of the argument which is based quite simply on the fact that it would make an absolute mockery of this issue if a worker had to have completed one year's service with his current or last employer in order to gain protection.<br/>
Therefore, I hope that Opposition Members will not feel inclined to press the amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1456.0" hansard_membership_id="6924" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/16703" speakername="Mr. Jopling" colnum="1456" time="">
<p>One thing that has pleased me so far in this short debate is that we have had a tone and attitude from the Parliamentary Secretary rather different from that which we had in our


first debate today. He has adopted a more reasonable attitude, which he had throughout the Committee stage.<br/>
The amendment brings us back to the original philosophic approach to the Bill, on the question whether there should be a qualifying period at all. It is as well to acknowledge that the Government, to give them credit, have always taken the view that there should be a qualifying period of some sort. That was set out in the consultative document. We certainly welcomed it. What the Parliamentary Secretary has not referred to is the fact that it is this matter of a qualifying period that has caused more disquiet and concern in the farming industry than any other single factor; with the exception of the implications of Clause 30, to which we shall be moving next.<br/>
I observe that some groups want a qualifying period of five years. They include organisations such as the National Farmers' Union. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will say that that is only to be expected. However, they include organisations such as the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers, which I think the hon. Gentleman will agree is a rather less political organisation, and the Milk Marketing Board, which I should have thought was a totally non-political organisation. All those bodies have been saying that there ought to be a five-year qualifying period.<br/>
At present the Bill says that the period should be two years. The amendment proposes a good and reasonable compromise of four years. It introduces a new element into the Bill, as the Parliamentary Secretary has said&#x2014;that to qualify, a worker must have done a year's service with one employer. However one drafts the Bill, there will be some hardship somewhere. I think that we all recognise that one has to draw arbitrary lines.<br/>
9.45 p.m.<br/>
We welcome the introduction of a condition that in order to qualify a worker must have worked for a certain period with his present employer. Otherwise, if a farm worker has completed his qualifying period in agriculture, whether it be two, four or even five years, there will be a temptation for him to move, perhaps to a better house than the one he has and perhaps one close to some work he wants to take up outside agricul-

ture. It is that type of attitude which I think, all of us are intent on not assisting.<br/>
Therefore, to introduce a condition that there must be a period of service with the existing employer is good. I think that it will tend to cut out the temptation for a farm worker merely to take on a job because the house happens to be a good one and near to some non-agricultural employment which he may wish to take up.<br/>
Second, to give a longer period of qualification, increased from two years to four, would give added protection to the farming industry against a certain minority. Before the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) leaps to her feet and jumps down my throat-she can do both at the same time&#x2014;to tell me that there are very few farm workers who take that attitude, let me say that I accept at once that there are few who would abuse the system in the way that I have suggested. At the same time, however, it is right for the industry to ask to be better protected against that minority. Therefore, I hope that the Government will think again about this amendment and agree to the extension of the qualifying period from two years to four.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary said that the Leader of the Opposition in another place was somewhat sympathetic to the point of view put from the Government Benches, but I think I am right in saying that in the end he voted for the amendment.<br/>
I turn now, as I have done twice before this evening, to hon. Members on the Liberal Bench. I hope that in our support for this amendment we shall have the pleasure of their company in the Lobby. This was a Liberal amendment, and there were 11 Liberal peers who came to support it. I hope that with the support of the Liberal Members, which I trust we shall have, we shall be able to press the amendment and carry it against the wishes of the Government. But, who knows?&#x2014;they may have changed their minds in the meantime.</p>

<p>Over a year ago I held many discussions with farming representatives in my constituency, including a day-long seminar. But because of the way in which


the Bill was handled, and because I was not on the Standing Committee, as I was then on another Committee considering another Bill, I have not until now been able to express any of the views held by the farming community in Norfolk on the provisions of the Bill.<br/>
I confirm what my hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) said about the two issues which are continuing to bother farmers. One is the qualifying period and the other is the need to put a statutory obligation on local authorities. We shall come to the latter in a moment, but I think that the two are closely connected.<br/>
One of the worries of local authorities is that if a statutory obligation is placed upon them there may be heavy demands at various times upon their housing accommodation. There is, therefore, the need to remove the non-genuine cases among people who happen to be in farm cottages at the time and to get down to the proper core. That is what the Lords amendment does. Therefore, I believe that the two matters go closely together.<br/>
I have read all the debates in the House of Lords, and it seemed to me that, although the leader of the Conservative Opposition there took note of the points made, he still stuck to his guns, regarding the amendment as important to the farming community.<br/>
I believe we all agree that this is a matter of striking the right balance&#x2014;protecting local authorities from queue-jumping and from people who come into rural areas and perhaps use the clauses of the Bill in order to jump the queue into a council house, while at the same time protecting the farmer against someone coming in with no intention of working on his farm.<br/>
The Minister said that the amendment would make an absolute mockery of the Bill. That is putting it too strongly. We are simply trying to get the right balance. On the whole the four-year clause, and particularly the one-year clause, gives a more reasonable protection without in any way hampering or restricting the rights of the genuine cases among farm workers. Indeed, many farmers would like to have seen either a five-year or three-year clause, but I am sure they will be happy to settle for this compromise as being a reasonable one.<br/>
Twelve months is not a long time for any person to earn his rights under the Bill. It protects the farmer from the situation where someone comes to his farm not with any intention of working there but because it is an area to which he wishes to go or because it is better accommodation, and he works there only a month to have the protection under the Bill granted to him, while the farmer finds himself in extreme difficulty. Twelve months is not too long to earn the rights under the Bill for full protection to be applied to the farm worker.<br/>
The Minister gave one example perhaps to justify his claim that the amendment made an absolute mockery. That was an example of someone who had worked in agriculture all his life and who in the year of his retirement had moved somewhere else. That is no doubt an accurate example, but I believe that it would apply to very few cases. The question that the House must consider is whether on balance one should agree with the Minister and deal with the extreme case of the farm worker who has spent 40 years in the industry and has to move at the last minute, or whether it is right to put in a few extra protections for the farmer to deal with the equally dangerous situation of a farm worker going in with no intention of working for him in order to gain accommodation on which he has set his eye.<br/>
It seems to me that the amendment would afford a reasonable balance. It does not in any way affect the objectives or ultimate purpose of the Bill. It gives the protection that the farming community feels is necessary. I am bound to say that the misgivings and fears in the farming community about the two-year protection are still very strong. A great deal of benefit would be gained by the Minister if, even at this late stage, he accepted the amendment which the Lords carried.</p>

<p>Amendment No. 78 is a Liberal amendment. It gives me great pleasure to support it. The Lords have been constructive in their approach to change the qualifying period. The amendment seeks to change the qualifying period from two years to four years, with the stipulation that the last year must be in the employment of the farmer who owns the house in respect of which the worker seeks security of tenure.<br/>
The two-year period at present provided in the Bill is felt by many organisations, including the NFU and the Farmers' Union of Wales, to be too short. Many organisations have argued in favour of a period of five years, others for eight years and others for 10 years.<br/>
I am delighted that the Conservative Opposition are agreeing with the Liberals about a change and that they will support us in the Division Lobby. I was delighted to hear the views of the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling).<br/>
In my view, and in the view of many others, a period of two years is too short to prevent the Bill's being used as a short cut to a council house or a stautory tenancy. Many people would be prepared to work for two years in agriculture if it meant that they could be sure of a house at the end of that period. Having established the right to a house, they could then do what they had intended to do&#x2014;take a job in the nearest town. It seems simpler to have a minimum period for the industry, as the Bill provides. Unfortunately, it is too short. It gives me great pleasure to support the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>I support the argument for the longer qualifying period. Any employer considering two candidates for a job will, if he thinks the qualifying period is too short, seek to minimise the risk by choosing an older man, who is mature, whose character is formed, and whose family is established, in preference to a younger man. We are beginning to see this happening under the Employment Protection Act, which provides a much shorter qualifying period.<br/>
In the countryside we need more young people who will create families and add to the community. Many rural areas in</p>

<p>I do not know whether Conservative Members really believe that just to get a house anyone would work for two years in an industry which pays the kind of wages that agriculture does. It is ludicrous to say so. I agree with the hon. Member for Kidderminster (Mr. Bulmer) that we need more young people. I said earlier that there is an aging labour force in agriculture. The way to get more young people is to pay them a decent rate, since they are among the most skilled workers in the country. The answer is not a qualifying period of four years.</p>

I hope that the Minister will remember what he said about the hon. Member for Cardigan (Mr. Howells) half an hour ago. He said then the hon.

<p>We now come to that area of the Bill which, above all others, has proved controversial. These amendments have served to prolong the controversy in a way that I regard as singularly dogmatic.<br/>
The rehousing duty for local authorities proposed in the Bill as it left the House was a strong duty. It was abundantly clear that local authorities were in no doubt on this point. The replacement by Amendment No. 46 of the phrase which enjoined local authorities to "use their best endeavours", a phrase we have heard a great deal in past months, with a phrase purporting to lay on them a straightforward duty stems from the misconception that the new wording adds a legal force that was previously lacking.


It ignores the fact that the original obligation placed on local authorities unambiguously required them to do their utmost, and recognised that more than their utmost was not feasible.<br/>
If Amendment No. 46 is misconceived, its effect when taken together with Amendment No. 47 is irresponsible. I use the word "irresponsible" advisedly, because that is the very apt description used by the Association of District Councils, speaking for the housing authorities, which are to be responsible for carrying out the new duty. This is strong language from the association, but the strength of the language is warranted.<br/>
The other place has tried to remove from housing authorities a vital discretion to decide the priorities of housing allocation. Like many other hon. Members, I have been a member of a housing committee. The members of such committees have to make agonising decisions from time to time. There are no blueprints that anyone can supply that will automatically guide a housing committee that is faced with a choice of priorities. The amendment would attempt to give absolute instructions to housing authorities that have vial decisions to make. The result would be that automatic overriding priority would be given to applications from farmers that were valid under the criteria set out in Clause 29 irrespective of other claimants beyond agriculture, irrespective of the housing authority's resources and irrespective even of whether the application was urgent in agricultural terms. That would represent a totally unjustified intrusion into the responsibilities of the elected representatives who sit on local housing authorities. It would inevitably lead to distortion in that those who would suffer would be those in desperate need of rehousing.<br/>
I suspect that in their heart of hearts their Lordships realise that this place cannot possibly accept either the letter or the spirit of the amendments. I am sure that many hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber with day-to-day experience of working on housing committees will know that the amendment is not acceptable given the relationship that we now have with local government. If they apply their minds coolly to the clause as it reached them, their Lordships should be able to see that without their amend-

ments the Bill offers to farmers provisions from which they stand to benefit a great deal. If I may say so, they stand to benefit a great deal more in many instances than is their position under the present system. I trust that the House will return the message in no uncertain terms to another place that the amendments cannot be accepted.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1472.0" hansard_membership_id="679" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29378" speakername="Mr. Pym" colnum="1472" time="">
<p>I agree with the Minister that this is a highly controversial matter. It is one of the most controversial aspects of the Bill. It is all the more surprising, therefore, that there was no opportunity upon Report for the House to address itself to the matter. Had it not been for the belated but welcome acceptance of the amendment that I moved this afternoon, we should not have had an opportunity to discuss it now.<br/>
The clause involves not only agriculture but local authorities. I remind the House of the attitude that I have taken all the way through. One of the reasons for my thinking that the Bill is so fundamentally wrong is that I believe it to be fundamentally wrong for agriculture that farmers should be in a position of doubt and uncertainty about the future repossession of houses that go with farms, not knowing whether the man will be rehoused so that they can engage another man. That uncertainty is totally wrong for the industry.<br/>
I have always been at the forefront of those who argue, as the Minister has done, that it is equally wrong to put an absolute commitment upon the local authority to give complete and absolute priority so that farmers' doubts can be allayed. It seems to be the design of the Bill that produces such an impossible conundrum. That is one of its greatest weaknesses. Many of us feel that it is wrong to impose an absolute priority on the local authority, yet we do not feel that to leave the Bill as it stands is acceptable from the farmer's point of view.<br/>
What the Minister said in trying to reject their Lordships' amendment increased rather than diminished my anxiety. He said that when the Bill left the House local authorities already had imposed upon them a strong and real duty. They certainly had a duty to use their best endeavours, but what does that actually mean? What does it mean to


the farmer and the farm worker in real terms? No one has yet been able to answer that question.<br/>
The Minister went on to say that, if their Lordships' amendment were accepted, that would have removed a vital discretion on the part of housing authorities in allocating houses. If that vital discretion is removed, what does the phrase "best endeavours" mean? If the Lords amendment is rejected, local authorities retain that discretion in allocating houses. That is the fear and anxiety that now affect agriculture.<br/>
I believe that five amendments to the subsection, and certainly four in relation to the clause, should now be mentioned The two amendments with which we are now dealing place a duty to secure the provision of housing for farm workers displaced from their jobs. Amendment No. 48 deals with the special circumstances that arise when an advisory committee says that the freedom of a house for another worker is of such urgency that provision should be made by the local authority within a period of three months. That surely is a reasonable obligation to impose.<br/>
Amendment No. 86 refers to temporary accommodation, and the Government have tabled an amendment that will be helpful in that respect. Finally Amendment No. 49 deals with the position where, despite the duty imposed by Amendment No. 46, authorities are unable for any reason physically to provide a house. In those circumstances farmers would be entitled with no further argument to provide a mobile home without any requirements in planning terms, and that could overcome a difficulty in relation to a farmer's business. Therefore, in that general sense one must examine these five amendments together, although I appreciate that we are now dealing with two only.<br/>
On first reading of the amendments, one would think that certainly Amendment No. 46 imposed an absolute duty and that that was the end of the matter. But what they did in another place was not as severe, as positive or as definite as that. Their Lordships allowed for the fact that it could happen, through nobody's fault, that a local authority would be unable to provide alternative accommodation physically. That is why they inserted these other amendments.<br/>
We must examine Amendments Nos. 46 and 47 in that light.<br/>
I do not regard the way in which the Bill left the House as providing adequate protection for farmers. I have acknowledged that an absolute compelling duty almost to the point of turning somebody out is an unreasonable proposition from the local authority's point of view. But as the matter has returned from another place, taking these amendments together, there is a practical alternative which would give a greater degree of reassurance to the industry that houses would become available and that other arrangements would be made, particularly in circumstances when the advisory committee recommended that that was essential from the point of view of the needs of a particular farm.<br/>
In that sense, the House would be well advised to acept all these amendments from another place. I do not accept the impression gained by the Minister in relation to the debates in another place. I believe that there was a genuine search for a new position between the unsatisfactory "best endeavours" as we now know them, and the absolute obligation that at the other end of the scale no matter what happens. Their Lordships made an effort to introduce practical and sensible amendments to achieve that objective. I hope the House will support them.</p>

<p>I entirely agree with what my right hon. Friend the Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) has said in this matter. The duty has been expressed in these words:
<q>If I may turn to the question of the requirements to be met by the new duty&#x2014;and I emphasise that it is the duty placed upon local authorities&#x2014;this is the first time that in an Act of Parliament, as I hope it will be, a statutory duty has been put upon local authorities to rehouse any group."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 5th October 1976; Vol. 374, c. 1166.]</q>
The author of those words was saying that there should be a duty, even though it was the first time. Those are the words not of any Tory or Liberal but of Baroness Birk in stating what she conceived to be the duty, speaking on behalf of the Government. If we use her words as the test, the words which are contained in the Bill as it stands at the moment are quite inadequate. To use one's best endeavours to achieve something is not in any way an enforceable legal duty. I


know of no lawyer who would accept that it is an enforceable legal duty.<br/>
10.30 p.m.<br/>
The Minister will remember well that in Committee a number of us tried to find a way round this problem. I said then, and repeat now, that one cannot find the way round the problem, as my right hon. Friend said, just in one set of words in this particular paragraph. The right way to do it is to say that there is the duty imposed upon the local authority&#x2014;Baroness Birk in another place, indeed, adverted to this&#x2014;but at the same time to limit it by certain severe restrictions in the other clauses.<br/>
It seems to me that the other place&#x2014;much assisted, if I may say so, by a perusal of some of the debates which took place in the Committee stage here&#x2014;from its own very wide experience put forward the ideas which are contained now in its amendments. As has rightly been said, in doing so in particular it realised first of all that it would be necessary to have some machinery to decide on the appropriate cases.<br/>
I did not say before, and I do not argue now, that every single case where the person has been dispossessed provides an urgent case for the Agricultural Dwelling-house Advisory Committee, ADHAC, to provide the accommodation which is necessary for the newcomer&#x2014;the person, for example, who wants to leave and go elsewhere. It is right, therefore, that that duty should obtain first of all in the cases of real urgency, where a certificate of urgency has been granted.<br/>
As I see it, that is precisely what is laid down by Amendment No. 48&#x2014;that where ADHAC advises that suitable alternative accommodation ought to be provided as a matter of urgency, the authority must provide that within three months. Plainly it is right that it should provide it, surely, if it is an urgent case. Indeed, there is no one in the agricultural world&#x2014;not the agricultural workers or anybody&#x2014;who would not accept that that is reasonable.<br/>
Then it is said that a particular time limit should not be imposed. I will not argue that, because that really is within the province of the later amendment to which we shall be coming.<br/>
We are not asking for anything unreasonable. We are asking that notice be taken of the Lords, who have considered this matter from a practical angle, and have recommended that undue burdens should not be put on local authorities. Many hon. Members have served on local authorities, and no hon. Member would want to impose on the Association of District Councils an undue burden to provide housing which we know it will not be able to provide.<br/>
But if, as in this case, the burden is imposed for a very limited number of people who have service tenancies&#x2014;namely, agricultural workers&#x2014;this puts those people in a privileged position. The hon. Member for Sheffield, Bright-side (Miss Maynard), who has pressed this matter on behalf of her union, has introduced " Maynard's Mischief" into the Bill because she has managed to get a privileged position for a tiny minority of workers&#x2014;a position which the miners, the police, local authority servants and many school caretakers cannot get.<br/>
In cases of urgency there should be a specific duty imposed on local authorities, and this is what the Lords have aimed to do. In order that it should not be too great a duty it should be limited to cases of urgency. If the local authorities fail to do this within a period of three months, they may be driven to extreme measures to find temporary accommodation. The Government gave way on an amendment to enable us to run hostels with reasonable success without their being protected by the Rent Act. This is one of the benefits of Amendment No. 77. It is equally important that some form of temporary accommodation should otherwise be provided by way of hostels or caravans.<br/>
In trying to get through this very narrow position between the fact that one does not want to impose too onerous a burden on local authorities on the one hand and the fact that one wants to help the agriculturists on the other, one is left with the unfortunate thought that this Bill should have been brought in by the Ministry of Agriculture and not by the Department of the Environment. It is really an agricultural matter. Nevertheless, faced with these


difficulties we find that the balance preserved in the other place is a sensible one, and the Government would be wise to accept the amendments.</p>

<p>Running through the debate on these amendments is a platitudinous approach by Conservatives towards their colleagues in another place. The House of Lords has done much deliberately to wreck a succession of Bills, and the verdict on its behaviour has been given by this House. Conservative speakers have talked today about the impartiality of the House of Lords in this matter. They claim that Members of another place have no particular axe to grind. However, I suspect that many of them have a deep and vested interest in the farming industry. I wonder how many Members of another place, who sent these amendments back to us, have actually worked as agricultural labourers and been victims of the tied cottage system. I doubt if there is one.<br/>
It is not true to say, as the right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) implied, that this amendment, which makes it obligatory for local authorities to provide alternative accommodation, did not get enough mileage during the Bill's passage. He should examine the Committee proceedings. The clause occupied more time than any other. Every Opposition Member spoke on it, and it was because of the time taken by Opposition Members that I and my hon. Friends made our contributions brief. It is, therefore, futile to suggest that the debate has been hurried through with insufficient chance for hon. Members to speak.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Thanet, West (Mr. Rees-Davies) said, as was said so often in Committee, that my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) has had her way and is trying now to ram the Bill down the throat of the House on behalf of the members of her union. Successive Governments this century, Conservative, Liberal and Labour, have passed socially progressive Bills. This subject has been argued about for years. The topic has not arisen just because an engineering constituency in Sheffield adopted as its Labour candidate a lady from the agriculture industry. I remember as a boy hearing discussion of the iniquitous position of farm labourers who at that time

could be bundled out of their dwellings overnight and their furniture dumped in the country lanes so that the farmer could secure vacant possession. It is not my hon. Friend's Bill, it is the Government's Bill. The Government are fulfilling a manifesto commitment.<br/>
Let me turn to the point about the system being made mandatory on local authorities. The Opposition have put forward some strange arguments. The Bill could lead to increased public expenditure. Most of the local authorities which will be affected by the Bill are not those with vast numbers of houses. The overwhelming majority of council houses are situated around urban centres such as Greater London, Birmingham and the metropolitan counties and districts. We are not, therefore, concerned with authorities with vast numbers of council houses.<br/>
The Opposition frequently refer to the sale of council houses. The majority of such sales take place, I suspect, not in the inner city areas but in the desirable country areas. The stock of houses concerned with the effects of the Bill is, therefore, diminishing. In addition, public spending cuts are curtailing municipal house building programmes. I suspect that authorities in rural areas have been among the first to stop building council houses because they have no crying need for them.</p>

<p>It may be that they will be the only cases which will be referred to the local authority by the ADHAC. In Committee the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) said that ADHAC may make some unfair decisions. I should point out that, as farmers are part of the community in which they live, it is quite on the cards that some will be local councillors who will be appointed to the ADHAC and that they will be making recommendations. I am not concerned whether there are many or few cases. A fundamental principle is involved. As an ex-chairman of a large housing authority,


I know the awful decisions which sometimes have to be taken when deciding priorities.<br/>
If we accept the amendment, we are saying that any case recommended by the ADHAC should go to the top of the queue. We are recommending that it should be given priority over people who are seriously medically disadvantaged to whom priority should be given. My experience as chairman of one authority which had over 90,000 houses was that it could give help with immediate rehousing only to four-star cases. Those were people with medical conditions which I should not wish on anybody. They were the most tragic cases one could imagine. However we look at this situation, somebody would go to the top of the queue irrespective of the needs of others for housing.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Gentleman is arguing two ways. In his earlier contribution he said just the opposite. Indeed, he implied that if a park keeper, a teacher or a school caretaker were to retire or to have his employment terminated, he would have no protection. I should like to know of any large authority with any conscience about housing which has evicted a school caretaker on his retirement.<br/>
I have experience of cases, almost on the domino system, where a school caretaker who has been living in a very desirable bungalow in the grounds of a school has reached retirement age and should move on and that has created a sequence of vacancies. I also have experience of situations where the last or the second last man in the chain has come to my surgery and said "I cannot move to my job because the man who retired is very demanding in the type of accommodation that he wants and will not move ". Most local authorities bend over backwards to ensure that a man who retires or leaves his employment goes into accommodation which is acceptable to him. That is not the legal position, but that is how it works. People are not put on the streets and told to go somewhere.</p>

<p>I was not referring to that type of accommodation. The hon. and learned Gentleman, in his speech, specifically referred to school caretakers. Many such people are accommodated in local authority houses. We must deal with those who are particularly affected by this type of provision.<br/>
It will be extremely difficult to tell a local authority to rehouse a couple, for example, if the authority has only two-or three-bedroomed house available. Could it, in all justice, say "You could have a three-bedroomed house but a family lower down the road has been waiting for three or four years"&#x2014;or 10 years in some areas&#x2014;"and we are sorry but you will have to wait. The house is adequate to the size of your family but there is a couple that we have been instructed to rehouse"? It will not work.<br/>
When talking mainly about farm workers with small families and childless couples, we must remember that one of the biggest shortages at present&#x2014;the leeway has never been made up&#x2014;is in one-bedroomed and two-bedroomed accommodation. That is the present situation. We are trying to impose upon local authorities a mandatory responsibility to carry out something that would be physically impossible for them to carry out.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is standing the argument on its head. He has made his point on that. He is trying to open up the debate on the whole theme of the Bill and what it is about. We are now discussing an amendment to a clause. I prefer to relate my argument to that.<br/>
I could mention numerous cases in the argument in which it could be said "It is all right. No one can evict because we cannot find houses." However, the situation here is quite different.<br/>
If one tells a local authority that it must rehouse someone, in most cases it would be physically impossible for it to do so. I was the chairman of the national committee of the old AMC. In the main I have found that when this sort of request is made to local authorities, couched in terms of "strongest endeavours", they play the game and attempt to comply with it. No one could justifiably ask for more.<br/>
The Minister has referred to what the Association of District Councils says about the situation. That is the parent authority of those who will be most affected by the clause. It would be disastrous to try to impose upon it something that it could not possibly carry out.</p>

<p>By the Bill the Government are proposing to interfere in a doctrinal fashion in the rights of the owner of property, over both its use and occupation and its disposition. It does not lie within the mouths of Labour Members to say that after the Government have interfered in this way, the resulting unfairness and injustice must lie where it falls. Unless the amendment is adopted, it will lie with the owners of the property alone. Because of their particular position and our need for a thriving agricultural industry, that is manifestly unfair.<br/>
The mischief will be created by the Government. Therefore, it is perfectly logical and fair for the Government to say that government at lower level, local government, must attend to the unfairnesses and injustices that might result from the application of this policy.<br/>
This is a doctrinaire policy. If it is justified&#x2014;I do not say that all doctrinaire policies are unjustified&#x2014;it must follow that, it having been justified at Government level, at local government level we are entitled to say "Local government will have to clear up the mess that we have created because of this application of our view of these matters."<br/>
That point is completely overlooked by Labour Members. They are assuming that the unfairnesses and injustices that will result from the Bill's interference with owners' rights must rest with owners and that all the hardship, nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience and loss must be suffered by them. It is proposed that we should

impose this burden upon them, and yet it is within our power to say that there is an authority, the local authority, that can mitigate this nuisance and annoyance.<br/>
I can illustrate the utter unwisdom of both the Bill and the Government's approach to this amendment by reference to a case in my constituency. Although my constituency is in Greater London, I am fortunate in that it contains a good number of farms since it lies just north of the Kent boundary, on the periphery of London. We are experiencing the problems to which the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean) referred. Being on the periphery of an urban area, we have problems of accommodation, but they are not problems of accommodating agricultural workers.<br/>
Some five or six years ago, however, a local owner of property in my constituency was allowed to convert his dairy into living accommodation, subject to the planning condition imposed by the local authority&#x2014;one may say that it was rightly and properly imposed at that time&#x2014;that the property when converted to residential use should be occupied by an agricultural worker. At that time this was possible. The gentleman concerned, being wealthy enough to employ a certain number of staff, was able to engage someone who occupied the cottage and worked on the property as an agricultural worker.<br/>
The owner died two years ago, the family suffered financially as a consequence, and the widow was unable to maintain the property in the state in which it had hitherto been kept. As a result, she was not able to afford an agricultural worker any longer. Her son moved into the residential accommodation to which I have referred, and he happened to be a local councillor whose job was in London. The local authority was then obliged to serve an enforcement notice upon him saying that he was in occupation of a property restricted to occupation by agricultural workers, so that his occupation of it was illegal.<br/>
The son, as I have said, was a local councillor. What could he do about it?&#x2014;nothing, so it transpired. There was an appeal against the enforcement notice, which was turned down by the Minister. I raised the matter on the Adjournment in the House. The response was always "No"&#x2014;the property was reserved for an


agricultural worker and no one else could occupy it, even though the owner of the property could no longer afford to pay for an agricultural worker to live on the property. The outcome was that that person with his wife and two children had to move out, and the premises have been empty for the past two years, because there is no agricultural worker locally who wishes to occupy them.<br/>
That seems to me to be an excellent illustration of the nonsense which we create in tenancies, whether agricultural tenancies or tenancies involving just the ordinary relations between landlord and tenant. In the long run, interference of this kind leads to greater and greater confusion, I see the Minister for Housing and Construction shaking his head, but, unfortunately, that is the situation, and if only he and others would come to grips with it and start to make the whole range of legislation governing housing&#x2014;</p>

<p>I accept that, but it is a question of approach to these problems. The same attitude governs the approach to planning as governs the approach to housing generally and the problem of agricultural tenancies. If the Government insist upon intervening in this way by legislation imposing a rigid system upon the allocation and control of housing and its occupation, they will run up against these difficulties. Whether the rigid control be imposed through planning or through a Bill of this kind, the same difficulties will arise. It is up to the Minister to do something about it. Let him cease being so doctrinaire and think of ways by which he can help people rather than hinder them in this doctrinaire fashion.</p>

<p>I am opposed to the Lords amendment, which lays a mandatory duty on local authorities. I do not think I have always been of that view. At a certain time in my life I would have been in favour of laying mandatory duties on local authorities. That was when I

lived in Pickhill, where I knew the conditions in which people lived in tied cottages and the difficulties which attended people in getting decent homes. There was no sewerage scheme there, and a very limited amount of council house building.<br/>
If hon. Members opposite are saying that people in rural areas are in difficulties, I well appreciate that, but I would also point out that many of those areas are controlled not by the Labour Party but by the Conservative Party and farmers have held the reins of power. As things are at present, they are free to apply their own rules, and if they prefer to house people in this category they can give them a high priority, perhaps the highest.<br/>
If there is a lack of council dwellings in many rural areas, it is because the local authorities have not built houses over the years. I think of the situation at Pickhill where, when farm workers moved into the limited council accommodation and had security of tenure, they smartly got jobs elsewhere and worked for the county council, the railway or on local airfields. So the people who controlled the local authority said " We are not going to do that if they are going to move out of tied cottages into these houses built by the council and leave the industry".<br/>
People said to me at the time "Why not stand for the local council?" I did. I set the hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Sir T. Kitson) on his way to becoming a Member of Parliament. I am pleased to see the hon. Member for Westmorland (Mr. Jopling) in his place because he acted as agent for the hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks.</p>

<p>Yes. They shot me away home. I got very few votes.<br/>
The point I am making is that for that village there was the hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks, a farmer and he was on the council, while the councillor for the next village was a farmer also. That was Sinderby. The hon. Member for Westmorland was a councillor for Sinderby and the councillor for the next village of Howe was also a farmer, Mr. Greensit. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) was on the council as well, but she was in a small minority.<br/>
In such circumstances, if we are being realistic in discussing the problem, there


are various rural areas of the country where certainly no one could plead that farmers did not have a real say in housing policy, and there are huge areas where one could say that they controlled that policy. An hon. Member opposite intervened in a speech by one of my hon. Friends to ask whether this would produce more council houses. I would say that farmers and the Conservative Party have for years been in a position in the rural areas to do something about conditions there. My main plank was that there should be basic amenities like a sewerage system.</p>

<p>That is right. I hope they got the sanitation system, because without that they could not get housing. The hon. Member for Petersfield (Mr. Mates), who intervened so glibly, is right.<br/>
I have no time for the amendment. If I have changed my view about laying mandatory powers on local authorities if is not for that reason. My experience at that time would have led me to do something about it and give them advice. But the people wanted the discussion to be about policies, and that is what took place. I am a local government man. I have served on other authorities as well.</p>

<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman for giving way. I hope, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that you will temporarily turn deaf. The hon. Gentleman has made one or two remarks that are not quite accurate. During his first election campaign I was not the agent of my hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Sir T. Kitson). At the time the hon. Gentleman ran for the county council, and was defeated by 1,100 votes to 90. It was not against my hon. Friend, and I was not the agent.<br/>
The other point that I wanted to make clear was with regard to sewerage works. I must put the record straight. The hon. Gentleman will recall that when I was a member of that council I was instrumental in getting a sewerage scheme at Pickhill, in the village in which I lived and in all the other villages that the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>

<p>We are not departing so far out of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker, since this relates to the provision of housing. I am glad that the hon. Member for Westmorland was later converted, perhaps because of some of the work that I had done earlier.<br/>
It is pious nonsense to talk about the lack of council houses in those areas when hon. Gentlemen opposite, and farmers, had the power to do something about it. The hon. Member for Westmorland smiles, but I am sure he would agree that there is much cogency in that argument.<br/>
I certainly accept that local authorities should have power in housing, and that they must make up their minds about priorities. It would be wrong for us to intercede in that realm. Equally I believe that it is up to the people in those areas to do something about it, if they so wish. Perhaps our debate will give local authorities a stimulus to improve housing conditions in some of those areas, because it is the rural areas that have the worst conditions.<br/>
I would also refer to the availability of accommodation&#x2014;something that no one has mentioned so far. Everyone concedes that over the years there has been a vast depletion in the number of people engaged on the land. In my own area, it is possible to go into village after village and see empty houses which had formerly been tied cottages. Although there has been an outflow from the land, there are still workers in those areas in tied cottages.<br/>
But some of the shortages which have been referred to are not real. Some of the accommodation is old and has been flogged off to people who can pay exorbitant sums to buy a cottage in the countryside and who may have to spend a lot of money on those cottages.</p>

<p>That may be, but it is not part of my argument. This amendment deals with people working in agriculture, and the argument is that the farmer will be disadvantaged if he does not have a house to give to a worker. I am trying to put the matter into perspective from my experience. Many of these places are terrible; they have rising damp and lack the basic amenities.


The hon. Member for Peterfield talks glibly about these matters, but riding through all this problem is the conviction&#x2014;it would be better if Conservative Members had some experience of it&#x2014;that it is wrong to tie the roof over a man's head to the circumstances of his job.

<p>Like my hon. Friends, I regard this as a critical amendment. If it is not agreed to, the working of the Bill will have to be kept under review and perhaps a future Government will have to strengthen it along these lines.<br/>
I recognise the difficulties. It is interesting that the Association of District Councils should take the line the Minister described. But the Government must keep a proper balance between the concern of the local authorities and the legitimate fears of the farming community. Some of the speeches of Labour Members have done nothing to assuage those fears.<br/>
I found it difficult at times to follow what the hon. Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Dean) was talking about. At one point he seemed to suggest that it was unfair to impose this burden on local authorities because many could not carry it out. In that case, the fears of the farming community are well founded. Then, the hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest that there would not be too much difficulty in some cases, in which case the thing could be pushed a little further; this statutory obligation would meet the fears of the farming community.<br/>
On Third Reading in another place, the noble Lord who led for the Opposition, who comes from the area which I represent and therefore is concerned with the same sort of fears, summed this up when he said that the words "best endeavours" had "scared the life" out of the agricultural community. He said that once a local authority had said that,

after using its "best endeavours", it had been unable to rehouse someone, a vital house would be lost to a farmer for years.<br/>
My own Norfolk NFU says that it is still "totally dissatisfied" with this aspect of the Bill. Of course the proposed solutions are not ideal, but there will be a range of alternatives under later amendments open to local authorities. All we are doing is trying to make the Bill practical. If not ideal, it would at least be better than when it originally left this House.<br/>
It was a bit rich for the Minister to criticise the proposed statutory obligation on the ground that it meant that one section of the community would be given "overriding priority". Whose fault is that? This must be the fault of the Government who have introduced this legislation. They ought to recognise that and face up to the responsibilities inherent in their own legislation.<br/>
11.15 p.m.<br/>
I have been in touch with my two local district councils to ask how they feel they will be able to meet this "best endeavours" requirement. Their view&#x2014;as councils which have worked locally with the NFU and the farm workers' union&#x2014;is that they think they may be able to meet all the demands made in the Bill. But they stress the uncertainty and say that it is difficult to forecast the Bill's effect on numbers because it will create a new situation. They hope that the impact of the legislation will not be too great and that they will be able to satisfy the needs of the farming community in almost every case.<br/>
The crucial point is that they cannot give an absolute guarantee, and that is what is worrying farmers. This is not giving farmers confidence. All we are doing in the amendment is pushing local authorities a little further while giving farmers the real assurance they seek. That is a very strong argument in favour of this group of amendments.<br/>
Of course, there will be difficulties in rural areas. Hon. Members opposite have made play of the fact that this is because some local authorities in rural areas have not provided sufficient council housing. But in a very scattered rural area it is not an economic proposition to


have groups of council houses everywhere one might want them to be.<br/>
I hope that the Government and local authorities will recognise that there will be considerable need for flexibility in considering where alternative accommodation should be provided. In very big, scattered rural areas, it is not always possible to provide an ideal alternative in an ideal place.<br/>
If the Government are to impose this new obligation upon local authorities, they must provide the finance. It is typical of this Government to lay more obligations on others without providing the necessary resources. We suspect that the Secretary of State for the Environment, in the Rate Support Grant announcement next Monday, will make clear that there will be even fewer resources, in real terms, for local authorities next year.<br/>
We are talking about rural areas, and it has been the practice of this Government during the past two years to reduce the grant to rural areas in favour of others. The Government are imposing obligations upon local authorities but reducing the finance they provide to enable the authorities to carry them out. In this case it is even worse because not only are the Government refusing to provide extra resources but they are going further and asking the private sector to shoulder the burden if the local authorities cannot. The Government are squirming out of obligations that they ought to face.</p>

<p>There is a contradiction in that argument, because the hon. Gentleman is assuming that the housing situation is universal. The point about rural areas could be accepted by this side of the House, but the Opposition say that less should be spent on housing in the cities&#x2014;where there are tremendous housing problems and where even priority medical cases cannot be housed&#x2014;but that more should be spent on housing by rural local authorities. Can we be told exactly what the Opposition think about housing policy?</p>

<p>I am under pressure to be brief, but the point I am trying to make is that where the Government impose new obligations&#x2014;whether "best endeavours" or. statutory. obligations&#x2014;it

is fair to give the local authorities or industries upon which they are imposed the resources to carry them out. Unless this group of amendments is passed, most farmers will not build any more houses&#x2014;costs have spiralled enough already&#x2014;and they will also begin to get rid of their surplus housing. If farmers were given the reassurance contained in the amendment, that consequence would not necessarily follow.</p>

<p>The speech of the hon. Member for Norfolk, South (Mr. MacGregor) sounded like double dutch to me. For months now, we have been listening to the Opposition calling for public expenditure cuts. They cannot have it both ways by complaining when, as a result of the cuts, fewer houses are built in country areas.<br/>
We have been getting the old argument from the agricultural industry tonight. The industry has always asked for special consideration, but the Government are saying that they are not giving it that special consideration on this occasion.<br/>
The imposition of a mandatory duty on local authorities would be to tell them that they must face an open-ended commitment. Every time they rehoused a farm worker, his cottage could be relet and the whole procedure would start again. No one should expect local authorities to accept that situation, and hon. Members should remember that such an open-ended commitment would be at the expense of other people on the waiting lists.<br/>
I am opposed to dictating to local authorities in this way. I was once a member of a local authority, and I think that councils are best equipped to decide how their houses should be let.<br/>
I was perturbed by the remarks of hon. Members opposite on the need for flexibility and how farm workers might have to accept places which were not ideal. I hope that they are not suggesting that workers could be shunted off to a house miles away. The farm workers are not prepared to accept that sort of flexibility. They have had to put up with that sort of attitude for far too long.<br/>
Hon. Members have asked what will happen if a local authority is unable to meet a request for housing. If skilled farm workers were paid what they are worth, they would be able to buy their


own homes. Some hon. Members opposite have asked where the money is to come from. I remind them that in the 1950s, when the industry was raking in the money, the wonderful wages board was giving farm workers rises of 4, 6 and 8 bob a week. So do not let any hon. Member pretend that the money is not there for the industry to pay the rate for the job.<br/>
Listening to farmers and hon. Members opposite talking about burdens and inconveniences is rather like listening to the white man complaining what a burden coloured people are to him. Farmers can get rid of the burden if they pay the rate for the job.</p>

<p>I shall be brief because of the pressure of time. I wish that hon. Members opposite would agree among themselves their reasons for rejecting the amendment.<br/>
Hon. Members on the Government Back Benches seem to be under the impression that the phrase "best endeavours" means something less than a duty. They seem to have been sorely misled by their Front Bench, because in opening the debate the Minister said that he understood "best endeavours" to mean a strong duty and a clear duty. If the Minister finds himself constrained to use the word "duty" to describe the meaning of "best endeavours", "duty" should appear in the statute.<br/>
Support for the view that the Minister appears to be adopting is to be found in subsection (9):
<q>The authority shall not be obliged to provide suitable alternative accommodation if at the time when the accommodation becomes available".</q>
That assumes that there is something in the clause which obliges the authority to provide alternative accommodation&#x2014;in other words, a duty to do so. If "best endeavours" did not import that duty, subsection (9) would not have been phrased in that way. Therefore, what the Minister is telling us is that "best endeavours" means a duty to provide alternative accommodation. Anybody who has been speaking to the issue that it provides less than a duty has been misled.<br/>
If it is the Government's case that it means a duty to provide alternative

secure accommodation, there does not seem to be the slightest reason why the amendment is being opposed. If that is the Minister's case, he should say so and explain why all this time has been wasted, not only here but in Committee. Why is he allowing his hon. Friends to retain the impression that there is a completely different meaning of "best endeavours" to that which clearly the courts will consider when they come to interpret those words?</p>

<p>I intervene briefly in the debate for the first time because it appears to me that the amendment is the one on which the whole Bill turns. Its acceptance would remove most of the objections of the farming community to the Bill.<br/>
There are objections to the amendment because it is said that it would create problems for the local authorities. I cannot accept that, because in Northern Ireland, where the housing authorities have problems beside which any problem experienced on this side of the Irish Sea pales into insignificance, the authorities are capable of dealing with the matter and have dealt with many thousands of such cases over the past year. Intimidation, arson and murder have forced many people out of their homes, not only in city areas but in rural areas. They go on an emergency list and are normally rehoused, some within 24 hours. If that can be done in the circumstances of Northern Ireland, I can see no reason why the same sort of work cannot be done in the peaceful and settled conditions of the rest of the United Kingdom.<br/>
To say that councils and housing authorities cannot do it is to insult their ability, for it is being said that they are incapable of doing the job they were elected to do. If the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Miss Maynard) wants to see farm workers paid better, she should accept responsibility when people such as I in future demand a realignment of the green pound.</p>

<p>As one who has supported the Bill, I am a little worried about the local authorities' duty to rehouse. The Bill as it stands is totally inadequate in the crucial area of the local authorities' obligation to rehouse agricultural tenants who are no longer working on the land. In merely saying that the


local authorities must
<q>use their best endeavours to provide alternative accommodation,</q>
it leaves a large loophole for unsympathetic local authorities not to be rehouse former agricultural tenants. To me, the term is very vague.<br/>
Many local authorities will house ex-farm workers in any case, but the Bill should have such force as to put a legal obligation on all authorities to provide a council house for an agricultural worker if he is turned out of his tied cottage. As I said on Second Reading, the clause provides no method of appeal for the applicant to challenge the local authority's decision. If the Bill is to have any real effect, the clause must be strengthened to place on local authorities a statutory responsibility to provide accommodation if the local agricultural dwelling-house advisory committee decides that there is a proven case for rehousing on the ground of efficient agriculture.<br/>
11.30 p.m.<br/>
When I spoke on a previous occasion I emphasised that
<q>Local authorities should have a statutory obligation to rehouse anyone in the agricultural industry leaving a licensed or otherwise tied cottage."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 4th May 1976; Vol. 910, c. 1124.]</q>
I am sure that many right hon. and hon, Members will agree that if the Bill is to succeed special housing finance should be made available to housing authorities to eanble them to implement an urgent building programme to deal with increased housing needs created by these proposals.</p>

<p>The ground that has been covered this evening is somewhat familiar for those who served in Committee. Therefore, I shall not go over the ground at great length. Unfortunately, just as the matter was left in an unsatisfactory and unresolved state at the end of our deliberations in Committee, so it has been left this evening by the Minister. I do not think that we are much further forward.<br/>
The Minister, in inviting the House to reject the amendment, has put forward the proposition that "best endeavours" is the highest obligation that can be put upon local authorities short of an absolute duty. He then says that it would be irresponsible and calls in aid the advisory committees, to impose an absolute duty upon local authorities because they would

not have the means to discharge it. He says that "best endeavours" is the best way of using words that will arrive at the balance that he is trying to achieve.<br/>
The dilemma is caused through the Government bringing forward the Bill in the first place. They have created an impossible position for farmers, who are faced with cottages that they cannot get back. In the interests of efficient agriculture the Government concede that it is necessary to make alternative provision, and they have required the local authorities to make that provision. The local authorities say that they cannot make that provision. The advisory committees go further and say that it is irresponsible to impose an absolute duty upon them. They are saying that the do not want any duty at all. That is the message that came through to us loud and clear in Committee.<br/>
The Committees have gone further because they are in a worse position than when we were considering the matter in Committee as a result of the changes that have taken place in Government policy. Since Committee there has been a severe cutback in the housing programme. There will be 30,000 fewer new houses built next year. The Government have cut back resources to local authorities. The Government say that such resources as there are must be concentrated on areas of urban stress. If the resources are to be concentrated on those areas, where are the local authorities in the rural areas to get the money to make the provision that is necessary if the Act is to operate in the way that the Minister suggests? Money has been severely slashed back even in the area of local government advances for mortgage purposes. Therefore, local authorities will be in tremendous difficulty. It is doubted whether they will be able to accept any obligation under the Act and whether the Act will work in the way that the Minister suggests.<br/>
Let us examine the wording that the Minister says is so important&#x2014;namely, "best endeavours"&#x2014;as distinct from the words used by their Lordships in the amendment. That is the point that was taken up by my hon. Friend the Member for Burton (Mr. Lawrence). The Government will recall that we examined this matter in some detail in Committee, when we found that there were only six decided cases in the courts on the meaning of the wording "best endeavours". I do not


propose to take the House through those six cases, but the dilemma that local authorites and farmers alike will be in when trying to decide what "best endeavours" means is indicated by two cases, one which was decided in 1911&#x2014;namely, the Sheffield District Railway Company v. the Great Central Railway Company. The court decided in that case that "best endeavours" meant leaving no stone unturned. That is an extremely high duty indeed.<br/>
More recently, in 1952, in Terrell's case, the court decided that "best endeavours" means "an obligation to do what is reasonable in all the circumstances." That is a far cry from leaving no stone unturned. Therefore, when, in future, farmers and local authorities look at the Act and say "What are the local authorities required to do; what is their obligation? ", are they to take into account Sheffield's case or Terrell's case&#x2014;or do they go to law and bring more money into the pockets of the legal profession, until, eventually, the House of Lords, in its judicial capacity, decides what the words mean?<br/>
It is most unsatisfactory that uncertainty of that kind should be created, simply because the Government are seeking a way out of a dilemma that they have created for themselves, seeking to compromise the uncompromisable&#x2014;the conflict between the interests of agriculture and the difficulties that local authorities will have in discharging any obligation that the Government may give them without the resources to go with those obligations. Certainly, local authorities would be prepared to undertake any duty that this House imposed upon them, provided that the House also made available the resources. It is in that that the signal failure of the Government lies.<br/>
Their Lordships' wording is not uncertain to the extent that the hon. Member's wording is uncertain, because the wording that their Lordships follow is the wording of Section 39 of the Land Compensation Act 1973, which states that
<q>it shall be the duty of the relevant authority to secure</q>
that alternative accommodation is provided. It is the duty of the authority. That has been judicially decided also, because, in Hendy's case, which we also discussed in Committee, the Master of

the Rolls said that this imposes on the local authority a duty to do its best; that and no more. He also said that a local authority had an obligation to do what is reasonable in the circumstances. What the Minister is saying is that an absolute duty is no more than the kind of duty that he told the Committee, and this evening told the House, he is seeking to impose upon local authorities; namely, a duty to do what is reasonable and practical in the circumstances.<br/>
The Minister is using the wrong form of words, and I invite my right hon. and hon. Friends and Members of the minority parties to join us in opposing the Government in this case, because all they are succeeding in doing is to create such an area of uncertainty that neither the farming industry nor the local authorities will be satisfied with, or will derive any comfort from, the situation. Trouble will be caused all round, or, if not trouble, certainly litigation.</p>

<p>I should like to reply very briefly. There are two misconceptions that I want to deal with. The first is in relation to the attitude of the Opposition to local authorities. I must say that I was surprised and shocked tonight to hear their condemnation of local authorities, to the effect that they will evade their obligation under the Bill, because in their correspondence with hon. Members on the Government Benches here and in Committee local authorities have made it abundantly clear that they accept the obligation. Yet time after time Opposition speakers have suggested that district councils will not take the obligation seriously and will not rehouse workers.<br/>
The other misconception is that to give security of tenure to farm workers will cause much more movement in and out of cottages. I cannot see how it can be argued that to give farm workers more security of tenure will cause more movement.<br/>
I accept what was said about the farmers and their relationship with the workers. It is a very small minority of whom hon. Members have expressed themselves as being ashamed. Relationships are good. But we are anxious to give farm workers the same kind of security of tenure as most people in the country have been able to take for


granted for many years. We are not seeking to down the industry in any way.<br/>
I say at this Dispatch Box without fear of contradiction that I want farming to be attractive to young folk. I think that the relationship established over the years, where conditions of service are related to occupation of a dwelling-house, has reacted against the industry. I have talked to a great number of enlightened farmers who believe that the new system will work. But I am bound to say, as the right hon. Member for Cambridgeshire (Mr. Pym) said, that to impose not a general duty but a specific and compelling duty on local authorities to rehouse, whatever the priorities of the housing committee, is really not on.<br/>
We all recognise that no local authorities will ever have surplus houses waiting for somebody to occupy them, and that it would be quite wrong to pass legislation giving one section of the community an advantage over all others. If rationing is necessary, housing authorities must have discretion to decide priorities according to individual and local circumstances.<br/>
We are dealing here with a great human problem, and I was impressed that</p>

<p>in the debates in the House of Lords almost every one of the Opposition speakers who forced through these amendments began by saying that this was a problem which ought to be tackled, and that there were great human tragedies and so on because of the system as it now operates.</p>

<p>Trying to amend the system brings great difficulty&#x2014;I acknowledge that&#x2014;but to say that because it is difficult to get the right balance we should not have the Bill at all seems to me to be a denial of the job that we are supposed to be doing in this Parliament. Certainly we cannot brush aside the evictions which have taken place, or brush aside the number of times that people have had to be taken to court. Where there is inhumanity, something has to be done. The Government believe that they have the right balance, and that to accept the Lords amendments would destroy that balance. I therefore hope that the House will agree with the proposition I have made.</p>

As the House knows from its experience the other night, the strict interpretation of those words is that the motions to disagree should be moved and the Questions put on them one by one. That interpretation which I followed the other evening seems to have caused some concern and I have had representations from both sides of the House that the House would be willing to accept the moving together of consecutive sequences of motions to disagree provided that there is no wish in any quarter to divide on any of them.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The effect of the amendment is to remove any specific designation in the composition of the membership of the relevant body which is to be constituted to encourage common ownership and co-operative enterprises.<br/>
The composition of the relevant body was a matter of extensive debate both in this House and in the other place. I sense that the House is anxious to come to a decision on this, therefore I shall be brief. I stress that the relevant body ought to be widely representative and that it could not be so without trade union members within its membership. It could not be widely representative without trade union members, any more than it could be representative without the membership of persons experienced in common ownership and co-operative enterprises. Indeed, the two very much overlap.<br/>
I hope, in the light of what I have said, that when the time comes the Secretary of State will give careful consideration to the composition of any body which seeks to be recognised as the relevant body as designated in the Bill.<br/>
I have already referred to the fact that extensive debate has taken place both in this House and in the House of Lords in relation to the subject matter of the amendment. The amendment results from extensive consultations which have taken place in this House and in the other House. This is an agreed amendment which is acceptable to myself and to my co-sponsors. I recommend it to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1523.0" hansard_membership_id="2349" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21255" speakername="Mr. Norman Tebbit" colnum="1523" time="">
<p>I certainly think that the House would be wise to accept what the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins) has said, and to accept the wording of the amendment, which, as he said, was worked out as an agreed compromise in the other place.<br/>
The arguments have been well rehearsed many times before. It is quite late enough for us to have good reason not to go over them again in any detail. It is sufficient to say that many of us felt in both Houses that it was unwise that one particular group of persons should be specified in the law as being those who had to be present on this body.<br/>
Certainly it seemed odd to us that if the body were to be required to have representatives of trade unions on it&#x2014;and not just trade unionists but representatives of trade unions&#x2014;there should not also be a requirement that it should have on it 600 persons who were experienced in the running of common ownership firms.<br/>
We are well satisfied with the amendment as it is proposed, and I hope that there will be no attempt on the part of anybody on the Opposition Benches to argue against it, or, least of all, to vote against it, which would prejudice the further progress of the Bill at this stage.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1976-11-17a.1523.1" hansard_membership_id="3021" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11441" speakername="The Under-Secretary of State for Industry (Mr. Bob Cryer)" colnum="1523" time="">
<p>In this atmosphere of mutual accord and congratulation I shall delay the House only a moment or so and would not wish to disturb the even tenor of the hon. Member's remarks.<br/>
In accepting the amendment we in no way accepted the arguments put forward by the Opposition in this House and in another place. We feel that if the relevant body is to function efficiently, and workpeople's interests are to be properly represented, it should include a repre-

sentative of the trade unions among its membership.<br/>
However, my hon. Friend the Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins), who moved the acceptance so well, saw no reason to delay the Bill further by opposing the amendment, and since we very much want to see this important Private Member's Bill reach the statute book, the Government accept the amendment.<br/>
In assessing the suitability of the relevant body for the purposes of the Bill, the Secretary of State will no doubt have full regard to whether the membership of the body includes a representative of trade unions. Having said that, I hope that the House will accept the motion.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
This amendment seeks to meet a difficult point which had proved rather baffling to those involved in the Bill during the earlier stages. It has resulted from extensive consultation in both Houses and also with the Industrial Common Ownership movement. I record my thanks to ICOM for its invaluable help and advice given at all stages of the Bill, right from the initial drafting. I thank particularly the Chairman of ICOM, Mr. Roger Sawtell, and the organiser, Ms Manuela Sykes.<br/>
A feeling was shared by all hon. Members that common ownership enterprises should be given the widest freedom in deciding their own rules of membership within the lines laid down in the legal definition, which is one of the fundamental principles of the Bill. For this reason in page 2, line 37, the phrase
<q>other factors of any description</q>
was included. The difficulty of including that phrase and not restricting them in any way was that we found that the position was open to abuse, and it made


it possible for common ownership enterprises to apply restrictive qualifications on membership.<br/>
The amendment makes illegal discrimination on political or religious grounds. There is no reference to racial or sexual discrimination, because that was unnecessary, as that position is already covered in existing legislation. This is an agreed amendment resulting from widespread consultation. Its purpose is to preserve freedom without licence. Accordingly, I recommend it to the House.</p>

<p>It would be idle to pretend that I personally care for this aspect of the Bill. I care very little more for it now than I did when it left this House originally. My concern, expressed then and now, was not about the power given in this part of the Bill being abused by those who would use the measure. I think that is most unlikely. My worry throughout was that as this place is obsessed&#x2014;rightly perhaps&#x2014;with precedent, we should think very carefully before we legislate in any circumstances.<br/>
To include the power to exclude persons by factors of any description seems to me to be very bad legislation. Some time in the future some Parliamentary Secretary pushing through another piece of legislation about a quite different matter could find these words used in his legislation and could quote the precedent of this Bill, passed with the approval of both Houses. So we were extremely unhappy about the matter. I am still unhappy about the compromise amendment. I accept that it has been extremely difficult to find a suitable turn of phrase. I would have preferred the expression
<q>or other factors of any description</q>
to be removed from the Bill.<br/>
I do not want to stop the Bill becoming law at this stage by attempting to insist that what I regard as an unsatisfactory wording should be removed.<br/>
To stop the Bill now would be to rob the hon. Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins) of the well-justified triumph of seeing the Bill reach the statute book. It has not had an easy passage and at times I think that the hon. Member almost

despaired of it. There have been moments when some of us thought that perhaps it was being assisted by the Government&#x2014;not unfairly, but certainly in a way which could have been extended to other Bills of similar merit.<br/>
For all that, the Bill looks as though it will reach the statute book. I believe that it will do good by encouraging the concept of men and women owning and controlling their own commercial enterprises, and that must be good for the economy and for society. I congratulate the hon. Member and I wish the Bill and the common ownership movement well.</p>

<p>I should like the House to support the amendment. I can assure the hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit) that it is very difficult to legislate and to produce a form of words which allows a degree of flexibility while excluding the possibility of that flexibility being used in an undesirable way. This may not be the perfect formulation of words, but at least an attempt has been made to retain a degree of flexibility while providing adequate safeguards to prevent abuse. Hopefully we think that the amendment will work. It represents an improvement in the Bill and we are looking forward to seeing the Bill on the statute book.<br/>
I shall take this last opportunity to offer the congratulations of the Government to my hon. Friend the Member for Consett (Mr. Watkins). I hope that the Bill will go a little way towards achieving an objective in which we in the Labour Party have always believed. Working people have a great deal more to contribute to the ownership, means, distribution and exchange of production than has been the case in our society in many respects.<br/>
We believe that there is a well of talent and good will among working people that can in large part be met by a different form of organisation from that which governs our society now. We hope that industrial common ownership and co-operative enterprises will draw on this well of creative ability and good will in working people and that the Bill will be a small step towards an ever-fast developing movement.</p>

<p>This debate for which I have asked concerns the move to Glasgow of 360 trained cartographers and other experts from their purpose-built headquarters at Tolworth in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Surbiton (Sir N. Fisher). I should say at the outset that a good many of my hon. Friends have said that they would have wished to take part in the debate if there had been time, but, unfortunately, we are confined to half an hour.<br/>
It is, I think, the unanimous opinion of all those who work at Tolworth that they do not want to make this move, but they do not take that view for personal or family reasons. Their real fear is for the future of the Directorate of Overseas Surveys itself and whether it will survive. The move is all part of the 1,000-post slice which the Ministry of Overseas Development must move from the London area up to Glasgow, upon the orders of the Government. The object of the exercise, according to the Hardman Report, is to take more jobs from the Londcn area to areas of high unemploy-

ment, and also to take advantage of the lower cost of office space in those areas outside London. In this case neither of those objectives is fulfilled.<br/>
The job of the members of the staff of the Directorate of Overseas Surveys is as follows. They play a small but important part in the aid programme to the Third World. When countries of the Third World are planning the development of resources, such development can be held up entirely through a lack of medium-scale maps. There is, therefore, a spin-off here in that trade is apt to follow the map rather than the flag. Immediately one has a map of an area, all sorts of other experts are needed to give advice. The service is therefore of importance to this country.<br/>
I believe that the staff who work at Tolworth do it virtually as a vocation. They are not particularly highly paid, and there is very little chance of promotion. All they want to do is perform their job efficiently and get on with it in peace. Their present location at Tolworth is convenient for purposes of liaison. To begin with, they are near the Ministry, which is an advantage. They are reasonably near their printers at Southampton, the Ordnance Survey printers. They are near the Land Resources Division of the Ministry of Overseas Development, which is shortly to move to Basingstoke, and they are not far from the Hydrographic Survey office at Taunton, as well as being close to the mapping and charting establishment at Feltham.<br/>
The equipment used is extremely sensitive and sophisticated and there will be great difficulty in moving this equipment up to Scoltand. It will be an expensive process&#x2014;about &#x00A3;30,000 for the most sophisticated equipment, the stereo plotters&#x2014;and experts will be required to come from abroad to relocate these machines and calibrate them. Moreover, it will entail the demolition of buildings in order to get them out. There is also a highly organised library of about 2 million photographs and 100,000 maps.<br/>
The Hardman criteria for the movement of Government work out of London were really concerned with clerical grades, the principal idea being that there would be jobs in the clerical grades. Hardman did not concern himself with the more expert people in the Government service he saw the gain in respect of


clerical staff. But among the staff at Tolworth the clerical grades account for only 12 per cent., and there are 88 per cent. of specialists or senior adiministrators. Therefore, the proposed move does not really fall within the criteria.<br/>
In addition to this, it is expected that only five new trainees a year will be taken on in the new location. That is the total increase in jobs, and it will cost some &#x00A3;8,000 over four years to train cartographers who at present are recruited nationally from all over the country simply because of the difficulty of finding these people in one location.<br/>
Therefore, one wonders how this training will take place. Possibly 100 people will not find themselves able to move and will have to be replaced. How are these people to be trained? Where will they come from? Will the Directorate be split in order to perform this task? These questions have not been answered.<br/>
Then there is the question of the costs It has been estimated&#x2014;I think that this was in a ministerial reply&#x2014;that the capital cost of the move will be &#x00A3;2&#x00BD; million. Perhaps the Minister will say whether the overall cost is far short of &#x00A3;5 million, which seems to me to be a very large sum of money to spend for no gain in any direction at all, either in jobs in an area of high employment or in increased efficiency.<br/>
Then there are the costs of the severe loss in mapping production which the period of the move will entail, before, during and after the move, and the loss in contracts. It is expected that this will take five years to make up. Then one must count the cost in human terms in the dislocation from homes, families and so on. The ultimate cost is likely to be very great. It is no exaggeration to say that it could mean the destruction of the DOS through loss of output and loss of trained staff.<br/>
Set in the context of the present economic crisis and the inevitable cuts in public expenditure, this proposal seems to be bureaucracy gone mad. If there were a political advantage of some sort, one could understand it. But there is no political advantage because there is likely to be no increase in jobs in the Glasgow area. In fact, the families of the people moving up there, working wives and

working teenage children, will be requiring and demanding jobs.<br/>
I am not blaming the Minister. I do not envy him in his task. However, he has a very good case to take to the Cabinet, and let us hope that common sense prevails.</p>

<p>I am most grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Mather) for allowing me some of his time.<br/>
The Directorate of Overseas Surveys is situated in my constituency and most of its home-based staff of 320 people are my constituents. I have met two deputations of them&#x2014;I also discussed the matter some time ago with the then Parliamentary Secretary&#x2014;and I am very much impressed with the arguments they advanced, as I believe the Minister has been impressed, although I do not want to put words into his mouth.<br/>
I have a file of 116 letters on this issue from constituents&#x2014;115 of them against the move, and one, from a Scotsman, in favour of the move.<br/>
I understand the general Government policy of dispersal, but this really is an exceptional case and policy should never be so rigid that it cannot make exceptions where they are justified.<br/>
As my hon. Friend has said, this is a specialist unit, 88 per cent. of the staff being specialists recruited nationally who could not be replaced by unemployed people in Glasgow without a four-year specialist training course at a cost of about &#x00A3;8,000 each. At least 100 of the present staff, I would think, will have to go to Glasgow, whether they like it or not, in order to train the new recruits and to do whatever work it is possible to do, although I should have thought, as my hon. Friend indicated, that the map-making side of things will suffer and that that aspect of our aid programme will suffer by the move.<br/>
If to avoid that disadvantage the Ministry were able to persuade a larger number of the present staff to go to Glasgow, very little new employment would be created in the Glasgow area and there would be no benefit to anyone.<br/>
The expense of the move is not confined to the training of new staff. Moving


a specialist unit of this kind is not just a question of desks and files. As my hon. Friend pointed out, it is difficult and costly to move specialist high precision equipment.<br/>
The accommodation provided at Tolworth is purpose-built. Similar accommodation would presumably have to be built again at some expense in the Glasgow area. The present premises would no doubt revert to the local authority which would have to convert them back to ordinary office use.<br/>
I understand that, for up to three years, the Tolworth staff would be eligible for travelling expenses home at the weekends &#x2014;a further cost of &#x00A3;4,000 or &#x00A3;5,000 a week for 100 people. It is incredible that, at a time when the Government are or should be making drastic cuts in public expenditure, an expensive move of this kind should even be considered.<br/>
But these are the financial costs. But I am even more concerned with the human cost involved in this disruption of the home and family life of so many of my constituents. They are not just cogs in a machine.<br/>
The consequences of this move in human terms should also count very much in the scales against it. Many of these people have been at Tolworth for 20 years or more. All their friends are there. Their wives and children may be working to supplement the family income. If so&#x2014;I know of many cases where it is&#x2014;far from creating employment opportunities in the Glasgow area, extra people from the South&#x2014;wives and children&#x2014;may be looking for work which does not exist.<br/>
One of my constituents, recently married, faces the move to Glasgow while his wife, employed by the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, faces a move to Cumbria. That small family will be totally disrupted. If these specialist-trained people refuse to move, they will have to find less skilled work in the Surbiton area with a corresponding fall in the family income at a period of high inflation.<br/>
All in all, this move will cost the taxpayer considerable sums of money with virtually no benefit to anyone&#x2014;certainly not very much benefit to Glasgow&#x2014;and

with maximum loss to the happiness and personal lives of my constituents.<br/>
I am not blaming the Minister. I know where his sympathies lie, because I know his character. I have known him for a long time. I can only hope that the debate may serve to give him some aid in the representations which I understand he may be making to his Cabinet colleagues to try to secure an exception from general Government policy in favour of this small, efficient unit and those who work in it.</p>

<p>I, too, should like to express my appreciation to my hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Mather) for allowing me to make a brief contribution because I have constituents who are actively involved in this establishment at Tolworth. I hope that the Minister will, if possible, read the excellent study which I shall give him, prepared by Stephen Tucker of Shirley Way, Croydon, who works in the establishment and who, to that extent, puts the questions better than I can.<br/>
All I can say is that this might be an opportunity for one of my more distinguished constituents, if not the most distinguished&#x2014;the Minister&#x2014;to illustrate flexibility in Government at this last moment to allow my constituents to benefit alongside those of my hon. Friend the Member for Esher.</p>

<p>Like my hon. Friends the Members for Surbiton (Sir N. Fisher) and Croydon, Central (Mr. Moore), I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Esher (Mr. Mather) for allowing me to join their ranks and to point out that I have constituents who will be affected by the move. Surely, the Government should not take any deliberate actions which will seriously disadvantage those specialist staff who are employed at Tolworth.<br/>
I should like to concentrate on one particular point. The specialist staff at Tolworth are classified as mobile, as I understand it, a classification within Civil Service terminology which was assumed on behalf of many of them after they had joined their present employment. If they decide not to go to


Glasgow they will have to leave the service without the benefit of redundancy payments and they will also have to seek other employment&#x2014;a point which was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Surbiton&#x2014;employment in which they will not be able to utilise their specialist skills.<br/>
This puts them in a particular, not to say a special, case, because it is not as though they can just go somewhere nearby and seek similar employment. They are in a special category because of the nature of the service they provide. It is largely a governmental type of service which is not done in the private sector and they will not be able to go round the corner, metaphorically speaking, and find another job. They will be devoid of the advantages of redundancy and will not be able to get advantages similar to those they have in their present jobs. That puts them in a seriously disadvantaged position.</p>

<p>I should also like to make a contribution and to congratulate the hon. Member for Esher (Mr. Mather) who has raised this subject.<br/>
The whole question of job dispersal within the Civil Service is of extreme significance in Scotland. I should like to discuss some of the aspects of that question, but first let me say to some hon. Members opposite that we are quite civilised in Scotland. There is a general feeling, particularly in the West, that many people in the service feel that jobs should not be dispersed to Scotland on the basis that they fear losing the weighting allowances which they receive south of the border, and because they fear that they will not be able to understand us.<br/>
I must declare a constituency interest because in Cumbernauld New Town in my constituency we have been pressing this question for a long time. This is one job dispersal which will be important for us in Cumbernauld. It would be a Government centre in Scotland and on that hinges a lot of future development for much of the West of Scotland.<br/>
The dispersal of this Directorate would be a psychological boost to the whole of the West of Scotland. It has been regarded as a deprived area with many

problems and the psychological boost of having this directorate there would be very meaningful to the area. We have suffered emigration. People have left because there have not been the job opportunities and there has been little incentive for them to stay. There is high unemployment in the area, higher than in other constituencies about which hon. Members have spoken, and ancillary to that is the question of job dispersal to Scotland.<br/>
We hope that the Government will not be put off a policy of job dispersal to Scotland because of unemployment elsewhere. We ask them to remember the particular problems of the West of Scotland and to realise the great psychological boost which this move would provide for us in the West of Scotland. Too few jobs in the Civil Service have come to us and this is an opportunity for the Government to show that they care about the high level of unemployment in the West of Scotland.</p>

<p>This has been an interesting debate in which the arguments which the hon. Lady has just put and those of the first four sneakers illustrated the dilemma facing the Government in this decision.<br/>
I shall make one of those awful replies which say "On the one hand this and on the other that". It is the case for one-armed Ministers.<br/>
I saw the staff side of my Department, including representatives of the DOS, on 21st October. They made a very strong case to me. I said then that this matter would be further considered by my colleagues and myself. That consideration is continuing. It is not complete. I cannot, therefore, make a definitive reply to the House tonight.<br/>
I would agree with all those hon. Members who paid tribute to the work of DOS. It has made a unique contribution in the developing world in the last 30 years. It exists entirely in order to serve our technical co-operation programme with developing countries. It is financed entirely from the aid programme. In the last 30 years it has carried out the mapping of over 2 million square miles of territory in the developing world as well as undertaking a considerable training programme both in


Tolworth, where people have come from the developing world, and in the developing world, where staff from Tolworth have been seconded.<br/>
The case against moving DOS is in many respects a special one. Some of the arguments, with respect, made by the first four speakers were arguments which could be applied to many establishments which are due for dispersal&#x2014;the argument about convenience of location, cost and so on. But here there are certain special considerations.<br/>
I should like to underline two in particular. One is that the type of work in which these men and women are engaged is so specialised that for those who feel that for family reasons they cannot or do not choose to make the move to Scotland, there would not be comparable work available in the London area.<br/>
Meanwhile, if a substantial number do not choose to go to Scotland&#x2014;and the Staff Side estimates that perhaps half might decide not to go&#x2014;those who do go to Scotland will be so engaged in the work of training new recruits that the production of the unit could well be seriously affected. That is an important argument and one that I have clearly to acknowledge.<br/>
Another special reason is that the future life of the DOS itself is limited. A review of its future was carried out recently. I am glad to say that as a result of that review the Government were able to decide that it had a clear future for many years to come, but the size of the operation will diminish. We are talking of about 320 jobs to be transferred from Tolworth to the West of Scotland in 1980 or thereabouts. But the establishment will probably be reduced to about 220 during the 1980's and the whole operation will probably be phased out by the end of the century.<br/>
Therefore, a serious disadvantage from the Scottish point of view is that people trained in this work would not necessarily have the career prospects that they might expect in some other work. These are arguments which support the case for keeping DOS at Tolworth.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dunbartonshire, East (Mrs. Bain) properly drew attention to the case for dispersal. Those of us who see the difficulty of making the

transfer have to face up to the fact that we are in the classic situation of being in favour of dispersal in general but against a particular example.<br/>
The easiest thing for a departmental Minister to say to his colleagues is that their people should be dispersed but his should not. That is the difficult aspect of the whole thing. It was in July 1974 that the Government announced their dispersal proposals, broadly following the lines of the Hardman Report, and accepting the need to transfer some 30,000 Civil Service jobs out of London over a 10-year period to go mainly to the assisted areas. Those 30,000 jobs comprise people working in many situations where there are special arguments against making the move.<br/>
As one hon. Member recognised, there are other parts of the Ministry affected besides DOS and considerable practical difficulties are involved in moving them. If this had been a longer debate and if it had taken place at a more civilised hour, many hon. Members from assisted areas would have set out the case which the hon. Member for Dunbartonshire East outlined, perhaps at greater length, and would have made the case for saying not merely that more jobs are required for the assisted areas but that those areas should have a better share of jobs with a professional or technical content, white collar as well as blue collar jobs.<br/>
We have all said, have we not, from time to time, that the imbalance of job opportunities in the United Kingdom can be solved only by pretty drastic surgery within the Civil Service, the nationalised industries and the private sector so that fewer of these specialist jobs are available in London and more in other parts of the country? Therefore, if there is a reconsideration within Government&#x2014;there is a reconsideration of this point but I can make no announcement tonight&#x2014;it is against that background of the need for dispersal that any special case must be argued, and it is very difficult to argue such a special case. I repeat that the matter is being studied but that I cannot forecast the outcome.<br/>
It is reasonable to acknowledge, as I have acknowledged I think, that there are special reasons in the case of DOS which are peculiar to it. I certainly agree with those who say that we must be very


careful to see that this unique and valuable organisation is maintained and that nothing is done to destroy it. On the other hand, it is vital to recognise that the whole dispersal programme could be whittled down by a series of special cases and that we must balance one argument against another.</p>

<p>Can the Minister give any indication when he might reach a decision about the dispersal programme? It has been drawn to my attention in the last week that the process of trawling in terms of job dispersal is not to operate in Glasgow until 1984, which suggests that the Ministry of Defence project will be held back. Therefore, we are increasingly interested in Departments such as the Minister's in terms of what they will mean to the West of Scotland.</p>

<p>No, Sir. I cannot give an indication of that. As the hon. Lady has reminded the House, there are proposals for dispersing a large part of the Ministry of Defence to the Glasgow area. That is a much bigger operation numerically than that which we are dis-

cussing tonight. Inevitably, when the Government consider any one unit, they have to do so against the background of the total programme. I do not want to go beyond that. I must not be even more indiscreet than I usually am. Therefore, I cannot answer the question.<br/>
Clearly, everyone is entitled to have more precise information as early as possible&#x2014;certainly the staff of DOS and their families are entitled to a more definitive statement&#x2014;but the Government's policy as of tonight is the dispersal policy announced in July 1974. There is no alteration of that policy which I am authorised to announce. I hope that I have indicated to those who have raised the question that I recognise the special problems, that I have been going into them carefully and that I have been impressed by the staff side argument. But I cannot go beyond that. I shall inform the House and the staff and everyone concerned when I can give more information.</p>
