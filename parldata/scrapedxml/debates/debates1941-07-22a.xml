<p>His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom are fully alive to the importance of co-operation with the Dominions on all matters of publicity.

<p>No, Sir. The general licence to which the hon. Member refers suspends the quota limitation on the supply of certain kinds of clothing, the consumption of which is controlled by rationing.

<p>The arrangements for the deduction of Income Tax from pay of Army officers are based on the provisions of the Income Tax Act. Under that Act the tax is deductible from pay on issue, and in practice the liability for the year is collected in twelve approximately even monthly instalments ending in March. The instalments taken at the beginning of the tax year are provisionally based on tax tables which take into account the personal and family reliefs to which an officer is entitled. These tables are published for the information of the Army. When the individual income return of the officer has been examined and certified, the instalment is revised and he receives a notice of assessment which shows his actual net liability for the year. If any officer feels that the provisional deductions of tax are excessive, his case may be specially considered with a view to an appropriate adjustment.</p>

<p>The amount of petrol issued to motor-craft has been drastically rationed since the outbreak of the war, and the ration has recently been still

further reduced. The use of supplementary rations for daily long-distance journeys to London where other means of transport are available, or for pleasure purposes, is a contravention of the conditions under which supplementary rations are issued, and will be dealt with as such.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. It appears that two men who were employed in a filling process had a bomb returned to them after inspection as being under weight. To make up the deficiency in weight they put some water into the bomb without apparently realising how serious might be the consequence of such action. They pleaded guilty to an offence against Defence Regulation 2B and were both sentenced to three months' hard labour.</p>

This arrangement includes gardeners in private employment where the agricultural executive committee of the area certify that substitution by older men or women is impracticable.

<p>No, Sir. Because a Member or a Minister has made a statement in Secret Session he is naturally not precluded, if he thinks it right, from repeating that statement upon another occasion. He is barred only from referring to what was done in Secret Session or to statements made by other Ministers.

The underwriting and selling commission on the sale of American Viscose shares, which was &#x0024; 4,099,200, is 6.58 per cent. of the gross selling price.

<p>Arising out of that statement, is it not the case that we should all express our appreciation of the patience exercised by the Viceroy of India as a result of which it has been possible to carry out this enlargement of the Executive Council, and may I ask the Secretary of State for India what exactly would be the function of the National Defence Council?</p>

<p>I entirely agree with what my right hon. Friend has said about the infinite patience and tact which the Viceroy has exercised for many months to try and get together a team which will co-operate in the defence of India, and in the interests of India and ourselves in the common cause. We have now succeeded in getting together what I believe to be a most representative and powerful team. As regards the National Defence Council, it is an advisory body whose object is to keep the central Government of India, in its war effort, in the closest possible touch with the different Provinces and their Governments, and the Governments of the Indian States, and with industry, commerce and labour.</p>

<p>I should like, with permission, to make a statement regarding negotiations for a loan in the United States. I am glad to be able to inform the House that, with the approval of the President of the United States, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has authorised a loan to His Majesty's Government of 425,000,000 dollars and an Agreement was signed yesterday. The purpose of the loan is to provide this country with exchange to be used towards paying for war supplies contracted for prior to the enactment of the Lend-Lease Act. As collateral security for the loan, there will be pledged shares representing direct investments and certain marketable securities. There will be no change in the control or management of these direct investments, including British-owned insurance companies in the United States. The loan will bear interest at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum and mature in 15 years, provided that an extension for five years may at our option be made if two-thirds of the capital has been repaid at the end of 15 years. The full text of the announcement which is being made to-day in the United States will be circulated in the OFFICIAL REPORT. The terms of the Agreement are contained in a White Paper which will be available at once in the Vote Office.<br/>
I believe the House, with the terms of the Agreement before them, will agree with me that this represents a satisfactory arrangement and once again reflects the readiness of the United States Administration to extend their assistance to us. The execution of this Agreement will require legislation, since the Treasury will need to

retain special powers until the loan has been fully repaid, whereas the present Emergency Powers Act will in the ordinary course lapse before that date. The Government intend to ask the House to pass the necessary legislation as a matter of urgency. The text of the Bill will be available to-morrow, and my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister authorises me to say that it is proposed to ask the House to consider it and to pass it through all its stages on the fourth Sitting Day.</p>

<p>With the approval of the President, and at the request of the Federal Loan Administrator, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has to-day authorised a loan to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of 425,000,000 dollars. The loan is made under specific authority granted to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation by Congress in an Act approved by the President on10th June, 1941, for the purpose of providing the British with dollar exchange without having to sell their securities and investments at forced sale. They will be used by Great Britain to pay for war supplies in this country contracted for prior to enactment of the Lend-Lease Bill. The collateral includes securities of United States Corporations listed on the New York Stock Exchange having an aggregate value at present quoted prices of approximately 205,000,000 dollars, unlisted securities of United States Corporations estimated to be worth approximately 115,000,000 dollars and capital stock of 41 British-owned United States insurance companies estimated to have an aggregate


nett worth something over 180 million dollars. There will be no change in control or management of these direct investments including insurance companies. Their strong financial position and stability will continue unaffected.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1941-07-22a.801.0" colnum="801" time="">

Nett assets of these branches in this country represented by investments in the United States over and above reserves necessary to meet their policy obligations in this country is approximately 200,000,000 dollars, consisting largely of cash and United States Government securities. Collateral will be pledged to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank as in case of other loans made by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Interest and dividends on this collateral, together with earnings of United States branches of the 41 British insurance companies have averaged about 36,000,000 dollars a year for the past five years, all of which will be applied to payment of interest and principal of the loan.</p>

Funds will be available to the British as needed to meet their commitments at approximate rates of 100,000,000 dollars a month.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
This Bill is needed because, as the House will be aware, Part I of the War Damage Act, 1941, provides for payments in respect of damage to land, only if that damage occurs during the period which ends on 31st August this year. It was, of course, never the intention of the Government or of Parliament that no provision should be made in respect of damage occurring after that date. As I made clear when I introduced the original Bill, the risk period was designed in order to provide a basis for the payment of contributions and give Parliament an opportunity to review the matter and to determine what contributions might be required in respect of future damage when that period had expired.<br/>
The reasons which caused the Government to introduce the War Damages Scheme remain as cogent as ever, namely, to make full security provision against war damage to property and goods and to help to restore assets of vital importance to our national economy in which practically every section of the community has a considerable stake. While, however, for all these reasons it is essential that protection should continue to be given, the time is not yet ripe for that review by Parliament to which I have referred, and at some future date, probably in the Autumn, it will be necessary for Parliament to consider more comprehensive legislation relating to war damage. In the first place, the Act itself is long and complicated, and experience of its working may disclose points at which it needs amendment. I also have under consideration, as I explained to the House at the end of May, the legislation which will be needed to provide a scheme relating to war damage to public utility undertakings, but we are not yet in a position&#x2014; discussions are in fact now going on with the interests concerned&#x2014; to submit that more comprehensive legislation.<br/>
This Bill, therefore, makes provision for what is immediately essential, namely, to give protection in respect of damage occurring after 31st August next. The existing position is in no way changed, nor, of course, are the decisions to be taken by Parliament at a later stage with regard to contributions in any way prejudiced. All that the Bill does is to provide that payments under Part I of the War Damage Act may continue to be made, subject to the same terms and conditions as at present apply, in respect of damage to land which may occur during the period beginning at 1st September next and ending on 31st August, 1942. That is what is described as the second risk period. I have chosen that period because I think it is an appropriate one to take. It would be inconvenient to have too short a period, and, on the other hand, I have no doubt Parliament would not wish to commit itself too far ahead on so important a matter. I should, at the same time, explain that no similar provisions for extension of time are required in respect of the schemes for the insurance of goods against war damage covered by Part II of the Act and administered by the Board of Trade. My hon. Friends who followed the proceedings on the Act will remember that these schemes are not limited by the Act in point of time.<br/>
I had better say a few words about contributions. The position with regard to contributions, as laid down in Part I of the Act, is left unchanged. Contributions will remain payable as at present, and payable in respect of the risk period which is about to expire. The contributions to be payable in respect of the further risk period provided for in the Bill are left to Parliament to determine at a later stage. We shall be in a better position then, for obvious reasons, to see what the situation is in regard to contributions.<br/>
The provisions of the Bill are set out in a single and, I think, a simple Clause. The first Sub-section provides for the continuance of payments in respect of damage occurring during a further year, and the second reserves the question of contributions to be paid in respect of that year for future determination. The Schedule applies the same principles in detail to the relevant Sections of the War Damage Act. I hope the House will give


a friendly and speedy passage to this short but important Bill. It will, I know, be the unanimous determination of the House to carry on with the war damage scheme, and I would say, in conclusion, that this Measure, providing for further payments in respect of that scheme, offers further evidence, if such were needed, of our confidence in our capacity to withstand any assaults that the enemy may make upon us.</p>

<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in all the words that are necessary, has explained the provisions of this Bill. I say, straight away, that if we were living in ordinary times, I would consider&#x2014;and the light hon. Gentleman would probably agree with me&#x2014;that this was a most unsatisfactory proposal. I was born in, I will not say the expansive, but the secure Victorian era. A Bill of this kind, with its complete uncertainty, would have filled the Victorians with horror and dismay. First, we embarked upon an insurance Bill which was not really an insurance Bill at all, but a form of tax on owners of property in order to cover an absolutely unknown risk, and the State agreed to undertake at least half the risk and after that, to see what could be done. The present proposal is still more vague, because it extends the period for which benefit is paid, while not even going so far as to declare whether there is to be any further premium, or, if so, what the amount is to be. Therefore, judged by the ordinary standards of peace-time, I can hardly imagine a worse proposal than that to which the right hon. Gentleman invites us to give a Second Reading to-day. But we all know that we are living in very exceptional times. We cannot complain because the Government cannot form any estimate of the damage. We do not know in the least what the future nature of the war will be; we do not know how far damage will be inflicted, from the skies or otherwise, upon this country. We are living in a world which our fathers of the Victorian age could never have dreamed of as being possible. We have to face facts. When the Government told us in the spring that the insurance would run out on 31st August and that after that another Bill would be required, I confess I was very much surprised that they imagined that they would by that time have experience enough to enable them to bring in a

Bill covering the whole ground. They are bringing in an interim Bill, leaving everything uncertain except that damage will be covered for a further period. I think they are right in taking that course. While it is true that the whole thing is really left in the air, I think that the House will be well advised to give this interim Bill a Second Reading to-day.</p>

I am connected with a number of "institutions which have a large property interest, and, as the Chancellor will be the first to appreciate, the Bill leaves the situation, from a business point of view, in a very unsatisfactory state.</p>

<p>I know that there is a great deal of difficulty in getting consistency in these allowances. I want to refer to the effect that this will have upon blind people. I do not want to labour the point; but so complicated are the arrangements as they relate to the provision of assistance to blind people that in some circumstances blind people can actually suffer as a consequence of this provision. I do not want to do more than draw attention to the matter, in the hope that the Minister will turn his attention to it and see whether something can be done. It is logical that when people come before a public assistance committee their first 10s. 6d., instead of the first 7s. 6d., should be ignored. When we deal with blind people there is this strange situation, that they draw their incomes not from one, but from more than one, source. Consequently, a county council or county borough council which may be responsible for a scheme under the Blind Persons Act arrange, for instance, that the person shall have a maximum income. They make an allowance out of public funds to bring the income of the blind person up to a maximum of, say, 30s. a week. The Middlesex County Council, whose scheme is one of the best in the country, enables any blind person to have his income made up to a maximum of 27s. 6d. That has recently been increased. What is happening here is that, whereas previously we ignored 7s. 6d., we shall now ignore 10s., but it will not make a penny difference to the income of the blind person. If we should ignore the amount that could be drawn, then the local authority would really be putting the difference into its pocket, and the blind person would get no benefit. I am sure that if the Minister will give his attention to this matter, something may perhaps be done.<br/>
We are surely considering the position of the individual, and in considering the blind people, in whom I am very interested, we have this strange situation. They are not getting a grant from public funds merely because they are poor. Many of the people on public assistance


have throughout their lifetime earned money and have had some of the joys of life, but blind people do not have that opportunity. They are not merely poor. They are poor because they are blind, and therefore possibly it is not just a question of the exigencies of the moment or of the fluctuations which take place in industry. This thing is permanent in their lives. The solution would be to ensure these people a definite income from national sources, and it is because of the peculiar position of these people that I hope that some consideration may be given to their exceptional case and that something will be done.</p>

Although this Clause looks very large, it is a very simple matter, and I do not think it will keep the House occupied for more than a few minutes. Clause 2 gives power to the Statutory Committee to consider cases of misconduct or of conviction for a criminal offence where the pharmacy concerned is temporarily unregistered by reason of the non-payment of fees. The new Clause has been set down to extend the principle to corporate bodies carrying on a chemist's business. It brings them within the jurisdiction of the Statutory Committee for breaches committed while they are temporarily not carrying on business in accordance with the Pharmacy Acts. That is the main desire back of the Clause, and I hope that the House will be willing to accept it.</p>

<p>As my hon. and gallant Friend has pointed out in moving the Motion, Clause 2 incorporates certain extensions of the powers of the Statutory Committee which have been found to be desirable as the result of practical experience of the working of the Pharmacy Act, 1933. My hon. and gallant Friend's new Clause would make similar extensions in cases where corporate bodies are concerned, as Clause 2 does in the case where individuals are concerned. It is a useful Amendment, which, obviously, ought to have been incorporated in the Bill at an earlier stage, but the omission has been pointed out to us by the Pharmaceutical Society, and we accept the Clause.</p>

<li> (ii) in a case where the appropriate designation of each of the active constituents is written as aforesaid, the appropriate quantitative particulars of the constituents."</li></ol></q>
I will make a general statement on this Amendment, as it covers a long Amendment later on the same page. The House will remember that in all quarters two desires were expressed: first, that we should enlarge the scope of the definition by including quantities and, second, that so Jar as possible we should get the expression in popular language. I pointed out in the course of the Second Reading Debate that the English language, expressed in certain definitions, was not quite as clear as some technical headlines which were not supposed to be in the English language. The real desire of the House was to get it as clear as could be, and I have had a close look at this matter to see how far we could get disclosure expressed in everyday terms. This Amendment and the following Amendment are my propositions to the House. I am bound to say, however, that the more popular you tend to make an expression the more danger you are in of losing accuracy, and the House would not wish me to lose accuracy for popularity.<br/>
What I have done is to examine very thoroughly disclosure in everyday terms, and wherever a well-known term exists that name should be used. I have come to the conclusion that I must not make that disclosure in so vague and uncertain terms as to make it either less accurate than otherwise or less easily enforceable. I have fallen back on disclosure in terms which will be readily understood by a doctor, chemist or any other expert. Taken with the other Amendment this Amendment requires disclosure in one of the following ways: (1) Where a medicine or a constituent is a poison in the Poisons List the name to be used is that required in connection with the labelling of the poison; (2) Where it is not a poison but is described in the British Pharmacopeia or the British Pharmaceutical Codex the description at the head of the relevant monograph must be used; (3) Where it is neither a poison nor described in the British Pharma-

ceutical Codex, then the accepted scientific name or other name descriptive of its true nature must be used.<br/>
I think the House will agree that I have done my best to meet their desires in this matter. So far as quantitative disclosure is concerned the second part of this particular Amendment and the subsequent Amendment require the quantities of the named constituents to be disclosed either by giving the percentages in the medicine, or by stating the actual amounts. When a medicine is supplied in the form of pills and tablets disclosure may be made in one of three ways: (1) The percentage of the constituent in the medicine; (2) the quantity in each pill or tablet; or (3) the quantity of the constituent in the whole article. The effect of these Amendments, together is to require disclosure in English so that the explicit requirement to that effect is unnecessary.</p>

<p>So far as I can see, the Minister has made an honest attempt to meet not only my desire but the desires of others. What we are anxious to do, as far as possible, is to prevent people being defrauded, and in order to protect people it is essential that we must tell the public what is in their medicine. The description must be in terms that will be understood by the people. I accept the Minister's assurance that that point will be fully met when it can be met in the Amendments which he now proposes.</p>

<p>I do not want to do more than thank my right hon. Friend for having met us in other respects. I agree that as regards the description we have the same desire as the hon. Member for Llanelly (Mr. J. Griffiths). We want to stop fraud by having plain statements which cannot be got round by the extremely ingenious people who are sharks in this world. It must be something quite clear and definite, and for that purpose we must use scientific names. But they must be such scientific names as can be traced to their source. If the public are inquisitive and want to know what they are taking, they will no doubt be advised by doctors or chemists or through the Press. The Press has constantly been fulfilling this extremely useful function of interpreting technical phrases of any profession for the benefit of the general reader. We shall have to rely on them, as I know we can, to interpret these terms by referring to the


British Pharmacopoeia or the Codex, so in that way the public will get what they want and not be defrauded as in the past. The second point in the Amendment, is the provision requiring quantitative particulars. It is essential that not only should the description state what are the ingredients, but give the quantity of the ingredients, because otherwise a man who wished to defraud the public might include in the medicine an infinitesimal dose of some important ingredient and fill it up with unimportant ingredients. We were afraid that the proprietary trade might object to this quantitative statement, and I think it is to their credit that they met the Minister in this respect and agreed to the provision. I think this Amendment has the unique advantage of satisfying everybody, including me.</p>

<p>I do not think anybody fails to recognise the good intentions of my right hon.

I can quite understand that in the case of drugs, as was said by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Sir F. Fremantle), it is essential that the quantities of the ingredients should be stated, but the herbalists feel that if they have to state the quantities of the different ingredients of herbal preparations, they will be giving away their trade secrets to those who may be called their competitors. After all, the herbalists have built up their great popularity, which they deservedly have, over a long period of years, and they were practising long before druggists and chemists came into existence. They feel that it is now a matter of grave importance that my right hon. Friend should not overlook the fact that if the word "quantitative" is applied in the case of herbal preparations, it may have a very damaging effect on the herbalists' trade. I hope my right hon. Friend will find a way of meeting this point in another place.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 8, line 38, to leave out paragraph (<i>a</i>).<br/>
With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to discuss together this Amendment and the Amendment which I have on the Order Paper in page 9, line 27, at the end, to insert:
<q>(6) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act a person who carries on a legitimate practice of herbalism and the sale of herbal preparations may, subject to the provisions of Section six of this Act sell herbal preparations which are medicines within the meaning of this Act.</q>


The purpose of these Amendments is to prevent the Bill from stopping the business of herbalists. I make no apology for raising this matter again. I know that my right hon. Friend intends, as far as words can make his meaning clear, to safeguard the rights of herbalists, and I know that intention is shared by the Parliamentary Secretary. I have in my hand a copy&#x2014;I trust that my right hon. Friend also has one&#x2014;of the opinion of an eminent counsel as to the effect which this Clause will have on the position of herbalists. I will not quote the whole of the document, but only this remark:
<q>There is not the slightest foundation for any such suggestion "&#x2014;</q>
that is, the suggestion that anything in Clause 7 can affect herbalists. In view of that opinion, given by a very eminent counsel, which thus gives a legal backing for the contention I am advancing, surely my right hon. Friend will see to it that the Amendments I am moving are accepted, or will find some other method of wording the Clause which will put the position completely beyond doubt. Subsection (1) of the Clause prohibits any persons from selling medicines unless they are registered medical practitioners, registered dentists, authorised sellers of poisons, or chemists. This creates a further monopoly for the greatest monopolists in the country. The herbalists are convinced that under the Bill as it now is, any herbalist who continues to sell herbal preparations will be liable to prosecution. It is true that in Subsections (4) and (5) of the Clause, herbalists would be permitted to put up two defences, but I do not believe that these provisions, or the Amendment which my right hon. Friend has on the Order Paper to Sub-section 4 (<i>a</i>) are adequate. They provide no safeguard.<br/>
I should like to recall to my right hon. Friend, in support of my argument, that in the Second Reading debate, and again in Committee, both he and the Parliamentary Secretary said several times that they did not intend to prevent herbalists from carrying on the businesses they had formed, but I maintain that those intentions are inconsistent with the Bill as it now is. In the Second Reading debate my right hon. Friend said that there was no desire on the part of anyone to interfere with the legitimate practice of the legitimate herbalist. In reply to the hon.

Member for Ince (Mr. G. Macdonald) and myself, it was stated by the Parliamentary Secretary that there was no desire whatever to interfere with the genuine operations of genuine herbalists. Notwithstanding all those assurances, apparently herbalists will not be allowed to continue their businesses, as they feel they must continue if they are to be of service to the country and the invalid section of the community, which certainly they are today. It was for the purpose of giving my right hon. Friend an opportunity of giving effect to these various undertakings and promises that I put down these two Amendments. I ask him to accept the Amendments and allow herbalists who carry on legitimate businesses, as the majority of them do to-day, in the sale of herbal preparations, to continue doing so.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I do so, not because I have any special interest in herbalists, or, indeed, that I have any knowledge of the business they carry on, but because the Amendment seems to cover a difficulty which was put to me this morning. The difficulty arises in this way. I am informed by the Incorporated Society of Pharmacists and Drug Store Proprietors, whose registered office is in Leeds, that a number of people throughout the country, who have not been formally apprenticed, have been carrying on business for a number of years, either on their own account, or with others. For example, there is one man whose father was a qualified pharmacist in March, 1871, who died in November, 1925, after being in the business for 54 years. His son, who was born in1874, helped his father and eventually assisted in dispensing, but unfortunately was not formally apprenticed. Since his father's death that man has carried on the business in an unqualified capacity. He has been engaged in the business for 50 years or more. It seems to me that unless some Amendment is adopted, that man will have to close down his business which he has apparently carried on successfully without complaint for more than 50 years. I would remind the Minister that many of these businesses are carried on in the poorer parts of large cities and that they assist people who live in those areas.<br/>
I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me, assuming that a man has sold herbal preparations under these


circumstances, if the Amendment is accepted, whether he will be covered, and, if not, what will be his position. Under the Bill as it stands, will those businesses have to be closed down and the owners faced possibly with ruin? There are many professions where those who have carried on in an unqualified capacity have had some provision made to deal with their case, such as the legal profession, and so on. Therefore, it does not seem unreasonable that, subject to a certificate from the Minister's Department or elsewhere, in these extreme cases, those concerned should be permitted to retain their rights and privileges, instead of being deprived of their livelihood.</p>

<p>Before the Minister replies, may I ask him to make as plain a statement as is possible on the position of herbalists under this Bill, and to state whether this Amendment is necessary or not to protect the public. Since last we discussed this matter I have received an enormous amount of correspondence, including many letters from my constituents. I could quote to the Committee many of these authentic cases. I have made inquiries and I have found out that they are genuine letters, and, therefore, I must pay some attention to them. They nearly all follow the same line. The persons concerned state they have tried their doctor and have seen a specialist but have obtained no satisfaction until they have visited a herbalist. These people have probably been canvassed by the herbalists, who have told them that if this Bill passes they will be unable to continue to give their treatment. The Bill lays down certain conditions, and they are necessary conditions, but I think some clear and concise statement should be made on this subject. I have a letter from the Society of Herbalists. The Minister will remember that when we discussed this Bill last he said that he had met them and that they were entirely satisfied, but according to my letter they left completely unsatisfied with the Minister's explanation. Members must take notice of these letters, although it is our duty to see that no one is allowed to practise to the detriment of the public. In many ways there is a case for extending the provisions of this Bill. It has already been pointed out in a very interesting speech by the hon. Member for Cambridge University (Professor Hill) that

many of the practices about which he spoke will not be affected by this Measure. I appeal to the Minister to make a plain statement, so that there is no ambiguity and misunderstanding on the position of herbalists.</p>

<p>I will now try to make a plain statement. I should like to reassure hon. Members in all parts of the House that, as my right hon. Friend and I have stated over and over again, we have no desire to stop herbalists carrying on their work. We have also been asked about the position of faith healers, who are endeavouring to cure illnesses as they think best. There is nothing in this Bill to stop treatment of any sort or kind. The easiest way of dealing with this Amendment is to try and make the plainest statement on what can be done if this Bill becomes an Act. There is nothing in this Bill to prevent anyone treating anyone else for any illness.</p>

<p>I do not think this Bill will prevent any form of treatment. There is nothing to prevent herbalists or anyone else from making any mixture under a proprietary name and selling it under a proprietary name, so long as there is disclosure, as provided under Clause 6. My hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Ayr Burghs (Sir T. Moore), who moved this Amendment, quoted an expert opinion on Clause 7, but it did not refer to the whole of Clause 7. If these people had studied the whole of Clause 7, instead of dealing with only one part of it, a great deal of this difficulty might have been cleared up. If my hon. and gallant Friend looks at the Clause, he will see there is a Sub-section (5) as well as a Sub-section (4). One group of people for whom the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Ayr Burghs has put the case, who are selling a large number of proprietary medicines, know that the names of the contents must be disclosed. What can they do in future? They can, under Sub-section (4, <i>a</i>), sell this mixture of herbs. There is an Amendment on the Paper going further and including water as well, as some people seem to think that substance must be solid and not liquid, though I


am informed it is not so. Sub-section (4, <i>a</i>) in its amended form shows what herbalists can do in making simple preparations of herbs with water. They can continue to do that.<br/>
It may be said that under that simple preparation there cannot be distilling and various other things, but they can still make and sell preparations involving those processes under a proprietary name. What they can do under Sub-section (4, <i>a</i>) are the simple preparations which herbalists are doing without having a proprietary name. If they wish to go beyond that and come into the sphere which would not be that of simple herbal preparations, they can, but they must sell the preparation under a proprietary name, as the majority are doing now, and the preparation must not be one that is already in the British Pharmacopoeia. I think the difficulty has been that people have looked at Sub-section (4, <i>a)</i> and said, "We cannot distil and we cannot make this particular preparation," but they have not gone on and seen that under (5, <i>a)</i> they can do all those things and sell the result under a proprietary name, disclosing the contents. We have been very careful to go into this. I have asked these people to send me a single case showing what they could not do. When I have been told "distilling," my answer has been, "You can do that not under (4, <i>a</i>) but under (5, <i>a</i>). We can see no case at all." It was put to me again, '' Supposing a particular person had been treating and selling medicines for particular ailments, can be go on doing it? He can go on treating, and he can sell the medicine that he makes with these simple herbal remedies with water. He can go further and sell proprietary medicines if he discloses the contents. When I am told that a person who wishes to treat will be stopped because the medicine does not come under this, the answer is that the chemist can still make "it up. No treatment of any sort or kind is stopped as far as we can see.</p>

<p>Surely it is clear that even without the addition of water the processes mentioned in Sub-section (4, <i>a)</i> are limited &#x2014; there are only a few instead of a vast number of processes&#x2014; and also they are dry processes to produce a dry substance. My alteration makes it clear beyond doubt. If the result is the same, surely it will be better to remove the doubt which obviously still clings to herbalists.</p>

<p>I will try to make it plain. If it is an ordinary, simple, herbal remedy it will come within Sub-section (4, <i>a</i>) If people want to go further, they can do so under (5, <i>a</i>) using a proprietary name. That is the simplest explanation that I can give. The two things must be taken together. I hope I have put hon. Members' minds at ease by that explanation. I do not think there is any difference as far as the people to whom the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for South-East Leeds(Major Milner) referred are concerned. They all have the same rights and can sell proprietary medicines-under a proprietary name with disclosure. I know that a good many people think they are being put out of business, but I do not think they are being put out of business at all.</p>

<p>I beg to move in page 8, line 39, to leave out "but not subjecting to," and to insert "or."<br/>
I move this Amendment in order to get some explanation from the Minister. Under Sub-section (5, <i>a</i>), according to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement, herbalists can go much further than they can go under Sub-section (4, <i>a</i>), provided they use a proprietary title for their preparations. Once a proprietary name has been registered it will be impossible, as I see it, for the herbalist making the preparation to make any changes in the make-up so that he will be unable to make use of fresh knowledge that might come to him for the benefit of the community. As far as I can see once a


herbalist has registered a title he will not be allowed to devise any suitable process which may come through increased knowledge. Therefore, the public will be denied the benefit of many preparations which might be given to them.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
This strangely drafted Bill says that a lot of things are offences and that if there is a prosecution, such and such a thing will be a good defence. The Bill says that there shall be a prosecution in order to establish a good defence, instead of adopting the sensible way of saying that it shall not be an offence to do so and so. This is extraordinary drafting which should be looked into. On the question of proprietary articles, a person can continue to sell them unless they are in the British Pharmacopoeia or British Pharmaceutical Codex, so that all the chemists have to do in order to wreck the industry of these people is to shove articles into the Codex or Pharmacopoeia. I have never seen such drafting in a Bill. I see the Minister of Health and the Parliamentary Secretary laughing. Let them read it. Sub-section (5, <i>a</i>) says:
<q>that the substance recommended as a medicine which the article consisted of or comprised was not described in any of the monographs contained in the edition of the British Pharmacopoeia or British Pharmaceutical Codex which was last published before the date of the passing of this Act.</q></p>

<p>It goes on:
<q>or the date on which the substance was first sold by retail under the proprietary designation, whichever date is the later.</q>
Therefore, my right hon. Friend contends that you can change the articles as much as you like and no offence arises. There have to be prosecutions under this Bill before a man can show himself to be in the right, because the Bill is drawn on the basis of prosecutions. Sub-sections (5) and (6) are not exceptions to the preliminary words of the Clause, which are, "no person shall sell by retail." That prohibition remains unqualified, but, having sold by retail something which comes under Subsections (4, <i>a</i>) or (5, <i>a</i>), when the police or whoever prosecutes have done their proper job, a person is charged with an offence&#x2014;</p>

<p>My hon. and gallant Friend gave the example of the proprietary medicine, which is partly covered by this Amendment. The problem also arises in Sub-section (5, <i>a</i>), and I would not have raised it in this particular form unless you had previously permitted my hon. and gallant Friend to raise the problem of the proprietary medicine. I think that my right hon. Friend should look at these paragraphs with a view to re-drafting the Clause in another place, so that people will be freed from the obligation of having to raise these defences. It is a point that must be examined by the legal advisers of the Minister.</p>

<p>With regard to the point raised by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Ayr Burghs (Sir T. Moore), the ingredients can be changed as long as disclosure takes place of the new ingredients. In answer to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams), if a person was selling a preparation before it appeared in the Codex or the Pharmacopoeia, he can go on selling it. If it appeared in them the day after he sold it, he can go on selling it as long as he sold it first. He cannot sell a thing which is already in the Codex or the Pharmacopoeia. The question of drafting which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon is a larger matter than I can deal with at this moment. I would point out that it is only the individual himself who can give the information as to when he first sold the article. Supposing he was selling a particular medicine and he was told that he had no right to sell it because it was in the Pharmacopoeia or the Codex, he could then prove that he sold it before it was included. That is a defence. My right hon. Friend will look further into my hon. Friend's points. The difficulty has been to safeguard all these matters, and that is why the drafting is so complex. My right hon. Friend, however, will see whether it can be made simpler, at the same time leaving these safeguards which we are anxious to retain.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 8, line 40, to leave out "of a single species."<br/>
I am moving this Amendment in order to give my right hon. Friend an opportunity of exercising his real kindness and generosity, because I can see no possible justification for not accepting it. As the Clause reads at the moment these preparations are limited to a single species, the words being
<q>of a substance produced by drying, crushing, or comminuting (bat not subjecting to any other process) a plant or plants of a single species.</q>
Candidly, none of my herbalist friends can see any justification for limiting these preparations to a single species. They say that often it is necessary to boil various herbs and to infuse them at one and the same time if real benefit is to be secured from the component parts of each, and it is felt that it was possibly due to some misunderstanding of the methods by which these preparations are made that the Minister allowed the phrase "single species" to be incorporated in the Clause.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment<br/>
I can see no reason for limiting this to a single species. My right hon. Friend, despite his cheerfulness, is a teetotaller, but if he ever had consumed that commodity which the vulgar call a "Gin and It" he would have known that it was composed of two herbs, one being juniper, though what the other is I do not know. It is not, however, regarded as a medicine officially, although some people look upon it in that way. I cannot see why we cannot be allowed to mix the results of drying, crushing or comminuting two different species of herbs. I cannot see any sense in that restriction, although there may be some reason for it which my right hon. Friend can explain to us. When you buy a bottle of medicine the bottle has a label

bearing a lot of words in bad Latin which I do not understand but which the medical profession regard as a complete disclosure of what is inside the bottle. Sometimes it finishes up with "H<sup>2</sup>O," and I happen to know what that means, but it is a disclosure. There was a celebrated case of a chemist who received a piece of paper on which a fly had walked and took it to be a prescription and succeeded in making it up. Therefore, my medical friends must not be too perturbed if I say that I see no reason why these "simples," as I think they were once called, should not include more than one substance. It may be that paragraph (4, <i>a</i>) means that they may, but the Bill is drafted so incomprehensibly that it is possible that I have misread it.</p>

<p>I shall not associate myself with what the hon. Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams) said about the Minister being so cheerful although he was a teetotaller. I am almost certain that he is so cheerful because he is a teetotaller. Although I am supporting this Amendment, I do not want anyone to think I am supporting it in the same spirit as the hon. Member for South Croydon. What I do know is that there are a lot of species of plants, and that I do not think any hon. Member has had more advice offered to him about remedies than I have had during the last seven years. I have had "perfect cures" sent to me from all parts of the world. One came from Blackburn. The lady wrote: "I see by the Press that you are suffering from so-and-so. I have a cure for it." The cure was this: to pound up some pigs' toe-nails until they are almost like powder and then drink them in water That was sent to me as a perfect cure for diabetes. I think it would be a pity for the Minister to prevent a cure like that from being tried by human beings.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend says "Not wholly." Let me come back to herbs, and say that my right hon. Friend is quite willing to accept the


Amendment, but if the Mover and the Seconder will look at the Amendment and then at the words in the Bill they will see that their Amendment is really unnecessary since we already have the words "two or more such substances." And in an Amendment which I shall be moving later we get the same words: "two or more such substances." Therefore, we have already provided that there may be more than one species. We have already provided for the mixing of two species, and further for the mixing of more than two species, and so the point which the hon. Members wanted covering is already covered.</p>

<p>I am delighted with that explanation, but I do not think the hon. Lady quite realises where it leads her. Her argument is that to delete these words will make no difference. The unfortunate thing is that if this Bill should go before the courts to be interpreted the judge will say "Why are those words in?" He will not take any notice of the eloquent speech just made. The real burden of the speech was that the words really make no difference because there can be as many species as they like. But the judge will think that the words have been put in for a definite purpose, and will have to find out what that purpose is, and no one knows what the result may be. It is only another proof of how badly the Bill is drafted.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for South Croydon (Sir H. Williams) has not given that close attention to all the stages of this Bill which he usually gives to Measures in which he is interested. The present drafting is not the official drafting of the Bill but is the result of an attempt by me to meet these very points. We have met the points about blending, and more than one species, and more than one substance, and I am advised that it is not now necessary in pursuance of the general scheme to include the words mentioned in the Amendment, and therefore I shall be very glad to accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>My trouble about the word "preservative" is that very few things could not be called into that category by some stretch of imagination.

<p>I am glad my hon. Friend has just put that point. I am sure that my hon. Friend who moved the Amendment will realise that "preservative" is a rather wide term. Preservatives may be added if medicines are sold under a proprietary name, but I am informed that the whole nature of some vegetable substances may be changed by certain treatment and converted into substances quite outside the range of herbalists' activity. I will not trouble the House by going into detail on this point.<br/>

<p>I should not like to let the Bill go without emphasising the great debt we owe to those who have brought the Bill to this stage of being passed into law. In the absence of my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Blackburn (Captain Elliston) I can register also what we owe to him, without raising

his blushes. This is the end of a long history of hard endeavour on the part of himself and his friends, over many years, to deal with this species of fraud on the public. I hope the Bill will do much to put an end to that fraud. My hon. and gallant Friend has done a great deal of work in this direction, with very little help and against a great deal of antagonism. He has met the persons concerned, and now the Minister of Health has put the matter into official form. I believe the Minister has realised in his conferences some of the difficulties which have been met with all these years by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Blackburn. A great tribute is due to all the interests concerned. They have mollified their opposition by degrees, until now they have come to heel by supporting this legislation.<br/>
This is a remarkable piece of legislation from the point of view of bringing out what is too often forgotten: the quite rightful opportunity&#x2014;the liberal opportunity&#x2014;that is left to herbalists and other people to treat the public so long as they do not defraud. It is often said and thought that the medical profession has a monopoly of treatment. There is no such thing. Everybody can get treated or maltreated as much as he likes, and I am very glad that the herbalists should have been left the opportunity they have under this Bill. We quite recognise the truth of what my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Ayr Burghs (Sir T. Moore) said to the effect that herbalists carried on their trade long before the medical profession as such was thought of. The use of herbs is as old as creation, and it is through that that the medical and pharmaceutical professions have discovered the use of valuable drugs. They have been tried out under the most extraordinary empirical conditions, often with disastrous results to the patients&#x2014;it has been an experiment in vivisection on the community&#x2014;but often with such valuable results that a drug has come into common use. One such drug is ergot, which is extraordinarily valuable in child-birth. It is now recognised as consisting of several constituents, some of which are valuable while others are dangerous, and the valuable derivatives are now in common practical use in pharmacy. It is an instance of how we must not stifle enterprise and individuality of any kind, nor the desire and the right of


people to use any method they think fit for treating themselves or for being treated, and giving proper remuneration in return for the benefits or otherwise which they receive. The medical profession entirely endorses that point of view. We have no monopoly and do not wish to have any monopoly.<br/>
On the other hand, we recognise, and I hope it is generally recognised too, that this is in keeping with the Medical Act of 1858, and subsequent amending Acts, which were introduced not in order to give privileges to the medical profession, but to give protection and guidance to the general public. Obviously there are difficult border-line cases, but in general it is for the protection of the public that there is a recognised medical profession with a recognised training&#x2014;I believe of a very high standard, consistently maintained&#x2014;but there is nothing to prevent people using their own judgment if they so desire. From the point of view of the medical profession and from that of the public, this Measure is only a stepping stone. It is a great advance, not least because of the improvements which have been made to it to-day, but there are other things which have already been referred to which cannot be so easily defined. I have not the least doubt that the sharks who have made money by deliberately misleading the public will continue to do so, because they will find ways of avoiding the provisions of the present Measure. Further amendments may therefore be required, but it is a very good thing to proceed slowly, step by step, and this Measure will be a useful test as to how far restrictions can be introduced without disturbance to the proper interests of the public. I trust it will be rapidly passed in another place and will soon become law, and that the arrangements for enforcing it will be properly carried out. We shall then find much useful experience in its operation.</p>

<p>We ought to thank the Minister and his assistants for the way in which they have tried to meet the Amendments put down. This will be a useful Bill. I think it was a necessary Bill for the protection of that part of the public which most needs protection, the people who are suffering from disease and whose psychology is open to the

worst kind of exploitation. If the Bill gives that protection, it will be a very useful Bill indeed. I think it could have gone further than it does, but I am sure the Minister will later call for a report on its operation to see whether its provisions need widening or tightening-up, and I hope he will not hesitate to come to the House to ask for authority in that direction. I will conclude with the first observation I made in the course of the Second Reading, that the best remedy against all these things is to build up a positive medical service available to everyone everywhere, making all that science knows available to all on equal terms. Out of the survey which is to be made and out of the stresses of war I hope something of the kind may ultimately come. Meantime, we give this Bill a welcome.</p>

<q>That, in accordance with the Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act, 1919, this House do direct that the Diocesan Reorganisation Committees Measure, 1941, be presented to His Majesty for Royal Assent.</q>
This Measure is the essential response of the Church Assembly to Section 39 of the War Damage Act, which provides that the War Damage Commission shall have power, instead of making a value payment or a cost of works payment, to pay lump sums to bodies representing Churches and similar organisations, and it was quite obviously necessary that the Church of England should bring its Church laws into conformity with the public Statute law represented by the War Damage Act. As things stand at present, there is an obligation upon incumbents of the Church of England and churchwardens to undertake with reasonable promptitude the restoration of damaged churches. Unfortunately, as everybody knows, a very large number of churches have been either destroyed or seriously damaged. This Measure provides for the


necessary delay. It removes the existing obligation from the shoulders of the incumbents and church-wardens, and places the responsibility for providing for the delay and for the necessary reorganisation upon the diocesan committees which will be set up under this Measure. It has already been arranged under the War Damage Act that local matters should be dealt with regionally. The regional officers require a body, other than individual churchwardens and individual parsons, to negotiate with, and further there is this matter to be provided for, that particularly in the great cities, and notably the City of London, where a large number of churches have been destroyed, it will probably be found unnecessary that all those churches should be rebuilt. The Diocesan Reorganisation Committees set up by this Measure will have the power to re-arrange, and make fresh plans, for the provision of necessary churches for the public worship of any given area. I do not think it is necessary to go into a greater detail than this, and I beg to move.</p>

<p>The greatest menace to this country to-day is the continuation of the "old school tie" predominance in politics. It has developed a practice that overlooks inefficiency and administrative shortcomings, provided that the offender conforms to the standards laid down by the "Margesson school. "By the" Margesson school" I mean the system whereby the discipline of Government Ministers and M.P. supporters is controlled through the Government Whips'

office, a system perfected by the right hon. and gallant Member for Rugby (Captain Margesson), who, for so many years, was Chief Whip. Few Conservatives could hope for advancement unless they were approved by the "Margesson school" and conformed to the necessary standards. These standards do not necessarily include ability, but, with few exceptions, it is essential that candidates should be popular types of men who belong to the so-called hereditary ruling class, and it has been noticed that, if they also happen to be hunting men, then their careers in the Government are assured, starting in the Whips' office as Junior Whips&#x2014;an appropriate hunting term.<br/>
Of course, it is also demanded that they should be good party men, which, in plain language, means that they shall be docile, that they will do what they are told, and that they will not ask awkward questions. All this may sound fantastic, but nevertheless it is true, and in some ways it is reasonable, and from the Chief Whip's point of view, it is quite understandable, because his is the responsibility of seeing that there is no trouble for the Government or, anyhow, as little trouble as possible. The Chief Whip was not likely to recommend to the Prime Minister of the day that some brilliant, stormy petrel, with the strength of his convictions, should be given a Government appointment; to have somebody within the nest who might take a strong and independent line would he just asking for trouble. That is why the present Prime Minister, Lord Beaverbrook, and, I understand, Lord Rothermere, were constantly excluded from succeeding Governments.<br/>
Then, again, one can appreciate that in the Whips' Office it is essential that there should be good team work, and as the Chief Whip very naturally chooses men to help him whom he knows and whom he can trust, that is to say, his friends, he does so, sometimes, regardless of whether they have political aptitude or keenness. Prior to entering the Whips' Office the present Chief Whip had attended 88 Divisions out of a Session of 414 Divisions, so it will be seen that it is not conscientious application to House of Commons duties that is considered to be of paramount importance. To that extent, I ought to be in the running for a Whip's job, because I think there was a period when my Division record was


worse than was the record I have just mentioned of the right hon. Member for Moray and Nairn (Mr. J. Stuart).<br/>
I wonder if my reasons for non-attendance at that period were the same as his. Was he, like myself, disgusted, and disheartened, by the determination of the Baldwin-Chamberlain crowd not to prevent Germany from re-arming and by their corresponding determination to go slow with our own re-arming? Though what happened at Munich was deplorable, nevertheless I feel that it was essential, in view of what had gone before. But when M.P.s, unimportant to the Whips, such as myself, attempted to make our voices heard we were prevented by the Whips' Office by various means, and even during the seriousness of war, such means are still continued. One had supposed that the Conservative Whips' Office was by way of being representative of a democratic party, within which every Member had an equal chance, and where one was not hindered in expressing one's views. Here let me say that I am well aware that the "old school tie" caucus will contemptuously dismiss the contribution I am now making as sour grapes. Well, let them do it; it will make no difference to the facts that I intend to put before this House.<br/>
The Whips' Office being the main stepping-stone to all other Government appointments, is it to be wondered at, realising how Conservative Whips are chosen, that many key positions to-day are held by "jolly good fellows"? But when you come to examine their ability for such vital war-time responsibility, that is a very different matter. There are first-class men in this House of Commons to-day who, although they may not conform to the outward conventional standards required by the Whips' Office, and although they may have few friends and no relations in high places, possess attributes which would help this country to avoid defeat, and which it would appear, to my simple mind, are more important than being just a "jolly good fellow." I refer to attributes such as efficiency, alertness, driving power and toughness. How many of the millstones hanging round the Prime Minister's neck to-day have those qualities? One senior Minister, by being in office with both Baldwin and Chamberlain, has lost all his independence. He

now agrees with everybody. He was head of a vital war Department that has important and essential work to do day and night, but he had become so complacent that even when matters were serious he used to go home to the seaside nearly every night and week-end. That Minister is still in the Government to-day.<br/>
The Government Whips' Office is nearly as powerful as any Prime Minister, because, as I have indicated, it is this office that suggests and provides for all Government key positions. This office has the inestimable advantage of being comparatively inconspicuous. It is the only Government Department that does not have to give an account of its stewardship. It is more silent than the so-called "Silent Service." The power that it wields behind the scenes is positively extraordinary. It has been observed that the most independent of characters get drawn under its spell sooner or later. Has the Prime Minister been affected? Our system of Government is such that a Prime Minister, of necessity, becomes dependent on his Whips' Office. The Whips' Office provides the barometer of political weather. It warns the Prime Minister if a legislative storm is brewing, and suggests procedure for overcoming it. The untimely end of a Government is often avoided by the tactics of the Whips' Office. Its advice is taken on Ministerial appointments, and, as the Whips have always been sticklers for team work, one realises that they naturally lean towards men who will create no trouble once they are within the inner circle. No man worked harder or more successfully than the right hon. and gallant Member for Rugby to keep the present Prime Minister out of office when the right hon. and gallant Member was Chief Whip. Nevertheless, it is significant that when the present Prime Minister became Prime Minister, he not only kept on the right hon. and gallant Member as Chief Whip, but eventually put him in supreme charge of our Army: the very same man who was in the inner councils of the Baldwin-cum-Chamberlain rule of unpreparedness, the same man who showed such faulty judgment in being a party to excluding the present Prime Minister from office when his influence might have done immense good, and might even have saved this country from war.<br/>
The Baldwin-Chamberlain influence does not end there, for, although in the


present Government there is a sprinkling of Conservatives, Liberals and Socialists who have not been tainted with the influence, as many as 50 Ministers who held office when ineptitude and complacency let us down so badly are still in the Government to-day. In this latest shuffle round that we heard about on Monday only one of the old gang has been removed, and that has been set off by the fact that one of what I might call the new gang has also been removed and he has been dispatched to the wilderness of the B.B.C. The "old school ties" are still bunched together to the extent of 60 per cent. of the present Government. They hold 60 per cent. of the key positions.<br/>
One is entitled to ask why should the products of the "Margesson school," that has always been satisfied with muddling-along standards, provided that the pupils were of the approved type, suddenly, miraculously be able to transform themselves into men of energy, imagination and driving power? It is asking too much. Only a very few of these legacies are fitted to cope with the present crisis. It is very difficult to teach old dogs new tricks. Only a few of these old dogs are likely to learn the new tricks. It is fresh minds, with new tricks, that is going to win this war. Therefore, I ask, is it not time that the Baldwin-Chamberlain old boys reunion broke up and were replaced by all and sundry, regardless of the colour of their ties, provided that they are of outstanding ability in particular spheres and possess the necessary thoroughness and ruthlessness to better the Hun?</p>

<p>If there is to be no reply to the hon. and gallant Member's criticism of the Whips' Department, with special reference, as the hon. and gallant Member definitely showed, to the Government Whips' Department, I rise to remove the possibility of any misunderstanding. To-day, with the House constituted as it is, with Members on this side not being looked upon as definitely in opposition to the Government, I simply want to make it perfectly clear that when the hon. and gallant Member refers to the way in which Whips are appointed by the party to which he "belongs, his description

does not apply to those Whips who are Members of the Labour party. Labour party Whips are appointed by democratic vote of the whole membership of that party in this House. It is a pleasure for me also to Be "able to say that those members of this party who at present are acting as Whips on the Government side have that imprimatur placed upon their appointment by the fact that they also had their appointments arrived at under that proper democratic principle.</p>

<p>I only rose with the same object as my hon. Friend, namely, to clear up any possible doubt. He used a phrase which I did not quite follow. He said that he and his hon. Friends were not definitely in opposition to the Government. Is that really a fair and comprehensive statement of the position? Would it not be fairer to say that he and his hon. Friends are supporters of the Government?</p>

<p>I wished to indicate that, although we are sitting here, we were not in opposition to the Government in the way in which we are generally looked upon, when the House is normally constituted, as the Government Opposition. I am sure that the hon. Member for East Wolverhampton (Mr. Mander) recognises, as do all of us, the position in which the major parties in this House are operating at the present time.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend really has not met the point. Does he still maintain that the correct description is '' not definitely in opposition"? Would he not say that he and his friends support the Government, in which one of the outstanding ornaments is the Lord Privy Seal?</p>

<p>I am sure that it is not necessary for me to make the position any more clear. I hope that it is well under stood how and where we stand, and perhaps my hon. Friend the Member for East Wolverhampton will, in the same way, make his own position clear.</p>
