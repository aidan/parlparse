	<p pid="a.683.3/1">We heard today, and in the last Scottish questions on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-10">10 July</phrase>, the Secretary of State's commitment to co-operate. At the beginning of this term of the Scottish Parliament, the new First Minister said that under his stewardship the Scottish Parliament would be about compromise, concession, intelligent debate and mature discussion. The Secretary of State will accept, however, that the people of Scotland have not seen that over the past two weeks, and that they expect and deserve better from both their Governments. Does he now accept that the memorandum of understanding on managing the relationships between the UK Government and devolved Administrations is no longer fit for purpose? Does he agree that the Secretary of State for Justice should review it as soon as possible?</p>

	<p pid="a.707.0/1">My hon. Friend puts her argument clearly. Enabling people in countries such as Afghanistan to enjoy a quality of life and to be governed in a way that they manifestly want to be will guarantee our long-term security. Future generations in the United Kingdom will be much safer if countries such as Afghanistan and other places that had became ungoverned space&mdash;places that could be used as training grounds for terrorists and that gangsters and others could maraud around&mdash;become more stable and settled.</p>
	<p pid="a.707.0/2">We face a problem in getting that across to the people of the United Kingdom, although I never find any difficulty in explaining the narcotics issue on the streets of my constituency. People understand the heroin issue clearly, because it is present in their communities. However, part of the problem in getting the argument across is that we need better to describe the end state that we believe we can allow the people of Afghanistan to take forward themselves. Part of that is substantially dependent on engaging more women in the decision-making process in such countries. I do not think that there is any doubt about that.</p>

	<p pid="a.711.0/1">Although I take issue with the Secretary of State on the wisdom of our continued presence in Afghanistan, I am sure that we both agree that our troops on the ground are doing excellent work and that we must seriously consider their welfare and morale. Has he received reports of, for example, forward units in Helmand spending 40 days on ration packs and it not being possible to resupply them? Is that the case, is the Secretary of State aware of such reports, and if so, what does he think that does for the morale of the soldiers?</p>

	<p pid="a.714.0/1">I can, of course, confirm that exactly the opposite has happened&mdash;thus far. I make that qualification because I recognise that the situation is very fragile and that it is very important that the negotiations between General Mohan and those others who seek to exercise political power and economic influence in southern Iraq are sustained. We can create the opportunity for such negotiations and discussions to take place, but we cannot be a party to them, as they are for Iraqis to sort out between themselves. As long as progress is being made in that regard, the relationship that I have described will be sustained.</p>
	<p pid="a.714.0/2">We hear constant predictions that things are about to melt down in Iraq, but it is always possible, at any stage in the transition, that things will go either right or wrong. Many people out there know that it is a fifty-fifty bet and so always opt for pessimism, on the basis that that gives them a 50 per cent. chance of being right, and being able to say, &quot;I told you so.&quot; Thankfully, however, our judgments are a bit more sophisticated than that. At the points of transition, we do not take any step unless we are assured that we are doing so in the context of preset conditions, measurements and tests that we have agreed with others.</p>
	<p pid="a.714.0/3">Until now, we have managed to make the progress that we have planned for, and broadly within the planned time scale. At each step, we have told the House and the country what the next stage of the plan would be, but I am not complacent: I know that we face a volatile and fragile set of circumstances, and that many people do not have the best interests of the UK or the Iraqi people at heart. In their briefings to me about what is going on in the operational theatre, many military commanders have told me, &quot;You have to remember, Secretary of State, the enemy get a vote too, and we don't control that.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.714.0/4">Thus far, therefore, our actions have been correct, but we must not be complacent. In the interests of the Iraqi people, and of our people too, we have to recognise that we must take the same care when it comes to the next stage of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.714.0/5">We cannot debate defence without addressing the threat of terrorism, which can emerge from abroad or at home and manifests itself against both armed forces and civilians. Its method is indiscriminate killing. Its aim is to promote an extremist ideology. As a Government, we are committed to tackling that threat at every level&mdash;its fundamental values, its spread to the disaffected, its planning, actions and representation. To do so requires hard power, to minimise the actions of terrorists, and soft power to minimise intent and recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.714.0/6">The military play an important role in countering terrorism and British forces are working to that end as I speak, both at home and across the globe. Through capacity building we help other nations bolster their defences and contribute to the international effort.</p>

	<p pid="a.720.7/1">The armed forces compensation scheme has recently received wide publicity, and we welcome the fact that a review was undertaken on what is obviously a broken compensation system. We still await the full results of the review. However, I was, as other Members would have been, a little perplexed that the first time we heard about that review was on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-28">28 August</phrase>, when the Minister for the Armed Forces mentioned it on Radio 4's &quot;PM&quot; programme. Why was the statement not first made in the House of Commons?</p>
	<p pid="a.720.7/2">As for the scheme itself, the maximum amount payable is &pound;285,000 plus the guaranteed-income pension for the rest of a service member's life. That is in contrast to the recent RAF civilian's lump sum of &pound;485,000; they would not, of course, require a guaranteed-income payment. Those numbers are widely in the public domain and have an effect on the perception of the fairness with which the systems are applied. It is important that the Government's view on the matter should be clearly set out. Do they regard that discrepancy as fair and reasonable?</p>

	<p pid="a.721.0/1">What the public will see is this: for losing limbs or major organs, someone would get a maximum of &pound;285,000 plus a guaranteed-income pension, while someone working as a civilian who got a wrist injury would get a much larger sum and probably be back at work and able to generate their own income within a relatively short time. The public do not appreciate that discrepancy or the legalities that are being put forward&mdash;they view one as overly generous in relation to the other. I hope that the Government understand that when they finally review the matter, because the public perception of the fairness of the treatment of our armed forces is extremely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.721.0/2">Let me turn to a matter that has recently been raised in the press: the treatment of military personnel in hospitals in the United Kingdom. Having visited the field hospital in Iraq, where our personnel are treated magnificently and not a single person has contracted a case of MRSA, I find it amazing that Private Jamie Cooper, the youngest British soldier to be injured in Iraq, is now back in Selly Oak with a C. difficile infection and two MRSA infections. We have to do an awful lot more as regards the quality of the medical care that is given. In general, the quality of care is superb, but surely something is very wrong when a field hospital can manage to have minimal infection levels, but on coming back to the UK our military personnel find that having fought off the enemy in Iraq they are having to fight off infections in the national health service of the world's fourth richest country. Something is very wrong with a medical system that allows that to happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.721.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is making me very angry. I have visited Selly Oak, and it is nothing short of shameful for him to denigrate the hard-working staff there. If he actually read the newspaper article about the case that he mentions, he would see that the consultant said that the reason why the individual contracted the disease was that he had a stomach wound and that the condition related to that, not to dirty hospitals.</p>

	<p pid="a.727.2/1">No, let me first outline what I am going to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.727.2/2">If the Opposition want to demonstrate that they are capable, they must show that they are different from the Conservative party that I have observed in my 34 years as a Member of Parliament, mostly in opposition. If one cannot get much from the future&mdash;from what might happen, according to the Opposition's proposals&mdash;one is forced to revert to the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.727.2/3">The Opposition's past is even more dispiriting than their proposals for the future. One gains the impression from listening to the hon. Member for Woodspring that the Conservative party is the SAS of Opposition defence teams, confident in its abilities and its history. One would also believe that the Government were somehow the descendants of a semi-pacifist or pacifist Labour party led by Michael Foot, Tony Benn, Frank Allaun and Ramsay MacDonald, who ended up as a Conservative. Neither of those extremes is true.</p>
	<p pid="a.727.2/4">The Government have been accused of all sorts of things, such as cutting defence expenditure. If the Opposition want to talk about cuts, they should consider the template under the Thatcher and Major Governments. Most of the increase in Government expenditure went on replacing kit lost during the war against Argentina. The previous Labour Government&mdash;Fred Mulley was Secretary of State&mdash;promised that we would commit ourselves to a 3 per cent. real increase in defence expenditure. Labour did that&mdash;the cut came under Michael Heseltine. If one looks at the chart of defence expenditure and what the Library has produced&mdash;I do not want to embroil the Library research department in a political argument&mdash;one sees that the statistics are clear. The picture of Tory defence expenditure, following a little spurt after the Falklands war, is: drop, drop, drop, drop, drop until the Defence Committee, then led by a wonderful Conservative Chairman, the late Michael Colvin, argued that Government expenditure was projected to fall to 2.2 per cent. Therefore, before too many rocks are thrown about any failings, I hope that the shadow Secretary of State will look at the many Defence Committee reports that were published during his party's period in office.</p>
	<p pid="a.727.2/5">Charges have been laid against the Government on Defence Medical Services, but just look at what the Defence Committee said about hospitals in &quot;Defence Costs Study No. 15&quot;. It said that the situation was appalling and that the cuts had gone so far that it doubted whether medical services would ever recover. That was a Tory-led Defence Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.727.2/6">The Tory-led Defence Committee said in 1996 that defence cuts had gone so far that if they proceeded in the same direction the defence of the realm would be severely endangered. I advise the shadow Secretary of State to look at my A to Z of Tory procurement foul-ups&mdash;the word &quot;foul-up&quot; was suggested when my first word was deemed inadvisable by the Clerks. All I am saying is, yes, we have made mistakes, but, on balance, this is not the Labour party of the early 1980s. This Labour Government have behaved, if not impeccably and perfectly, then in a way that has defended this country's interests well, and they will continue to do so. The hon. Member for Woodspring does neither himself nor his party any good by imagining that we are a party of extremist troglodytes who have somehow found their way into office and are now doing their best to undermine the security of the state and the welfare of our armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.731.3/1">I am not sure whether to thank my hon. Friend for what he has said, as he is only half proud of what we did. One thing that we did was appoint better advisers than the Mood's, and we gave the MOD a rough time. However, we recognised that much had happened with compensation and other forms of benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.731.3/2">Much has been done, but more remains to be done. We can never be absolutely happy until members of our armed forces who have been injured are properly compensated, regardless of whether they were injured while facing the enemy, in peacetime operations or while serving at home; we owe them a debt of honour. They must be properly compensated not only so that we can be happier about that and our consciences can be clearer, but so that more people will be prepared to join the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.731.3/3">We must examine how our defence forces are evolving, the equipment we are purchasing, the training we are doing, the alliances of which we are a part, and whether our Government are displaying political wisdom in respect of our allies and potential adversaries&mdash;we hope that they are. In doing so, we must move beyond the immediate future. I recall Ministers such as Archie Hamilton&mdash;a great guy&mdash;coming before the Defence Committee, and our saying, &quot;Minister, you are thinking about the fact that the Soviet Union has now collapsed, but is the threat to the UK over? Why are you rushing to cut regiments? Why are you cutting defence expenditure? History teaches us that, regrettably, war is sometimes inevitable.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.733.0/1">I begin by echoing the Secretary of State's words of condolence and by paying tribute to the superb work of the men and women of our armed forces in Afghanistan, Iraq and other places around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/2">We had a debate last week on defence procurement, so I will not go over ground that we covered then. However, I welcome the opportunity to have a broader debate on defence policy at a time when overstretch in the armed forces is a subject of discussion not only among politicians and the media, but, in the past few months, among present and former heads of the Army. We are having this debate at a time when, as has already been stated and acknowledged, defence planning assumptions have been exceeded for several years, harmony guidelines have been breached too much, and the state of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan means that a toll is being taken not only on the men and women of our armed services, but on the equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/3">There are particular units in the armed forces that we turn to again and again because of their suitability and excellence in undertaking work such as that in which we are currently involved. I am thinking in particular of the Marines, the Paras and others whom we go back to again and again for such operations. Each of those units will, in time, need to rebuild their contingent capabilities, but they will be unable to do so if we keep sending them out quite as regularly as we have done in the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/4">I welcome the fact that the Defence Secretary began to acknowledge and address some of those issues in his speech this afternoon. He said that he believed that changes were afoot that would ease some of these pressures. I hope that that is right. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating, and we will watch developments closely to see whether the hopes outlined today come to fruition.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/5">We welcome the Government's recent announcement that they intend to reduce the number of our troops in Iraq in the early part of next year. That is a very welcome step in the right direction. The British mission in south-east Iraq has been in progress for some time. Originally, we had responsibility for four provinces; three have been handed back, and we are in the process of withdrawing from Basra province at present, but I remain curious about one matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/6">I assure the house that I raise this not to score a point but because I am genuinely puzzled, and hope that the Minister for the Armed Forces will be able to offer some clarification when he winds up the debate. As recently as <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-26">26 July</phrase>, the Minister was discussing with the Defence Committee the prospects for reducing the number of our troops in Iraq. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The force is not self-sustaining and able to protect itself and do the other work that it has to do below about 5,000&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/8">He went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/9" class="indent">&quot;in an...over-watch situation we cannot get much below 5,000 because we have to be able to sustain the force and self-protect the force itself, so over-watch in itself does not take us down a lot lower than that.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/10">I repeat that I am not referring to those remarks because I oppose the reduction to 2,500&mdash;far from it. As I said, that is a move in the right direction, but I want to understand what has happened in the past couple of months that has caused the Government to make an assessment today that is different from what they were saying as recently as late July. Perhaps they have revised their assessments; if so, I look forward to hearing the Minister's explanation later on.</p>
	<p pid="a.733.0/11">I believe that the work in Iraq is progressing towards some sort of endgame and that, increasingly, the focus will move to our ongoing operations in Afghanistan. In my opinion it is widely accepted that we are in for a long haul there, and the public remain somewhat confused about what we are trying to achieve. As a political community composed of all the parties, Parliament must set about trying to explain that more clearly if we are to ensure that the public continue to support and understand&mdash;and see the justification for&mdash;what we are going to be doing in Afghanistan for some years to come.</p>

	<p pid="a.739.0/1">I welcome the announcement that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October</phrase> on Iraq, which will see troop numbers reduced to about 2,500 by next spring. The decision was made possible only as a result of the fantastic efforts of British troops who have helped to train 13,000 members of the Iraqi army. I was saddened that instead of welcoming that news, the Opposition took the opportunity for a bit of political knockabout. The public will make a harsh judgment about those who sat in the comfort of those Benches and saw the announcement as a chance to launch a political attack on the Government rather than celebrate the success of Britain's servicemen and women. Is it any wonder that the recent ICM poll showed that two thirds of those polled believe that the Tories are not fit for government?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-10-16a.739.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" colnum="739"  time="018:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071016/debtext/71016-0010.htm#07101661000078">
	<p pid="a.739.2/1">The public will judge the Conservatives' reaction on that day; I have no doubt that a harsh judgment will be made on that party.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.2/2">The conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan has meant that we are asking servicemen and women to do more than ever before, placing greater demands on them and their families. In return, therefore, we have to take on board an even greater duty to support them. I have always held the view that joining the armed forces is not like taking a job at Barclays bank or Tesco. Those who volunteer to serve their country are joining an organisation that may require them to put their life on the line, as has so tragically happened in Iraq and Afghanistan these past few years. In return for their commitment, it is our duty to ensure they are well motivated, well trained, and equipped and protected to do the job that we ask of them. That is our true covenant with the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.2/3">In return for the service that our forces give, Britain owes them only the very best. I am talking not simply about the best training and equipment, but about the best accommodation and support for them and their families. It is important that families are given support.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.2/4">When I served as a defence Minister, my mission statement was simple: we will value our servicemen, servicewomen and their families, our reserves, cadets their employers and their families, our veterans, their widows and their families, and we will do everything in our power to demonstrate that. That idea should run throughout our approach to our support for the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.2/5">I could not speak of the value agenda without mentioning the campaign by veterans who fought in Malaysia to be allowed to wear the Pingat Jasa Malaysia medal. I have tabled early-day motion 356 on that and hon. Members on both sides of the House have generously supported it. However, we have to do more. We have a duty to honour the commitment of the 35,000 of our boys who fought in the jungles of Malaysia. They earned that medal and they have the right to wear it. A greater degree of honour falls on them than on the members of the honours and decorations committee who are resisting the legitimate request to wear that medal. I wonder how many of those who serve on that committee served in the jungle. Probably the only jungle they know is the jungle around Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.2/6">The value agenda should run right through the whole of our forces, from cadets to veterans, and even beyond, to our service families. Service families are very important. They really are the rock on which our people rely for support. If the families back home are happy, content and supported, the boys whom we deploy in many theatres of conflict are happy, too. Like everyone else, our servicemen and women cannot give their best in operations if they are worried about things at home. So it should be an absolute priority that servicemen and their families have the support and help they need and deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.2/7">The absolute cornerstone of that is service accommodation. Armed forces personnel and their families deserve decent accommodation. Those serving must be secure in the knowledge that their families are housed in accommodation on a par with the very best on offer in Britain. While I know that the MOD is committed to improving accommodation, and some &pound;700 million has already been spent on housing and other living accommodation, much more needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.2/8">I occasionally smile to myself when I hear present&mdash;and yes, former&mdash;senior defence chiefs calling for more to be done to improve service family accommodation. I pressed for that, as a Minister in the MOD between 2005 and 2006, but I do not recall receiving any support from those individuals. Indeed, it was Ministers in the MOD who expressed the greatest concern about service family accommodation, not the senior officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.2/9">I believe that the MOD plans to spend &pound;5 billion in the next decade and that will help, but I have one piece of advice for my successor, who takes a very real interest in this matter. He should watch his back when it comes to determining priorities. He will have to fight his corner for funding for service family accommodation, and he will find his opponents pretty formidable.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.2/10">There is no quick fix. The legacy of underfunding inherited from the previous Government means that we are tackling shortcomings that will take considerable time to resolve. It is a bit rich for the Conservatives to claim the moral high ground on the issue when it was their policy of slashing the defence budget that led to service family housing being in the poor state of repair that it is in now. Indeed, there is no more pathetic sight than the Tories trying to pitch their tent on the moral high ground. When it comes to our armed forces, they had no idea when in government and they have no credibility now. Their record speaks for itself.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-10-16a.741.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" colnum="741"  time="018:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071016/debtext/71016-0010.htm#07101661000080">
	<p pid="a.741.1/1">I am coming to an NAO report now. MOD officials appeared before the Public Accounts Committee on <phrase class="date" code="1998-01-28">28 January 1998</phrase> and they were asked whether spending constraints under the previous Government had prevented improvements to housing stock. They said yes. Who asked the question? It was none o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">ther than the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase>, the present shadow Home Secretary. Contrast that with the record of this Government on spending and investment in the armed forces. We are reversing the legacy that the Conservatives left. We now have more than 20,000 new or upgraded single-living accommodation spaces and 20,000 more are planned. In this financial year, the accommodation of 900 service families will be upgraded, and there is more to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/2">I hope that my hon. Friends on the Treasury Bench will take a closer look at an idea that I examined when I was a Minister. Today, many service families aspire to own their own home and we must to do all we can to help them achieve that. We could perhaps give them a grant of, say, &pound;30,000 towards their mortgage. That cost could be offset by savings elsewhere on other benefits. Alternatively, the Department could act as a guarantor for a certain proportion of any mortgage applied for. The Americans do that with their veterans, for example. One of the major advantages of such a scheme is that the lender is protected against loss and a favourable mortgage is obtained by the service family.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/3">The issue of home ownership will become increasingly important in the coming years as we move towards super-garrisons. It also extends choice to the services and meets a legitimate aspiration. The quality of service accommodation, alongside military pay and training, has a massive impact on recruitment and retention, which are the two great challenges facing us.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/4">Recruitment is an ongoing challenge. Our strong economy increases the challenge. I entered the House in 1995 in a by-election, and I remember that almost every door that I knocked on in my campaign was answered. In the last general election, hardly any doors were answered, because the area now has a strong economy and almost full employment. The forces now have to compete for recruits and show that joining is an attractive proposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/5">Retention is also an issue with some 20,000-plus people leaving the services each year. The skills that our servicemen and women gain during their time in the forces are desirable to those who run business and industry in the private sector. Imagine a married serviceman who has returned from a second or third deployment in the field being greeted by his wife. She will probably say, &quot;Thank God you are back. I worried about you the whole time you were away. Now you have skills that you can sell outside in the private sector. The children are growing up and we are living in awful service accommodation.&quot; How can we retain those people in the forces? We need to do more, and the deployed welfare package does help with retention.</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/6">Let us not forget that our forces were given the best public sector pay deal this year. In fact, armed forces salary growth has exceeded growth in the whole economy in all but one of the last five years. Contrast that with the record of the Conservatives who, rather than supporting our service personnel, cut the Army by 36,000 during their last five years in government. With that record, where is their commitment to our armed forces?</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/7">T he hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox), who spoke on behalf of the Opposition, but is no longer in his place, was a little coy when pressed about what they would do on public spending if they were in power. I do not know why he was coy: he should take a lead from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">his leader, the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase>, who said in a webcast interview recently:</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/8" class="indent">&quot;There is no magic pot of money we can dip into to spend...on our armed forces.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.741.1/9">There we have it. If the Tories were in power, there would be no more for the armed forces. As so often in the past, the Tories are long on promises, but short on delivery. The party that cut the defence budget by &pound;0.5 billion a year between 1992 and 1997 has not changed at all. If, God forbid, they were one day elected to power, the outlook for the armed forces would be cuts, cuts and more cuts. Contrast that with the record of this Government&mdash;increasing pay, improving equipment, updating medical care and accommodation, and constantly seeking to improve the package available to veterans. The Government are committed to delivering for our servicemen and women, and long may that continue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-10-16a.755.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2001" speakername="David Hamilton" colnum="755"  time="019:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071016/debtext/71016-0012.htm#07101670000043">
	<p pid="a.755.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1901" name="Bruce George">The right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George)</phrase> said earlier that people should not get up and speak unless they have something to say&mdash;a piece of advice to one of our young colleagues across the way. In many cases that advice is sound, but then again, everyone has to start somewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.0/2">I have been here for six years and I have entered into three defence debates. I have been involved with the Select Committee on Defence for the last two years. Two of my colleagues are here; it is unfortunate that the Defence Committee is away again. These debates seem to take place when it is away, which is an unfortunate bit of timing. However, the reason for my involvement in defence, and for thinking that it is an important issue for us to consider, is personal experience. I was at Capitol Hill in 2001 when the plane hit the Pentagon next door, and my colleagues and I had to run out of the Capitol building.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.0/3">I quickly realised that as an MP, I was not here just to represent my constituency, but that the decisions that I, and others, took in this place would result in people going to war and not coming back again. If I had to make such decisions, therefore, the least I could do was to try to understand exactly what the conflicts to which we send people were about. That is why I joined the armed forces parliamentary scheme, which I recommend to anyone who has not been involved with the armed forces before.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> referred to deployment, and how the linkage between the armed forces and the public is now void, which is true. When I left school in 1965, I could go either to the pit, into the textile industry or to the local Army recruitment office&mdash;the Glencorse barracks is in my area. There is a link between the armed forces and my local community. There are marches in the area every year, but such links are few and far between, and do not exist in very many places. A disconnect has taken place over the years, and it is important that we understand that.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.0/5">Many previous speakers have talked about Iraq and Afghanistan, and I anticipated that that would be the position. I want to raise some specific issues about which I feel quite strongly, and refer to things that we need to develop. Like a substantial number of Members in my party, I opposed going into Iraq, and I continue to think that I was on the side of the righteous in doing so. At the end of the day, however, I have never spoken publicly against the decision to go into Iraq because it was a democratic decision taken in this House, and I was in the minority. I am from that old group that believes that when defeated, people should accept the decision taken. When the troops moved out, it was important that we were seen to support them in that conflict. That does not mean I have not had reservations about what happened, and what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.0/6">I want to make one or two points on Iraq. The first, which has been discussed during the past week, was about the commitment made to the Iraqi interpreters, who have been a major support. They have done a great deal of work not just in their interpretation duties, but in saving a great many British lives. I was glad to see the Prime Minister acknowledge that contribution by saying that we would have to support those people and ensure that they get sanctuary in this country. However, the fact is that there were 740 rulings last year on Iraqis who had supported the UK, but asylum was granted to only 30 of them. I hope that when we talk about the new dynamic, we will see interpreters being treated in a different way.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.0/7">Other hon. Members have spoken about the contribution from other countries, or lack of it, in sending people to the conflict; I suggest that those countries could make a contribution by looking after those who have been so supportive of our armed forces. We should also support them for another good reason: if we enter into any conflicts in future, the way in which we have treated those who supported us in the current conflict will be remembered. I was on BBC Scotland on Sunday, supporting the Government's position, and I listened to an Iraqi interpreter who is in Syria. He made quite clear his disappointment with what has happened in the past, and he welcomed the Prime Minister's statement because he may now be able to leave Syria and come to the UK. That applies not just to people like him, of course, but in many cases, to their families too.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.0/8">I appreciate the fact that troop numbers in Iraq, which stood at 7,200 individuals at the beginning of 2007, had gone down to 5,500 at the start of September. That number has decreased to 4,000, and by next spring it may have gone down to 2,500. It is disingenuous of many Opposition Members not to recognise that that is a major reduction. For anyone who has been supportive of our troops in Iraq, it is a good move, and I welcome what the Prime Minister has done.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.0/9">Like most Defence Committee members, I have been to Afghanistan. I was there last year, between 2 and <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-07">7 July</phrase>, and we went not only to Afghanistan but to Pakistan. I would like to pick up on an earlier comment about the contribution of the Pakistani army. Some 800 troops of that army have been killed. Sometimes people criticise the Pakistani armed forces, when they are on the front line in many cases, and are losing troops hand over fist. They resent the criticisms, which are often made by people who should know better. When we met General Musharraf in Pakistan, he went to great lengths to explain how it is trying to support the UK and American forces and the United Nations in Afghanistan. We went to Camp Bastion and met a number of people down there. We were mortar-bombed one night, and someone had to wake me up&mdash;I am a deep sleeper. That was first-hand experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.0/10">Several hon. Members have mentioned talking to members of the armed forces and finding out from them how things are. I am a reformed smoker, which means that you can go out of the way, into back doorways, to have a cigarette, and that is where you really meet the troops. They tell you what they really think of you when they are away from their officers&mdash;smokers tend to get into direct contact with them. In all my experience of the armed forces parliamentary scheme and the Defence Committee, equipment is not an issue that has been raised with me. It is important to say that. Wages, and the conditions in married quarters, have been brought up, but conditions and equipment in conflicts have not been mentioned to me.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-10-16a.771.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" speakername="Eric Joyce" colnum="771"  time="020:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071016/debtext/71016-0015.htm#07101678000091">
	<p pid="a.771.1/1">That is absolutely right. Indeed, a Patrick Barkham article in <i> The Guardian </i>back in April dealt with this issue. Essentially, when the accommodation becomes surplus, Annington, which owns it, refurbishes it and sells it on. I might be wrong and the Minister might want to correct me, but, as I understand it, there is no formal mechanism by which those houses can be awarded to service personnel, or offered to them with some form of discount.</p>
	<p pid="a.771.1/2">In the case of RAF Coltershall, which was referred to in the newspapers, Annington agreed that half the houses would go to service personnel. <i> The Guardian </i>cited the case study of a woman and her family who literally camped out for several days to get a house, because they were required to spend 22 of every 24 hours in the queue. Her husband was in Iraq, and in order to succeed&mdash;the price had not been confirmed&mdash;they had to queue up. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that when he winds up. Although this issue is not the MOD's responsibility, I hope that it can persuade Annington to look again at whether it is appropriate to have the families of service personnel camping in a field to get a surplus house.</p>
	<p pid="a.771.1/3">Before I came to the House tonight, I visited the website of Terra Firma, a powerful and successful private equity company that I would not criticise per se, and which put together this deal. As I understand it, the Nomura bank was the primary investor. However, it did not have that English, home counties twang, so Annington&mdash;the name sounded a bit more English, and a little more acceptable to some who objected at the time to a Japanese investment bank taking over MOD quarters&mdash;was chosen as the name of the vehicle. However, that is ancient history.</p>
	<p pid="a.771.1/4">I was interested to read how Terra Firma describes what it does, and why it is so successful as a private equity vehicle. We should bear it in mind that the following was written in 1996, after 17 years of Tory government:</p>
	<p pid="a.771.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Terra Firma focuses on businesses where our views differ from the market consensus. Companies that are out of favour, usually as a result of being neglected, under-managed or under-invested by their owners.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.771.1/6">That is the state that MOD housing was in at the end of the period of Conservative government. After years of neglect, the then Government sold off housing cheap, hoping to bolster their chances at the following year's election. That clearly did not work, but the last thing on their minds when they sold those houses and created the mess that we have today, which the Labour Government are doing their very best with, was the welfare of service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.771.1/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> made a number of excellent points about garrisons. There is a danger that the big garrisons that we inevitably have now will lead, if we are not careful and do not take appropriate steps, to a greater degree of insularity, in that fewer people in civilian life will have contact with service personnel. That is why the Territorial Army is so very important. The hon. Gentleman talked, as several other Members did, about the military covenant. We need to think of it not simply as a covenant between the armed services and the Government. It is about much more than that&mdash;it is about society and the way that society is.</p>
	<p pid="a.771.1/8">Earlier, I was fiddling around with my biro, wondering about its size. It is bigger than a 5.56 mm round, but a bit smaller than 7.62 mm ammunition. However, let us say that it is the same as the latter. Looking at it, one can see the sort of bullets shot at British service personnel by enemies across the world. That is why I prefer to call the military covenant &quot;rule 762&quot;: it is easier and has a nicer ring to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.771.1/9">The term &quot;military covenant&quot; is one that people who are not acquainted with military language, acronyms and the oddities of the way we speak about service issues find hard to get their heads around. It means that service personnel&mdash;of all countries, as the concept is not confined to Britain&mdash;take extraordinary risks on behalf of their nation and that, in return, that nation honours them and looks after their unique needs. No one can argue with the concept, so the question is not whether we agree with it, but whether we observe it.</p>
	<p pid="a.771.1/10">The Royal British Legion campaign makes some valid policy points, although other elements are more arguable. Yet all hon. Members will agree that it makes an important philosophical point, and that it poses a question that society at large must answer. I do not want to sound too high minded, but I believe that all Members of Parliament, like many people outside, have a role to play in reminding the public of the extraordinary things that our service personnel do for our country. Every time people fiddle with a biro, they can use their imagination to remind themselves of the military covenant&mdash;or rule 762, if they prefer to call it that.</p>
	<p pid="a.771.1/11">Service personnel face extraordinary dangers on our behalf. The responsibility to ensure that that is remembered does not lie only with politicians or people interested in politics, but with society as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.781.3/1">We did not, actually; that was voted for by Members of this House, including some on the hon. Gentleman's side. Even those who voted against it will no doubt spend it. I am sorry, but we cannot have such one-way criticism. As the hon. Gentleman knows, I respect him, but all I am saying is that if we are considering the defence budget, we should look at everything in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.781.3/2">I turn to welfare for Her Majesty's armed forces and their families. Whenever I visit members of the armed forces, I am always impressed not only by the young men and women themselves, but by the amount of responsibility that they carry on their very young shoulders. Sadly, some of them pay the ultimate price of losing their lives or having terrible injuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.781.3/3">We have heard again tonight about the &quot;terrible&quot; situation at Selly Oak hospital. I should like to put the following on the record, as it is important. An urban myth has built up that somehow the hospital is letting down our armed forces. Given the last two occasions on which I visited, I do not think that anything could be further from the truth. The urban myth drips out of newspaper articles as if it were the truth. In <i> The Sunday Telegraph</i> last Sunday, Tim Collins wrote a good article&mdash;but sadly, he used the words:</p>
	<p pid="a.781.3/4" class="indent">&quot;As a result, the broken and injured servicemen and women are brought back to the UK to face at best indifference, at worst abuse in the mixed wards in the notorious Selly Oak Hospital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.781.3/5">I am sorry, but it is not notorious. Dedicated men and women from the armed forces and the NHS are working at the hospital. When, as part of the Defence Committee's report into medical services, we visited it recently, we saw some first-rate treatment. When I was there, I put to Julie Moore, chief executive of University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, some of the headlines that had appeared in the newspapers in the previous six months. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-02">2 October 2006</phrase>, <i> The Daily Telegraph </i>carried the headline, &quot;Muslim accosts injured Para in hospital&quot;. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-05">5 March</phrase> this year, the <i> Daily Star</i> had this one: &quot;Hero squaddie told by British hospital to strip uniform as offensive to Muslims&quot;. Finally, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-10">10 June</phrase> this year, <i> The Mail on Sunday</i> ran the headline, &quot;Muslim women abuse soldiers at troops' hospital&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.781.3/6">I put those headlines to the chief executive, because it is important to get to the truth. If the stories had been true, I would have been totally appalled by them. However, what Ms Moore said was interesting. In respect of the first headline, there were no Muslim nurses on the ward in question; in response to the article, every soldier there had been interviewed, along with representatives of the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, but nobody had complained about what had been alleged. The second article was partly true, in that people are told to take off their uniforms if they are going to get into bed. However, anyone who has been to Selly Oak will see uniformed armed forces personnel walking around, so it is simply not the case that they are not wearing uniform. For the last claim, she could find no evidence whatsoever. I put those questions again to the clinical director, Dr. David Rosser, and asked whether he could find any such instances that had really taken place. His answer was no, and neither could the chief executive. We have to deal with fact, not mythology. Before people repeat the kinds of things that they have during this debate, they should go back to the facts in question.</p>

	<p pid="a.789.0/1">It is always a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1946" name="Mark Pritchard">my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Mark Pritchard)</phrase>. I enjoyed his general strategic overview, as well as his specific points about the DLO and defence attach&eacute;s. I hope that the Minister will have answers to those questions at his fingertips when he replies. I declare an interest as a medical officer in the Royal Naval Reserve, and I am in receipt of a naval pension. We have heard 14 Back-Bench speeches today, all of which had merit, even if in some cases one had to dig a little deep to find it.</p>
	<p pid="a.789.0/2">Ministers can surely be in no doubt that the military covenant has been broken. I appreciate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2001" name="David Hamilton">the caveat that the hon. Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase> entered with regard to Scotland, but the Royal British Legion has felt it necessary to mount its &quot;Honour the covenant&quot; campaign this autumn, while a completely new organisation, the British Armed Forces Federation, was created this summer to lobby for a better deal for the service community. Unofficial forces websites have sprung up. I draw the Minister's attention particularly to the Army Rumour Service website&mdash;better known, if you will forgive me, Mr. Deputy Speaker, by its acronym ARRSE&mdash;which provides a free and frank window on the views of an increasingly dischuffed service population.</p>
	<p pid="a.789.0/3">In 25 years of service in the armed forces, I can never remember anything quite like this. It is important to acknowledge, however, that there have been times in our history when our troops have not been given the respect to which they are surely entitled. Rudyard Kipling described the plight of Tommy Atkins. Although Kipling's Tommy emerged in the 1890s, he is chiefly associated with our engagement in total war in two obvious fights for national survival. His descendants are involved in conflicts that are much more discretionary, and that do not command the support of the British public in anything like the same way.</p>
	<p pid="a.789.0/4">In my view, that means that the Government owe more than ever to today's men and women who are putting their lives on the line in pursuit of their foreign policy. That is all the more reason for disappointment at the attitude adopted by Ministers, captured perfectly by Mrs. Diane Dernie, mother of Lance Bombardier Ben Parkinson, who said of injured servicemen:</p>
	<p pid="a.789.0/5" class="indent">&quot;They are simply figures on a balance sheet. They do not have any role, any function and the MOD wants to dispose of them as cheaply as possible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.789.0/6">Meanwhile, Ben, even after Ministers have been shamed by public outcry into doubling his payment, faces a bleak future. No doubt the Minister will crow about guaranteed income payments, but on close examination those appear frugal, and for junior soldiers unrepresentative of potential future earnings. I am sorry if I detected a scoff from the Under-Secretary of State for Defence&mdash;he criticised me earlier in a rather crude intervention, if I may say so&mdash;but that is certainly the view of the service community. If he doubts that, I suggest that he look at the website to which I referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.789.0/7">It is difficult to see Labour's armed forces compensation scheme as anything other than a second-rate deal, which is inferior in important respects to elements of the preceding war pension scheme, imperfect though that undoubtedly was, and which uniquely attempts to swim against the tide of society's prevailing compensation culture. The formulaic way in which compensation is pegged ignores the fact that a broken body is so much more than the sum of constituent injuries. It addresses quality of life forgone in the most bludgeonly way imaginable and is untenable.</p>
	<p pid="a.789.0/8">The Royal British Legion is correct to point out, as we have, that the vast majority of personnel will simply not benefit from the changes announced on the hoof last week, and that the changes will not benefit those with a single devastating injury of the sort sustained by Lance Corporal Martin Edwards. As the Minister's announcement was, admittedly, by way of launching a consultation, I hope that he will listen to those with the best interests of servicemen at heart before finalising his plans; I say that in all sincerity. So far, those plans have been chaotic. We understood initially that an increase in retrospective payments was &quot;highly unlikely&quot;. If that were so, people injured in Operation Telic I to IV would have found themselves at a financial disadvantage compared with people hurt post-April 2005. Clearly, that would be a nonsense, and we understand that the MOD has been obliged to change tack.</p>
	<p pid="a.789.0/9">The United States is often held out as the exemplar in delivering the military covenant. I simply do not know why America lauds servicemen in a way that we do not. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> touched on some of the possible reasons. I am realistic enough to appreciate that the attitudinal differences between our two countries mean that our servicemen will not be patriotically ushered to the front of queues or showered with cinema tickets. But the strand of care for those who have given extraordinary service, embodied in the GI Bill and the Veterans Administration, and extended this year in the inauguration of the President's Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors, is indicative of our best friend's far more generous interpretation of the military covenant. I hope that the Minister will say what lessons he has learned from the US and how he intends to implement best practice here.</p>
	<p pid="a.789.0/10">Our armed forces are a mirror of the society from which they are drawn, yet increasingly their deal looks second-rate. What are they to make of compensation for the most severe battlefield injuries, reluctantly increased by Ministers to &pound;285,000, against nearly &pound;500,000 for an RAF typist with repetitive strain injury of the thumb?</p>

	<p pid="a.791.5/1">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for his intervention, but it does not move us much further forward. I seriously suggest that he listen to the British Armed Forces Federation and the Royal British Legion, and look at their websites. He should listen to them, not to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.791.5/2">I have to say that I am not surprised that the Royal British Legion thinks ill of an Administration whose armed forces compensation scheme is designed to shift the burden of proof in the MOD's favour, to narrow eligibility criteria and to impose onerous time restrictions on claimants? That is precisely what the scheme has done. I know Ministers mean well&mdash;I do not doubt that&mdash;but these are hardly the actions of Ministers who are falling over themselves to fulfil their side of the military covenant. In one of the most thoughtful contributions of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1579" name="Bernard Jenkin">the day, my hon. Friend the Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin)</phrase> called defence the Cinderella of public services, and I fear that he is correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.791.5/3">A number of Members mentioned housing. When I was a practising doctor I had a fair amount to do with military public health, but I never thought that as a Member of Parliament I would visit barracks that were infested with cockroaches. One young man said to me, &quot;I do not have to put up with cockroaches when I am at my mum's house, so I do not see why I should have to do so when I am living in barracks.&quot; What messages do conditions like that send to the men and women whom Ministers say they value so highly?</p>

	<p pid="a.792.3/1">No, I will not.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/2">On resettlement, personnel seeking social housing must not be disadvantaged by their peripatetic careers, as they are currently. I believe that that point was made by the hon. Member for Midlothian.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">The hon. Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> described at first hand his experience of married quarters. My experience was slightly different: we at least had indoor sanitation. My experience of health care at the point of wounding in theatre at roles 1 and 2 has been fairly positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/4">It is important for our troops to know that they will be well looked after, but we should not seek to cover up the concerns of highly experienced and respected professionals such as Lieutenant-Colonel Paul Parker of the Royal Army Medical Corps, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon who has presented us with a picture of military medicine in Afghanistan that is not rosy. His view is that medical evacuation, basic supplies in military hospitals and medical imaging in theatre are inadequate. I hope Ministers agree that the way in which they provide for our injured lies at the very heart of our military covenant.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/5">Over the weekend, the Army's top brass were accused of failing to stand up for their people. Lieutenant-Colonel Parker has certainly stood up for those in his care, and as a doctor and as an officer he deserves great credit. His report cuts through the hierarchy that surrounds Ministers and demands their critical appraisal. I hope that Ministers have satisfied themselves that any shortcomings identified by him have now been remedied, and that in so doing they have not been content simply to accept any old flannel from the general staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/6">In the last month alone 145 injured soldiers have been repatriated for treatment, yet we learn that because our UK military hospitals have now closed, soldiers are being nursed not with their comrades but alongside civilians. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury mentioned that point. The Minister must say whether that is because they have complex medical needs that demand tertiary and higher specialist medical care&mdash;which is fine&mdash;or because the new medical managed arrangements supported in all parts of the House are inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/7">My chief concern, however, is not about care in theatre&mdash;or role 3 back home at Selly Oak or in the wider NHS. My chief concern is not about health care at all; instead, it is about care, by which I mean what happens when a person is done with Selly Oak and begins to face the future with a broken body or broken mind. The announcement by Ministers of more cash for combat stress was welcome, but the fact that it was such a sudden and substantial injection more than four years after the start of Operation Telic calls into question the foresight of an MOD that has meanwhile been happy to preside over the serious erosion of uniformed military psychiatry.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1901" name="Bruce George">The right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George)</phrase> talked in his discussion of finance about Labour being on the brink of fantasy&mdash;to borrow his words&mdash;in the 1980s. He also looked forward to aircraft carriers and FRES&mdash;the future rapid effect system&mdash;as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1769" name="Mark Hendrick">the hon. Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick)</phrase>. I shall say more about that if I have time. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">My hon. Friend the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase> discussed defence equipment in her inimitable, robust and highly thoughtful fashion. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1973" name="Stewart Hosie">The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> also touched briefly on defence procurement. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1978" name="Gavin Strang">The right hon. Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang)</phrase> talked about Afghanistan and its flourishing poppy crop, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" name="Sarah McCarthy-Fry">the hon. Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry)</phrase>&mdash;if I may say so without embarrassing her, in what was a most thoughtful contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/9">Despite the debt it owes to our reserve forces, it appears that the Labour party continues to conflate the Territorial Army with the Home Guard. If anyone doubts that, they should take a look at the Home Secretary's unworthy line at the expense of the TA while playing to the gallery in Bournemouth last month. I have written to the right hon. Lady and invited her to come to the House and explain herself and apologise. I regret to have to say that, to date, she has been silent on that. Words mean what words say, and we as politicians should understand that full well. At a time when this Government's foreign policy is so heavily reliant on the TA, it behoves Ministers to choose their words carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/10">The Defence Analytical Services Agency tells us that our volunteer reserves stand at 36,000, down from 46,000 in April 2000, yet in Iraq and Afghanistan they have been employed as never before. Given their battle-proven capabilities, it seems to me that the only reason for cutting the TA is a failure to demonstrate cost-effectiveness. Therefore, during the summer I asked how much the TA costs. We learned on Tuesday how difficult it is to pin Ministers down on defence costs, but in this instance it appears that they simply do not have a clue. The Minister stated to me in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/11" class="indent">&quot;I can understand how you might feel surprised at our inability to provide information on the total cost of the Territorial Army.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/12">He is utterly right that I am surprised, because he is saying that his axemen have been hacking away at the TA without having any idea about savings that might be achieved, or whether consequential costs would need to be borne elsewhere. How can we possibly secure maximum advantage for the cash available if we have no handle on relative costings?</p>
	<p pid="a.792.3/13">Given that the Minister of State has no idea about the cost drivers within his own Department, it is hardly surprising that he cannot give timelines for procurement&mdash;as was painfully obviously apparent in his contribution last Tuesday. Without timelines, all the commitments made last week and in the July statement are no more than aspirations. That, along with the failure of defence spending&mdash;at 1.5 per cent.&mdash;to keep pace with defence-related inflation and no commensurate fall in operational tempo, means that, as the Royal United Service Institute pointed out last week, an overly optimistic comprehensive spending review is likely to be followed by defence strategic guidance for the next 10 years that will disappoint those of us eagerly anticipating carriers, FRES and attack aircraft. That is all the more reason for a proper strategic defence review. I am pleased to note that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> appears to agree with us on that&mdash;much as it pains me to have much in common with the Liberal Democrats. It seems to me that not only are the Government looking to my party to set the agenda, but the Liberal Democrats are at it as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.794.0/1">This has been a wide-ranging debate. I have always been aware of the level of expertise in the House on these issues, and I want to thank everybody for their contributions. It will not be possible for me to respond to every issue that was raised, but I will try to deal with as many as I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1901" name="Bruce George">My right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George)</phrase> treated us to a little bit of the history lesson that we have to listen every now and then in order to put into context some of the allegations that are made today. He did that very well. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" name="Don Touhig">My right hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig)</phrase> talked about the debt that we owe to our servicemen and their families, and he was particularly concerned about accommodation. He recognises&mdash;even if some Opposition Members do not&mdash;that a huge building programme is going on, and that some of the legacy issues of our single-living and family accommodation are now being dealt with. That cannot be done overnight; the neglect went on for generations. There are Members in this House who know that, yet they choose to try to deny it. However, I agree with my right hon. Friend that there are some big issues that we need to address, particularly in relation to family living accommodation and the right to buy. We are as concerned about and interested in those matters as he was when he did his job at the Ministry of Defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/3">I am sorry that I was not in the House for most of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the speech of the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase>, who talked mainly about procurement. I was a little surprised by her intimation that she is concerned that the Royal Navy is going to be dominated by the carriers. Yes, the carriers are going to be somewhat dominating features of the Royal Navy. If we want our Navy to have worldwide reach and the ability to project force around the world wherever we want it&mdash;be it air power or assault capability&mdash;the carriers and the protection force are the single most important way in which we will do that. That is why the carriers are so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> talked about the covenant and said that we have a debt to our armed forces that needs to be met. I do not disagree with him, and he knows that nobody in the ministerial team does. This is not just an issue for the Government. We need to recognise that we are paying back our armed forces for the tremendous sacrifice that they make for, and the capability that they give to, our nation. The nation also needs to recognise that. This is not an easy issue to address, and there are no quick remedies. It is not just a matter of parades, for example; we have to work on t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">his. As the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> and others in the House have said, we all have a responsibility to address this issue, to take it out to the public at large, and to ensure that we all do our best&mdash;irrespective of where we sit in this House&mdash;to connect the work being done on behalf of the nation by the armed forces with the general public, whose understanding is perhaps not all that it once was. With effort, perhaps we can make that connection again. The hon. Member for Canterbury also talked passionately about the Territorial Army, about which I know he has great concerns. I intend to sit down with him and talk through some of those issues as soon as I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/5">In a wide-ranging discussion, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2001" name="David Hamilton">my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase> talked about a lot of issues. He, too, was concerned about housing, and particularly about the priority given to our armed forces by local authorities throughout the country. He asked whether we were prepared to meet him and a delegation of Members of Parliament&mdash;and we of course are. I do not suppose that he is concerned about whether it is most appropriate for me or for another member of the ministerial team to meet that delegation. One or other of us will be more than happy to make ourselves available for a meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1769" name="Mark Hendrick">My hon. Friend the Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick)</phrase> talked about our relationship with the USA. However, he was also concerned to ensure that we should develop our co-operative capability with our European neighbours, and stressed the importance of that for the future. I agree with him in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1973" name="Stewart Hosie">The fact that the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> has certain problems was exposed in some of the interventions made during his contribution. If he thinks that he can cherry-pick the defence estate and imprint in Scotland, he will have to do some explaining&mdash;beyond this debate in the House&mdash;to the many people up there who depend on that work for their livelihood.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/8">The hon. Gentleman talked about cap badges and the history of the Scottish regiments. Of course we must honour our history, but we all know that we cannot live in it. Time moves on, and we must address the issues that face us today. There is a need for change, and although we must try to retain the golden thread that runs through our regimental history, we must also deal with the problems confronting our military in today's world.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/9">The hon. Member for North Devon talked about the situation in Iraq, and asked me to explain the statement that I made in evidence to the Defence Committee in July. He compared that with the recent statement from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, but I do not think that any explanation is necessary. I am not a military expert, and do not pretend to be. I would not come to the House and say otherwise, but the statement that I made to the Defence Committee was based on military advice given to me at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/10">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister does not pretend to have military expertise either, but the military advice that we are given, and the situation that we face, have both changed. We are now able to consider the possibility of reducing our force level in Iraq, and to plan for it. Our forces will be backed up by other forces in the region, but the level that we will maintain will be lower than that which our military advice was prepared to contemplate in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/11">The hon. Member for North Devon also talked extensively about the situation in Afghanistan. So did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1978" name="Gavin Strang">my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" name="Sarah McCarthy-Fry">my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry)</phrase>, as well as other hon. Members. It is a matter that we must look at very seriously. Sometimes, the feeling is that our military personnel take a narrow view of the matters that they are dealing with, but my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North made it very clear that that was not true of the discussions that she had had out in theatre.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/12">The House should be aware that no one is more able to take a broad view of what people in the military are able to contribute than those people themselves. They know what they can do, and they also know what must come in behind them to ensure the nation building that has to happen if we are to render Afghanistan viable in the future. That is one of the tasks that face us, and our military people understand that as well as we do. In no way do the Afghan people want the Taliban back, but we must make sure that the growing capacity of the Afghan state is seen to be a force for good, a positive force that improves the lives of the people. A lot remains to be done, and it can be done only if we adopt a comprehensive approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/13">Equally, as various hon. Members noted, we must also ensure that our own people understand what we are doing in Afghanistan. The connection is not always made between what our armed forces are doing out there and the effect on the security of people and families here at home. All of us, regardless of which party we represent, have a responsibility to make sure that people appreciate that link. We must make people understand that what is happening in Afghanistan cannot be disconnected from security at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/14">Big issues are involved in that, and they must be fully explained and understood. However, there is a convergence between heroin, organised crime and international terrorism; it is a thread that runs all the way from Afghanistan to the streets of Coventry, and the streets of every town and city in our country. The elements cannot be disconnected.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/15">I have to tell the hon. Member for North Devon that it is not true that there are no dedicated helicopters for medical evacuation in Afghanistan. Dedicated helicopters are available in the field, as I saw when I visited Bastion, so if the hon. Gentleman has been given contrary information it is untrue.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/16"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">My hon. Friend the Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> gave us much information, as well as a vivid personal insight into forces living accommodation over the generations. He gave the lie to the idea that the problems can be solved overnight. There has been ingrained, systematic under-investment over a period of time. We have made structural changes to ensure that will no longer happen, but the problems cannot be fixed overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/17"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1556" name="Kevan Jones">My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> reacted as I did to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1938" name="Liam Fox">the speech of the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox)</phrase>. Of all the speeches I heard during the debate, the two from the Conservative Front Bench were the most extraordinary. The hon. Member for Woodspring showed that he was capable of applying himself to give us analysis and a constructive view when he talked about Iran. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was sitting on the Treasury Bench at the time, and neither he nor I could disagree with what the hon. Gentleman said. However, almost all the rest of the speech that he treated us to was a catalogue of misrepresentation and abuse of the facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/18">That does not matter so much when what is said is about the Government. The hon. Gentleman deliberately and repeatedly tries to present the case that there are cuts in the defence budget. He tells people that in television and radio studios, and he told us the same thing today. He denies the fact that by the end of the current spending round, real-terms spending will be &pound;3 billion, or 10 per cent., higher than in 1997. As some of my hon. Friends pointed out, our record is in marked contrast to that of the Government the hon. Gentleman supported, who introduced defence cuts year on year during the back end of their period in office.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/19">What the hon. Gentleman says in that vein is part of the cut and thrust of politics. People do not always use facts when they are throwing politics around in this place; we misrepresent the facts and make accusations against people from time to time. However, the hon. Gentleman went on to attack civilian volunteers in theatre and, more importantly, said things about the medical facilities at Selly Oak. I think he needs to reflect on what he said, and the allegations that he made today.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.0/20">I visited Selly Oak on Monday. I talked to parents, patients, nurses, doctors and the military personnel who run that facility. I can tell the House that they are sick and tired of being used as a political football. They are angry about that. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Woodspring cannot be in the Chamber now, because I would be saying exactly the same thing to him if he was. Today he made allegations about a particular case. I will not go further. I say only this: the hon. Gentleman should read what the surgeon who dealt with the individual had to say, and he should look at the press release issued by the hospital tonight. Given that he has an expertise in this area&mdash;I am not going to attempt to second-guess medical capability&mdash;he should reflect on what he said and how he said it, and the allegations that he made.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-10-16a.800.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1998" speakername="Jimmy Hood" colnum="800"  time="022:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071016/debtext/71016-0019.htm#07101692000046">
	<p pid="a.800.2/1">I welcome the opportunity of this Adjournment debate t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">his evening. My right hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase>, when he was Home Secretary, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June</phrase> new powers to protect children from known sex offenders. Following that announcement, I said in a press release in my constituency that there are few crimes more horrific than sexual offences against children. We need to ensure that the most vulnerable group in our society is safe, and I am glad that that is at the heart of Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.2/2">The tragic murder of Sarah Payne by Roy Whiting in 2001 sparked a debate about monitoring paedophiles in the community. It was evident that the Sexual Offences Act 1997 did not go far enough, as Whiting was one of the first offenders added to that list and he murdered Sarah Payne. A similar concern regarding the shortcomings of laws on sexual offences against children was voiced in Scotland in response to the murder of eight-year-old Mark Cummings by convicted sex offender Stuart Leggate in 2004. Once again, it is believed that the loss of an innocent child's life could have been prevented had the proposed new laws been in operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.2/3">The UK has some of the strongest restrictions on child sex offenders, but as my right hon. Friend acknowledged in his statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June</phrase>, we need to do more. I hope that the Minister can tell me tonight that the new measures, which will strengthen child protection even further, are a progressive beginning of a more engaged and transparent public policy for the protection of children from known sex abusers.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.2/4">For too long, politicians have shied away from kicking over the stone of the sexual abuse of children. That may be a controversial thing to say, but in truth our society has failed its children. Whether it be the legislators, the courts, the social services, the police or any other public institution, all of us could have done more and all of us now need to do more. That is why I welcome the then Home Secretary's acknowledgement of that reality in his statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.2/5">In response, I decided to consult my constituents on their opinions on the proposals for England and Wales and to ask them if they wanted the same protection for children in Scottish law. To achieve that, the Scottish Parliament would be responsible for any changes to Scottish law, and I shall return to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.2/6">I consulted my constituents through a survey with a freepost reply. For the purpose of my survey, I wrote to a random selection of addresses in every part of my constituency. There are six multi-member local council wards in Lanark and Hamilton, East constituency and I wrote to some 8,000 households in those six communities. The distribution list was Lanark, 1,183 households; Carluke, 1,090; Larkhall, 1,256; Ashgill, 108; Forth, 640; Law Village, 406; Hamilton, 1,159; Uddingston, 651; Bothwell, 540; Carstairs/Carnwath, 493; and Cross Ford/ Kirkfieldbank, 471. The total is 7,997. That is eight times the number used in national opinion polls with an accuracy of plus or minus 3 per cent. I received a magnificent response to the survey. More than 1,300 people&mdash;more than 16 per cent. of people who were sent the survey&mdash;read the survey, answered every question, folded the answer sheet, went to the post office and posted their reply to me. I would argue that the results of the survey of my constituency are as accurate as it is possible to get.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.2/7">I shall read on to the record the questions, and the responses to them. My first question was &quot;Have you heard about the new legislation announced in the House of Commons to protect children from sex offenders?&quot; Some 68.5 per cent. of respondents said yes. The second question was &quot;Do you agree that parents or guardians should be able to request details of sex offenders in certain circumstances?&quot; and 98 per cent. of respondents said yes. The third question was &quot;Do you agree that satellite tracking should be used to monitor high risk sex offenders?&quot; to which 99 per cent. of respondents said yes. Question No. 4 was &quot;Do you think that the mandatory drug treatment should be used to reduce sexual drive in child sex offenders?&quot; and 96 per cent. of respondents said yes.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.2/8">The fifth question was &quot;Do you agree that the use of compulsory polygraph tests to ensure that child offenders are not reoffending is correct?&quot; Some 95 per cent. of respondents said yes. Question No. 6 was &quot;Do you agree that the child sex offender's conviction should be disclosed in order to protect the child?&quot; to which 97 per cent. of respondents said yes. The seventh question was &quot;Do you agree that the sex offenders register should be extended to include information on when they start relationships with a woman who has children?&quot; Some 98 per cent. of respondents said yes. My last question was &quot;Do you agree that Jim Hood MP should write to the Justice Minister asking that the legislation be introduced into Scottish law?&quot; and 97 per cent. said yes.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.2/9">In answer to my eighth question, 97 per cent. wanted the same protection for their children that children in England and Wales have, and asked me write to the Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice to request him to provide just that. I wrote to him, providing him with the results of my survey, and I invited him to respond to the wishes of my constituents. I proposed that he and the Scottish Parliament legislate to give Scottish children the protection that is being proposed for children in England and Wales. I received a reply from the Scottish Minister, and I will refer to it in a moment, but first I want to state the very obvious: this is not a party political issue. There is no place for political gimmickry, gamesmanship, or one-upmanship in a debate on how we protect children from sex offenders. When 97 or 98 per cent. of our constituents demand more protection for their children and tell their politician to get on with it, no politician can ignore those demands.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-10-16a.802.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1998" speakername="Jimmy Hood" colnum="802"  time="022:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071016/debtext/71016-0020.htm#07101692000050">
	<p pid="a.802.2/1">There may be resistance from institutions that need to accept when we have all collectively failed to protect children better. The police force is one of those institutions from which there will be mixed responses. A <i> Scotland on Sunday</i> article quoted a senior police officer as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.802.2/2" class="indent">&quot;I think our primary function is to protect children, and anything we can do to achieve that should be tried. The last thing we want is to make Scotland a soft option for paedophiles.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.802.2/3">My hon. Friend may be concerned about responses from the police force in his constituency, but I am sure that there are also police officers who share the views of that senior police officer in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.802.2/4">I was expressing my concern that Scotland could become a haven, respite, resting place or hiding place for sex abusers. Ironically, last year Jack McConnell, the former First Minister, indicated his support for such measures for Scotland, and in an article in <i> The Times </i>of <phrase class="date" code="">6 November</phrase>, the headline read, &quot;Scottish law could drive paedophiles into England&quot;. The First Minister had gone on the record in supporting similar measures proposed by the Home Secretary on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-30">30 June</phrase>, six months before he made that statement. The irony of the situation post-<phrase class="date" code="2007-06-30">30 June</phrase> is that headline in <i> The Times</i> could be reversed if Scotland's children are not given the same protection as in England and Wales. It could read, &quot;Westminster laws could drive paedophiles into Scotland&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.802.2/5">I am sure that the Scottish Justice Minister does not want or intend that to happen. I am equally sure that the Scottish Parliament will want to give maximum protection to Scottish children, as in the rest of the UK. I was comforted today, when my office spoke to the Scottish Executive, to be advised of their awareness of the need to have the same controls on both sides of the border. I hope that the Minister can assure me that she is determined to ensure that the Home Office and the Scottish Executive are singing from the same hymn sheet and that when we legislate we have the same protection for children throughout the UK.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-10-16a.803.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice"  colnum="803"  time="022:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071016/debtext/71016-0020.htm#07101692000051">
	<p pid="a.803.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1998" name="Jimmy Hood">my hon. Friend the Member for Lanark and Hamilton, East (Mr. Hood)</phrase> on securing this debate. He has raised a tremendously important issue; the fact that some Members have remained in the Chamber to listen to him is indicative of the importance that Members in this House attach to it. He is absolutely correct to highlight it as a matter of the greatest concern, not merely on a party political basis but as something that should promote cross-party agreement in many respects.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/2">I commend my hon. Friend for the work that he has done in his constituency in following up work carried out in the Home Office last year at the order of the previous Home Secretary on reviewing the protection of children from sex offenders. It is clear from the figures that he gave that the work that he has undertaken among his constituents has struck a chord, and not only because of the high response rate that he was able to tell the House that he had received following the questionnaire that he circulated. I have rarely heard of a figure as high as 68.5 per cent. when constituents are asked whether they have heard about something that the House has been doing or that the Government have been doing. I must ask him&mdash;perhaps he will tell me outside the Chamber&mdash;what measures he took to try to inform his constituents beforehand, because perhaps the Government can take a leaf out of his book. It is a tremendously high figure and one that is of course very heartening for the Government to hear. Public information and awareness of such issues is often one of the most important starting points in ensuring that, as he said, we manage to improve and increase the quality and effort that we all put into protecting children from sex offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/3">As my hon. Friend acknowledged, over the previous few years there has been much more of a recognition than ever before that dangerous sex offenders need supervision beyond merely serving the sentences that follow their criminal wrongdoing and the fact that they have been found out and convicted of sex offences. We have done much, as a Government, aimed at focusing supervision to reduce the serious potential harm that can be caused by such individuals later on in their lives having been convicted and then going on to commit further offences. Over the past years in England and Wales we have introduced a range of measures designed to protect children and the vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/4">My hon. Friend is right to say that those have been introduced on an England and Wales basis because of devolution. There has been some movement forwards in Scotland, sometimes at slightly later dates, in respect of some of these advances, but they have not all been implemented at the same time and to quite the same degree. It might be helpful if I highlight some of the current differences. It is certainly the case, as he noted, that there is always the danger that differences in law between Scotland and England and Wales may lead to effects such as he mentioned, perhaps encouraging child sex offenders to be on one side of the border rather than the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/5">As my hon. Friend is well aware, all sexual offenders in the UK are required to register under the same procedures, and each jurisdiction has the ability to apply to a court for an order that will further restrict a sexual offender's behaviour if the police can demonstrate that they present a significant risk of harm. Such orders are known as sexual offender prevention orders in England and Wales and as risk of sexual harm orders in Scotland, so there is an equivalent arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/6">The multi-agency public protection arrangements&mdash;MAPPA&mdash;established in England and Wales in 2001 as a result of the Criminal Justice and Courts Services Act 2000 were further strengthened by the Criminal Justice Act 2003. As my hon. Friend will also be aware, the police, the probation service and the Prison Service make up the responsible authority, which ensures that the management of sex offenders and seriously violent offenders is adequate in the respective areas. MAPPA is used to manage registered sexual offenders and violent offenders serving more than 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/7">In Scotland, however, MAPPA has been introduced much more recently&mdash;only in April 2007&mdash;and currently manages only registered sex offenders. The responsible authorities in Scotland are the police, prison, criminal justice and social work services and the health service. My understanding is that Scotland plans to include violent and dangerous offenders in about 18 months' time, but it is a number of years behind England and Wales in developing these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/8">There is a further difference in respect of accommodation. In England and Wales, 105 approved premises can accommodate high risk of harm level 2 and level 3 MAPPA offenders&mdash;those at the highest level of potential harm are at level 3. That includes those who have offended against children. There is no such arrangement in Scotland; rather than have approved premises, there is a national strategy on the accommodation of sex offenders. That is another slight difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/9">As my hon. Friend will know, ViSOR is a computer system used by all police forces in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as by the military police. It contains information on all registered sexual offenders and allows police forces to share that information. That is extremely important and helps to deal with some of my hon. Friend's points about the potential for cross-border movement among some of these people. If they feel that an eye is more likely to be kept on them in England than in Scotland, that might present some temptation to move north of the border. The fact that ViSOR is present and used by police across the whole of the UK shows that we are in a strong position to ensure that we know where these people are. That should provide my hon. Friend with some reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/10">Vetting and barring legislation was mentioned earlier and I would like to make it clear that the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, which establishes and seeks to implement the vetting and barring scheme and will help us to keep a much closer and up-to-date eye on those who have the capacity to cause harm to children and vulnerable adults, will be implemented in Scotland as well as in England and Wales. An equivalent arrangement will be introduced to a similar time scale to protect children by ensuring that all those who come into contact with them or vulnerable adults&mdash;either voluntarily or because they are paid to do a certain job&mdash;do not have a history of sexual, violent or abusive behaviours. It will help to ensure that any bans can be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/11">There is also some equivalence in respect of sentencing. The recently introduced indeterminate public protection sentence in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 has a parallel arrangement in Scotland, where it is called the order for lifelong restriction. The aim is the same. There are some real equivalences in the cross-border effort put into trying to improve arrangements to protect children particularly from sex offenders. I hope that my hon. Friend will find some reassurance there. However, it was quite clear from the results of the survey that he set out that his constituents feel that more needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/12">Despite the fact that the efforts of the past few years have meant that Britain is one of the leading countries in the management of sex offenders, we recognise that more can be done. That was certainly the aim of the review that the then Home Secretary commissioned last year in respect of the management of child sex offenders. It reported its findings on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-13">13 June</phrase> this year and set out 20 recommendations to further strengthen efforts to keep children safe. Work is now taking place to implement those recommendations. As a direct result of the review, that work is going ahead in respect of England and Wales, and the Scottish Parliament will consider parallel work.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/13">I was glad to hear my hon. Friend say that he has been in touch&mdash;I am sure, very robustly and in detail&mdash;with the Justice Minister. To start with, when I saw my hon. Friend's survey, I thought that he might mean me, and I was trying to remember whether I had had any such letter from him. So I was relatively relieved, even though I could not remember receiving such a letter, when I realised that he was talking about the Justice Minister in the Scottish Parliament. If anyone heard a sigh of relief, that was me realising that I was off the hook. Of course, devolution has many benefits; it enables jurisdictions to make their own rules and do their own thing in many ways. It also enables Ministers in the House to sit and listen to what is effectively an argument that is really going on elsewhere.</p>
