<p>I am sorry that the right hon. Gentleman, whose deep interest in these matters is well known to the House, should have found the Treasury pedantic.

<p>Does my hon. and learned Friend agree that working widows have a strong case for tax relief on part of their pension?

<p>I recognise that the point made by my hon. Friend on behalf of that group, for whom the whole House has sympathy, is felt with great force by it.

<p>I refer the hon. Member to February's economic progress report article. That notes that each increase of 100,000 in the level of unemployment in the private sector costs the Exchequer some &#x00A3;340 million in terms of direct tax forgone and increased benefit payments. If unemployment occurs in the public sector, there could be savings rather than costs.<br/>
The hon. Member should also note the comment made in the article that such estimates cannot be grossed up to give an estimate for all those at present unemployed.</p>

<p>Is the Minister aware that his misguided efforts to cut public expenditure, because they increase unemployment, are self-defeating? Is he aware that the research done for me by the Library, using the Treasury model and the survey to which he has referred, shows that the current cost of the unemployment queues is about &#x00A3;8&#x00BD; million? Does he agree that if he were to increase demand in the economy and take steps to see that at the same time that did not slacken imports, it would put the country back to work, increase wealth and cut the public sector borrowing requirement?</p>

<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would not wish to ascribe to the Library the errors that he has made. The article made clear that it is utterly misleading to gross up the total and to arrive at the cost that way. Indeed, the reason is simply that the figure in question is that of a net addition to the total.<br/>
On the more general point, simply to spend the large sums of money advocated by the hon. Gentleman would lead to higher taxation, higher borrowing, higher interest rates and damage to the economy.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that it would make a difference to the question of these resources being used to ease unemployment among young people if 16 to 18-year-olds were taken out of the collective bargaining system and instead paid a standard allowance for whatever they were doing?</p>

<p>Does the Minister agree that while there may be enormous variations between different individuals who are unemployed, other research&#x2014;the results of which are available in the Library&#x2014;shows that the cost to the Exchequer of unemployment for an adult male is &#x00A3;4,500 a year?

<p>I am always happy to enter into correspondence with my hon. Friend. However, I do not have the specific figure available.

<p>After all the obfuscation and stonewalling of recent weeks and months on this interesting question of


the cost of unemployment, is the Chief Secretary aware that we were glad to see the article in the economic progress report? Is that not patently an understatement of the true cost? Will the right hon. and learned Gentleman say why, for example, the cost to the Exchequer of the additional one-third who are unemployed for every 100,000 who are registered unemployed, is not added in terms of their failure to be able in future to contribute income tax payments? Is it not also true that indirect tax costs&#x2014;certaintly those that are attributed to an inability to pay VAT and excise duties&#x2014;could easily have been included in the figures? If the right hon. and learned Gentleman can produce figures for 100,000 unemployed, why cannot he give reasonable estimates for the total cost of the 2&#x00BD; million unemployed?</p>

<p>I shall give a short reply. The answer to the right hon. Gentleman would appear to be that when there is no estimate he complains, and when a serious article is published setting out the figures, he still complains.<br/>
Much depends on the cause of the unemployment. One cannot take those indirect factors into account. If, for example, the cause of unemployment were an increase in productivity, the effect would be quite different from where the cause was a different one.</p>

<p>The hon. Member recites a number of the many reasons why lower interest rates are desirable.

<p>It is true, as my hon. Friend points out, that measured against the substantial fall in inflation in recent months, interest rates have become more positive. That is one of the factors that we have to bear in

<p>Minimum lending rate is still at 14 per cent. If the rate of inflation is running at somewhere below 10 per cent., that is a vast discrepancy.

With results such as that declared by ICI today&#x2014;when even that firm has been running at a loss in the last six months&#x2014;surely it is time that he acted.

<p>On the second point, my right hon. and learned Friend has indicated that that is a relevant consideration.

<p>While the Chief Secretary is being re-educated in the facts of economic life by his hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Patten) and others, will he bear in mind that scaremongering about the size of the public sector debt, part of the Conservative attack on the Welfare State, has not only made financing of the public sector more difficult, but bears little relationship to the facts, and that, as a percentage of gross domestic product, this year's public sector borrowing requirement will still be at 6 per cent, historically? I accept that that is not as high as in previous years. Will he bear in mind, too, that the real value of the national debt, far from increasing, has declined by one-third since 1966.</p>

<p>Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman believe that either the cut in interest rates, which he appears to be planning in the Budget, or the end of de-stocking, which is not yet in sight, can produce a significant fall in unemployment?

<p>One of the most important reasons for expecting growth to resume and unemployment to fall in due course is the fall in inflation. If within a constant money supply inflation is falling, that in itself is likely to add substantially to activity in the economy. The second factor that makes a useful contribution is the continued maintenance of moderation in pay settlemants which has moved a long way in recent months. That will help to reduce the unit labour costs of British output and increase the chances of sales and therefore increase output and employment.</p>

<p>I understand that Lonrho representatives met Department of Trade officials this morning.

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That this House deplores the worsening crisis in the textile, clothing and footwear industries which is caused by Government economics, industrial and trading policies.</q>
I shall seek to be brief so that a number of hon. Members on both sides of the House may take part in the debate.<br/>
Manufacturing industry in this country is in a terrible crisis. The year 1980 saw the most rapid fall in output since the Second World War, and, as 2,400,000 of our fellow citizens are painfully aware, we are returning to the unemployment levels of the inter-war years. That is bad enough. But perhaps the most depressed sector of our depressed manufacturing industry is that of the textile, clothing and footwear industries. It looks as though well over 100,000 jobs have been lost in those industries in the course of 1980&#x2014; 40,000 jobs in the clothing industry alone. Therefore, in one year about 10 per cent. of the work force of those industries has gone. In recent months, and over the last year, we have seen a spate of large closures, with firms such as ICI and Courtaulds shedding labour at an alarming rate.<br/>
There can be no doubt, therefore, that these industries are in deep crisis. I regret to say that there appears to be no sign of improvement. Indeed, the fear and despondency running throughout those industries were evident in the large lobby of Parliament which the TUC organised last week. I am sure that many hon. Members will know at first hand, either from their constituents or from their constituency interests, of the worry which the management and work force in those industries feel about their immediate economic future.<br/>
There is also no doubt that the sharp acceleration in the decline of those industries has been caused by the Government's economic and industrial policies. First, the over-valued pound has hit exports particularly badly. I believe that that situation will get worse in the months to come. It has also had the effect of cheapening and stimulating imports, which is a recurrent problem in those industries.<br/>
Regrettably, a large amount of distress borrowing has also taken place, and that has been badly affected by the chronically high interest rates from which we are suffering as a result of the Government's monetarist policies. In those industries we also see the effect of depressed demand. Those industries are particularly sensitive to cycles of consumer demand, and at present they are being hard hit. We should not forget the retreat from an effective regional development policy&#x2014;again, one of the strands of Government policy. That has particularly hit industries that are located in many of our older industrial areas.</p>

<p>Does not my right hon. Friend agree that it is not just the Government's economic policy which has done positive harm to the textile industry, but also their appallling complacency in the face of often-repeated complaints from firms such as Courtaulds, in my own constituency, where 150,000 men and women were made redundant last week? They have repeatedly told the Government that they were suffering from a high exchange rate, artificially high interest rates and a disastrous artificial energy policy. It has been the Government's failure to act in the face of those repeated protestations of distress from the industry which places more of a responsibility on the Government.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing that matter to our attention, and also for reminding us of the effects of the Governments energy policy and the lack of any form of assistance to industry in the shape of relief from high energy prices. Some of those industries are suffering particularly in that regard.<br/>
In what I think will be the Secretary of State's first textile debate since he took office, I hope that he will show some of that flexibility which he was urging others to adopt in a recent television interview. I hope that we shall see some "constructive pragmatism", and examples of all the other phrases which are flying about the Conservative Party at the present time. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will take on board some of the serious problems which the industries are facing.<br/>
I turn to the question of trading policies. I should like to mention briefly the multi-fibre arrangement. Some of my hon. Friends and some Conservative Members may wish to debate the details of that. We know that it takes a fairly long time to work up to the multi-fibre arrangement negotiations. I do not expect the Government to make explicit statements about their attitude or negotiating position today, but I hope that they will listen to the House. In particular, I hope that they will study carefully the possibility of getting some form of recession clause in the new multi-fibre arrangement.<br/>
Above all, we ought to seek to have the levels of imports related to the circumstances of the domestic market. I hope that the Government will take that matter on board and seek to pursue it in the negotiations.<br/>
As to trading, the main disruptive effect over the last year or two, particularly for the textile and clothing industries, has come not from the traditional low-cost producers, but from a large surge of imports from the United States. That has caused a sharp) turn-round in our trade balance.</p>

<p>There are many problems associated with the multi-fibre arrangement of which that is one. There is also the problem of outward processing as well as the problem of free circulation. Many difficulties are involved in what is basically a good framework agreement. We ought to learn from our experience of the difficulties, encountered under successive Governments, of enforcing some aspects of the MFA. The Government should seek to try to block some of those loopholes if they can in the forthcoming negotiations.<br/>
I do not underplay the importance of the MFA at all. However, in this debate we ought to turn our attention to the problem of the United States. We have seen a sharp acceleration in imports from the United States. Of course, the benefit of the relationship between the pound and the dollar is itself the result of the Government's economic and financial policy. However, the sharp stimulus to American exports to the United Kingdom, particularly in bed linen and articles such as that, has derived from America's cheap energy pricing policies and from the unfair advantage which America has conferred on itself as a result of its energy pricing policies.<br/>
That was recognised some time ago. During the negotiations on the Tokyo round the Council of Ministers, at the instance of the United Kingdom Government, was persuaded to pass a resolution about this problem. It was linked to the conclusion of the multilateral trade negotiations. The Council resolution of 3 April 1979&#x2014;only a month or so before the general election&#x2014;was as follows:
<q>In the event that artificial differences in the price of energy and petroleum raw materials available to certain world synthetic fibre producers lead to, or threaten to lead to, a disruption of the Community textile market, the Community will have recourse, without delay, to the appropriate provisions of GATT.</q>
The present Government did not follow up that resolution, which was a wise precaution taken by the previous Government. It was reported to the House on 4 April 1979, and we made clear the importance that we attached to some action being taken by the Community to deal with the rapidly emerging problem posed by American exports.<br/>
For months after that, the Government did nothing in the Council of Ministers or elsewhere. Finally, in 1980, we got some quotas on some of the sensitive items. Quotas were imposed on polyester filament yarn and nylon carpet yarn, but not on tufted carpets. We argued at the time that those quotas were too high and that it was largely a case of shutting the door after the horse had bolted from the stable.<br/>
On the other hand, at the end of the year we found that the Government were not renewing the quotas at all for 1981, thus leaving the industry without any protection whatever. The Government said that we need not worry so much about that because a new initiative was being taken by the European Commission with the United States Administration which they thought would lead to a resolution of the problem. Those consultations have taken place, but I am afraid that from the report given to the February meeting of the Council of Ministers it now looks as if that initiative is a total failure and that the Community has made no impact whatever on the United States Administration.<br/>
I draw the attention of the House briefly to what was said at the meeting of the Council of Ministers. The Commission drew attention to the American intention to decontrol oil prices. That was nothing new. It had existed before and it took a long time coming. It drew attention to the American Administration's decision to decontrol gas prices over a long time. However, we know the difficulty there&#x2014;the President proposes but Congress disposes. Some effective lobbying will take place in the United States, and it will be surprising if we see any rapid movement on gas prices. I think that that advantage will remain with the United States. Reference was made to an intention to remove restrictions on naphtha exports, but they are of little relevance to the textile industry.<br/>
The worst part of all was when the Commission solemnly reported to the Council of Ministers that the United States Administration undertook to convey the concern of the European textile industry to the American industry. All that it is doing is conveying concern.<br/>
It is interesting to note what was said in the European press about that and what was said in the American press. "Europe", a journal in the EEC said:
<q>Council notes encouraging results of textiles consultations".</q>
An article in an American newspaper, the <i>Daily News Record,</i> of 11 February 1981, states:
<q>The Reagan Administration has told the European Economic Community that it won't press U.S. textile and apparel firms to restrict exports to Europe despite European pressure for such crackdown.</q>
<q>After two days of meetings here, top trade negotiators from the EEC left Tuesday without achieving their main goal: winning assurances from the White House that European-bound exports would be curtailed.</q>
<q>The European team, headed by Sir Roy Denman, the EEC's director general for external relations, was told politely that the U.S. couldn't 'under any circumstances' ask for such restraints at this time &#x2026; The Europeans were equally unsuccessful in winning Administration assurances on another contentious issue: U.S. deregulation of natural gas.</q>
It is clear that the United States has not paid the slightest attention to the representations made by the European Commission. It is equally clear that the problem of unfair trading will continue into the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Does not the right hon. Gentleman accept that there is room for negotiation with the United States? In 1978, the flow of knitted fabric was a mere trickle. In the next year its value rose to &#x00A3;17 million. There is a duty on English worsteds and woollens of 45 per cent. in addition to a strict quota. There should be room for manoeuvre between the Governments so that our products have greater opportunities when it comes to penetrating the American market.</p>

<p>I hope that the Government will achieve something along those lines. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman has drawn our attention to the fact that the United States has a protected textile market. Anybody who believes that there is international free trade in textiles is living in cloud-cuckoo-land. All the major consumers of textiles are protected in one way or another. The United States is not slow when it comes to seeking protection for its industry. Nor is it slow to seek export markets. The American textile industry is making a determined export drive. That drive has proved far too successful and has obtained a large share of the British market.<br/>
When the Minister told us that the Government were not pursuing quotas, he was asked what would happen if the initiative failed. My hon. Friend the Member for

Norwood (Mr. Fraser) asked what would happen if the Government did not get anywhere with the American Administration. The Minister replied:
<q>If the initiative fails, we have open to us a range of options under article XIX of GATT and elsewhere. We would consider those in the light of any failure."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 15 December 1980; vol. 996, c. 49&#x2013;50.]</q>
The Secretary of State might as well be honest with the House. He can tell us that the initiative has failed and that the United States will not budge. There is ample evidence to show that. Unfortunately, the Minister of State was not in the Chamber when I quoted an American newspaper article, but his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade heard me. Will the Secretary of State tell us precisely what is happening about the negotiations? What does the right hon. Gentleman propose to do if they end in failure, as I believe they will? The Government must spell out their position. They must tell us what action they intend to take to defend the interests of our industry. After all, the quotas were not replaced on the understanding that this initiative would take place.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Gillingham (Sir F. Burden) reminded us, there is no international free trade for textiles. Countries must look robustly towards the protection of their own interests. The Government should bear in mind that if they are weak about dealing with imports that flood in from the United States they will gravely weaken their hand when they negotiate with the low-cost producers from less prosperous parts of the world. Why should there be any restrictions on their products, they will say, when the richest nation in the world is allowed such free and ready access to our markets? It is in the interests of the Government's trading policies that they should take a firmer and more robust line with the United States.</p>

<p>I do not necessarily dissent from the right hon. Gentleman's view. However, if we take action against the United States of America over textiles, is the right hon. Gentleman worried or concerned about any backlash that might affect, for example, British Aerospace? We already have some difficulty breaking into the American market and the Americans might take action against successful industries, such as British Aerospace, and prevent them from intervening in their market.</p>

<p>I had not noticed such a connection, but under the multilateral trade negotiations I believe the Americans have entered into certain agreements about aerospace products. One would expect them to adhere to them. However, one must have an effective policy and one must make judgments. We cannot lie down every time the United States vigorously asserts its interests.<br/>
This year is important, because we are approaching the renegotiation of the MFA. the Government must start to lobby opinion within Europe. They must take a strong and determined line, because the problem is serious.<br/>
With regret, we feel obliged to highlight the sad state of the textile, clothing and footwear industries. However, we have a duty to draw the attention of Parliament and of the nation to the rapid and accelerating decline in employment, business opportunities and confidence. Those businesses constitute one of the worst hit sectors of manufacturing industry. It is vital that the Goverment should reverse their economic and industrial policies,


which are aggravating the problem. They should follow a robust trading policy that protects the interests of these important industries, which are also large employers.<br/>
I hope that the Secretary of State will take his own medicine. Following the interview that he gave on Sunday and the advice that he gave to his colleagues to be flexible, I hope that he will announce some changes in the Government's policy, the difficulty is that at the time the Secretary of State said that he advised people not to listen to what the Government said but to watch their actions. I am prepared to make an exception in the right hon. Gentleman's case. We shall listen to what he says this afternoon, and we might even believe it.</p>

<p>I beg to move, to leave out from "That'' to the end of the Question and to add instead thereof:
<q>this House acknowledges the difficult trading conditions facing the textile, clothing and footwear industries; notes the measures which the Government has taken to give these industries a wide range of protection; and believes their future is best assured by these measures and the pursuit of realistic policies designed to lower the rate of inflation and maintain access to export markets.</q>
At the outset of the debate there was a call for brevity, and above all for brevity from the Front Benches. The right hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North (Mr. Smith) made a commendably brief speech, which lost nothing on that account. I hope that I shall emulate his example. The right hon. Gentleman understandably said that part of the problem derived from the Government's general economic policy and that another part derived from the specific trading situation that faces the footwear, textile and clothing industries.<br/>
I turn to the general economic background. The hon. Member for Ormskirk (Mr. Kilroy-Silk) intervened earlier and reinforced the right hon. Gentleman's observation that there was anxiety about the minimum lending rate and about the exchange rate. Clearly no comments that I make can in any way indicate the next moves, but it is worth placing on record that the minimum lending rate has come down by three percentage points from its previous high level. It now stands at 14 per cent. There is real concern and anxiety that it should be reduced further in so far as that is consistent with the prudent financing of the public sector borrowing requirement. The House should take note that the minimum lending rate now stands above the retail price index. In so far as the minimum lending rate is an anticipatory figure, it is interesting to note that the retail price index is on a declining path, and the Treasury

forecast that it will stand at 11 per cent. by the autumn of this year. That evidence can be reinforced by the fact that the current inter-bank lending rate is less than 13 per cent. Although no comments, commitments or hints can be given, the evidence speaks for itself.</p>

<p>What I said was absolutely clear. I do not need to trespass upon the time of the House by elaborating further.<br/>
I am happy to turn now to the question of the exchange rate, because that has featured more in our debates than has MLR. In the 22 months since we took office there has been a tremendous increase in the exchange rate. However, the extent to which that position has adjusted in the recent past is not quite realised. The exchange rate of sterling against the dollar rose from May 1979 to a peak in October 1980, and showed an increase of 17 per cent. Since then, it has fallen back by 8 per cent. Therefore, half of the increase has now been adjusted.<br/>
The same is not necessarily true of the exchange rate against a basket of currencies. It rose 19 per cent. between May 1979 and February this year. There has been some fall-back, but nothing as dramatic as that against the dollar. I quote the dollar because on the evidence of the right hon. Gentleman, a great deal of debate has been about the American position relative to British textiles.<br/>
Oil is a major factor in determining our exchange rate. A number of hon. Members have observed that it is widely believed that MLR also contributes. The position that I have outlined for MLR can also be taken in the context of the exchange rate. We all know, and have experienced, the difficulties caused by an appreciating exchange rate. But let us never conceal from ourselves that there are also problems for industry in a depreciating exchange rate. We have only to look across the Channel to see the present German experience with the deutschemark. On 20 February the <i>Financial Times</i> quoted Count Lambsdorff as saying to the German Bundestag:
<q>However a survey of 14,000 companies by the Chamber of Commerce makes clear that the weaker mark has not necessarily brought across-the-board competitive advantages. The currency's weakness had led to increased energy and raw material import costs, squeezing profit margins.</q>
I make that point because it must be set in the balance so that we do not proceed with too exaggerated ideas about the consequences of alterations in the exchange rate.</p>

How is it helping the Dunlop workers in Walton, some of whom are also facing redundancy? What help is being given by the Government? Is it not the Government's overall policy that has led to the position where consumers are unable to buy the product, resulting in wholesale redundancies and a reduction in the work force?</p>

<p>I am a good-natured person, and I have accommodated a fair speech within my speech. I shall try to deal with those points as I discuss the industries themselves. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will not think me discourteous if, in the interests of the House, I quite reasonably try to limit myself in time and make my speech in my way.<br/>
I turn to the industries identified in the motion. In all parts of the House there is an understanding of the difficulties that have confronted the footwear industry, partly relating to the exchange rate and interest rates, partly to the level of domestic demand, and partly to the challenge of imports. The question of imports has featured largely in industry debates. About 50 per cent. of the low-cost imports are under various restraints, either formal quotas, Government-to-Government voluntary restraint arrangements, or inter-industry agreements. The Department of Trade's anti-dumping unit is ready to advise the footwear and textile industries whenever they feel that a case can be made, and that there needs to be representations to the European Commission, which has authority in these matters. I wish to emphasise what has been emphasised by my predecessors, namely, that we believe that the European Commission anti-dumping staff should be expanded to enable them to operate more effectively.<br/>
Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet the footwear economic development committee. Its chairman, Mr. Spencer Crookenden, and several members of his committee pressed upon me the importance that they attached to both the minimum lending rate and the sterling exchange rate. I am sure that they are valid arguments. I have taken them on board.</p>

<p>We should be happy to entertain any representations from the industry on that point. If my hon. Friend wants to contact me about it, I shall see what can be arranged.<br/>
I turn to the textiles and clothing industries. In a sense, they inevitably dominate such debates. The difficulties for those industries are similar to those that I outlined for the footwear industry&#x2014;a low level of domestic demand, problems of exchange rate and minimum lending rate, and imports. The textile industry is not homogeneous. Very often the import controls can cause problems for certain aspects of the industry. There is not a united and singularly identifiable view of the interests of the textile and clothing industries in relation to trade regulations.<br/>
I shall give an example of that so that the House can take it into its judgment. I am not doing any more than that. There was much discussion about the necessity of imposing quotas on polyester filament yarn and nylon carpet yarn, and temporary quotas were introduced in February 1980. We should bear two points in mind. First, those quotas created problems for United Kingdom manufacturers who use those products as raw materials. Secondly, and perhaps more significant, former President Carter, in September 1980, threatened to double almost United States tariffs on wool textiles if the quotas were maintained. That is one of the facts of international trade life. If we are not prepared to acknowledge that, we are taking a dangerously narrow view. I am glad that I have the nodding acquiescence of the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Wainwright). I am sure that he will agree that, notwithstanding that we share that anxiety, there is no doubt that there is a widespread concern in the House about the role that imports have played in causing acute disruption in the British market in the past.</p>

<p>The next area for movement must be in respect of natural gas. The position not merely of the United Kingdom Government but of our sister nation Governments within the community is well-known in Washington. On 24 February, in <i>The Times,</i> the United


States trade representative, Mr. Brock, was reported as saying that he was fully aware and "most sympathetic" to Britain's fibre import problems. He continued:
<q>We intend to work in the direction of decontrol of natural gas and we hope to take other steps that might prove to have greater short-term benefits.</q>
This is an issue that is in the grip of Congress and does not lie within Presidential authority. Nevertheless, our position is clear. We are able to use such advantages as are conferred by a new Administration to persuade them, as the hon. Member for Huddersfield, East says, of the inherent logic of what we are suggesting.<br/>
The Department of Trade anti-dumping unit is cooperating with the industry in preparing for the Commission a case on bed linen. Relations with the United States are causing more anxiety in the textile world than traditional arguments concerning the multi-fibre arrangement and many of the low-cost producers. The motion refers to the textile and clothing industries, yet 40 per cent. of our imports come from the European Community.<br/>
I am aware that there is anxiety that certain national aid schemes are being proposed within the European Community that might add to the competitive disadvantage for British manufacturers. That is true of Belgium, France and Holland. I am sure that the House will be gratified to know that under article 93 of the Treaty of Rome action is being taken against the Dutch proposals. I am sure that those who watch these developments as vigilantly as the right hon. Member for Salford, West (Mr. Orme) will be keen to maintain our national position.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend agree with me that one of the underlying problems that industry generally, and particularly both these industries, suffers from is our membership of the Common Market? Having a stronger currency because of our North Sea oil, we have a completely different trading environment from that of other countries in the EEC. We are locked into this institution. Their objectives may be different from ours. We have no trading policy of our own and we are unable to look after our own industries so long as we combine in that institution in the way that we do at the moment.</p>

<p>No, I shall not give way. I have been tolerably fair by the House, in the interests of those who wish to contribute to the debate.<br/>
We are proceeding to the enlargement of the European Community. It is important to have satisfactory transitional arrangements for textiles during the negotiations for Spanish and Portuguese membership. This would

be preferable to depending purely on the general safeguard article in the Treaty of Accession, as in the arrangements concluded for Greece by the Labour Government.<br/>
I turn to the renewal of the multi-fibre arrangement. The right hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North said that this was not an occasion when he expected detailed consideration of the current arrangements or the prospective replacement arrangements. The Government have received many representations about what the new arrangements should contain. Some have been from the industry and its spokesmen, such as the British Textile Confederation and the British Clothing Industry Association. Others have been from groups with quite different interests but which have a right to be heard, such as the Consumers Association, the Retail Consortium and organisations committed to Third world economic development. Many of these submissions have been very valuable, and we hope that they will continue.<br/>
We have received a good many inquiries about the British Government's objectives in the negotiations. The Government's position on their broad aims is perfectly clear. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has said that we want an effective and vigorous arrangement, and that is what we intend to get.<br/>
When we come to specific issues&#x2014;there are many of them&#x2014;we must not lose sight of the fact that the United Kingdom is one party of many to the negotiations. The first stage will be to establish a common position within the European Community. In these complicated negotiations, we must, if we are to get the best possible deal for the United Kingdom, be prepared to negotiate flexibly, taking advantage of opportunities as and when they occur. I do not believe that the House will wish me to lay down rigid and detailed negotiating objectives, still less to reveal them publicly. However, the House has made clear on a number of occasions the major areas of interest. Today's debate is but one of several occasions when the problems of the textile industry and the multi-fibre arrangement have been discussed.<br/>
Views have been expressed about the working of the basket extractor mechanism, about the distribution of quotas between low-cost supplying nations and, perhaps most clearly of all, about the desirability of a recession clause.</p>

<p>There are certainly substantial technical difficulties in devising an effective recession clause. My predecessor observed to the House in July 1980, when answering a question from my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster (Mrs. Kellett-Bowman), that a recession clause in MFA III would be a central matter for negotiation. Nothing in the intervening months diminishes the force of his remarks.<br/>
There are many more specific matters to which our negotiators will have to address themselves in the coming months. I do not propose to take any more of the time of the House. We shall go into the negotiations determined to secure a good and effective arrangement and to obtain the best possible deal for the United Kingdom as a whole.<br/>
The House has before it an Opposition motion. It is the privilege and the obligation of the Opposition to oppose and to raise the level of controversy. However, for all the complaints about the trading arrangements that are central to the debate, the multi-fibre arrangement is an inheritance


that the Opposition provided when in Government. The measures of unilateral control that could be sought under article 19 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were used but once by the Opposition when they were in power for four years. Let us be under no illusion. The difficult problems in this industry are being used for shameless opportunism, which is the hallmark of the hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Garrett) and his colleagues on the Front Bench.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1804451" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1981-02-26a.991.0" hansard_membership_id="9184" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18472" speakername="Mr. James Molyneaux" colnum="991" time="16:31:00">
<p>During 1980 about 4,000 jobs were lost in the textile, clothing and footwear industries in Northern Ireland, and a large number of employees are now on short-time working. Employers feel that the short-time working compensation scheme is of very little assistance to them in providing real jobs as opposed to phoney jobs. It is regarded as an alternative form of payment of dole money by the Government. Employers and employees would favour a return to the temporary employment subsidy, which they say was of real value in avoiding both redundancies and closures.<br/>
Those same employers, employees and, indeed, former employees, cannot be blamed for asking, when vast sums of money are being made available to British Leyland, British Steel and De Lorean, whether it is too much to expect that very limited assistance might be given to traditional and relatively small industries in Northern Ireland to assist them in their temporary difficulties. At the risk of embarrassing the Government Front Bench, perhaps I might add that in the changed circumstances, and in the light of some fresh thinking in the past week, they might take this point on board. If I might make a simple request to them, perhaps we might be allowed to have sight of the new spring guide.<br/>
On 30 July 1980 I entered a plea on behalf of the textile industry in Northern Ireland. Since then the giants&#x2014;Courtaulds, ICI and British Enkalon&#x2014;together with many smaller companies, have slipped badly, some of them, I am afraid, past the point of no return. In that debate I stressed the urgency and importance of shaking ourselves free of the EEC restrictions on our ability to defend our national interests.<br/>
As one who has always been opposed to the Common Market, I might give a gentle fan to that side wind to which the Secretary of State referred earlier. It is true that the very limited February 1980 restriction permitted by the EEC Commission has proved to be inadequate. The right hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North (Mr. Smith), the spokesman for the Opposition, rightly said that the more recent approach to the American Administration has also been abortive. As he further said, the up-to-date position with regard to the American Administration is also very unsatisfactory because it is clear to all of us that they have no intention of limiting their exports&#x2014;dumping might be a better term.<br/>
We on this Bench have consistently reminded the House, and I hope hon. Members will forgive me for devoting not more that two minutes to this topic, that the greatest single burden on the Northern Ireland economy as a whole is the high cost of energy. On 15 January 1981, at column 1524, my hon. Friend the Member for Armagh (Mr. McCusker) reminded the House that the cost differential between the two parts of the kingdom was between 25 and 35 per cent. I must put again to every right

hon. and hon Member this question: how would they feel if energy costs in their constituencies were 30 per cent. higher than those in neighbouring counties?<br/>
The House will be accustomed to Ministers seeking to justify the denial to Northern Ireland of one very important United Kingdom asset, namely, North Sea gas. Hitherto the excuse has been that the remit of the British Gas Corporation did not extend to Northern Ireland and therefore the corporation was under no obligation to provide supplies there. That may have been regarded as sufficient excuse for successive Governments and successive Ministers who were determined to pursue a do-nothing policy. Admittedly they were motivated in that do-nothing attitude, an attitude which perhaps requires very little motivation, by the belief that there would be great difficulty in finding the financial resources to meet the cost of a pipeline to Northern Ireland.<br/>
After the passage yesterday of the Gas Levy Bill that feeble excuse has been blown out of the water by a member of the Government, the Under-Secretary of State for Energy, who rejected an Opposition amendment on the ground that it would have the effect of permitting the British Gas Corporation to retain &#x00A3;130 million profit which it did not really need. He reinforced the point by saying that the corporation would be investing no less than &#x00A3;4,000 million, presumably in the three years covered by the Gas Levy Bill.<br/>
All that raises the question why the British Gas Corporation, with all this money at its disposal, could not in the past have found the trivial sum required for a gas pipeline to Northern Ireland. However, we are at the point today where the attitude of the British Gas Corporation is no longer our concern. The ball is now firmly in the court of the Treasury. It is widely known that some Whitehall Departments disclaim any responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs, for understandable reasons. The Treasury is not among them. Like the Foreign Office, the Treasury keeps its finger in the Northern Ireland pie.<br/>
Like the citizens of Great Britain, we are all forced to join the Inland Revenue club, and we are denied the right to resign if our subscriptions are thought to be out of all proportion to the benefits derived. In the matter of North Sea gas, the Treasury will benefit to the tune &#x00A3;1,300 million during the three years covered by the Gas Levy Bill.<br/>
I promised to be brief, and I end by making a simple plea to the Secretary of State. I put to him the not unreasonable request that he will put to his friends&#x2014;and he is not without friends and contacts in the Treasury&#x2014;the simple request that we should not be denied one-thirteenth of that vast sum for the provision of a pipeline to enable industry and the citizens of Northern Ireland to have access to energy on the same terms and at the same cost as the rest of the United Kingdom. If the Secretary of State cannot give us some real hope in that regard tonight I shall have to advise my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote, for quite separate reasons, for the motion put forward by the official Opposition.</p>

<p>I am profoundly sad, because we are debating the plight of industries that are of strategic importance to this country. I am also profoundly sad because successive Governments have ignored the appeals and requests of industries that have invested when Governments have asked them to


invest, have always had an excellent history of industrial relations and have a work force that is loyal to their respective industries, unlike practically any other industry in the country. I am also profoundly sad because tonight I shall be voting against my Government on their amendment; if the amendment is carried and if there is a second vote, I shall then vote against the Government again.<br/>
The Government fail to appreciate the problems of the textile, clothing and footwear industries in certain regions. Need I remind my right hon. Friend that the textile and clothing industry is still one of the major industries of the country, despite the massive redundancies of recent years? Need I remind my right hon. Friend&#x2014;whose speech gave me a slight glimmer of hope, but not enough to persuade me to change my decision&#x2014;that the industry employs approximately 650,000 people? The cotton and allied sector, with which I am particularly concerned as chairman of the cotton and allied group in the House of Commons, employs 44,000 people.<br/>
I ask my right hon. Friend to compare those statistics with the statistics of the coal mining industry, which is to benefit from a substantial Government handout in the near future. That industry employs 230,000 people and is receiving special Government consideration. I understand that it is likely that the package could involve a reduction in coal imports. I hope that the British Government&#x2014;not the English, Welsh, Irish or Scottish Government&#x2014;will give the same consideration to the British textile and clothing industry.<br/>
May I remind my right hon. Friend that more than 100,000 jobs were lost in 1980 in the textile and clothing industry, and 20,000 jobs were lost in the cotton and allied sector? That is 30 per cent. of the total employed in that sector.<br/>
Most of the remaining mills are working well below capacity. Many are on a three-day or four-day working week, while others which previously worked multi-shifts have cut out weekend and night shifts. These are all capital-intensive units which need maximum throughput to spread their overhead costs. A major overhead in the most recently equipped mills is the interest charge on capital borrowed to buy new plant and equipment. That is why I was delighted that the right hon. Member for Lanarkshire, North (Mr. Smith) raised so forcefully the subject of interest rates.<br/>
The most recently equipped mills and those which have bought the most costly automated equipment are the most vulnerable if, because of a severe decline in demand, they cannot run their plant to maximum capacity. If, because of the recession and the shortage of cash in people's pockets, there is no demand, these mills can get no return on the massive investment that has been made. Textiles are second only to chemicals in the amount of investment that has been made in them in recent years. The record of employers in the textile and clothing industry is something of which the industry can be proud.<br/>
All mills have standing charges which are so high that they are making substantial losses whenever they cut out shifts or work less than a full week, which is the order of the day at present. It follows, therefore, that if there is no change in Government policy many more factories and mills in the North-West, Yorkshire, the Northern region

and Northern Ireland&#x2014;here I follow the remarks made by the hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux)&#x2014;will be forced to close.<br/>
I cannot emphasise too strongly that the most efficient mills in the world are included in the list of those that are now on a reduced working week. I refer to the Majestic mill in Oldham and Unit 1 in Atherton, which was visited by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister before she bacame Prime Minister. In my capacity as chairman of the all-party group I seek to acquaint myself at first hand with what is going on. I went to Lancashire in the Christmas recess and visited Holdsworth Brothers at Bolton, Highams at Royton, Caledonian Textile Engineering Co. at Burnley and William Reed and Co. Ltd. in Nelson, in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Lee). All those mills have invested huge sums of money at the request of the Government; they have shed their work force without industrial dispute; and now, because the Government refuse to act in the national interest to provide fair competition for a strategic and important industry, thousands of people are being put out of work. I find that unacceptable.<br/>
Moving on to the temporary short-time working compensation scheme, I follow again the remarks made by the hon. Member for Antrim, South. I believe, sadly, that the scheme is of little value. It has done nothing to preserve business, since the main beneficiaries are the operatives and the Government. Firms lay out money for as long as 12 weeks to pay compensation to operatives. They save the cost to the Government of unemployment benefits and the administration of those benefits which employees would claim if there were no such schemes. Employers have used the scheme so far because it has helped them to keep their labour force together in the hope that trade would soon improve. I regret to say that this is now seen as a forlorn hope, both by me and by the industry. In any case, the modified scheme introduced by my Government of 50 per cent. of wages for stopped days is now of doubtful value to many employees because they can receive more when they are out of work than they can by remaining in work. That is a very sad state of affairs.<br/>
It surely should be possible for the Government to speed up payments to firms so as to do less damage to their cash flow. More importantly, they should devise a better scheme, but, best of all, they should go back to 75 per cent. which was the percentage prior to the new scheme.<br/>
In the end, nothing but increased production will save the industry, and I am sure this will be taken on board by my right hon. Friend. I see an increase in production as one of the ways in which the country can regain its economic greatness. This can be brought about, first, by an improvement in the general economy. Secondly, effective control is needed to protect the textile, clothing and footwear industries from unfair competition. If necessary we should use non-tariff barriers. There is no point in my right hon. Friends on the Front Bench, telling me that we are members of the EEC and must abide by the Treaty of Rome. Look at what the French, the Germans and the Dutch are doing. My right hon. Friend said that we were likely to take the Dutch to the European Court for what they are doing, but how long will it take to progress that case and how much damage will be done in the interim?<br/>
Thirdly, there must be a decrease in interest rates and in the value of the pound so that our highly efficient textile exporters have a reasonable and fair chance to trade on the


world markets. Finally, I propose that the Government should introduce an energy package so that the industry and people of our country can have the advantage of our great natural resources.<br/>
It is nonsense for my right hon. Friend to keep on claiming that we have a massive array of import controls. The controls are there on paper, but they are set at too high a level; they are not being tightened during a period of recession, and many of them are exceeded. In 1980 over 70 ceilings or trigger levels were exceeded, some of them, I accept, only marginally, but many of them substantially.<br/>
It is not without much consideration that I shall vote against my Government tonight in the Division Lobby. I believe that hon. Members do themselves no service if they lack credibility with the people whom they seek to serve and to represent. I have long believed that the textile and clothing industry has received less than justice from successive Governments. I shall not, in fact, be voting for the Opposition. I shall be voting against my Government. I deplore the fact that the Leader of the Opposition was seen strutting at the head of a large demonstration in Glasgow at the weekend. The right hon. Gentleman, when Secretary of State for Employment, presided over a more than doubling of unemployment in this country.<br/>
Sadly, it is perhaps a reflection on all political parties that we seek to use the unemployed for political purposes. I deeply regret it. This is something that has been gnawing inside me for some time. I am not prepared to be party to it any longer. For that reason I am going into the Division Lobby against my Government and for the Opposition motion. If the substantive motion as amended, is then voted on, I shall vote against it. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I say with some respect to my hon. Friend the Member for Preston, North (Mr. Atkins) that he may consider this a laughing matter. If, however, he was one of the 100,000 in the clothing and textile industry put out of a job, I am sure that he would not be smiling on either side of his face&#x2014;</p>

<p>It is right that I should compliment the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) on the resolve that he has expressed. It is difficult to go against one's party. In the end, however, one's constituents must be properly represented.<br/>
From my vantage point as chairman of the all-party group for the wool textile industry, I can confirm to the Government and the public the deep anxiety, even anger, that is felt in all parts of the House over the steadily deteriorating position of textiles in the British economy. I took the chair at a series of meetings held in the Grand

Committee Room of textile, clothing and footwear workers, where a deep feeling of hurt and frustration was evident. "What" they asked "do we do if we lose this job? There are no others to turn to". I warn the Government that the ground is growing increasingly fertile for those wishing to sow the seeds of dissent and social unrest.<br/>
Earlier this week I received from the Secretary of State for Industry a reply to a parliamentary question in which I asked why Government funding in the textile industry had not been at the level of funding of the steel and motor industries in the light of the greater job loss in textiles between 1970 and 1930. The reply was:
<q>The Government cannot be held responsible for the policies of the previous Administration or for their results. Our policy is to create an economic climate in which all industry can succeed without assistance from the taxpayer.</q>
It went on to say:
<q>In the case of both public and private sector businesses, loss of jobs is not a yardstick for determining whether the taxpayer should be asked to provide assistance".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 24 February 1981; Vol. 999, c. <i>346.</i>]</q>
I regard that answer as unworthy. It tries to blame the previous Administration. I blame all Administrations, over many years, for ignoring the textile industry in favour of the powerful battalions. The workers in textiles have done everything possible to co-operate in creating a viable situation. They have been among the lowest paid for many years. They have joined in with rationalisation schemes, alterations in hours of work and so on. Yet they have one of the best records regarding loss of time due to industrial disputes. How have they been rewarded? The answer is, by the loss of 262,000 jobs between 1970 and 1980&#x2014;as many as in steel, coal and motor vehicles put together. I took those figures from <i>The Sunday Times</i> of 15 February 1981.<br/>
When we consider the amount of money that has been available to these industries for enhanced redundancy payments alone, is it any wonder that the textile workers are bitter? Let us hear something from the Government about unilateral action in the interests of maintaining a viable industry, along similar lines to France, Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany. Let us hear something about the price of energy to industry, and also about the price of water, which has increased by 72 per cent. in two years to the wool textile industry.<br/>
How can large users of water, such as top makers, remain competitive in those circumstances? Interest rates should be brought down to help save smaller firms such as the one which, it was announced yesterday, is closing in a township in my constituency. It has taken a Conservative Government to suit the condition to the name of the town&#x2014;Idle.</p>

be content with quoting from the leading article in the February issue of "Wool Record and Textile World", which states:
<q>The Budget will show once and for all whether Mrs. Thatcher and her Government have grasped the realities of Britain's industrial situation or whether their many critics are right in their more frequent and more vehement contentions that the Thatcher policies will prove disastrous and result in the destruction of our whole industrial base. It is astonishing that this Government's actions should have been so inimical to the interests of private industry because it claims to stand for all the principles which private industry incorporates&#x2014;enterprise, initiative, independence and so on. Their treatment of the textile industry has been appalling in its inadequacy and there is every justification for the chairman of Allied Textiles saying in his annual review that 'We see no evidence of the political will necessary to secure the future of any significant capacity for the production of textiles and clothing in the United Kingdom'.</q>
It is unnecessary for me to add any further comment. I had intended to make a detailed case for national economic planning and to urge the Government to consider it. I have never considered the Treasury a suitable instrument for economic planning. It is necessary for us to know where we are going if the Government are pretending that they will bring about industrial reconstruction. We must know what they mean, what they intend and where the textile industry will lie in that industrial reconstruction.<br/>
I address myself to the Opposition Front Bench. I call on the Leader of the Opposition to appoint a senior Front Bench spokesman on national economic planning and to ensure that he has the facilities to gather around him the best brains in the country so that when we take over the Government we have a plan to work to. It is no longer feasible to carry on in Government on an ad hoc basis. Resources are finite and we have to identify and allocate them according to priorities. It is equally important that if we have a plan for progress it is communicated to and understood by the people that it covers such things as rent, profits, and interest as well as incomes, because then we are much more likely to produce a consensus where all are working towards the same end&#x2014;a fair, just and humane society.</p>

<p>For most of my business life I was engaged in the clothing and textile industry. Therefore, I may have an advantage over some of my right hon. and hon. Friends. I do not think that rhetoric or exaggeration will help the textile industry in any way. We must accept&#x2014;I have seen it for many years&#x2014;that the textile and clothing industry has experienced increasing difficulties. Those of us who have been engaged in the industry know that among the bankruptcies and closures in this country, clothing firms are high on the list.<br/>
We must accept that for many years Britain had advantages in markets throughout the world, through imperial preference. We controlled the industries in those countries and our products were able to enter with great advantages over products from many other countries. Unfortunately, that has ended and imperial preference no longer exists. The clothing industry is labour-intensive and is not an industry in which high capital resources are required. It lends itself to production in emerging countries and we find it difficult to compete with countries with low

labour costs. The prime example is Hong Kong. A wide range of exports from that country have spread throughout the world because Hong Kong has become efficient in manufacturing clothing right across the board. It is extremely difficult for us to compete with low-cost countries except in high quality garments, for which there has been a falling demand. The clothing industry will have continuing difficulties.<br/>
Since the war there have been increasing lower priced imports&#x2014;especially since synthetics were introduced&#x2014;from eastern European countries and other areas such as Portugal. Those imports have imposed considerable difficulties on our industry. Recently there have been considerable increases in imports from America&#x2014;carpets are an illustration. American carpets have been sponsored throughout the United Kingdom by the large and powerful retail groups. The Americans have produced keenly priced high fashion carpets. We recognise that fashion is an important factor. I pointed out in an intervention that since 1978 the Americans have radically increased their trade in knitted fabrics. It was a trickle then, but it was worth &#x00A3;17 million in 1979, and it is growing at an alarming rate.<br/>
Fashion changes have added to the difficulties of the textile trade. The traditional dress of the British man was a tailored suit, and he kept quite a few of them in his wardrobe. Now it is unusual to find more than one suit, or perhaps two, in the average man's wardrobe. The remainder is made up of casual wear, which has not helped the woollen industry, and must have reduced considerably the demand for men's woollens throughout the world. I emphasise that woollen textiles from this country are still of high quality. The Government can help. We must remember that the woollen textile industry has relied in the past to a considerable extent upon stock holders and distributors. They buy from the mills and hold heavy stocks, very often of fashion woollens. The fact that they have to hold large stocks means that the high rate of interest has reduced the size of the orders that they would normally place. I ask my right hon. Friend to consider that carefully. In piece goods, especially, many factories require a stock holder, and in fashion stock holding the rate of interest is an important factor to be taken into consideration. The Chancellor of the Exchequer could help the whole of the textile industry by making a reduction in the interest rate in the Budget.<br/>
Some of the highest tariffs against British woollens are, surprisingly, in countries with which we have traditionally had great trade relations. It is discomfiting to find that the tariff on British woollens going into Australia is 35 per cent., with a severe quota. In New Zealand the duty is 45 per cent. with a quota in addition. In the United States, the import duty on woollens is 45&#x00B7;5 per cent. Although we may have had no lever in the past to bring a more reasonable attitude to our exports of textiles to America, the fact that the Americans are increasing their exports to us should give us an opportunity to open negotiations with them to give us better opportunities to sell our textiles and clothing in the United States.<br/>
Those are countries in which we are at a disadvantage. But there are other countries that penalise our exports of textiles, especially woollens, with duties as high as 100 per cent., yet they sell their textiles, finished and unfinished, to this country without any comparable restriction.<br/>
My right hon. Friend could do the textile industry in this country a great deal of good if he would consider the


instances in which other countries, by exporting on a very large scale to this country, are also giving us opportunities of the sort that I have suggested.<br/>
I have one comment to make on the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton). It is easy to talk about giving the textile industry and the clothing manufacturers the sort of handout that has been given to the miners.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend would serve his purpose much better if he would use less rhetoric and less exaggeration. If I misunderstood him, I apologise, but certainly I thought that that was what he meant. I have been in the industry nearly all my life. If he had been in the industry for as long as I have, he would realise that it would be impossible to subsidise hundreds of small factories manufacturing clothing and also to subsidise to the same extent those engaged in the textile industry.<br/>
I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will look at the position in the textile manufacturing industry, where we are competing with overseas countries that are exporting to this country on a considerable scale. The position is not quite the same in the clothing industry, because of the conditions to which I have referred. Given the right opportunity, I am sure that our woollen manufacturers can hold their own, but we have also to take into consideration the fact that there have been changing fashions and that the overall demand for men's traditional wool textiles is not as great as it was several years ago.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Gillingham (Sir F. Burden) will, I hope, forgive me if I do not take up his remarks. I hope he will also forgive me if I say that I found the speech of his hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) more entertaining than his speech, if only because I agreed more with the hon. Member for Macclesfield than with him.<br/>
Last week, with many other hon. Members, particularly Opposition Members, I met deputations of textile workers&#x2014;perhaps ex-workers would be a better word&#x2014;from the North of England. Those from my constituency were certainly ex-workers. When I met them here in the House, I had to tell them that in my view the Government had virtually written off the textile industry, certainly in terms of being willing to give practical assistance to it. I had to tell them that in my view the present Government are as pathetic as the Labour Government in regard to willingness to help the industry. I also told them that, while I was quite sure that we would continue to receive from this Government&#x2014;as from the Labour Government&#x2014;a great deal of noise in support of the industry, it was not likely to materialise in real help.<br/>
As I listened to the Minister's speech this afternoon, it seemed to me that we were being given all sorts of reasons or excuses as why nothing could be done but little indication as to what was to be done or what the Government thought they might be able to do.<br/>
I shall not rehearse all the problems of the industry. Suffice it to say that in the past 12 months we have lost

over 100,000 jobs. In my constituency of Rochdale, unemployment has risen from under 6 per cent. to over 14 per cent. in 12 months. In the cotton industry and the allied textile industry we have lost 20,000 jobs in one year&#x2014;a 33 per cent. reduction in the labour force in one year. We have had all the usual closures, bankruptcies and liquidations. I am sure that the House has heard about them before and will continue to hear about them.<br/>
The latest closures are those in Courtaulds, especially in the city of Liverpool, and in Northern Ireland. I understand that many of those closures are due to an energy policy that is not particularly helpful to the industry or conducive to its success. In short, what the House is talking about is a pathetic mess. One hopes&#x2014;although with little optimism&#x2014;that the debate will produce a promise of Government action rather than the crocodile tears that we often get in these debates.<br/>
I have not missed a textile debate in this House since I was elected in 1972. In 1966, when I was the mayor of Rochdale, I led a deputation of Lancashire mayors to the then President of the Board of Trade, the right hon. Member for Battersea, North (Mr. Jay), so the problem has obviously existed for 10 or 15 years, and we have not made a great deal of progress in that time.<br/>
The reasons for contraction are well known to the Government. To be fair, some of them, quite properly, were mentioned by the Minister in his opening speech. There is the general world-wide economic depression. There are also the high interest rates in the United Kingdom.<br/>
Perhaps I might at this point urge the Government to look at some of the special interest rates that other countries in the EEC are offering people at the present time. I can produce evidence to the Government, for example, to prove that the Belgian Government, in an attempt to attract one company, recently offered capital loans at 2 per cent., not only for buildings and plant but also for working capital. That example shows the difference between two countries in the EEC in the way in which they deal with interest rates.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has mentioned subsidised industry in the Common Market which is working to the detriment of our own textile industry. Is he aware that woollen manufacturers in the Prato district in Italy are given substantial capital subsidies to enable them to compete directly with their Common Market partners, ourselves?</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention, which substantiates the point that I was making. I know of his deep concern about the woollen industry, especially in the woollen mills of Yorkshire. I am sure that note will have been taken of his point.<br/>
A further reason for contraction is the high value of the pound, which has affected the margins of some of the most efficient and aggressive exporters. There is also the high level of imports, to which reference has been made. We know the problems and we know the causes of them. We want to hear what the Government propose to do about them.<br/>
The same story is absolutely true of the footwear industry. In the Rossendale Valley alone&#x2014;close to my constituency geographically&#x2014;three factories and 1,000 jobs have been lost in the last 12 months. I know that that is a source of great concern to the hon. Member for


Rossendale (Mr. Trippier), who will no doubt be hoping to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, in order to say something about it.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for mentioning my constituency and for the context in which he has mentioned it. There is not only the problem of the unemployment which has arisen in my constituency. There is also the problem of potential unemployment arising from the fact that so many people are on short-time working. The temporary short-time working compensation scheme is totally inadequate to deal with the problem.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1804471" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1981-02-26a.1001.1" hansard_membership_id="12251" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28998" speakername="Mr. Smith" colnum="1001" time="17:11:00">
<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I was about to say that 43 per cent. of textile mills in the North of England are now using the temporary short-time working compensation scheme. That scheme is less attractive than it was, now that it is related to 50 per cent. as opposed to 75 per cent. As the hon. Member for Macclesfield has indicated, it is even less attractive to companies.<br/>
I declare an interest, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, in that my company in Rochdale has been waiting for approval under the scheme since 5 December. During those three months, my company has been financing the money that the Government promised to repay to us. I have tabled a question as to the reason for the delay. I have also asked how many companies in the North-West are waiting for approval. There are scores of them. I was told recently by Ministry officials that the queue for approvals is so great that they cannot cope with the numbers. It is taking weeks and even months to get them through.<br/>
That is some indication of the state of trade, but it is also an indication that the Government are not giving sufficient attention to the problem. They have made a mess of the scheme by reducing the figure to 50 per cent. But even if they will not increase it above 50 per cent., they can at least try to ensure that the scheme is being administered efficiently, so that it does not take so long to arrive at conclusions, and so that companies can get back the money that they are paying out. Incidentally, while the firms are paying out the money it is saving the Government from having to find the money for unemployment pay.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will tell us whether the 50 per cent. can be increased, whether the period to which the scheme applies can be lengthened, and whether there can be a speeding up, particularly in the North-West, of the time that is being taken to deal with applications.<br/>
The footwear and textile industries do much for exports, and have tried to help themselves by exporting. The footwear industry in Lancashire exported &#x00A3;2 million worth of goods to North Africa in recent months. The textile industry has sold &#x00A3;2,000 million worth of exports. So we are not just talking about saving industries and jobs; we are talking about saving exports too.<br/>
The hon. Member for Macclesfield referred to Unit 1 at Atherton. That company invested &#x00A3;6 million. Yet it is companies like that which are now facing closure or short-time working as a consequence of the Government's policies. We are not talking about inefficient mills or mills that have failed to invest. We are not talking about an industry with a long record of bad labour relations. We are

talking about companies that have invested and exported, and an industry that has a superb record in industrial relations.<br/>
The hon. Member for Macclesfield rightly said that we tend to be a soft touch for imports. Every year ceilings are exceeded. Indonesia is an example. Last year, over 5 million garments came into this country from Indonesia. The Minister agreed a quota of 2 million, but that was twice the 1979 amount from that country which four years previously sent nothing to the United Kingdom.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Macclesfield said, it is worth noting that in 1980 over 70 ceilings, or trigger levers, were exceeded. We want to know what the Government are doing about that. May we have an assurance that the amount by which they were exceeded in 1980 will be deducted from the quotas of those countries in 1981 so that what they sent in last year over the levels will be deducted from what they are allowed to send in this year? That would be perfectly proper, and it is the way that I am sure other Governments would react. Some of the excesses were minor; some of them were not. But together they have a major effect on the industry as a whole.<br/>
It has been said that the textile and clothing industries employ 650,000 people. The coal industry employs 230,000 people. I see that a Minister from the Department of Industry is present, so perhaps he will perform the same sort of U-turn for the clothing and textile industries that he performed for the coal industry. Even though we employ three times more people, we are prepared to settle for one-third of the help. That is surely a fair basis on which to seek Government intervention. Textile workers are upset when they read of people in other industries&#x2014;car, coal, and steel&#x2014;getting redundancy payments of &#x00A3;15,000, &#x00A3;16,000 or &#x00A3;20,000. Yet textile workers, with the same length of service in an industry which has the same health dangers as the mining industry&#x2014;a lot of textile workers suffer from byssinosis&#x2014;are being declared redundant and receiving redundancy payments of &#x00A3;2,000, &#x00A3;3,000 or even less.<br/>
I understand the Government's problem, and I understand, too, that some industries are publicly financed and others are privately financed. But the workers are entitled to demand and expect fair play from any Government. There is nothing fair about a situation in which one redundant worker gets &#x00A3;15,000 and another with the same length of service in another industry with less muscle gets about one-fifth or one-sixth of the amount.<br/>
We therefore await with eager anticipation the Government's U-turn on economic policies. We need lower interest rates. We need short-term finance help to keep the industry going. We need a curb on imports. We need a control of energy charges&#x2014;not a deliberate increase, as this Government perpetrated through athe gas industry. We need the EEC's import controls on low-wage countries to be fully enforced. We need new quotas at lower levels as soon as possible, and we want to ensure that those quotas, when renegotiated, are negotiated in relation to domestic demand.<br/>
The industry welcomes the origin marking order, but we believe that it should be much tighter. I hope that the Government will consider the possibility of tightening it up to cover such things as the origin of the main fabric to be used, forcing mail order catalogues to show the country


of origin, and stronger enforcement, including marking the source of origin at the time of manufacture and not at the time of retail sales.<br/>
I hope that, even at this eleventh hour, the Government will make sure that the industry has fair play. That is all that the textile industry has ever sought. It has never sought protection or to be treated in a better or more generous manner than any other industry. All that it has ever sought, in the 15 years during which I have been associated with it, is to have fair play and justice. That is what we seek from the Government today, and that is what we hope to hear from the Minister tonight.</p>

<p>It is a pleasure for me to follow the hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith). I spent many happy and interesting hours with him on the town council in Rochdale, the town where we were both born. I also had the doubtful privilege of fighting him in 1972 in the Rochdale by-election, when he did not just beat me but metaphorically sat on me. which was the most painful experience of my political career. I agree with everyting that he said today.<br/>
I remind the House that approximately 50 per cent. of the work force in my constituency is employed in the textile and footwear industries. That makes it unique&#x2014;certainly in the North-West, and, as far as I know, in the rest of the country. The decline in the textile and footwear industries did not begin in May 1979. There has been a steady erosion over a long time, certainly since the last war. Indeed, many people would say that it was a longer period. Both industries have suffered from unfair import penetration, and both have been the recipients of Government largesses in the form of subsidies or compensation schemes.</p>

<p>It is true that there has been a long-term decline in output and employment in the industry, but does not the hon. Gentleman agree that what has happened in the past 15 months is on a quite different scale from the gentle decline that the industry suffered earlier? By way of illustration, I would point out that the output of the textile industry remained stable&#x2014;an index of 100&#x2014;during the period of the Labor Government, while it has collapsed by 25 per cent. during the 18 months of this Government.</p>

<p>I do not deny for one moment that the situation has deteriorated during the 21 months that this Government have been in office, but it is a little hypocritical for Labour Members to attack the Government when they were instrumental in negotiating the multi-fibre arrangement under which we are currently operating. Opposition Members often say that the then Opposition&#x2014;the Conservative Party&#x2014;supported the negotiations. The fact remains that the people who negotiated the multi-fibre arrangement were Ministers of the Crown. Only Ministers of the Crown&#x2014;members of the Government of the day&#x2014;sit round the table at the time.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman must appreciate that Ministers of the day have a responsibility to persuade the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers to

negotiate on their behalf. Successive Governments have a lot to answer for for the way in which they have let down the textile and footwear industries since the war.<br/>
I emphasise that the textile industry is twice as big as the coal industry. It is more than twice as big as the car industry. It accounts for 10 per cent. of all manufacturing employment.<br/>
Many in the industry say that the renewal of the multifibre arrangement after 1981 is academic because the industry may not survive until then. That is not right. The renewal of the MFA and the bilaterals is crucial for the textile industry after this year. More to the point, a commitment to strengthen the MFA, which we did not have from the Secretary of State for Trade today, is essential. A recession clause must be built in in order to restore confidence. That is not just a central point for discussion; it is vital. We must fight tooth and nail for it in the Council of Europe.<br/>
Britain has the largest textile industry in Europe. It is under the most pressure. There is no confidence in the industry. One of the major reasons is the dithering attitude of the present Government. Early on, Ministers from the Departments of Trade and Industry failed to give a firm commitment that we would right for a tough successor. Eventually it came from the Prime Minister herself. We are grateful for that.<br/>
Debates such as this place hon. Members like myself in a dilemma. I despair of the Government's attitude and I deplore the Opposition's hypocrisy. The textile industry has been in decline for more than 20 years. Opposition Members would do well to remember that Labour Governments have been in power for two-thirds of that time. Textile mills in my constituency closed under Labour Governments just as they are closing under a Conservative Government. Both parties have a lot to answer for.<br/>
The current position is disastrous. Production has fallen dramatically. The fall accelerated in 1980. Output in textiles for the last quarter of 1980 was 22&#x00B7;1 per cent. down on the same period of 1979. That is certainly disastrous. At least 200 mill closures occurred in 1980 and others have occurred since.<br/>
Hon. Members who have spoken with such passion, including my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) and the hon. Member for Rochdale, do not really know what it is like to lose a job, as many of the textile workers in Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire have lost theirs. They must feel as if their world is caving in. Opposition Members should not laugh at that. They should encourage us. They recognise that they do not have a monopoly on compassion.<br/>
Many textile workers suffer double injury when they lose their jobs, because frequently both husband and wife are employed in the same mill. Sometimes their daughter will also work in the same mill&#x2014;on the switchboard, for instance. That applies particularly in Greater Manchester and Lancashire. They must be wondering what they did wrong. They have not been on strike within living memory. They have not negotiated irresponsible wage settlements. They have worked hard in a noisy and often unpleasant environment, and yet they are proud to work in an industry manufacturing essential goods.<br/>
Many textile workers in my constituency are suffering the indignity of short-time working. The potential unemployment figures are disastrous. What needs to be done? The Government must introduce an entirely new


scheme of temporary compensation for short-time working&#x2014;a scheme that will last for 12 months. No one would be happy with such a scheme, but in the absence of a constructive alternative it would be a means of holding the work force together. It would also make economic sense. It is better to pay for shor-time working than to pay unemployment benefit.<br/>
The Government must reduce the minimum lending rate by at least two points as quickly as possible. Faced with diminished demand and high interest rates, how can companies be encouraged to invest in new machinery and sustain high stocks?<br/>
The Government must recognise that there is a minimum base that must be preserved and protected under a recession clause. It should not be assumed that an annihilated textile industry would allow the British consumer to continue to enjoy cheap textiles at the low prices operating today.<br/>
Members of the Lancashire Footwear Manufacturers Association, the headquarters of which is in my constituency, produce about 25 million pairs of footwear per annum. The employee strength is about 7,000. About 4,000 people are employed in the vicinity of Rossendale, in 21 factories. A year ago over 5,000 people were employed in 24 factories in the same area. That means that there has been a loss of 1,000 jobs and three mills in the last year.<br/>
The footwear industry in North-East Lancashire is in danger of collapse if there is a further contraction in the number of factories. Further contraction will mean that suppliers of components such as leather and heels will not be viable. The Government should take dramatic and urgent steps to rectify the high imbalance in footwear imports. Efforts should be made to stimulate home trade by reducing interest rates and stabilising the pound.<br/>
It is suggested that in order to keep the footwear industry at its present level and strength the Government should impose immediately across-the-board import controls on footwear from all sources, amounting to 50 per cent. of current estimated imports either in terms of value or pairs.<br/>
I have always been fascinated by the skilful footwork of Ministers whenever textiles and footwear are mentioned at Question Time. Every time I press for a commitment for the textile or footwear industries Ministers bob and weave. They talk about "orderly marketing arrangements" and "effective restraints". We have been told that Ministers would try to make an effort to persuade the Italians to stop using child labour in the manufacture of shoes. Ministers are brilliant at not being specific, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was in his opening speech today. He said nothing. My right hon. Friend is a skilled politician.<br/>
When asked for an opinion on a book that had just been published, Abraham Lincoln, an equally skilled politician, once said
<q>People who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like".</q>
I am still in the dark about the Government's view on the textile and footwear industries. Worse, those industries themselves are still in the dark. I look to the Secretary of State to shed some light when he replies,. Otherwise, I shall be unable to support the Government in the Lobby tonight.</p>

<p>The debate is already settling into a fairly well-worn pattern. A cautious attack on the Government is made from the Opposition Front Bench. It was cautious because my right hon. Friend the Member for Lanarkshire, North (Mr. Smith) is always mindful that the day will come when positions will be reserved and he will be on the Government Front Bench facing a similar debate. Back Benchers on both sides of the House then proclaim the need for assistance to the textile industry. Hardly one, if there ever is one, has a kind word to say about the Government's policy, whether it is a Labour or a Tory Government.<br/>
Will we go through that again today, or are we considering something a little more different? I think that there is a difference, and the Government would be well advised to note it. The motion that we are debating says:
<q>This House deplores the worsening crisis in the textile, clothing and footwear industries".</q>
The crisis is worsening and its effects are being felt throughout the North-West, for example. The number of unemployed in the North-West region, announced earlier this week, was 338,000 men and women, the second largest number in any region in the United Kingdom.<br/>
The crisis in the textile industry is taking place mainly in an area that is already heavily hit. In other words, there is a crisis within a crisis, because there has been a continuing crisis in textiles not for 20 years, but for 50 years. The number of people employed in textiles has been falling for 50 years. That number is now one-tenth of what if was 50 years ago. Because of the gradualness of that decline an opportunity has been available to take up the people who are being made unemployed, but now the speed of the crisis is overtaking the ability of people in that region to find new employment.<br/>
The Secretary of State for Trade tried to support the Government's amendment, which says that:
<q>this House acknowledges the difficult trading conditions facing the textile, clothing and footwear industries".</q>
That is acceptable enough. Of course the Government must acknowledge those conditions. They are as plain as plain could be. There is nothing objectionable in that part of the amendment, but it then says that the House
<q>notes the measures which the Government has taken to give these industries a wide range of protection".</q>
That is more questionable. I know that the Government can say that protection has been afforded to the textile industry, and Ministers have said that it is well protected, but the crisis is such that as soon as the debate was announced I was deluged by briefs&#x2014;as I am sure other hon. Members have been&#x2014;from employers' organisations, trade unions and many others. Many of them have been read out today. There is no harm in that, because it is good that opinions that have been received are reinforced in the House. I am sure that the Minister has received them. That is an indication that there is much concern that there is not sufficient protection for the industry.<br/>
I do not blame the Government for that. The multi-fibre arrangement was negotiated when there was a Labour Government, but we objected to it then. We are entitled to continue that objection. Two years may be a long time, but the Government must recognise their responsibilities in view of the dreadful situation facing the industry. If the debate helps to sharpen their minds on that point, it will have been valuable.<br/>
The Minister talked about the anti-dumping legislation. It was bad enough when it was operated from this country, because there were many complaints about the delays. Speed is of the essence when one is concerned with dumping operations. If there is some delay in dealing with dumping, the damage is done before it is revealed for what it is. That has been made worse because the matter is now dealt with at Common Market level. The industry is again complaining that that is not good enough for it. Therefore, the second part of the amendment falls on the ground that there is not sufficient protection either by the anti-dumping legislation or through the multi-fibre arrangement.<br/>
I should have liked to dwell for some time on the Government's policies, the effects of which are falling particularly hard on the textile industry. One point is particularly applicable to textiles that are sold in shops. The destocking in this industry is directly attributable to the high interest rates charged in this country, because no shop, no matter how large or small, can afford to carry stocks for which it must borrow money and pay high interest rates. Stocks in shops may sound a small matter. They are not normally considered to be all that important unless the clothing industry is directly concerned, but when one realises the many millions of pounds worth of goods that are normally held in stock, one realises that when those are run down that represents a long period during which there is no demand for fresh supplies. The industry has felt that strongly.<br/>
The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) said that he would vote against the Government. I have looked at the motion and at the amendment. I do not think that it makes any difference to the textile industry which of them is carried tonight. I recognise the bravery of the hon. Gentleman. It is always brave to vote against one's own Government. However, the Government should not judge the seriousness of our feelings on whether we vote for or against their amendment.<br/>
The Government should take into account what has been said by all hon. Members, never mind the vote, and carry it into the new negotiations. They should not set aside the textile industry because it happens to be less militant than some others. They should not reward its loyalty by giving it unfair treatment compared with that given to other industries which may be more militant. It is not a good lesson to teach workers that the more militant they are, the more attention they will get and the more help they will receive from the Government. If the Government want to pursue a policy that will unite this country they must demonstrate to these workers who have never taken an aggressive attitude to the community as a whole that that will pay off for them.</p>

<p>I shall take up some of the points mentioned on both sides of the House. I am speaking as joint chairman of the all-party knitting industries group. The East Midlands region, which I represent, has the highest concentration of employees dependent on the clothing, textile and footwear industries. It is 10 per cent., or 150,000 out of a total work force of 1&#x00B7;5 million.<br/>
I am concerned about the wholesale decline in employment in hosiery and knitwear. Since June 1979 the number employed in hosiery and knitwear has declined from 110,000 to 94,000 in November 1980, a decline of 14 per cent., coupled with a tripling of short-time working.

Hand in hand with that decline in jobs has gone rising import penetration, from 15 per cent. in 1968 to 34 per cent. now for textiles, to 39 per cent. for knitted outerwear and no less than 84 per cent. for knitted shirts.<br/>
There has been a combination of circumstances, many of which the Government can remedy. If I receive a meaningful undertaking from the Minister tonight I shall support the Government, but unless I receive a meaningful reply to the points that I shall raise I shall not be in the Lobby with the Government tonight.<br/>
I have the greatest confidence in the ability of the hosiery and knitwear industries to survive and thrive if overseas competition is fair. I recently visited various firms in Leicestershire. I was impressed by the speed and efficiency of the workers and the 100 per cent. co-operation between management and workers. I am not prepared to accept a situation in which our home industries continue to be undermined by unfair foreign competition; nor am I prepared to accept a Government who do not make it crystal clear that there will be a continuing, large and permanent hosiery and knitwear industry in Britain.<br/>
Regrettably, on 3 February my hon. Friend the Member for Loughborough (Mr. Dorrell) stated:
<q>When I came to the House I was a director and shareholder in a clothing company manufacturing in Britain. I am convinced that there is no future for most of the British textile and clothing industry.</q>
No fewer than 650,000 people are employed in that industry in the United Kingdom, out of only 3 million in the whole of the EEC. I am not prepared to see such an investment written off.</p>

<p>May I add my next sentence but one:
<q>I find it difficult to support a policy that undertakes the negative part of that job"&#x2014;</q>
by which I meant the job of restructuring British industry&#x2014;
<q>and insists that imports come in if they are more competitive hut does not provide the prospect of alternative jobs for the people and assets that are made redundant."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 3 February 1981; Vol. 993, c. 455.]</q>
My speech has been widely reported in Leicestershire. I have a great deal of sympathy with the points made on both sides of the House about interest and exchange rates. However, it is pointless to have an industrial policy that does not recognise the need to concentrate investment in those industries that provide the best prospect of secure jobs, the highest wages and the highest return.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his lengthy intervention. Most of us recognise that such a future lies with the textile and knitting industries, given a proper Government attitude.<br/>
I said earlier that we were suffering from a combination of circumstances, such as the high level of MLR, which in turn has given us a high value of sterling. The Government must reduce MLR, which will have the tandem effect of reducing the value of sterling. Both are artificially high. The high level of MLR has made companies shed jobs and machines. Companies are now disappearing, and the decline must be halted. The lobby that came to the House a few days ago gave me a list of no fewer than five companies in the Leicester area that have either substantially reduced the number of their employees or gone out of business since 1 January.<br/>
I briefly mention the other points on which the Government should tonight make a robust statement. I am


not satisfied with the way that negotiations are being conducted by the EEC over United States imports. Through the availability of cheap energy, American imports are coming into Britain in much greater proportion than to other EEC countries. Other member States do not feel the same need for urgent action.<br/>
I want the Government to take a positive attitude in the multi-fibre negotiations. In the new MFA there must be recognition of the change in economic circumstances. We also need proper transitional arrangements over the enlargement of the EEC. The origin marking order shortly to be considered by the House should also be amended to include the origin marking of the contents of mail order catalogues.<br/>
The Government can take action. They have the power to arrest the decline of an old industry of which we are proud. The problems come partly from the world recession, but the Government can and should help in many ways. I hope that they will assure us of their help tonight.</p>

<p>I am pleased to speak after the hon. Member for Harborough (Mr. Farr). We are joint chairman of the knitting and hosiery industries group.<br/>
I echo the sadness expressed by the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) about what is happening to the textile industry. The industry has been established in the East Midlands for over 400 years and employs one in eight of every worker in productive employment, yet every day factories are closing and jobs disappearing. The feeling is growing that the Government are happy to see the industry disappear.<br/>
I shall not deal with such esoteric matters as the exchange rate and MLR. Apart from the consequences of Government policies, one could talk for hours about the many other unfairnesses that the industry has to face&#x2014;fiddling, the bending of international rules, quota dodging, fraudulent labelling, the protection and subsidisation of textile industries in other countries, and dumping. There is a need to secure a fair deal for Britain in the renewal of the MFA. Additional problems will face us with the enlargement of the EEC. Because the Government appear not to see the need for urgent action over such matters there is great despondency, particularly in the East Midlands. That despondency was heightened when the Secretary of State for Industry told us on 10 July that our competitors were not competing unfairly.<br/>
In December the hon. Member for Harborough and I visited two Ministers with representatives of the knitting and hosiery industries to discuss the growing threat from America. The Americans subsidise and protect their industry by artificial energy prices and by lowering their import quotas. They are therefore able to send goods here at prices lower than those for goods from Hong Kong, Korea and Portugal. That behaviour is unfair, and the Americans should be dealt with under the appropriate MFA and GATT provisions. The Minister for Trade conceded that there was identifiable unfairness. However, he told us that if these suggestions were implemented it would be the first occasion on which a developed country had been so treated and that he therefore could not contemplate such action.</p>

<p>I said that if we were to try to have an MFA-type arrangement with America it would be the first arrangement under the MFA with developed countries and the first step towards a managed world trade in textiles.<br/>
The Reagan Administration have been in power for barely a month. They have deregulated oil and have said that they regard the deregulation of gas as an important priority and that they will make other proposals that will be of more immediate assistance to the United Kingdom textile industry. To get an Administration to say that in their first month in office is quite an achievement. I hope that the hon. Gentleman agrees.</p>

<p>It does not
seem to me to be a very great achievement. Instead of a forthright denunciation of American unfairness there has been a nice cosy chat between representatives of the EEC and the American Administration, at the end of which the Americans have agreed to pass on our fears to their own industry. The American industry already knows about our concern in these matters. Last year, representatives of the Knitwear Industries Federation went to America and saw their counterparts and told them all about it. The American producers said that they believed that they were making progress in our markets because they had better production methods and their goods were of better quality. The people from the federation were astonished and annoyed, because they knew perfectly well that, in the main, our production methods were better than those of the American textile industry and that the goods that we produce were better than those produced by the Americans. When the American textile producers hear of our polite approach to the Administration there will undoubtedly be complete indifference to what we have to say.<br/>
The Government must stop pussyfooting around and, instead, fight for a fair deal for the industry. Nothing less than a declaration today of the Government's intention to do just that will satisfy the Opposition at the end of the debate. Let us not have yet one more debate that brings no hope to the industry.</p>

<p>As chairman of the all-party footwear group, I am delighted to be able to take part in the debate, not least because even in this debate the footwear industry tends to think of itself as the forgotten industry which not too many people get worked up about. The reason may be that it is not a militant industry. It is not always going on strike, demanding more and more, or trying to hold anybody to ransom. It is an industry which, over the years, has put in good solid work and made a great contribution to our national economy.<br/>
As was mentioned earlier, the footwear industry, too, is in a state of crisis. The county of Northamptonshire is probably the home of the men's footwear industry in this country. Since January 1980, 20 per cent. of the jobs in that industry have disappeared. This means that for the first time&#x2014;I include the time of the Depression&#x2014;the vision of very high unemployment is stalking my constituency and those of my colleagues. Those of us who represent that part of the world are entitled to say that we do not believe that any Government have really done all that they can to assist this industry.<br/>
The problems that have arisen have certainly not been due to high prices and high inflation. In the past year prices


in the footwear industry have increased by some 7&#x00B7;9 per cent., compared with public sector increases of 20 per cent. to 30 per cent., which these firms have had to pay. That says something about the efficiency of the footwear industry, and rather more about the efficiency of the public sector, particularly over the past 18 months.<br/>
We have not heard much tonight about one major problem confronting the industry, namely, the fact that although we have a Government who believe in fair trade and believe that the best thing to do is to reduce the barriers, our footwear exporters find that 75 per cent. of the world's markets are closed or partly closed to them. That is something that they should expect the Government to do something about.</p>

<p>One of the major problems in relation to the whole of North America is, of course, the high value of the pound. I was attempting not to go over ground that other hon. Members had covered. I accept that the high value of the pound and high interest rates are factors in this matter. I was trying to pick out one or two aspects that are peculiar to this industry for the Government to do something about.<br/>
One of the great strengths of the industry is that its trade union has always been a responsible one. I saw the union delegation when it came to see us last week and I accepted its four-point programme, which I shall put to the Government tonight. First, it asks for a further reduction in minimum lending rate. We have been into that already. Secondly, it, too, would like a review of the temporary short-time working compensation scheme, and particularly a restoration of the 75 per cent. payment for a 12-month period. Thirdly&#x2014;and this is very important indeed&#x2014;it wants the Government to influence the EEC so that the Commission moves for the removal of barriers to United Kingdom exports. Fourthly, it asks for incentives to companies pursuing export markets.<br/>
What is significant about those four points is that they have no reference to imports. It is a very responsible trade union. If we are to try to respond to the work force of this country and to get its co-operation, let us put on record how responsible these people have been and let us respond to what they say. I say bluntly to the Government that I believe that those demands are modest. Indeed, they are too modest. I reiterate the cry of my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Trippier), who asked for a degree of control on imports.<br/>
Even more, I remind my right hon. Friends that there is a footwear EDC, which is putting forward proposals to assist the industry in this difficult period of transition. Help is needed to increase productivity, to improve marketing techniques, to improve design, and to encourage exports, but a degree of financial backing will be required if the development council's plans are to be achieved. The question that we must ask ourselves tonight is whether this can and should be done.<br/>
When the Government had an economic and industrial policy that I could understand I had some doubts whether that kind of policy could be pursued. I must tell my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade that after his interview last Sunday morning I am not sure what the

Government's industrial and economic policy is. I believe that we are in new territory and that some of the things that could not be done a month or so ago are perhaps more possible today.</p>

<p>If my hon. Friend does not mind, I shall not give way, as other hon. Members wish to speak.<br/>
I believe that my constituents are entitled to ask certain questions. If the Government are pouring out massive help to bankrupt industries such as British Steel, what about a bit of modest help to the footwear industry? If its employees are to be made redundant, can they not have some of the generous payments that are made to those in the public sector? Above all, if we are to cut back on imports of coal, what about imports of footwear and textiles?<br/>
I do not believe that those are excessive demands. They are the reasonable requests of people who are worried about their jobs and who see no reason why they should be threatened.<br/>
I must say that I, too, am in something of a dilemma in terms of how I should vote tonight. I do not like the Opposition motion, because I do not believe that all of the problems are due to the Government. On the other hand, I do not agree with the Government amendment. I believe that this is one of those occasions on which hon. Members have to look into their hearts and decide whom they represent. I believe that my first responsibility today is to my constituents. They have kept faith with me through four or five very tough elections, and I intend to keep faith with them tonight. I must tell my right hon. and hon.

<p>I shall be brief, because I appreciate the demands of my colleagues.<br/>
First, I should like to refer to Bradford. There, unemployment is up by 82&#x00B7;2 per cent. since May 1979. In West Yorkshire and Humberside unemployment has doubled in the same period. One can visit a block of flats, and the only people who are working will say that they expect to be made redundant any time. Asian workers are particularly numerous in the textile industry. Therefore, they suffer particularly heavy casualties from the holocaust that is hitting the textile industry in my area.<br/>
It is against that background that I wish to make my remarks. It should also be borne in mind that while the water workers and the miners have received wage increases well above double figures, the General and Municipal Workers Union in the textile industry in my area has just agreed a 5 per cent. increase and the work force there has a good work record.<br/>
I want to confine my general remarks to the question of the United States. The United States is undertaking, and has done so over the last two or three years, a determined export drive into European markets. The damage is enormous. America is not subject to quotas, or really to the MFA. The developing countries are entitled to ask, as indeed they do "Why should we restrict our exports to


Britain and to the EEC, not for the sake of the domestic industries, but to make a holiday for the United States?" That is what is being said.<br/>
Why is it a holiday? It is not only because of the low value of the dollar in relation to the pound but because American industry is highly protected. It is a result of energy policies that are unfair compared with what happens in Europe. It is also because America has economies of scale.<br/>
America, which is the richest nation in the world, is keeping out imports from underdeveloped countries by tariffs that are far higher than ours. It is not taking its fair share of imports from developing countries. It is leaving us to do that. That is not fair to the developing countries, nor is it fair to us. Therefore, the Americans must do more.<br/>
I know that in the Tokyo round America agreed that from 1982 it would cut those high tariffs by about 5 per cent. In fact, the American Customs and Excise have now come up with a wonderful proposal in respect of many categories of clothing, namely, to change their classification from non-ornamental to ornamental clothing, whatever that means. The effect will be to double the tariff. That proposal will come up for discussion in March and April. If America succeeds with that proposal to reclassify clothing imports, it will mean that American tariffs will be far higher than they are now. The degree of protection will thus be far greater.<br/>
It therefore follows that the EEC and Britain must take a more determined attitude to the United States than they have taken so far. That is one matter that the Prime Minister ought to raise today and tomorrow in America in her talks with President Reagan. It is not consistent with the attitude of the United States as a world leader or as a country that is supposed to care for other countries and their problems or for its allies in Europe that it should adopt the harsh attitude that it is now adopting.<br/>
In those circumstances, the message from the Government tonight ought to be&#x2014;loud and clear&#x2014;that they will have a bash at America in order to make it fully aware of the damage that its policies are causing. America should be told that it should seek to remedy that damage.</p>

<p>I have been in the House for seven years. During that time I have tried to stress the importance of the footwear industry to this country. I recognise that we are not winners, but, equally, we are not losers. The footwear industry is one that this country needs.<br/>
I want to put three or four points to my right hon. Friend. First, I want to re-emphasise the fact that 75 per cent. of export markets are in one way or another restricted to us. Frankly, I find it laughable when the Japanese tell us that for religious reasons they will not allow shoe imports, while at the same time they proceed to dump roller bearings on to our market, with an adverse effect on Northampton and the other towns that are central to that market.<br/>
Secondly, some of my hon. Friends have mentioned Europe. Most of us who over the years have been involved in anti-dumping work know that the time that the Department of Trade took in the past was a great deal longer than the EEC takes today, certainly in respect of footwear. None of us should now forget that 53 per cent.

of footwear exports go to the EEC and that if we pull out of the EEC, as some of my hon. Friends suggest, the footwear industry will suffer.<br/>
I do not believe that any Government have ever had a proper strategy to meet the import problem. We have had a series of ad hoc arrangements as the problems appeared over the horizon. I want to look at one particular market&#x2014;Poland and COMECON, particularly Poland. Have we not done enough for the Polish economy, when we built 24 ships at a cost of &#x00A3;40 million to the taxpayer and all that Poland put in was &#x00A3;25,000? That is all that Poland put in up front.<br/>
Is it not incredible that, imports having gone down by 4 per cent. in volume last year, blow me down, we find that Poland has increased its exports to Britain by 12 per cent.? Yet we are supposed to have some restrictive agreement with Poland and the rest of COMECON. That increase is not even compensated for by other members of COMECON. For example, exports from Czechoslovakia are up by 6 per cent. If, as reported, the Poles could do better selling their leather, why do we not advise them to sell it on the open market and not dump their shoes on us?<br/>
Earlier on, in an intervention, I mentioned the situation in India. That problem is coming over the horizon. Today, India's exports are up by 69 per cent. to more than 3 million pair. That is the next problem. My right hon. Friend, who is new in office, should begin to look at that problem now rather than wait for two or three years.</p>

<p>Northamptonshire has lost 20 per cent. of its employment. We understand the Government's macro-policy. Indeed, I believe that the industry supports it. The industry understands the fight against inflation and wants to support the Government. What it does not understand is the Government's energy pricing policy. It believes that it has a role to play. If it is to succeed, it needs to be unshackled. It needs to know that the Government will support it, particularly in regard to import penetration. It wants to believe that it forms a part of the Government's industrial strategy.</p>

<p>I shall speak as rapidly as possible. The House will agree that the position of the textile industry as a whole is lamentable. The industry has declined over the last 20 to 25 years. It has been totally ignored by successive Governments, who


have treated its problems with no urgency, even though that was absolutely imperative if the industry was to survive over that period. Ultimately we have seen&#x2014;I am sure that it is a matter of great concern to all of us&#x2014;the decline about which I have spoken.<br/>
The real issue which divides the House this evening is that the Government's indifference and inaction, along with their ruinous economic policies and impotent industrial strategy, have played a positive role in accelerating the decline of the industry. That is our major point.<br/>
It is no use the Minister lecturing us today about strong exchange rates and so on. My constituents think not about exchange controls but about their inability to get away from the numbers of people outside the labour exchange. That is the exchange that they understand. When I became a Member of this House, 13 textile mills were open and flourishing. Since then, five have closed, six are on short time and two are struggling and have been forced to consider taking immediate action to stave off further bankruptcy and decline.<br/>
For many years, a dedicated and loyal labour force has accepted the technical innovation that is imperative if the industry is to progress. The amount of investment has been tremendous. Textile industrialists have invested &#x00A3;2,000 million. The industry has an impeccable industrial relations record. I could dot the i's and cross the t's, but I wish to be brief. Political parties and Governments must realise that these industries are fighting for their very lives. It would be a gross betrayal and an act of criminal folly if the Government were to fail to recognise the industry's plight and if they were to ignore the pleas for help and for constructive intervention.<br/>
The Prime Minister now says that she is in favour of constructive intervention. Such intervention could be used to help these industries, which have not had a fair crack of the whip in the post-war period.</p>

<p>There can be no workers in the world who less deserve to be thrown out of work than the textile and shoe workers. Throughout the years their conduct has been a model which should have ensured not only their survival but their prosperity. Shoe factories and mills have steadily modernised and brought themselves up not only to European standards but to the best world standards. The men and women in those factories and mills have adopted every possible improvement in manning practices and technology in order to keep them up to date. As Spencer Crookenden said, they are suffering badly from the exchange rate and the high level of the minimum lending rate. Textiles also suffer from those two things. Despite their fantastic efforts to modernise and adapt, no fewer than 200 mills closed inl980. Between January and November, 97,000 jobs were lost.<br/>
Yesterday's results from Carrington Viyella&#x2014;which has modernised to an extraordinary degree&#x2014;throw the textile industry into even deeper gloom. As many of my hon. Friends have said, 43 per cent. of those working in the industry are on short time. However, short-time working does not by any means work smoothly in every case.<br/>
On Monday a firm in my constituency wrote to me and said that it had experienced delays of up to three months in securing approval for a short-time working scheme and

delays of over five weeks in receiving the money after approval had been granted. Admittedly, I received a letter today which said that it had received some of the money, but part of the amount remains outstanding from October. That is clearly of extreme importance when one considers the industry's cash flow position and the high level of interest rates. I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend would exert pressure on his colleagues to improve matters substantially.<br/>
Despite all these difficulties, the industry still employs 630,000 people and has an output worth &#x00A3;9 billion. However, output fell by no less than 20 per cent. in the final quarter of the year compared with 1979. Despite the world recession and the strong pound, textile and clothing exports exceeded &#x00A3;2,000 million in 1980. That is a very creditable record.<br/>
Within the figures there are worrying signs. Although for 1980 as a whole the volume of textile and clothing exports fell by only 5 per cent. compared with the pevious year, the fall accelerated alarmingly in the last quarter of the year, to 20 per cent. Some of the factors involved in that fall are common to all exporting industries, namely, high interest rates, the high rate of sterling and the high cost of energy, which many hon. Members have mentioned.<br/>
Some factors are peculiar to the textile industry and affect both exports and the import penetration of the home market. In particular, there has been a great upsurge in the number of imports from the United States of America. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) that textiles are getting a jolly sight worse deal than coal. It is aggravating for those of us who come from the areas of the textile and shoe industries to see that coal miners are managing to keep coal out when we cannot keep textiles and shoes out. No one would complain if imports were fair, but they are not. The American home market is greatly protected by high tariffs which give the Americans a much larger share of the market than they would have on merit. It means that they can take full advantage of the economies of scale that are denied to us.<br/>
By far the most serious problem has been the artificially low price of energy to American textile producers. That has enabled them to seize an unduly large share of the United Kingdom market. Even if that advantage were to cease today, the enervating effect of squeezed margins and accumulated losses in the United Kingdom's textile industry would have a continuing effect, since once factories such as the Courtaulds' Lansil factory in my constituency close&#x2014;which closed with a loss of 665 jobs,&#x2014;they are unlikely to reopen. Those that remain open are weakened thereby. Unfortunately, there is no chance of the unfair energy pricing for gas changing immediately in the United States of America, because that would require legislation, which would take months to achieve.<br/>
There is no chance that the American textile industry will voluntarily&#x2014;I stress that word&#x2014;curb its exports to the United Kingdom unless it can be frightened into doing so. We are about to embark on renegotiation of the MFA, which the United States wants just as badly as we do. However, the developing countries rightly say that their restraints on exports to the EEC have not benefited European producers, since the slack has simply been filled by imports from the United States. That is the last thing desired by Britain or by the developing countries. The United States has a clear interest in seeing that the agreement is negotiated. Unless the United States


moderates its present cut-throat policies, the renewal of the MFA and its bilaterals could be put at risk. At present imports from the United States are the main threat, but that must not lead the Government to overlook for a moment the importance of renewing the MFA this year.<br/>
I hope that my right hon. Friend has read the booklet "Textiles into the 80's", which some colleagues and I put before him as a policy for the textile industry. Low-cost countries are by no means always genuinely developing countries. That point is made in the booklet. They have taken almost 30 per cent. in volume of the United Kingdom's textile and clothing market.<br/>
If the market were growing, that would not be so serious. However, the market is not growing. Indeed, sales in this sector fell by 4 per cent. during the last quarter. It is only fair that, if developing countries wish to have an increasing share of our home market when it is expanding, they should be prepared to accept a decrease when our market is contracting.<br/>
A growth recession clause, relating imports from the developing countries to the state of the home market, should be included in the MFA. I was slightly reassured when I heard the Secretary of State say that nothing had changed since July, when his predecessor promised to make this a central matter for negotiation. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Trippier) that this is not only central but vital. The situation has worsened considerably since July.<br/>
I believe that the Secretary of State has a genuine interest in the problems of the textile industry. However, he did not entirely show that interest today. He knows that the damage done in the course of many years cannot be undone overnight. I beg him to take the toughest stand possible with the United States of America about the MFA. When there is an upturn in demand there will then be an industry that is still capable of taking advantage of it.<br/>
Some factors relating to the origin marking scheme have been worrying the textile industry. It is important that the material should also be marked with the country of origin and not just the garment. I do not like the Government's amendment to the motion. The first and last parts of the amendment make sense. However, I do not like the words
<q>notes the measures which the Government has taken to give these industries a wide range of protection".</q>
Not nearly enough protection has been given. Far tougher action needs to be taken.<br/>
However, I agree that the pursuit of realistic policies that are designed to lower the rate of inflation and to maintain access to export markets is important. For that reason alone, I shall give the Government one more chance. However, the next time that we debate the textiles industry I shall go into the Opposition Lobby if we are not faced with a much more satisfactory position.</p>

<p>The debate is a direct response to the TUC-organised lobby of workers from the textile, clothing and footwear industries. It has once again shown the House the importance of the issue. It has highlighted the fact that the Government's policies are completely bankrupt.<br/>
During the short debate we heard criticisms of the Government from both sides of the House. My hon. Friends the Members for Kettering (Mr. Homewood), Stockport, South (Mr. McNally), Batley and Morley (Mr. Woolmer), Ince (Mr. McGuire) and Keighley (Mr. Cryer) have sat here throughout the debate. Only time has prevented them from making a contribution in support of the Opposition motion.<br/>
In his opening remarks the Minister referred to high interest rates and the strength of the pound, but he did not say what he intended to do about them. Those factors, together with high energy costs, on top of a depressed home market, have led to redundancies and closures on a massive scale. Investment in those industries has been reduced. During the 1970s all three industries invested heavily to meet the challenge of the 1980s. That financial and human capital is being steadily destroyed as a direct result of monetarism.<br/>
Major companies are making savage cuts. Total employment in the textile and clothing industry is more than 700,000, compared with 420,000 in chemicals, 389,000 in metal manufacture and 695,000 in vehicles. Reference was made to short-time working and redundancies. In the list of the level of short-time working, textiles is fourth and clothing and footwear fifth. For redundancies in 1980, unfortunately, the textile industry is top of the league&#x2014;an unfortunate league indeed.<br/>
Between January and November 1980, 97,000 jobs were lost in textiles and clothing alone. Courtaulds has just announced the loss of 1,550 jobs at Aintree, and more than 300 jobs are to be lost at Carrickfergus. The blame for that has been laid firmly at the feet of the Government. Last year, 200 mills closed. The clothing industry has been equally hard hit, spelling the end of the small clothing manufacturer and opening the door to imports.<br/>
There are 66,000 workers in the footwear industry of whom 6,000 lost their job in 1980 alone. There were 800 redundancies in January this year. This month 17,000 workers in the footwear industry are on short-time, and 1,200 jobs at Norvic were recently saved by the intervention of my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, South (Mr.Garrett) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield (Mr. Concannon).<br/>
The previous Labour Government was the first Government to take the footwear industry seriously. They set up the footwear study group&#x2014;a committee of Labour and Conservative Members, manufacturers, traders, trade unions and civil servants. The group proposed a scheme of assistance to which the Labour Government responded immediately by making an initial &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;5 million available. That was fully taken up and led to many modernisation projects in the industry. The present Government have made no further funds available. We have heard the pleas from the Minister's hon. Friends this afternoon for more assistance for the footwear industry. That industry has been scaled down. What is the Government's current position in relation to the industry demand for more capital? Will they provide a small sum to help the industry survive and, not least, to improve design? The footwear economic development committee says that it will now concentrate on improving productivity, marketing, design and exports. What help will the Government give to its efforts?<br/>
I turn to imports in the textile industry. It is worth noting that in 1980, in volume terms imports from the developed countries exceeded those from under-developed


countries for the first time in our history. That answers the claim that Britain is being flooded with imports from the Third world. It shows clearly that the major problem is imports from the EEC and, not least, the United States.<br/>
The problem of United States imports has dominated the debate. It was the only major country to increase its exports of textiles to Britain in 1980. Yet it has a highly protected home market, and is subsidising industry through artificial pricing of natural gas and feedstock. We acknowledge that the Government have raised the control of American imports with the EEC Council of Ministers. Their attempts to obtain an agreement have failed dismally. The matter will be raised again&#x2014;we assume, at the meeting of the Council next month. It is imperative for the future of our textile industry that a satisfactory conclusion is reached at that meeting, and that we are not fobbed off with promises of more discussions.<br/>
If the Council of Ministers once again fails to agree EEC-wide controls of textile imports from the United States, the Government must take unilateral action immediately to secure a future for our textile industry. The Government must ensure that the multi-fibre arrangement works in the interests of British industry, and that a recession agreement is negotiated at the earliest opportunity.<br/>
Investment is a key factor. Other Governments in Europe&#x2014;for example, Belgium and France&#x2014;have recognised that and are investing heavily to save their industries. That is direct Government intervention by EEC countries. The Government must not allow the investment of the 1970s to go to waste, as it will if the trends of the past two years continue. The future of our industries can be secured only be a high and continuing level of investment. The Government must act now to prevent any further cuts in equipment and manpower and to stimulate innovation.<br/>
The Government should ensure that the trade unions are involved in the planning and use of Government aid. The guidelines for aid must be strengthened so that, wherever possible, British machinery and equipment are purchased. An immediate step that the Government could take to prevent a further decline would be to strengthen the temporary short-time working compensation scheme, which would at least prevent the departure of skilled labour from the industry in the way that is happening now.<br/>
Textiles, clothing and footwear have been among the worst affected by the Government's decision to reduce regional aid and to remove areas in the North-West and Yorkshire from assisted area status. That is absolutely criminal. It is clear that regional aid must be extended, with a greater input of funds and the restoration of assisted area status to those areas in which the industries operate. It is obvious from the debate that urgent action is needed to save the textile, clothing and footwear industries.<br/>
We have heard this afternoon about other industries, such as the coal, steel and motor industries, which are vital to the economy of the nation, but the wide debate that has taken place in the House this afternoon, reflecting a large number of constituencies represented by Members on both sides of the House, has underlined the importance of our textile, clothing and footwear industries.<br/>
What we are asking the Government, what we are saying to the Minister, and what my right hon. and hon. Friends have said clearly during this short debate, is that we want action. We want a clear commitment from the Government to maintain viable textile, clothing and

footwear industries. My right hon. and hon. Friends have advanced constructive proposals. We want to see Government action. We want to see action on behalf of the three industries. If the Government do not take action, and if nothing is done at the March meeting of the EEC Ministers, it could spell disaster for the industries. I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote against the Government.<br/>
We want to hear from the Secretary of State some clear policies and an outline of the way in which the Government will deal with the issue. If the Government are changing course, they must do so for the textile, footwear and clothing industries.</p>

<p>It was made by my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton), who explained to me that he had to go elsewhere.<br/>
Ministers are constantly and legitimately bombarded by the industries, their managements, their work forces and by the trade unions concerned. Hon. Members on both sides of the House art: validly and constantly emphasising the problems of these industries. I pay tribute to the sincerity and passion with which the case is made for better treatment for the industries. The one thing that we are not short of is information.<br/>
I hope that the House will understand that in a debate covering no fewer than three major industries and with only 17 minutes in which to reply I shall not be able to answer every issue that has been raised. However, I undertake to write to all those whose points I shall not have time to answer.<br/>
Secondly, I shall have to generalise in meeting the main arguments. I shall refer to all those who have spoken, but I shall not refer specifically to the arguments advanced by the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Ford) and by the hon. and learned Member for Bradford, West (Mr. Lyons). I recognise the force of their feelings and general arguments. Equally, I shall not refer specifically to the strong, brief but none the less effective speech of the hon. Member for Leigh (Mr. Cunliffe). I acknowledge the value of the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Gillingham (Sir F. Burden), who has great experience.<br/>
Ministers working on this range of subjects are helped because the Parliamentary Private Secretary to my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Industry happens to be my hon. Friend the Member for Nelson and Colne (Mr. Lee), who is an extremely articulate representative of that constituency and leaves Ministers in no doubt about the problems of the industries in Nelson and Colne.<br/>
Before taking up the general argument I turn to the questions asked at the beginning of the debate by the hon. Member for Antrim, South (Mr. Molyneaux), who spoke of energy prices in Northern Ireland. The Government recognise that there are problems. Electricity prices in Northern Ireland are already subsidised by the taxpayer.


Subsidies have been applied to keep industrial electricity prices to within 7 per cent. of the level in the rest of the United Kingdom, and a working party has been considering electricity prices in Northern Ireland. Energy prices in Northern Ireland are the responsibility of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.<br/>
In the 15 minutes that remain I shall try, while recognising the intensely strong feelings on both sides of the House and the impact of all the factors that have been identified upon the jobs and lives of those who work in the industries and on their households, to put the arguments in a slighly different framework, without in any way flinching from the Government's share of responsibility.</p>

<p>That is what I shall try to set in a proper framework.<br/>
In these industrial matters there is a division of responsibility. The Government have general and particular responsibilities. The general responsibility is to reduce inflation&#x2014;which we are seeking to do with some success&#x2014;and to reduce interest rates. The Government dearly want to reduce interest rates. We want to create conditions in which interest rates come down, and come down sharply. However, we inherited a runaway spending momentum from the Labour Government. Until we achieve a better proportion in terms of what we spend, and therefore what we have to tax and borrow, interest rates will not come down as much as we all want.<br/>
There may even be a connection, though experts argue with each other about it, between interest rates and the exchange rate, which hon. Members on both sides of the House have correctly identified as a crucial factor in current trading conditions. We recognise that the Government have a responsibility for creating conditions in which inflation and interest rates fall. We recognise that we must get energy prices right. The House knows that at the NEDC meeting next week there will be presented the task force's report on energy prices, to which the Government will have to react.<br/>
As I have said, the Government have a responsibility to create the right framework for industry, and that could lead me to talk about nationalised industry charges. The Government have responsibilities for all these general pressures upon industry, upon the economy and upon individuals, but we cannot control the world recession, which is one of the important factors affecting the three industries that we are discussing.<br/>
In addition to the Government's responsibility to the economy in general&#x2014;the pressures that I have mentioned have an effect on every other industry, as well as on clothing, textiles and footwear&#x2014;there are special responsibilities that successive Governments, including this one, have accepted towards these three internationally highly competitive industries. These include the responsibility to open doors for our exports. As my hon. Friends the Members for Wellingborough (Mr. Fry) and for Northampton, South (Mr. Morris) have emphasised, our footwear industry is desperately blocked by so many of our natural export markets being closed. My hon. Friends have no reason to doubt that Ministers are trying as hard as they can to negotiate, in private discussion and

in public negotiation, to open the closed markets. We want to open them, and I recognise the strength of feeling in the industry until we succeed.<br/>
The Government have a special responsibility to negotiate and to operate as well as they can the inherited regulatory framework. The industries are protected to a greater extent than any other industry in our economy. The Government are a free but fair trade Government. We recognise that we do not have a fair trading world, but it is in our interests to make it as fair as possible and to trade as much as possible in the philosophy of free but fair trade. I do not think that anybody can question the vigour with which my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade has sought, first under the guidance of my right hon. Friend who is now the Secretary of State for Defence, and now under that of the new Secretary of State for Trade, to protect the network of protective arrangements that we inherited from our predecessors, and which we have greatly expanded. The textile, clothing and footwear industries, so far as they come from State trading or developing countries, are massively protected, though not always 100 per cent. effectively.<br/>
It is against that background of Government responsibility, general and special, that I come to the next factor in the argument. Home demand for clothing, textiles and footwear has been pretty stable over the last 18 months, surprisingly enough. We do not have the latest figures. The consumption of footwear has increased. Textiles sales have fallen, but sales of clothing are stable. Exports have gone up, rather than down. Imports have not risen significantly. What has caused output to slump so sharply is the massive destocking that has taken place under general economic pressures&#x2014;interest rates, inflation and the other factors of world recession to which I have referred.</p>

<p>In general, imports in these industries have been stable. Some have fallen, while some, including those from the United States, have risen, but, overall, imports have been stable.<br/>
Our clothing, textile and footwear industries are still by far the largest suppliers of our home market&#x2014;70 per cent. of the home market is supplied by our own manufacturers. Two-thirds of imports come from developed countries. I identify in particular the United States because it has featured a great deal in the debate. There is no doubt that American energy prices provide the background for what is unfair competition. Labour Members, with great braggadocio, demand that we confront the new President, President Reagan, and insist upon a change in energy prices. May I ask the House whether that is a more likely way to get results than the negotiations that we have initiated through the EEC with the new Administration and which have already resulted in a fairly hopeful response from the new American trade secretary? That will be followed up.<br/>
Only one-ninth of our market is supplied from developing countries. Although the vast bulk of the exports from developing countries are subject to restraint,


I accept that these exports can have a devastating affect upon narrow sectors and individual firms in our markets. Yet the House cannot doubt that there is now a much more massive and comprehensive system of regulation than the Government inherited, thanks to the activities of my right hon. and hon. Friends at the Department of Trade.<br/>
The House should remember that these exports are from developing countries which are our markets as well as our competitors. They are the very countries to which the Opposition want us to give more help but the very countries which they wish to stop from trading with us. There are firms and work forces in many parts of the country that rely upon the earnings of those developing countries, which have to export clothing, textiles and footwear to us in order to buy the products of other parts of this country.</p>

<p>No, I do not have time to do so.<br/>
I want to emphasise not only how widespread the network of protection is but also that it is effective. My hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield made the charge that the Dutch will be able to introduce massive aid for their textile industry and that it will take this country three years to block it. I should like to tell the House, in the absence of my hon. Friend who has to be away, that that is utterly untrue. The EEC has already blocked the Dutch proposed trade support scheme.<br/>
The hon. Member for Rochdale (Mr. Smith) and my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster (Mrs. Kellett-Bowman) showed understandable chagrin because coal miners are seeking higher redundancy pay or because steel workers get higher redundancy pay than textile workers, but I fear that the logic goes the other way. If the industry cannot afford higher redundancy payments than it is paying already, and if any extra redundancy pay has to come from the taxpayer, the more that is paid out by the taxpayer in, say, steel and coal, the less there is for any other public spending.<br/>
I have spoken openly and without denial of the responsibility of the Government. I turn now to the industry&#x2014;</p>

<p>Among those things for which the Government have no responsibility, does my right hon. Friend agree that one of the heaviest hammer blows to the industry has been the high rates that local authorities have imposed on companies in the textile industry, particularly in West Yorkshire, bearing in mind that many areas in West Yorkshire went Labour at the last election, imposed supplementary rates and are now imposing higher rates for next year?</p>

<p>That is absolutely true. I am glad I gave way to one hon. Member opposite and to one on my own side.<br/>
I accept that industrial relations in the industries concerned are excellent and that there has been massive investment in many parts of these industries. Nevertheless, I note, and I hope the House will note too, that the contrasts within these three industries are vivid. Firms are closing next door to firms that are booming.</p>

<p>How can that be, against the background of the conditions that have been described? The answer is that a combination of design skills, marketing flair, management flair and modern technology can produce triumphant success. In all the gloom, there are dramatic success stories.<br/>
I was asked whether the Government cared. Of course the Government cart: about these three industries. We would be mad not to care.&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "YOU are".]&#x2014;but we cannot guarantee the size of the industry. The coal industry, to which many hon. Members have referred, has shrunk over the past 20 years to one-third of its former size. Textiles, clothing and footwear are not the only industries that are having to adjust to changing conditions. We cannot guarantee the size of the industries, because so much depends on their management.<br/>
The Opposition's motion is opportunistic and hypocritical. They negotiated the framework which we are administering far more vigorously than they ever did. I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to reject the motion and to support the amendment.</p>

<p>It is somewhat unusual, I know, for the House to debate the economic and unemployment situation in the South-West. It last did so in 1977. It is without precedent for the House to debate unemployment in the South. The affluent South, as it was once known, is now suffering severely from the same economic situation that affects the rest of the country. I do not pretend that the South, even with the inclusion of the South-West, is in the dire economic position of the worst hit parts of the country. All things, however, are relative. We are talking of a grave and fast deteriorating situation which should be fully exposed in this debate.<br/>
I do not want to take too long in my remarks. I recognise that there are many hon. Members who wish to make constituency points. Although this is an Opposition Supply day, we can thank the Prime Minister and the Government for this debate. The Prime Minister's policies have spread the misery of grievously high unemployment so that no area of the country can escape its tragic consequences. The fortunes of any region are inevitably dependent largely on national trends.<br/>
At the moment, we are slap in the middle of the worst recession since the 1930s. The fall in output last year was the biggest since those grim years. The trend is continuing unabated. Only last week the Confederation of British Industry warned that no one should think that there is an upturn round the corner. Even the Institute of Directors is saying that the Government's economic policies are in a shambles. I believe that even the Minister of State, who, I understand, is to follow me in the debate, has been forced to become a wet alongside the Secretary of State for Employment. I suspect that he is probably dripping with chagrin.<br/>
The output of manufacturing industry last year fell by 13&#x00BD; per cent., and industry was reducing stocks at an unprecedented rate. Investment by manufacturing industry was 7 per cent. down in the second half of the year. We are talking of an appalling mess. When we discuss unemployment, a nightmare turns into a full scale horror story.<br/>
During the debate on the Redundancy Fund Bill last week, I drew attention to the staggering financial cost to the nation of unemployment. The Secretary of State for Employment played a little with the figures, but nothing that he said refutes the fact that the Government are needlessly paying people not to work instead of helping to create employment and jobs. They are pursuing the economic theories of the madhouse. Only industrial brute strength frightens them into listening to reason. That is the meaning of the pragmatic interventionism of the last few days in the coal mining industry and in the water industry.<br/>
The unemployment figure nationally is 2,463,000&#x2014;or 10&#x00B7;2 per cent.&#x2014;a rise of 974,000 in a year. It is a damning indictment of Government policy. I should like to examine the situation regionally. In the South-East region, excluding Greater London, unemployment went up by 59 per cent. between October 1979 and October 1980 compared with a national rise of 51 per cent. The figure

since that time has steadily increased. There are almost 300,000 people out of work in the region. Vacancies number only about 16,000 and have dropped appreciably this month. People tend to forget that the South-East is this country's largest manufacturing centre. If its prosperity falls away, it can only be the hallmark of national decline.<br/>
In the South-West, there are almost 155,000 people out of work&#x2014;9&#x00B7;3 per cent. There are only 6,500 vacancies. There are 24 people chasing every vacancy, which, measured in those terms, represents as bad a situation as exists in Scotland. In 1980, unemployment in the South-West was up by more than 50 per cent.<br/>
A debate of this sort will obviously cover contrasting ground. Employment conditions are different in Cornwall and Devon from those in Bristol or those in the Home Counties. Hon. Members will be making their own constituency points. Their speeches, I am sure, will reflect the extraordinarly diverse nature of industrial development that we are considering. Whether we are talking of major factory closures in Hertfordshire, Kent or Essex, of the effect on office jobs, which make up 40 per cent. of employment in the South-East, or on the hundreds of small engineering and printing firms that have gone bust or are deep in trouble, of building and construction, which is regarded as crucial in the South-West, of the contraction of work in the great ports of Portsmouth, Southampton or Bristol, or of agriculture and tourism, wherever we look, the picture is equally grim.<br/>
There are large pockets of unemployment in the South and South-West that well match many of the problems further north. Some places, specially in Devon and Cornwall, have jobless rates of two or three times the national average. In those areas the smaller firms in the private sector tend to be the hardest hit. Many of the workers in these firms who are thrown on the scrap-heap are less well provided for. They do not have the special payments and treatment provided when there are large-scale redundancies in parts of the public sector. For a Government who were supposedly dedicated to helping small firms, particularly the self-employed, their record is nothing short of an unmitigated disaster.<br/>
Earlier I mentioned the 1977 debate on the South-West. I have re-read what some right hon. and hon. Gentlemen, who were then in opposition, said. They were calling the unemployment position in that area "unacceptable" and "disgraceful". I wonder what they will call it tonight when over 1 million more are out of work. At that time they demanded remedial measures. The Labour Government introduced a good many remedial measures. I am thinking especially of the special employment measures which were sneered at by the then Opposition. They spoke then about the need for "real jobs". That was a favourite phrase.<br/>
Now the Government are being forced to expand those remedial measures&#x2014;for the most part inadequately. Unemployment fell steadily during the latter days of the Labour Government. It went down month by month in the South and the South-West as it did in the rest of the country. At that time inflation, too, was going down. At that time we were not using unemployment as a weapon, and the figures prove it.<br/>
One subject to which I draw the attention of the Minister of State is the Youth Aid report published yesterday about the youth opportunities programme. That applies to many young people in the areas we are debating. The report warns starkly that the youth opportunities programme faces the danger of breakdown if it is enlarged


to cope with the increased numbers of young unemployed without offering the right quality of education and training. I do not have time to go into the details of that report. I am not attacking the increased spending on the youth opportunities programme, but I ask the Secretary of State to consider carefully the message contained in the report and to take it seriously.<br/>
I looked at the report of what the right hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann) said in 1977. He called for a great public works programme to build roads and hospitals. I hope he will repeat his call tonight. If such works were needed then, they would be a godsend to such areas now. I hope to see the right hon. Gentleman and all his hon. Friends joining the queue outside No. 10. I understand that the Prime Minister said that she would see any Members who had major redundancy problems in their localities. If they queued up outside No. 10, they would be a rather more honest assembly than the Saatchi and Saatchi rent-a-crowd queue that we saw in the infamous pre-election dole queue poster.<br/>
The way to revive the flagging economy of the South and South-West and to get people back to work must be for the Government to change course but primarily to eject a Government who by any standards are dragging the nation deeper and deeper into a morass.<br/>
The Secretary of State for Employment&#x2014;I am sorry he has had to leave&#x2014;said in Eastbourne recently that it was all very well
<q>in the South-East of England, the relatively prosperous South-East, the pretty smug South-East, to be patronising about the North and the North-East but by God if you live there it is tough, it is hard.</q>
<q>If we talk about a united nation, one nation, do not let it just be words, let us try to understand the problems they face in places like Sunderland.</q>
I agree with the right hon. Gentleman entirely, but he was talking to that smug, self-satisfied Young Conservatives audience&#x2014;the same people who gave the Prime Minister a standing ovation not long before.<br/>
A week before that speech I was in Eastbourne speaking at a public meeting on unemployment. I had with me on the platform a representative of the local unemployed workers' organisation. There was nothing smug about that meeting. It is a sign of the times that one can be invited to speak at meetings on unemployment in such places as Eastbourne.<br/>
The Secretary of State should face the facts. The policies of his Government, especially those of the Prime Minister, have succeeded in achieving the one nation of which they speak, because there is nowhere else for the unemployed to go. Labour mobility&#x2014;something else that the Prime Minister was fond of talking about&#x2014;is now a very sick joke. The Government have united the nation, including the South and the South-West, in economic misery. We are suffering a level of unemployment that is a scandal in a civilised society.<br/>
I quote the Prime Minister's words in 1977. It is not the first time that the House will have heard this comment. I have no doubt that we shall hear it again form time to time. She said:
<q>Sometimes I've heard it said that Conservatives have been associated with unemployment. That's absolutely wrong. We'd have been drummed out of office if we'd had this level of unemployment".</q>
That was at a time when there were 1 million fewer unemployed than there are today. The Prime Minister is condemned out of her own mouth.<br/>
Only last week the Secretary of State for Employment made what I thought was an amazing U-turn. He publicly recorded what he called his unstinted admiration for the Prime Minister. I do not think that added to his public credibility. If he can find even an echo of that unbelievable sentiment among the 2&#x00BD; million people now unemployed, especially among those in the South and South-West, he will deserve a medal. What he really deserves is the sack, along with the rest of the Government.</p>

<p>There may only be 1 million in it, but the hon. Gentleman forgets that when the right hon. Gentleman came into office he inherited a level of unemployment of about 600,000. He more than doubled that level of unemployment. It does not do for the hon. Member for Islington, Central to shed tears over the unemployment level when he knows that the record of his Government was quite disgraceful.<br/>
Then, when the hon. Gentleman takes some credit for the fact that unemployment was falling in the last days of that Government, he has a sauce He knows why unemployment was falling then. It was falling because, first, the economy had been turned round from the disaster when his right hon. Friend the then Chancellor of the Exchequer came running back from Heathrow and called for the International Monetary Fund to bail him out. He had taken that measure with all the expenditure cuts that were involved. Secondly, even the former Prime Minister was able to muster just enough vision of the future to see that a general election was coming, although he did not even control the date of it. Having seen that it was coming, he stoked up the fires of future inflation by Government spending, in one programme after another, leaving us to clear up the mess that we inherited.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Member for Islington, Central on one thing&#x2014;that it is unusual for the House to discuss problems in the South and the South-West of Britain. As a Southerner myself. I find that perfectly welcome.<br/>
The House hears often enough about the obvious widespread problems in traditional manufacturing areas. It is important to recollect why those problems are so much worse in the old manufacturing areas. It is because past resistance to change prevented the solution of industrial problems when they were still sufficiently small to be easily handled.<br/>
Now, as always happens when the dam bursts&#x2014;and it always bursts when it is built up to try to stop progress&#x2014;we get a flood of problems. They are problems that have submerged many firms and threatened whole


industries. The South and the South-West, in contrast, have not suffered to anything like the same extent, because they have never had the same rigidities of structure that have so damaged the North of England and the Lowlands of Scotland.<br/>
No one would deny that we have our problems in the South, and in the South-West in particular. In London the local economy is usually very overheated. Even today, although the hon. Gentleman says that there are no jobs, the evening newspapers show that there are jobs aplenty being offered in a way that can only evoke envy among less fortunate, unemployed workers in the other regions of the country.</p>

Gentleman has only to look at the evening papers around London to know that that is true. Many skills are still in short supply in the South and South-East. All too often the poor levels of educational qualifications damage the chance of youngsters, especially in inner London, of finding employment. High commercial and industrial rents, expensive transport, and high rates&#x2014;I emphasise high rates to the hon. Gentleman, remembering which borough he represents in London&#x2014;together with traffic congestion, and the prospect of regional grants elsewhere, tend to drive or lure manufacturing away from the South and the South-East, and particularly away from the capital.<br/>
To some degree the same problems exist in other parts of the South. Despite the availability elsewhere of regional aids, however, new towns such as Crawley, Hemel Hempstead, Harlow and Basildon&#x2014;and growing centres such as Reading and the areas that are prominent in the electronics industry all along the Thames Valley&#x2014;remain attractive to industry. There are abounding instances of successes scored at home and abroad by companies in those areas.</p>

<p>Does the hon. Gentleman agree that even in new towns such as Harlow, which he previously represented, many firms are being driven out and are under very great pressure? Many people are becoming unemployed there because of the policies of the hon. Gentleman's Government. Will he say something about the effects of high interest rates, about the present overvaluation of the pound, and about many other issues that undoubtedly are producing unemployment in the South-East, in precisely the areas to which he has referred?</p>

<p>I shall be willing to give way again to the hon. Gentleman if he wants to welcome, for example, some of the new firms that are coming to Harlow and increasing employment opportunities, such as Merck Sharp and Dohme, the pharmaceutical company. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman, who is a very fair-minded man, would want to make that point in order to get the record straight.<br/>
Sometimes the projects that we are talking about are run-of-the-mill projects, but sometimes&#x2014;indeed, very

often in the South&#x2014;they are well up in the forefront of technology. I have in mind such firms as Redifon, of Crawley, and its rivals in flight and other simulation, Link Miles at Shoreham&#x2014;world leaders and well capable of taking on competition from anywhere in the world, despite the high level of the pound and despite high interest rates and all the other problems of which hon.

<p>The Minister has great knowledge of the aircraft industry. He may agree that the Isle of Wight is a very good place to be for those in the civil aviation and light aircraft industry; indeed, it is probably the home of the industry now. But he must be aware that, in spite of the fact that we have very modern industry on the Isle of Wight, we have 10&#x00BD; per cent. unemployment. The unemployment figure in Ventnor is 20 per cent. That is not the fault of the people there. Firms such as Ronson are closing down, due largely to the high interest rates and the overvalued pound.</p>

<p>I shall not duck these points. I prefer to come to them in my own time.<br/>
It is perfectly easy to turn to the South-West and to assume that it is still all tourism, agriculture and fishing, but that is very far from the case. When we talk about the South-West, it is wise to remember that Bristol and Severnside, and the industry there, present a very different picture from that in the far South-West of the country. Places such as Plymouth are different again, with the historical dependence on the Royal Naval dockyard.<br/>
I am not sure whether the hon. Member for Islington, Central is in favour of defence spending or against it. No doubt he is against it if it is defence spending and for it if it creates employment. But there are problems that are totally different from those of the traditional South-West&#x2014;the rural and small towns of Cornwall and Devon.<br/>
It should be remembered that the distance from Bristol to London is hardly any greater than the distance from Bristol to Plymouth, and that it takes rather less time to get to London from Bristol than to get to Bristol from Plymouth. So the South-West region is one in which there are great differences between places, although we tend to talk about them in the same way.</p>

<p>The Minister has wisely hit on the difficulties that exist. Will he say something about the pressures being brought by many hon. Members from Devon and Cornwall for the regional headquarters to be moved from Bristol to somewhere such as Taunton, Exeter or Plymouth? There are many places in the area that are further from Bristol than Bristol is from London. It really is nonsense to have the headquarters in Bristol.</p>

<p>I entirely understand my hon. Friend's point of view. It is one of the matters that we have to look at all the time. We have to consider whether these centres are in the best place. In the past, because most of the work has been in the Bristol and Severnside area, that is where the centre has been. It is because of the weight of population as well as the distance factor.</p>

<p>The Government have just closed down the regional employment headquarters in Exeter, which is 100 miles from where I live, in order to concentrate the facilities on Bristol. That is exactly the sort of thing about which there is mutual complaint in the South-West.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1804548" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1981-02-26a.1035.0" hansard_membership_id="2349" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21256" speakername="Mr. Tebbit" colnum="1035" time="19:26:00">
<p>It may well be that in the interests of the control of Government expenditure&#x2014;which at least half the House has in mind&#x2014;it is right to concentrate the facilities in the areas where most of the business is done, as opposed to meeting the other desirable criteria mentioned by hon. Members.<br/>
The unemployment rate in the South-West is now 9&#x00BD;1 per cent. That is the fourth lowest regional rate in the United Kingdom. None the less, we are aware that it conceals areas of acute local difficulties, as well as areas of considerable prosperity. The tourist business has a short seasonal peak and long winter troughs. It has had a hard fight to remain competitive against overseas holidays, but it has done remarkably well in recent times.<br/>
This is a debate about the regions, so it is right to refer to regional policy as such, and how it aims to assist areas such as the far South-West in coping with present problems. When we came to office in May 1979 we inherited a quite extraordinary regional policy. It had started back in the 1930s as a system for selectively aiding the most hard-pressed areas&#x2014;Merseyside, the North-East, and South Wales. But it had been allowed to grow, until 40 per cent. of the working population of the country was in assisted areas.<br/>
The key to any regional aid policy is that it must be discriminatory. One could not hold with a system offering aid so widely spread that it redressed the disadvantages of the most needy areas. So, following a review of that policy we decided that we had to enhance the attractiveness of the worst-off areas&#x2014;the special development areas&#x2014;by increasing the differential between regional development grant paid there and in the development areas. We increased that differential from 2 per cent. to 7 per cent. We concluded that it would be possible to reduce over three years the coverage of regional policy to 25 per cent. of the country.<br/>
We are now in the second of the three phases of changes implementing that conclusion. We are on the way to a concentrated and more cost-effective policy aimed at the areas most in need of help. More help is being brought to the extreme areas of the South-West, the special development areas and the other assisted areas&#x2014;relative to the rest of the country, which is what counts&#x2014;than they received previously.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a certain illogicality in an exercise whereby the excellent city of Plymouth gains the benefit of development area status&#x2014;an area with good roads, excellent rail services and some air traffic&#x2014;whereas an area such as North Devon, which has none of those advantages, loses development area status?</p>

<p>It is always possible to put a case by deploying the favourable aspects&#x2014;if that is the right word&#x2014;of a particular area in its quest for special treatment. We have to take a balance of all the factors that are involved&#x2014;unemployment levels, the question whether unemployment has been persistent, communications, and whether the area is cut off from other travel-to-work areas. Moreover, we keep the areas under review.<br/>
Regional policy is not only about grants; it includes infrastructure improvements. Much benefit has come from improved communications. For example, the Gloucester northern bypass will start this summer. That represents another &#x00A3;12&#x00BD;5 million of road building. I am glad, too, that

the M5-Tiverton link&#x2014;another &#x00A3;12&#x00BD;8 million of road building&#x2014;will start at the end of the year. These are useful schemes of road development.<br/>
The other characteristic of the South, as opposed to the North, is that it is probably far more dependent than is the North upon employment in small firms, which nationally employ about 25 per cent of our work force. The SouthWest, without heavy or capital-intensive industry, is even more dependent on small firms than is the rest of the South.<br/>
We have set out to create conditions that are more favourable to small firms. Since his appointment in January my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has been seeking new ways to build on the successes of his predecessor, who had become identified with the cause of small firms. In particular, he is interested in the work of COSIRA and the Development Commission, which have given much support to small firms, not only by offering advisory training and financial services but by factory building in the South-West. The hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Mitchell) seems to find something amusing or derisory in assisting firms with advisory and financial services, or with small factory building, but these matters are of considerable assistance to smaller firms in the South-West, apart from the general changes in the last Budget that benefited small firms in other ways.</p>

<p>I agree entirely with what my hon. Friend is saying about help for small firms. Does he accept that the present facilities are very limited in time&#x2014;limited to about six months? He said that the South-West can no longer be dependent on fishing, agriculture and tourism. So additional help is needed to extend the periods of training to enable people to take jobs in small firms which at present are not there. I hope that either he or his hon. Friend will be able to comment on that matter.</p>

<p>I am sure that my hon. Friend will wish to say something about training of that sort because it is rather different from the work of COSIRA and the Development Commission.<br/>
I know that Opposition Members are specialists in gloom tonight, but there are a number of bright spots in that gloom. Let me give some of them: J. I. Case Limited, at Redruth&#x2014;another 500 jobs over the next two to three years; Becton Dickinson, at Plymouth&#x2014;another 340 jobs over the next two to three years; Marconi Avionics, at Bristol&#x2014;850 jobs over the next two to three years; Lee Cooper, at Helston&#x2014;220 jobs over the next two to three years; Intel, at Swindon&#x2014;500 jobs over the next two to three years; Racal Milgo, at Swindon&#x2014;another 500; Tectonic Electronics at Swindon&#x2014;300 more.<br/>
In the Reading area, Digital Electronics is recruiting for another 700 to 1,000 new jobs; Ferranti Computer Systems&#x2014;400 new jobs; Racal&#x2014;300 new jobs; and Mitel Telecommunications&#x2014;250 new jobs.<br/>
In Essex, to please the hon. Member for Harlow (Mr. Newens), there are 500 new jobs at Marconi Avionics, at Basildon and Rochester. I have mentioned Merck Sharp and Dohme and Trebor Mints, at Colchester&#x2014;400 new jobs; and Gordon's Gin, at Basildon&#x2014;150 new jobs. I know that the hon. Gentleman wants to recite all the bad news. I understand that he wants to tell us about the


closures and to keep telling us that everything is bad, but I want, to impress upon him the fact that there is another side to the story.<br/>
The new jobs that are created in the hard times of a recession are jobs that are viable in the long term, whereas many of the jobs that have gone to the wall during the past few years&#x2014;less in the South and South-West than in the rest of the country&#x2014;are jobs that have been hanging on by the skin of their teeth for many years past. They are jobs that would have had to go before long if British industry was to become sufficiently competitive to live in the competitive world of exports, where it has to face the challenge of the Germans and the Japanese.<br/>
There is good news, too, in the broader view. The Government have set as their prime objective the reduction of the level of inflation. Inflation is coming down fast. The underlying level of inflation is probably well under 10 per cent. But the hon. Gentleman does not want to talk about inflation now, though a year ago that was all that he wanted to talk about. Opposition Members do not want to discuss good news. It reminds me of a broadcast that I heard on the BBC yesterday morning, when it appeared that a football team had won a match against another football team that had been losing a lot. The Opposition always refer not to somebody winning a match but to somebody else losing.</p>

<p>No. I want to leave time for others to speak.<br/>
The balance of payments is now far more favourable than Opposition Members are willing to admit is possible. We are exporting &#x00A3;1 billion worth of goods a month despite all the problems. There is much better news of pay settlements generally in industry. Pay settlements in the engineering industry are reported to be well down to single figures. That must be good news for the future. Industrial relations are better in terms of days lost and strikes. The Opposition wanted to talk about that in the past.<br/>
All that has been achieved without the rigidities of statutory pay and price control. All that will ensure that as the recession eases British industry and commerce will be better equipped than before to take advantage of it and less likely to run back into the familiar cycle of high inflation and another round of high unemployment.</p>

<p>As usual, the Minister gave his party knockabout, at which he is always good. However, he then drifted into the realms of fantasy. I shall be, I hope, short, but many hon. Members from the South-West sit on the Government Benches, whereas only a few sit on the Opposition Benches. They are many; we are few.<br/>
I propose to keep my remarks practical and to confine them to the Bristol area. Bristol has a fair mix of industry and commerce. It contains some advanced industries. It is also a commercial city. In the past, in times of depression,

one aspect has balanced the other and Bristol has not suffered as much as, say, the North or South Wales. I am not talking of course, about the far West. But the situation in Bristol today is different. Our unemployment figures are all too close to the national average.<br/>
The Minister spoke of gloom and suggested that we on the Labour Benches are merchants of gloom. Some gloomy Bristol people are probably closer to the Minister, politically, than we are. I received a memorandum from Mr. John West, the director and chief executive of the Engineering Employers' West of England Association. The Association's head office is in Bristol. The memorandum was sent to all hon. Members representing constituencies in the South-West. He stated:
<q>A few companies have been pushed so hard that they will never recover. Many more are having to close parts of their business with little hope that they will ever be able to start up again. A large proportion of our members have been shedding staff and/or working short-time. Many are reporting declining profits and some are eating into their financial reserves. Not since the War has there been such a picture of immense industrial change nor such worrying unemployment trends.</q>
I do not know anything about Mr. West's politics, but I guess that his members support the Conservative Party more than the Labour Party.<br/>
Business men seem to be torn now between their political allegiance and their practical experience. In spite of their theoretical principles at a general election, they are often now near to bankruptcy, and that concentrates their minds. They want cuts in public expenditure and reductions in the public sector borrowing requirement. At the same time, they praise those who maintain useful capital expenditure. Much capital expenditure these days is bound to emanate from the nationalised industries within the public sector. That is particularly true of firms in the Bristol area. I refer to the electricity, gas, nuclear energy and railway industries.<br/>
I do not blame firms for being confused, because clearly the Government are divided and confused. They do not know whether they are coming or going. Business men want both public expenditure to stimulate growth and public economies to keep down taxation. That is the impression that I gained also from a weekend ministerial television programme. So if the employers in Bristol are divided and confused, we should forgive them, for so are the Government.<br/>
But my present intention is not to go over the Government's general policy. I wish to make some short observations about the special difficulties of the Bristol area. Bristol is not a development area, and therefore receives no special assistance. It receives no encouragement from the Government to stimulate new industries. New industries often find fertile soil in the Bristol area, but the city receives no help from outside to provide additional stimulus.<br/>
Two bad decisions affecting Bristol were made by the Government recently. The first was the Government's decision to send the Inmos production development to South Wales. As a result, the development has slowed down. It is a loss to Bristol's economy and to that of the country as a whole. So far as I can judge, no great further progress has been made and no employment has been created in Wales. That was a bad decision about which there is strong feeling in Bristol.</p>

<p>I admit that there is good and bad in everything, but the loss of Inmos to Bristol, when it wished to be in Bristol, was the result of a mistaken decision.<br/>
The other grievance involves the refusal to make the area around the new Portbury dock an enterprise zone. The city council has been energetic and it applied for enterprise zone status for that land. We all know the history of Portbury. It was a venture of faith by the old Bristol corporation when Bristol had the resources of a county. It was constructed at ratepayers' expense, with no assistance from national funds. Potentially it is a tremendous national asset, being at a key point in the motorway system. It could be one of the most up-to-date ports of a new type in Europe. However, the city council and the port of Bristol are now going through heavy financial difficulties with the burden of Portbury. Therefore, it would be reasonable if the Government could give assistance by making the area around the port of Bristol, particularly on the western side of the Avon, an enterprise zone. Although it involved no cash subsidy, the enterprise zone was refused.<br/>
Bristol has lost again. Because if it is not a special area of one kind or another it does not rank for any help from EEC funds. Similarly, it fails to get the advantage of low interest rates. The Government's decision was conveyed to me and other Bristol Members in a short letter from a Minister, with no further explanation. By taking that decision, the Government have not just hit Bristol in one direction; several other consequent blows have flowed from it, against Bristol and its port.</p>

<p>I sympathise with a great deal of what the hon. Member says. However, in all honesty, he must make it clear that it would have been extremely unlikely for his party to start to give privileges of this kind, much as we might want them, to an area such as Bristol, whose unemployment rate is still two points below the national average. This is not a party point. It would be almost inconceivable for a Labour Government to give such privileges to Bristol.</p>

<p>I should have thought that the same was obviously true of the present Conservative Government, but I am speaking here for Bristol and I hope that the hon. Gentleman will do the same.<br/>
These adverse factors have entirely distorted the competitive position of Royal Portbury, and are significant to Bristol in the present economic situation. I am sure that the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Mr. Waldegrave) would agree with me at least on this point. The Bristol city council has made tremendous efforts to attract industry to the Bristol area. It has not been asleep on this matter, as the hon. Member knows.<br/>
An additional suggestion from Bristol is that we should have some overall good sense and planning in the port facilities for the Severn as a whole, because the nationalised ports on the other side of the river have advantages because of the special status of South Wales. Those advantages are lacking for the port of Bristol.<br/>
The port of Bristol is the largest municipal trading undertaking left in this country. Its finances need reorganisation. We would be helped if private funds were available. They are badly needed. But it will not be possible to attract private funds to the port, unless the

Government make a gesture to Bristol. I hope that we shall have a public response on this matter from the Minister, rather than private correspondence.<br/>
Finally, I turn to the possible Severn barrage. As the Minister knows&#x2014;he is a man of all wisdom&#x2014;a special committee has sat for some time, appointed by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn), when he was Secretary of State for Energy, following a report by the Select Committee on Science and Technology, of which the Minister was a member. That report suggested that there should be a new look at the possibilities of a Severn barrage for electricity production. If constructed, it would be a public work of great size and immense potential, not just for the present but for well into the future. It would stimulate engineering work, not only civil and mechanical but electrical, on an enormous scale. That would last for many years to come.<br/>
The barrage would be a power producer. It would be remunerative and would give an adequate return on capital for if it did not it would not be constructed at all. I have the privilege of serving on that special committee. Our report will be out soon. I think that I can say, without giving away any secrets, that the report will be in favour of proceeding with the barrage, subject to a further feasibility study. If built, the barrage will take the place of about three large modern power stations, whether nuclear or coal-fired. Therefore, the report should be taken seriously in the energy context.<br/>
There has been much talk over the years, going back before the First World War, about a Severn barrage but if one constructs a barrage it must be related to the electrical demand of the country. For this reason, today a barrage can be placed economically at the best point across the Severn Estuary to give maximum output.<br/>
I hope that when that report appears there will be some political will on the part of the Government and the Cabinet, to go further, because the construction of the Severn barrage is not just a question of reports, or of engineering capacity, but of political will.</p>

Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) and especially to my hon. Friend the Minister of State who has many qualities which I admire. However, perhaps it would be better if we did not have opening speeches from the Front Bench but merely had the motion moved formally. We could then have a series of more important winding-up speeches in answer to the debate.<br/>
On the face of it, it is surprising that we are discussing the economies of the South and the South-West together, because they are wholly different areas. They are as different as the Scilly Isles are from the Shetlands. However, there is a certain amount of logic in what we are doing. The economic health of the United Kingdom is


indivisible. In terms of economic prosperity, the nations and regions of the United Kingdom are wholly interdependent.<br/>
In our part of the world, we have special problems. We have an older than average population and we have less industry. I could quote statistics at some length, but I shall forbear to do so, for obvious reasons which we have already discussed. I quote one example:
<q>The South-West grew more slowly between 1971 and 1975 than any other region, and by 1975 the GDP per head in the South West was the lowest of any English region at just over 90 per cent. of the United Kingdom average.</q>
That example comes from <i>Economic Trends,</i> published at the end of last year.<br/>
Although, remarkably, more people are employed than there were five or six years ago, too many people are on short-time working. There are 150,000 or more out of work. In my area the unemployment percentage rate has increased by 50 per cent. in the last five years. The reality is that not only are we in the South-West growing more slowly than is the remainder of the United Kingdom but, alas, we are getting poorer in comparison with the remainder of the nation. If I have an ambition&#x2014;and I declare this plainly to the House, and I do not doubt that the feeling is shared by many other hon. Members&#x2014;it is to see a greater level of economic health in the South-West and a better opportunity in particular for our young people.<br/>
How can we help? This is my third and last point, and it is the major issue to which we should address ourselves. We heard a great deal about regional aid. Regional aid has a part to play, but, as a rule, only a small one. From my experience as a Minister at the old Board of Trade and with the Public Accounts Committee, I am convinced that if industries wish to move to a particular place they will go there irrespective of regional aid. If the whole country is prosperous, such aid is unnecessary.<br/>
Advance factories can help, as can bodies such as COSIRA. However, what matters much more is the attitude of the Government to the regions. It should be a prime aim of policy to do everything possible to maintain local interest and amenities. That has not always been the case. For example, we have not always nurtured local patriotism. We have destroyed some of the ethic of really local government. In my part of the world we have taken the Army away completely. We no longer have a local regiment. We have moved it to a ghetto on Salisbury Plain. The catalogue could continue with village schools. Hardly one substantial business in the South-West is now locally owned. It is the duty of the Government in every way possible to foster local amenities and interest.<br/>
We must strive to increase the general level of economic activity. It was once remarked that we had only tourism and agriculture in the South-West. If that were the truth, we should not be ashamed of it. However, it is not true. In 1979, domestic tourists spent &#x00A3;650 million, and overseas visitors over &#x00A3;100 million. Last year in the SouthWest they were spending on average &#x00A3;2 million a day. About 170,000 jobs are involved. We must endorse the strategy of the West Country tourist board. Why did I begin by saying that prosperity was indivisible? If people in the remainder of the United Kingdom are prosperous, tourism will benefit and so shall we in the South-West.<br/>
Then we come to agriculture. In the six counties there are 40,000 farms and 50,000 workers. From 4&#x00BC;million

acres our regional output is &#x00A3;1,000 million a year, onethird of it from dairying. However, what arrangements do we make as Members of this House and within the EEC? Farm incomes last year fell by 24 per cent. If the Common Market proposals go through in their present form there will be a further fall of 30 per cent. No wonder bank borrowing for agriculture rose by 30 per cent. last year, which is in any case, a rise on the previous year. If fanning is prosperous, more machinery will be bought. Prosperity is truly indivisible.<br/>
The general level of economic health is important to the South-West, but there are also special points. We must see that our communications are good. We have never paid proper tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Peyton) for the work that was done on the A303 when he was Minister of Transport, for the dualling of the A38 to Plymouth and for the building of the M5 motorway&#x2014;incidentally, in response to a campaign led from the Conservative Benches some years before. We must press on with roads and keep the rail link to Penzance.<br/>
I was challenged to repeat the remarks that I made in 1979. I shall do so. This has been a constant theme of mine. We must launch a strong public works programme, preferably privately funded. The hon. Member for Bristol North-East (Mr. Palmer) quoted the Severn barrage, which is an admirable case in point. The Department of Industry should set up a task force to identify all over the United Kingdom a series of projects like the Severn barrage. Let us put together a group of people to see what is practicable, what can be done and what can be funded. Let us do something constructive. In such a way let us bring a little more prosperity to those parts of the world in which we live, in which our children are growing up and which we love.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Minister was right. The theme should be success. Here is an ideal opportunity for the Department of Industry to give a lead, which would transform at any rate our part of the world.</p>

<p>I am a West Countryman and sound like one. I was born and brought up in Cornwall and am proud of it. Cornwall has a tremendous problem, although I do not underestimate the problems of other areas.<br/>
Percentage male unemployment registered at the employment exchanges in Cornwall is as follows: Penzance 18&#x00B7;1, St. Ives 29&#x00B7;7, Redruth-Camborne-Hayle 17&#x00B7;2, Falmouth 23&#x00B7;5, Helston 20.1, Truro 13&#x00B7;9, Newquay 19&#x00B7;2, St. Austell 10&#x00B7;6, Bodmin 12&#x00B7;1, Wadebridge 18&#x00B7;6 and Camelford 18&#x00B7;3. That is a district average of 16&#x00B7;5 per cent. A recent parliamentary reply that I received revealed that Cornwall had two out of the six worst exchanges for unemployment figures in Britain. The figures say it all. The area is only 80 or l00 miles long. Not one employment exchange shows male unemployment at less than 10 per cent. Not one employment exchange has figures less than the national average.<br/>
In mid-summer we can look to a marginal improvement, but it will be nothing like as good as those outside assume that it will be. Some of our detailed employment legislation precludes local people having a regular pattern of summer-time only employment. In the third year some people may end up receiving no unemployment benefit.<br/>
The figures for the South-West&#x2014;or at least the Government's version of the South-West&#x2014;are better than the national average. I have never been able to work out how Bristol is part of the South-West. I know that by saying that I shall upset Bristol Members, but from the great community in which I live Bristol seems more like a suburb of Birmingham. The figure for the South-West overall is 9&#x00B7;3 per cent. and for the South-East 7 per cent., and the national average is 10&#x00B7;2 per cent. The area has seen a substantial increase in unemployment in the past few months, which is a reflection of the general decline in employment. I firmly believe that most of it is a direct result of deliberate Government economic policy.<br/>
Currently the Government&#x2014;I do not say wrongly, given the situation in which they find themselves&#x2014;are pouring money into British Steel and British Leyland. That is no help at all to regions as far away as mine. To say that it is no help is perhaps an exaggeration, but it is certainly very little help. I regard that money as a tax on monetarism&#x2014;a penalty that the Government are being forced to pay to try to prop up the formerly prosperous Midlands because of their own economic policy. The Government are probably now spending more money on propping up those industries than they are spending in all the development areas in the country.<br/>
I am firmly of the view that the only real economic hope for Britain now is that the Prime Minister, during her current travels, will persuade the President of the United States to pursue an even more insane economic policy than her own, thus driving the hot money out of Britain and into the United States, and returning to a more sensible exchange rate.<br/>
Let us consider the individual industries which are important to our region. In the building industry, unemployment among building workers in Plymouth is 27 per cent., and I have no doubt that the figure for Cornwall is very much the same. Part of that is certainly the result of deliberate Government cuts in financing public housing&#x2014;in an area in which massive housing queues are the norm, not the exception. In the building industry in the South-West, what the Government have not succeeded in damaging through cuts in public expenditure has been slaughtered by interest rates. Private house building has virtually terminated in my area. That is not surprising when one analyses the reality. For a modest &#x00A3;17,000 house, the first-time purchaser is required to make monthly mortgage repayments of almost &#x00A3;200. In an area in which wages are substantially below the national average, such mortgages are beyond reality and possibility of repayment.<br/>
I strongly believe that areas with an essentially weak economy are more dependent upon a regular supply of Government investment than the more prosperous areas of the country. My own county council, probably above all in Britain, could not be accused of overspending. The argument is constantly rolled out in the House that we must keep the rates down and business will pour in. That hardly follows in my county, where I believe that we have the lowest rates of any county in the country.<br/>
The Inner London Education Authority spends 92 per cent. more per head on educating primary school students than the county council in Cornwall spends. I give that illustration to show that the county cannot be accused of any ludicrous waste of public money. Nevertheless, in

order to maintain a reasonable background of employment, the county requires a steady level of Government investment. Tragically, that level is currently being reduced.<br/>
It is in the industrial sector, however, that the real mayhem is being created. The South-West has lost Rank Toshiba, which was mostly in Plymouth but some of it also in the far South-West. There are massive cuts in employment in many of our industrial companies. The China Clay group in my constituency, a prosperous company which last year made &#x00A3;42 million in profits&#x2014;if we had a few more like it in Britain we should not be in our present difficulties&#x2014;has reduced employment by 800 in the past nine months. There have been no redundancies. It has been done very nicely and very skilfully. Nevertheless, it now offers 800 fewer jobs in my constituency than it did a while ago.<br/>
The county has a peripheral economy. There is no doubt about that. We encourage people to come to our county because the alternative of telling them to stay away would cause even more problems. But there is no doubt that if there is a general reduction in the economy it will further affect some of the peripheral satellite companies in my county.</p>

<p>I am listening very carefully and I have considerable sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman says, but he has not mentioned the fact that, particularly in an industry such as china clay, there is the problem of world recession. If there is no demand, it is very difficult to export clay.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="1804567" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1981-02-26a.1044.1" hansard_membership_id="10167" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19420" speakername="Mr. Penhaligon" colnum="1044" time="20:18:00">
<p>Whether it is the peripheral economy, ECLP, Rank Toshiba or the tourist industry, when asked what the problem is, the reason they all give is the exchange rate. Whether it is china clay, tourism, manufacturing springs or any other business that I can think of, all of them blame the exchange rate. Most of them tell me that they are losing their share of the world market and that, over and above the world slump, the exchange rate is one of the reasons why Britain is performing a great deal worse in the current situation than most of our industrial competitors abroad, and this is affecting the South-West as much as anywhere else.<br/>
If it is not the exchange rate, it is interest rates. I regard small businesses as one of the most hopeful areas for development. But one has only to meet the people running those companies to know that interest rates are crippling them as nothing has ever done before. I cite the example of tourism, which is a useful part of the West Country's economy. I do not know what kind of season we shall have this year. What with the internal slump and the high exchange rate, we may be in for a very rough time.<br/>
The farming industry, in which the hon. Member for Devon, West (Mr. Mills) is respected in the West Country, is experiencing a very difficult time. There is no doubt that the current price review in Europe is very important, because the industry could be swamped with debts&#x2014;I do not say bankrupted&#x2014;which will take a very long time to clear.<br/>
These are the important parts of West Country employment patterns. All of them are suffering from reversal and decline, which are a direct result of current Government policies, high interest rates and a massive exchange rate.<br/>
If I were to recommend a strategy for the South-West, certainly for the far South-West, it would be to encourage


what is natural. Farming, fishing, mining and tourism are the natural industries that come to mind. It is true that in the southern half of my constituency there is an engineering tradition which is more substantial than most people believe. I am a product of it. Whether that is a recommendation or not, I do not know. A combination of that with a massive long-term effort to expand telecommunications&#x2014;to be fair, I believe that the Government are, by legislation, doing some good work on that&#x2014;could enable the South-West to offer clerical and office services far more cheaply because of cheap office space and, to be honest, a relatively low-wage economy. Such services could be offered for some of the businesses in our big cities.<br/>
I therefore argue for an encouragement of what is natural. I am delighted to see the Minister nodding his head. Perhaps he will find out why mining, which is the backbone of Cornwall's industrial development, is excluded from development and special development area help. I have never understood why the industry which is most likely to grow in the far South-West of Cornwall is excluded from help afforded to development and special development areas.<br/>
It is true that if we want the tin mined we shall have to persuade people to go there. However, if the idea of such aid is to build up such an industry, it is logical that mining should be included.</p>

<p>I do not think that the hon. Gentleman hit the issue on the head. The special and selective aids are supposed to be for mobile investment, and by definition the mines are not mobile.</p>

<p>That just shows how stupid the scheme is. It seems far more logical to encourage what is natural and what may actually grow than to force something to come in from outside which does not even know where the great county of Cornwall is. Perhaps we can debate that matter in some detail on another occasion.<br/>
I accept that there is no way in which the regional problems of Cornwall will be solved in a general slump. We must look to an improvement in our infrastructure. The right hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann) mentioned roads. I would not argue with what he said about that. It is time that our rail links were improved. There are great fears in the county that the railway line through Cornwall will one day be totally chopped.<br/>
It is said that there are no votes in sewage. However, Cornwall is coming to an economic halt because of lack of sensible sewerage investment. There are few areas where industrial or domestic development can take place if there is a lack of sewerage investment.<br/>
My final point relates to industrial sites. Surprisingly, despite the slump, relatively few industrial factories that have been built over the years are empty. That shows what a success that policy has been. Now is the time to build further factories so that when the great recovery comes, about which the Government have more confidence than I, the infrastructure will exist to take advantage of it.<br/>
I beg the Government to consider giving the far SouthWest a larger responsibility to administer itself. I am constantly writing letters to Bristol, Cardiff, Gateshead and Salisbury&#x2014;Salisbury is the centre for COSIRA, one of the more successful enterprises&#x2014;but I fail to understand why so many of the real decisions affecting Cornwall are

taken outside the county. If the global sum currently given by the Government to the far peninsula of Cornwall to help it out of its economic difficulties were given to the county itself instead of being administered by all these other bodies, the people living in the county could make better use of it than people sitting in Gateshead, Cardiff, Bristol or Salisbury. A transfer of responsibility to the people who are affected by wrong decisions would help a great deal.<br/>
The figures that I quoted earlier are figures of tragedy. People in Cornwall are used to leaving the county to look for a job. Many a Cornish lad has gone to what is locally regarded as England in order to look for employment. The Government's failure is reflected in the fact that that lad no longer looks to England for employment because the situation is not much better there. The people in my county are born and brought up there and they are proud of their Cornishness. Outsiders may not understand that. Cornish people want an opportunity to earn their living, to raise families and to carry on their traditions.<br/>
The Government are, to a significant extent, responsible for the current slump. It has caused a breakdown in Cornwall's economy. I doubt whether we shall see a recovery within the next decade.</p>

<p>I warmly welcome the opportunity to debate the affairs of the SouthWest. Rightly or wrongly, we feel that, in the national context, we are often overlooked and forgotten. Unconsciously, that was borne out by the note that I received from the Library. I applied to the Library for some additional information for the debate. The Library wrote:
<q>There have been a good many articles about the impact of the recession on other regions, particularly the West Midlands &#x2026; but practically nothing in the national papers on the South-West.</q>
Other hon. Members have already intimated that the South-West has its own serious problems. I have been very worried by the increase in unemployment that has taken place even in areas such as Plymouth, where unemployment has risen to 12&#x00B7;6 per cent.<br/>
The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) indicated that in Cornwall there are even worse problems of unemployment. However, it is a mistake to assume that all is gloom and doom, or that all is the Government's fault. Clearly, the world recession must affect every part of the United Kingdom. No one can escape entirely from that. I welcome the fact that, early in their career, the Government gave the city of Plymouth the development status that had been asked for throughout the period of the Labour Government but which had not been granted. That is an earnest of the Government's good will towards that part of the world.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Minister rightly drew attention to the number of new firms and new jobs that are being attracted into the South-West generally. He mentioned some, including Becton Dickinson, by name. That firm is now building on a site in my constituency. Recently I had a discussion with the managing director, and I particularly asked him why that international firm had chosen the West Country, and Plymouth in particular. The answer that he gave was instructive. He said that the choice had largely been made because there was an excellent work force, with a reputation for good industrial relations, good humour and skill, and because there were good communications&#x2014;particularly with the


Continent&#x2014;through the operation of Brittany Ferries. That is important for the attraction of new industries, and I am pleased to be able to trumpet that tonight.<br/>
It is important that industrialists who might consider coming to the West Country should know that we have an excellent work force and good communications. Of course, those communications could be improved. I hope that nothing will be allowed to stand in the way of the development of the A38 bypass round Plymouth, which links up with Cornwall and the development of the North Devon link road. That is vital for the development of North Devon. No doubt my hon. Friend will wish to expatiate on that at greater length. Those are two incomparable assets and they offer enormous hope for the future.<br/>
There has been a renewal in the old industry of mining. I notice that the hon. Member for Truro did not make that point. More than &#x00A3;9 million is being spent on the Wheal Jane and Mount Wellington mines. If that is wrong, no doubt the hon. Member for Truro will tell me.</p>

<p>I am familiar with the activities of the Wheal Jane. If I had not blackmailed the Labour Government into running the pumps for about 12 months, the mine would have been flooded and dead years ago.</p>

<p>That does not invalidate my point. Those mines now have a new lease of life, and I am delighted. There is a scheme&#x2014;which I hope will be successful&#x2014;to dredge for tin off North Cornwall. If that scheme comes to fruition it will prove vital to an area that has been hard hit by the recession. I am astonished that no one has mentioned the prospect of offshore oil exploration. Oil finds would provide a magnificent opportunity for Falmouth and Plymouth to act as bases for such a major new industry. That would give an enormous boost and incentive to the South-West.<br/>
I am in no position to say whether such exploration will be successful. However, those to whom I have spoken&#x2014;who know more about the matter than I&#x2014;are sure that it is not a question of if, but of when, it will come about. I know that the city of Plymouth and its commercial organisations are anxious to give every assistance. Even now they are trying to work out schemes so that when the oil comes they will be able to offer every facility. They have visited Scotland to see how things work there and how to avoid the pitfalls.<br/>
I hope that the Government will bear in mind that, whatever the new industries may bring, the South-West still relies heavily on a number of small firms&#x2014;some very small indeed, with fewer than 10 employees. Any assistance that the Government can give, either directly or indirectly, to those small firms will do more to assist the South-West than anything else. I hope that there is a real prospect of future prosperity for the South-West.</p>

<p>We are debating the interests and problems of a large region. There was a time when I spent my holidays in North Devon in Noss Mayo and Newton Ferrers. I thought that I was getting away from the position in Slough. I was seeking a change. I have listened to the speeches that have been made, and it may be that the problems confronting my area are very different from some of the problems confronting the areas to which I have referred.<br/>
One thing that many Conservative Members and some Labour Members have in common is that traditionally

many of their constituents have come to Slough to find work. Until comparatively recently Slough, with its huge trading estate, was a magnet for labour from many parts of England, Wales and, indeed, the world. That is not so today.<br/>
When the Prime Minister made the extraordinary statement that people should move to where there was work, she was probably thinking of the traditional pattern of people seeking work in Slough. But its present unemployment rate, including Windsor and Maidenhead&#x2014;which are served largely by the huge trading estate in Slough&#x2014;is now more than 6 per cent. I accept that that is only half of what it is in Plymouth, but it is the highest that it has ever been in the history of the area. It is especially important that that point should be made because, historically, whatever recessions hit Britain in the 1930s, before and since, Slough's multiplicity of industries, its bouyancy and its willingness to experiment in many different industries have always enabled it to escape the effects of a recession. That is not so today.<br/>
The Minister spoke about gloom and said that we wanted only to be gloomy. Nobody wants to be gloomy. The fact is that things are gloomy. I tried to interrupt the Minister, but he would not give way to me. He spoke about jobs being created in certain areas, but the question to which he should address himself is whether unemployment is still rising. In my area it is rising more rapidly than ever before. That is the crucial issue. It is no answer to say that in one area some jobs are being created and that in another area other jobs are being created.<br/>
There is another question that I put to the hon. Gentleman. I asked the same question during Prime Minister's questions a few weeks ago but received no reply. Is the unemployment that we are now experiencing accidental or intentional? There must be an answer to that somewhere. Is it accidental? Is it unfortunate? Did not the Government intend it? Is it intentional to enable the Government to reduce inflation?<br/>
I know of no confident long-term projections that the rate of inflation will continue to fall. However, there are many long-term predictions that unemployment will increase. How can it be said that there is no reason to be gloomy and that we can all be buoyant because things are improving and inflation has begun to decrease? It is not fair to put that argument to those who are now experiencing the loss of their jobs.</p>

<p>Unemployment under the Labour Government was wrong and indefensible. I do not defend it. The hon. Gentleman should not try to be clever. Unemployment under any Government is either accidental or intentional. One of the reasons why the Labour Government were unable to tackle rising unemployment was that, unfortunately, they did not have sufficient support in the House for the measures that they wanted to carry through. They were a minority Government. Is unemployment accidental or is it intentional? An answer must be given to the question tonight.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman would have given way once too often if he had given way to me, I can assure him of that.<br/>
Slough has always been a magnet for labour. Workers have travelled to Slough from Wales, Scotland, Ireland, the Indian sub-continent and the West Indies. One of the contributory factors to the good race relations that we have always enjoyed in Slough has been the existence of full employment. Slough has a good solid base and experience of working and living with all sorts of different groups. That will stand it in good stead.<br/>
It is my fear that one of the consequences of growing unemployment in many of our large cities will be a deterioration in race relations. The Government are not really taking that on board, any more than they are taking on board the deleterious effect that it is having on many young people in our society who find themselves with no prospects of getting a job and the prospect of a nuclear war facing them.<br/>
The Government came to power on two important propositions. We all saw the posters that stated that Labour was not working. Presumably the implication was that Conservatives would get people back to work. Secondly, they promised that they would do something for small businesses. There are many small businesses and small firms in my area. Indeed, it has been characterised by those undertakings. What has happened to them? I have a list of small businesses that have closed down. They have given a variety of reasons that led them to close. Interest rates are high on the list.<br/>
We have a higher degree of short-time working than at any other time in our history. Since November 1979, 31 firms have gone on to short-time working. In the same period, in 80 firms there have been redundancies of from 12 to 240 people. This is in prosperous Slough, an area people have looked to for developnent and opportunities.</p>

<p>Does my hon. Friend recognise that the problems which she is pointing to as applying to small businesses in Slough apply generally throughout the country? Certainly they apply in Harlow. Is it not a fact that this Government, far from masquerading, as they have managed to do for a period, as the Government who defend small businesses, ought to be recognised by small businesses generally in the country as being absolutely a disaster for them? Ought not this to be recognised to be the case throughout the country as well as in our areas?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend has made the point that I was coming to&#x2014;that this characterises almost every area of the country.<br/>
In the last two or three weeks, starting with the coal dispute and going on to the announcement of the increase in gas prices, there have been letters in my postbag from small businesses in my constituency pointing out how the increase in gas prices will affect them adversely and saying that the Government had said that they would help them. I have had letters from others saying that, when they wished to switch to coal in the interests of economy and also to help stimulate the coal industry, they were refused assistance that had previously been available to those who wished to make the switch. So the argument that small firms would be helped was nonsense from beginning to end.<br/>
I was amazed to hear the Minister say that one of the reasons why we have had a shortage of skilled labour was that people were coming out of school with poor educational qualifications, which meant that there was a lack of skilled people available for jobs. That is amazing to me. Here we have a Government who are doing everything in their power to undermine the education system at almost every level and who are denying young people opportunities to train in skills that would be appropriate to the environment in which they will find themselves, yet we are told that the shortage of skilled labour is due to the fact that skilled people are not coming out of schools ready to take on these occupations.<br/>
Firms in my constituency say, quite rightly, that in Slough there has always been a shortage of skilled labour because of the particular types of skills that we have been looking for. That is true. But what the firms are telling me now, and what is obvious to anybody who cares to look, is that many of the firms who form the basis of the training and apprenticeship opportunities for the skills we need are closing. Those which have not closed are not taking on the young people because of financial restrictions and because they are afraid that they will not exist to continue the training.<br/>
Therefore, it is nonsense to say, as is true, that we have a shortage of skilled labour in certain industries and, at the same time, undermine the firms and the education system that will provide the training that we so desperately need. This is what I find so extraordinary in the Government's reasoning.<br/>
Earlier this week I talked to the secretary of the industrial engineers in my area, who said that, if there was a change in the fortunes of the country and we got a Labour Government, my area would be unable to meet the demand for the skills that would be necessary to take advantage of the upturn in the economy, because the process of learning skills was being undermined and destroyed. That has been said by almost every area of management concerned with training. The Minister should be considering this aspect very closely.<br/>
The Minister said that we were all too despondent, that we should be looking buoyantly towards the future. But even if there is an upturn in the economy in the next two or three years, skilled labour will not be forthcoming in industries that have traditionally demanded it, and they will have to look elsewhere for it. That is why many of us are depressed and feeling far from buoyant about the future of the areas we represent.<br/>
It is not sufficient for the Minister to say that certain jobs are being created when unemployment is rising to an unprecedentedly high level in my area and in others which in the past have managed to escape the full blast of economic recession. Unemployment will go on rising, as every economist predicts, because it is out of hand.<br/>
During the election campaign the Tories said that Labour was not working and spoke of helping small businesses. They raised hope in the minds of many owners of small businesses in my constituency and throughout the country. Those people have been sorely disappointed, they have been pulled down, and in their wake the opportunities for thousands of people have been destroyed.</p>

<p>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words in the debate, but I shall not follow the arguments adduced by the hon. Member for


Eton and Slough (Miss Lestor). I do not shy away from them, but I want to concentrate on the problems of the South-West, and particularly those in my constituency.<br/>
I wish to report to the Minister a serious problem that has arisen in North Devon, which my hon. Friend the Member for Devon, North (Mr. Speller) and I represent. The development area status that we had was taken away. We were told that our employment position did not warrant development area status. We warned the Minister concerned at the time that this was an unwise decision. Now our fears have come true and the problems in North Devon are growing fast, just as they are in other parts of the country. The loss of development area status has increased our problems. Firms have reduced their staff, some have gone out of business, unemployment is rising fast and we need the development area status to be reinstated.<br/>
Although we work hard and attract new firms into the area&#x2014;we have been successful, it is not all gloom&#x2014;the problem is that they are being attracted back into Plymouth and other areas with development area status. It is difficult to convince small companies that they should start up their factories in North Devon.<br/>
This is a growing problem, and I should be grateful if the Minister would reconsider the position of Bideford, Barnstaple, Torrington, and Okehampton, all of which have lost development area status. Our case is sound. If development area status is taken away because the level of unemployment is low, when the level of unemployment rises above the cut-off point development area status should be given back.<br/>
The problems of retired people in the South-West, particularly in the rural areas, are becoming increasingly distressing. Naturally, we welcome retired people into our small villages, but they face extremely high costs, especially in rural transport. I recognise that the Government have made kinds of efforts to help to ease the problem, but there are still extreme difficulties!. Many concessionary fares are disappearing. The motor car is becoming extremely expensive. I believe that attention must be given to these matters particularly as the economy improves. I am not arguing that it is possible to do much at present. When the economy improves, we should turn our attention seriously to these matters.<br/>
One worry for retired people was the possibility of the disappearance of sub post offices. It is probably true that we have won that battle, or at least gone a long way towards winning it. The problem could be very serious. Coupled with the tremendous loss of village shops up and down the land, it becomes difficult for elderly and retired people to obtain the services that they want and the provisions and goods that they need. I understand the Government's attitude. I can see that they want to reduce public expenditure, and the number of civil servants, by switching to modern methods, but I must say that those of us who live in the rural areas are concerned about any further movement in this area. We must hang on to our sub post offices. They give immense help and benefit to those living in the area.<br/>
I should also mention the cost of fuel in rural areas. I say, frankly, that I do not agree with my Government and party on energy policy. The criticisms levelled at this policy are justified. It is extremely difficult to explain the policy to people. I get bogged down myself if I try to do so. I realise that I do not possess all that much intelligence, but it is extremely difficult to explain the policy to a retired

person living in a small village in the South-West. These people do not have the opportunities of those in the towns to obtain alternative supplies of energy. I hope that the Government will look carefully at the problem. I hope that they will readjust their energy policy. It is not right at the moment.<br/>
Another factor is the cost of water. It is true that the Government have taken action recently to ease the problem. All Governments make mistakes, but I believe that we made a real mistake on the issue of democratic representation on water authorities. If the representation was more democratic, some of the changes that are necessary could be introduced, and insisted upon, to the benefit of those living in rural areas. Water is an extremely expensive item, as I believe it is also in the towns.<br/>
I should also like to refer to the cost of living. The Government have to be congratulated. To reduce the cost of living has been one of their main planks. It has become a fact of life. I have every faith that this progress will continue. I must say, however, that it is a fallacy to believe that because one lives in a village or the countryside the cost of living is much cheaper than in the towns. That is not so. For the retired and the elderly, this is a real burden.<br/>
I should like to describe to the Minister the difficult position that they face. Those who are retired and come to live in a small village bring with them a certain amount of capital and cash and their pension. As they get older, these funds start to dry up. The cost of living rises, but their income does not increase very much. They have to sell their car. This means that they cannot get into the towns to take advantage of cheaper prices or cheaper food in some of the big supermarkets. That is something we need to watch carefully, because a growing number of people feel frustrated and angry at what is happening. I fully realise that the Government cannot do much about it, but I ask them not to add to the burden in any way. It is not on.<br/>
I know that many other hon. Members wish to speak about agriculture, transport and many other subjects. But I want to bring two matters to the attention of the Minister. First, the Government should look again at the matter of development area status. Secondly, they should watch carefully what is happening in the rural areas, especially our small villages, and try to deal with the problems and difficulties that are facing retired people because of the cost of living.</p>

<p>I express my appreciation to the Shadow Cabinet and to my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench for giving the House the opportunity to discuss the problems of the South and the South-West. It shows that the Labour Party is concerned about the whole of the country and not just one part of it. The problems which beset the northern part of the country through Government policies of monetarism, high interest rates and the high value of the pound abroad affect the South just as much. Firms are going out of business and many are being put out of work. When I was first elected to my constituency in 1970 we had an unemployment rate of 2 per cent. At the last count, it was 9&#x00B7;7 per cent.&#x2014;the highest in Swindon's history. That is a direct result of the policies pursued by the Government.<br/>
The Minister mentioned my constituency and pointed to a number of firms that would be moving there. I am glad to say that they are, but that is no thanks to him. Some of


the moves are due to the efforts of the Labour Government, but most are due to the efforts of a very progressive local council, which has done its job without Government assistance.<br/>
However, in 1980 we lost 3,600 other jobs. The jobs we are gaining will in no way make up for the jobs that we have lost. The depressing march of redundancies goes on from day to day. Day by day we hear of new redundancies here and there. Today, we heard of sackings by Emerson Electric, a modern forward-looking firm manufacturing products of the present and the future. The resistors division of Plessey Electronics has laid off 92. Another branch of the firm is laying of 72. That is all in a week, and the depressing march goes on. Yorkshire Imperial plastics, a firm which provides water pipes, is closing down in Swindon because the Government have slashed the housing programme and cut the amount of money available to water authorities. That firm is going out of business in Swindon as a direct result of Government policy.<br/>
The number of vacancies, too, is depressingly low. At the last count there were only 12 vacancies notified for people under the age of 19 years. The young people in my constituency, who are being helped through the youth opportunities programme, do not think that that is good enough. They want to get out and do a good job of work. They want to have apprenticeships. They want to be trained in a proper manner and to feel that they are doing a worthwhile job, but as long as the Government pursue their present policy there is little hope of their being able to do that.<br/>
I do not suggest for one moment that Swindon is a depressed area; nevertheless, it is suffering very badly under this Government. It is not only industrial firms that are making things difficult; it is the Tory-controlled county council, which seems to cut services with great alacrity, sacking teachers here, caretakers there, and dinner ladies somewhere else. The council does it with alacrity. Indeed, the local Tories on the borough council have been advocating the sacking of 200 people, just like that, without any investigation. The Government are joined in the local sense by their friends who want to make a bad situation worse by sacking more people in the public sector.<br/>
This policy also affects the surrounding areas of Swindon. Swindon is a little red spot in a great ocean of blue. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Hon. Members can say "Yah, yah", but there are a lot more red spots appearing now. After the elections it will be seen that there are a lot more people who are sick and tired of the Government for whom they themselves voted.<br/>
I am glad to say that people are now joining the Labour Party in large numbers in those areas. They want to do everything they possibly can to help get the Tories out. But it is not only the Labour Party, my hon. Friends and the Leader of the Opposition, who are talking about the Government and criticising them. Industrialists are also criticising the Government. One of them&#x2014;a Mr. Turley&#x2014;made a speech in my constituency. The report, which I shall quote to the House, shows exactly what industrialists feel about the Government. The newspaper report states:
<q>The boss of two Swindon engineering firms has hammered the Tory Government's economic policy&#x2014;as one of his factories

has been forced on to a three-day week. Instead of sacking 60 workers at the Auto Precision factory in Blunsdon, John Turley has put 156 on short time &#x2026; 'We are just slipping into a black hole, and I can't see any end to it. It is the worst situation I have ever come across', said Mr. Turley, who is chairman of the Blunsdon factory and Kembrey Engineering &#x2026; 'I am so depressed as I really can't see any answer. It is only going to get worse. Engineering is on the slide. The only growth industries are law and order, the armed forces, banks, and the labour exchanges.'</q>
That is not from a Labour politician; it is not from the hon. Member for Swindon; it is not from my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South-East (Mr. Benn). It is from an industrialist who was good enough to take over some firms in my constituency and save 400 or 500 jobs. So the criticism of the Government and the policies that they have pursued for far too long is coming from all quarters.<br/>
Fortunately, Swindon has been a forward-looking authority. It has planned its housing and its population as a whole. As a result, we are very fortunate that the position is not worse than it is, since the British Rail workshops were run down from about 13,000 jobs to the present number of about 3,500. Swindon has planned its future, but the Government's policy is making that continued planning very difficult indeed. The Government's housing investment programme cuts, for example, are hindering the policy of job expansion.<br/>
One of the policies of Swindon is to house key personnel and to provide housing for firms coming into the area. Its ability to do that has been badly hit by the restriction in the housing investment programme. I hope that the Government will give further consideration to the cuts that they have imposed, particularly on housing, because they are affecting employment.<br/>
Swindon is still a railway town. It still has all the facilities for rebuilding and refurbishing rolling stock and locomotives. If the Government really want to tackle unemployment, in Swindon and elsewhere, they should do something to refurbish and rebuild railways and the other public services that are in decline. There is no doubt that our railways are an utter disgrace. Many of the carriages still in use are 30 and 40 years old. They need modernising and renewing. We have the skills and the resources to do that, if only the Government would use those skills and resources.<br/>
We have 2&#x00BD; million people unemployed. It would be far better if those people were used to refurbish our public services, which are in a state of squalor and decline that has never been seen before in this country. I therefore urge the Government to use the money that they are now spending in large amounts on keeping unemployed people on the dole for the purposes that I have mentioned. If they do that they will reduce unemployment, and they might even earn a little gratitude.</p>

<p>If one is to attract new enterprises to an area of unemployment, and if local authorities and, indeed, Members of Parliament are to be as effective as they can, it is absolutely essential that the Department of Employment should be able to provide accurate and relevant statistics.<br/>
Although we live in a computer age, it is astonishing to find that the Department of Employment is still in a quill pen age. I should like to give some specific examples. Crediton, in my constituency, is nearly eight miles from


Exeter. It is impossible to get from the Department of Employment the unemployment figures for Crediton, because they are lumped in with Exeter. Ten years ago, before the labour exchange at Cullompton closed, there were separate unemployment figures for Cullompton and Tiverton. Now all that one can find out from the Department of Employment is that there are 1,091 people unemployed in an area covering both, but that is not the information that is needed if a firm is to locate itself accurately.<br/>
At the south end of my constituency, Teignmouth and Dawlish together have 1,038 unemployed people. But the Department of Employment cannot tell me what percentage that is of the normally employed population. It can only give a percentage figure for the whole of Torbay, spanning three different constituencies.<br/>
It is grossly past time that the expensive and enormous Department of Employment pulled up its socks and produced accurate figures of local unemployment so that any mobile industry or enterprise that might be attracted can know the precise situation&#x2014;where sites are available, but where the labour that they require may not be available.<br/>
Today we have been discussing employment primarily in terms of industry and, to a lesser extent, the service industries. Let us remember that between 1976 and 1980 net farm incomes decreased by 21 per cent., assuming a constant value of the pound which does not exist. Interest payments went up by 230 per cent. and borrowing by 186 per cent. That is not only why direct employment of farm workers has shrunk and continues to shrink but why we have avoidable unemployment in the Midlands in the traditional engineering supply industries which used to depend for a large part of their sales on an agriculture industry which is now squeezed desperately.<br/>
We heard the Opposition spokesman on agriculture on Tuesday pressing the Government to revalue the green pound so that more and more agriculture enterprises will make a loss without any net income. It is incomprehensible why the Opposition do not realise that they are condemning not only the rural areas but industrial areas to poverty as well.</p>

<p>I shall not give way because I am trying to confine my remarks to five minutes so that other Members may speak.<br/>
I conclude with the plea that my hon. Friend the Member for Honiton (Mr. Emery) made, namely, that Government services should be situated in the centre of the area that they are supposed to serve, not in one extreme corner. Bristol is nearer to Dover than it is to Penzance. That is sometimes overlooked. If the so-called regional headquarters of the various Government Departments were located in the Exeter-Plymouth-Torbay area, they would be more accessible and therefore much more efficient. In addition, in an area where there is tremendous seasonal unemployment as well as unemployment in the summer, that would provide an outlet for employment, particularly for women, which is desperately needed and which will be needed in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>This is not the time to savage the Government's overall economic

policies, although the effect of them in the West Country has been more devastating than at any time in my life. We must urge the Government to take measures that will help us in the far South-West.<br/>
I take up what the right hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann) said, namely, that there is a vital and urgent need for public investment in certain key areas. The first is the Severn barrage. That should be brought forward at the earliest possible moment. Some further planning has to be done, but an early decision is needed. It would help in the far South-West because English China Clay would be a major supplier of some of the essential elements of the construction work.<br/>
The construction industry is one of the worst hit. In Plymouth the situation is bad. The Government could make selective investment decisions. For example, the construction at Deriford hospital has ceased simply because the regional health authority does not have sufficient money to fund its completion. That could and should be brought forward. It would ease the situation in the construction industry, and it is an investment that it would pay us to make.<br/>
We need better roads, particularly in Cornwall. There is a strong case for increasing the road building programme and continuing the extension of the motorway through Plymouth. I hope that that will continue, because it will provide jobs in the construction industry and generally in Plymouth. I refer to the plan to link the existing road with the Tamar bridge.<br/>
Something must also be done about the extractive industry. It is an indigenous industry and needs extra aid. The Minister said that it was not a mobile industry. That attitude must be revised. There is abundant evidence that, with a little more help, the tin mining industry, which is marginally economic, could be tipped towards being economic in Cornwall. There is also the possibility of mining at Hemerdon. That is an interesting prospect which could be tipped towards being worth while. There is a strategic need for the extractive industries of this country to be safeguarded at the first opportunity.<br/>
The Royal Navy is vital to Plymouth. If there are to be cuts in the Ministry of Defence, there must be certain safeguards, and they must have a regional emphasis. We have lost 1,000 jobs at the Naval base in Plymouth. Those jobs should not be lost. The Navy must consider Bath. I know that unemployment may be a problem there, but it is by no means as bad as that in Plymouth. I realise that there are also problems in Portsmouth and Chatham. The effects of the rundown of jobs at the Naval base in Plymouth are extremely serious.<br/>
The Minister knows that we face a serious problem with the Rank-Toshiba redundancies that are about to be made. It looks as if Toshiba will stay but with a much reduced capacity. There is a large partly empty plant at Rank, which will need to be filled. We shall expect every help in trying to persuade Toshiba to put a semi-conductor factory in the United Kingdom if it decides to build one in Europe. We must put forward a convincing case for the South-West, particularly Plymouth. I know that there are serious problems in Cornwall, particularly in Redruth. I hope that something can be done about the employment problems in Helston, which will certainly be affected by the Rank-Toshiba closure.<br/>
I have given some practical suggestions which the Goverment can carry out without changing their other policies. Major areas must be covered. We cannot afford


to have another year in which Devonport dockyard is preferentially cut back, as opposed to Chatham and Portsmouth. There were higher percentage reductions in employment in Devonport and in the naval base. That cannot be right with any regional policy.<br/>
The problems in the South-West are devastating and are getting worse. If we do not take action now the situation will be far worse next winter. Action that is taken in the next few months might help to shield us from worse consequences next winter. There is not much time. I beg the Government to look at investment programmes that will have merit in five or 10 years' time. Sewerage programmes, sensible public works building programmes and the injection of a little money into local authorities, such as Plymouth, for their house building programmes should be considered. Plymouth has a homeless problem and bad housing. There should be an extra financial allocation for public housing in Plymouth, which would help the construction industry.<br/>
Those are positive suggestions, and I hope that when the Minister replies to the debate he will say that they will be considered seriously.</p>

<p>I hope that the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen) will forgive me for not taking up his comments, although I am most grateful for the concern which he continually and genuinely shows for the problems which are related to his constituency and to mine.<br/>
I shall first deal with the problems of incoming international firms wishing to come to Cornwall and trying to create jobs. When they come into Cornwall, they unlock a veritable Pandora's box with a proliferation of advisory bodies and organisations, each scuttling hither and thither and falling over each other in an attempt genuinely to help.<br/>
There should be one advisory body which is able to answer five main questions which any incoming industrialist wishes to be answered: "Can you provide me with a site and, if so, at what cost? Does your area have the type of people I want to employ and can you train them for me? Are all the main services available, which I want, and can you guarantee that I will not have to face a hassle with energy or environmental services, and how soon and at what price can you connect me to those services? Can I get the support services which I need from subcontractors and suppliers? How in terms of communications and distribution does your area measure up to my needs to move raw materials, people and finished products?"<br/>
Those are five simple and basic questions that are asked over and over again. However, instead of there being a simple answer the responsibility spills over to the district council, the county council, the English Industrial Estates Corporation, industrial estate officers, district valuers, public utilities, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Employment, the Manpower Services Commission, gas, electricity, water and telecommunications authorities and local chambers of commerce. If we want to see industry generated in special development areas, why on earth cannot we have a simple, well advised, well equipped and representative task force able to deal with the questions of incoming industrialists?<br/>
The second part of my speech concerns two problems particularly associated with the recession that has hit Cornwall. First, too little thought and encoragement are coming from the Government and industry over the continuation and creation of industrial apprenticeships. The folly of that neglect will seriously hit us in the mid-1980s, when we shall find ourselves deprived of the skilled nucleus that we need and, ultimately, of middle-line management.<br/>
Secondly, I fear the social consequences of our failure to consider the long-term effect of redundancy on men in their late forties and early fifties. One town in my constituency has an unemployment rate of 23 per cent. I am increasingly meeting unemployed men in that age group, and I find them resigned to living off their redundancy payments but eagerly reading every economic forecast in the belief that as things get better they will be re-engaged. We must be honest with those men, with ourselves, with industry and with the country. The majority of those men will never see the inside of a work place again. If they do, it will be an immediate step back into over-manning and will set off another crazy cycle of lack of competitiveness.<br/>
However distasteful and politically unacceptable in the short term, we must spell out the fact that for many men there is no way back, but for goodness sake let us not be negative. Let us try to find ways to occupy their energy and leisure time in a dignified and useful manner. What I am about to say may be considered pure heresy by some of my hon. Friends, but let us educate ourselves and the public to realise once and for all that the man who, by becoming redundant, has helped to save a firm and the jobs of his colleagues for the future is not an idle scrounger and is perhaps contributing a great deal more to the future prosperity of the nation than the man who insists on turning up day after day for the job that makes his firm uncompetitive.</p>

<p>My speech is the second Liberal contribution, and I shall keep my remarks short. However, I make no excuse for speaking. My constituency has the highest rate of unemployment in the South of England, and mine is one of the few contributions from that area. Unemployment in my constituency stands at 10&#x00BD; per cent., and is increasing.<br/>
The Minister expected speeches of gloom from the Opposition Benches, but my speech will not be all gloom, although we need a bit of help. I have tried to get assisted area status. The application has been turned down, and I do not intend to press the matter unless the situation gets very much worse. We have modern industry in the Isle of Wight, but we have many problems. Many hon. Members may not know that the cost of our petrol is at least 10p a gallon higher than the national average. We have 50 private stations and no company-owned ones. That is an additional burden that everyone living on the Isle of Wight has to bear.<br/>
Secondly, we do not get the advantage of certain heavy duty oils. I am thinking particularly of the horticulture


industry. We have a modern horticulture industry, with a great deal of glass. It is a tragedy that horticulturists are virtually bankrupt. One of the largest companies, which used to employ over 60 people, has already finished business. On Monday night I met some of the growers. I do not know how they have survived thus far. One problem is that the industry cannot get gas or some of the cheaper types of heavy duty oil. First, the companies will not supply the oil and, secondly, it would have to come to the island on a boat, and there is argument about whether it is safe to bring it across. The industry is up against that, in addition to the fact that in Western Europe it is competing with the Dutch, the Germans and the rest, all of whom are subsidised.<br/>
I plead, as I have tried to do time and again with the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, that at least some pressure should be brought to bear by the Department of Industry to see whether help can be given towards energy costs in offshore islands such as mine. Some tax relief on heavy duty oil in the Budget would be helpful.<br/>
Secondly, the roads on the Isle of Wight are absolutely deplorable. We need a 10-year programme. Other hon. Members have pleaded for the infrastructure. Certainly, it would be an enormous boost if we could have a promise that the money available through the transportation grant, or whatever grant now applies, will be considered and maintained.<br/>
Thirdly, in the tourist industry, there has not, I think been a new hotel built on the Isle of Wight since the war, although there has been some modernisation. Frankly, we are losing out. There is a great need for investment. When I look at other parts of the country that happen to be in assisted areas [am envious of the money that they have received through EEC grants. I believe that Rhyl received a sizeable sum and that Cardiff was given more than &#x00A3;1 million towards its opera house. Those are the sort of grants that we, too, could desperately do with at this time.<br/>
Finally&#x2014;this has not been mentioned so far, although I am sure that other hon. Members encounter similar cases&#x2014;one of my greatest problems, arise from small firms coming to me because they are in trouble with VAT or PAYE I am often on my knees pleading with VAT officers and collectors of taxes to be reasonable, as, on the whole, they are. Nevertheless, I am sure that the Government could do something about this. It is tragic to see firms going further and further down because they have got themselves into trouble with the Inland Revenue. Of course they have to pay their debts, but there must be some way in which those debts could be laid over for a while without penal interest rates being charged. Otherwise, we simply put the firms into bankruptcy and wind them up. The chaps are then on the dole and cost the Government just as much money in other ways, when they could be in business.<br/>
We have some very modern industries on the island. I am constantly surprised at how well they are doing. We have the light aircraft industry. We have probably the best boat designer in Britain, although, unfortunately, the Navy does not want to build his boats and therefore he has to go abroad. We have Plessey, BHC and a number of companies of that kind, all doing very well.<br/>
Nevertheless, we still have a 10&#x00BD; per cent. unemployment rate, and the figure is rising. The hardest

letter that I have to answer is that in which a youngster thanks me for sending him a birthday card but asks when I am going to do something about getting him a job.<br/>
Help can be obtained from some multiple companies and from the banks through enterprise agencies. I am doing my best with that. But we need a little more help from the Government. That is my plea tonight.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1804601" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1981-02-26a.1060.0" hansard_membership_id="3057" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32864" speakername="Mr. Chris Patten" colnum="1060" time="21:33:00">
<p>I should like to put a couple of points to Ministers which I believe would not only help industrialists and firms in my constituency to survive the recession but would help to stimulate recovery in due course.<br/>
The first concerns the temporary short-time working compensation scheme. A number of firms in Bath and in the surrounding area have used the scheme as a breathing space. It has given them a valuable chance to retain during the recession skilled labour which they hope then to use in the upturn. One thing that bothers me a little is when the upturn will come. Many firms in my constituency joined the scheme last autumn. Several hundred jobs are involved. They come out of the scheme next summer. I am not sure that we shall have seen much sign of even an incipient recovery by that time.<br/>
I therefore ask my right hon. and hon. Friends&#x2014;and I hope that an answer can be given on this today&#x2014;although I know that the scheme is expensive&#x2014;to consider the possibility of extending it for three or six months next summer, even if it is at a lower level of subsidy. That is a very important factor in retaining skilled jobs until the level of economic activity in this country begins to rise once again.<br/>
The second point concerns that iniquitous tax on jobs and exploits&#x2014;the national insurance surcharge on employers. I have already used up most of my adjectives in talking about that tax in the past. I remind my hon. Friend that the CBI, in its pre-Budget memorandum to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pointed out that it would be almost impossible to imagine how one could devise a more damaging tax on business. I believe that that is correct. It is absurd that, on the one hand, we are subsidising labour costs and, on the other, increasing them through the national insurance surcharge.<br/>
We are told that nothing can be done about the matter because it would be too expensive. In other words, the argument is that, because the burden on the shoulders of industry is so great, nothing can be done to relieve industry of it. That is a ridiculous proposition, particularly from a Conservative Government. I realise that a solution would be expensive. Therefore, if we cannot abolish the tax completely, we should look at ways of cutting it selectively, for example, in order to help those areas or industries that have been hardest hit by the recession.<br/>
It is perfectly possible to do that administratively. For example, charities are at present exempt from the tax. I therefore hope that the Government will look positively at ways of reducing the tax, or removing it entirely, in respect of manufacturing industry at the least.<br/>
In the remaining few minutes available to me, I should like to touch on a point made by the right hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Dr. Owen). When one looks at documents such as the Manser report which was produced for the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors last


year, it is obvious that throughout the 1970s there has been a decline in capital investment in the public sector and an increase in current spending in the public sector.<br/>
Four years ago, the Estimates Committee said that that was a damaging trend which should be reversed. I understand the constraints on the Chancellor this year, even though I do not entirely share his views about the PSBR and how it should be assessed. Nevertheless, he has real difficulties. Even so, I hope that we can find some way of using capital programmes in the coming year in order to give a modest boost to the British private sector. I emphasise that, because there are one or two outrageous examples of public procurement policy in my constituency where local firms have found themselves elbowed aside by foreign competition in going for public sector contracts for no very good or discernible reason. By nudging and shoving, it may be possible to deal with that sort of problem.<br/>
I am not suggesting that the Government should publish guidelines or issue instructions, which are the sort of actions that would annoy foreign competitors.<br/>
Ministers are there to do that sort of thing in a more discreet way. That is more important than understanding the case for monetary-based control. That may be a rather old-fashioned view of politics, but it is a more realistic one, particularly in the present climate.</p>

<speech hansard_id="1804603" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1981-02-26a.1061.0" hansard_membership_id="9358" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32697" speakername="Mr. R. C. Mitchell" colnum="1061" time="21:37:00">
<p>This is a unique occasion. It is the first time since the war that the House of Commons has had a debate on unemployment in the South and South-East. We have had debates on the South-West, but never before on the South and South-East. The reason is obvious. It is only in the last year that we have really needed to have such a debate.<br/>
The Prime Minister often goes around saying that unemployment doubled under the Labour Administration, but in many parts of the South and South-East unemployment has doubled in the 18 months that this Government have been in office. We now have the worst unemployment rate in many parts of the South and South-East since the 1930s.<br/>
One thing of importance that it has shown&#x2014;here I agree with the right hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. du Cann)&#x2014;is that unemployment is a national problem and not just a regional problem. It is ironic that the South, which voted Conservative in large numbers in the general election, is now being sacrificed on the altar of monetarism.<br/>
The Prime Minister tries to blame excessive wages. Has she heard of the factory in Weymouth, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Dorset, South (Viscount Cranborne)&#x2014;who is not present today&#x2014;where the workers on low earnings agreed to take a reduction of &#x00A3;10 a week, but still the factory closed? I had hoped that the Minister would tell us something new. However, he said nothing and took a long time to do so. I noticed a certain degree of scepticism on the faces of those of his hon. Friends who sit behind him when he read out a list of promises. It must have taken the Department months to dig them up.<br/>
As several of my hon. Friends have pointed out, the problem in the South is that the small business man has been hit. The South does not have the great concentration

of industry that is found in the North and in the Midlands. It relies far more on small businesses. Every day we read in newspapers, hear on the television or receive letters in our postbags, about bankruptcies and about firms in the South that have had to go into voluntary liquidation. They cannot cope with excessive interest rates, or with having to borrow money at interest rates of 20 per cent. plus. Before they can start to make a profit they have to bear that tremendous overhead, and they cannot cope with the other burdens that the Government have placed on them.<br/>
When I canvassed during the last general election I knocked on a certain door, and when the man answered my knock I told him who I was and he said "Oh no, I must vote Conservative". I asked him why, and he said "I am a small business man". The other day he came back to me and apologised for what he had said. He is now on the dole, along with thousands of other small business men.<br/>
Can we see any hope for the future? At every management seminar the question is asked "Can you see a light at the end of the tunnel?" At a management seminar in Southampton a leading industrialist said:
<q>No, I cannot see a light. I cannot even see a tunnel. All I can see is a bloody great hole.</q>
Many people in the South have a similar feeling of no hope.<br/>
In addition to the unemployment that is shown in the statistics, there is a mass of disguised unemployment. Many firms are working only part time. Industrialists say that when the upturn begins they will be able to increase production, in many cases by 25 per cent., without taking on any extra men. The position is becoming increasingly serious. That is why I beg the Government to take note of some of the remarks made by the right hon. Member for Taunton and by others, who have asked for selective public works programmes for the region.<br/>
It is criminal that there should be an urgent need for houses and that there should be people on waiting lists when building workers are unemployed. It is criminal that we should be short of hospital beds and hospitals at such a time. We should get on with the electrification of the Southampton to Portsmouth line. That would provide employment.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon) gave us some appalling unemployment figures. Like me, he will know of the tragic stories that lie behind those statistics. Unemployment affects not statistics but people. Unemployment affects the man of 54, the former manager of a small firm, who sees no hope of employment. He thinks that he will have to spend the next 10 years on the dole despite the fact that he has a lot to offer society. Unemployment concerns the man who leaves home at 8.30 am, wanders about the town all day and returns home at 5.30 pm because he does not want his neighbours to know that he is unemployed in case they think that he is a scrounger.<br/>
Even more, unemployment affects the youngsters of 15 or 16 who argue that it is not worth getting O-levels or CSEs because there is no hope of finding a job. If Parliament deserts the young people of this country, they will desert us. They will turn to various forms of extremism. For a person of my generation, who remembers the last war, it was frightening to see&#x2014;as I did recently&#x2014;a parade through London of young people who carried and wore swastikas. That frightened me.<br/>
Unemployment and lack of hope are contributory factors. I seriously believe that if unemployment continues to rise at its present rate the whole basis of parliamentary democracy in Britain will be threatened.<br/>
I propose to quote from a speech made in the House on 27 November by the right hon. Member for Sidcup (Mr. Heath), who knows the South of England very well. He said:
<q>I find that I am not entirely alone among those in the Conservative Party who worked for its victory who are worried about the present situation. One of our intentions after the 1930s was to ensure that the Conservative Party was never again considered to be the party of unemployment. I ask my hon. Friends to think seriously about that in our present circumstances."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report,</i> 27 November 1980; Vol. 994, c. 918]</q>
I assure the House that throughout the South and South-West the Conservative Party is once against known as the party of unemployment.<br/>
I hope that the Government will listen to what has been said from both sides of the House. I hope that they will change direction before it is too late. If that happens, the debate today will have been worth while.</p>

<p>If I were to answer the debate properly I would have to be the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Secretaries of State for Defence, the Environment, Industry, Employment, Transport, and for Foreign Affairs. I am not, and I have only 14 minutes available to me. I shall try to answer most of the points raised as best I can.<br/>
I grew up in the South of England and know the area well, although I now represent a constituency in the North. It is only fair to say that we Northerners&#x2014;I am a Northerner by adoption&#x2014;have rather greater problems than do the Southerners, although I accept that there are pockets in the South where unemployment levels are especially high. The constituencies of the hon. Member for Truro (Mr. Penhaligon), my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Mr. Mudd) and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence, as well as other Cornish constituencies, have employment levels as bad as those in the North. I appreciate that that is the case. But, overall, the problems in the South are not as great as the problems in the North, in Wales and in Scotland.<br/>
I do not think that the position is as gloomy as some hon. Members would have us believe. During the course of the last year, through the employment services division of the Manpower Services Commission, 121,000 people were placed in new jobs in the South-West. That is only about one-third of the total new vacancies filled during the course of the year, so we are talking about 360,000 engagements. The equivalent figures for the South-East are 575,000, and 1&#x00B7;5 million in all.<br/>
Vacancies come on to the market, and are filled. However, it should not be thought that I am in any way complacent about the position either in the South-West or in the South-East. So much so am I nor complacent&#x2014;nor is my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Employment&#x2014;that a considerable amount of resources have been devoted to helping those without a job, to those whose jobs are in jeopardy, through the temporary short-time working scheme. There are 11,329 in the South-West and 24,930 in the South-East currently benefiting from

that scheme. We are helping as much as we can. The job release scheme benefits almost 5,500 in the South-West, and 8,398 in the South-East. All that costs Government money&#x2014;taxpayers' money. We are doing what we can, in limited circumstances, to help overcome the difficulties.<br/>
I apologise for bashing on, but it is the only way to get through all the points that were raised. One of the themes that ran through the debate was the concern mentioned by several hon. Members about training and skilled shortages. The hon. Member for Eton and Slough (Miss Lestor), my hon. Friend the Member for Torbay (Sir F. Bennett), my hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne and the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Mitchell) were concerned about youth and the skill shortages that might take place as and when the economic upturn comes. It is an issue that very much concerns the Department of Employment. That is why we put it in the melting pot. I know that Labour Members are not especially happy about the approach that we are adopting, but we believe that we have to get things right for the 1980s and 1990s.<br/>
There is common ground that if young people and the middle-aged have to be retrained for new jobs they must have the right training. If those are not available, retraining will be no good for them and no good for Britain. There is common ground in that respect, although perhaps there is a difference of opinion between the two Front Benches about the way in which we should act.<br/>
Another theme running through the debate was the importance of small firms. I have personal knowledge of the area, especially of Wiltshire, Dorset, Devon, Cornwall and Somerset&#x2014;and I entirely agree with my hon. Friends who said that in future it will be small firms more than any other firms that will bring employment to the South-West.<br/>
I had a hunch that small firms were being born at a rather greater rate than Labour Members have been suggesting. I asked what inquiries were being made of the small firms service in the South-West region. Rather amazingly, the number of inquiries has increased by 40 per cent. over the past year. I am told that 40 per cent. of the inquiries concern start-ups. I accept that not all these inquiries come to fruition. However, there is the entrepreneurial activity in the South-West that I expected. Over some years that activity, provided that it is properly supported by a Government who want to promote activity and enterprise, should provide more jobs and more prosperity in the area.<br/>
In one respect the hon. Member for Islington, Central (Mr. Grant) was contradicted by the hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen The hon. Member for Islington, Central said that the South-East is now the largest manufacturing centre. We in the North-West think of ourselves as the big industry area.</p>

<p>Yes, I understand that. The hon. Gentleman talked about pockets of unemployment that are two or three times higher than the national average. I do not think that that is true, but we can split hairs about that later.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman referred to the Youth Aid report. He said that he was worried about the 440,000 places that the Government have guaranteed for the youth opportunities programme, and whether they could be filled or properly administered.

Friend the Secretary of State for Energy. I am sure that my right hon. Friend will consider it carefully. The hon. Gentleman asked whether the port area of Bristol could be an enterprise zone.

<p>It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman is at such variance with his Front Bench colleagues. I cannot say what view my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment will take. I am glad to have the hon. Gentleman's support in principle for enterprise zones.<br/>
In regard to the remarks of the hon. Member for Bristol, North-East about the decision to send Inmos to South Wales, has he talked to his right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition to find out whether he approves of the idea of bringing it back from South Wales to Bristol? I assure the hon. Member that I know Bristol. I grew up 30 miles from it and I accept everything that he says about the city. It is a remarkable city, with merchant venturers and so on. It has an unemployment level of 8&#x00B7;4 per cent., which is high, but as compared with other areas is not that high.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Member for Taunton (<i>Mr. du Cann</i>) made what was to me the most important point of the whole debate when he talked about patriotism. I agree with him entirely that if any area, town or city that is fiercely proud of itself goes out to sell itself and all the facilities in its area it is much more likely to attract business and industry.<br/>
I also noticed my right hon. Friend's recommendation that there should be no Front Bench opening speeches and only winding-up speeches. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Chief Whip has paid attention to that.<br/>
As the hon. Member for Truro knows, I visited Cornwall. It was the second regional visit that I made. I went to Merseyside first and them to Cornwall, because I was more than aware that the levels of unemployment were incredibly high and I wanted to see for myself.

<p>I went to have a look for myself just after I was appointed. It is reasonable to go and look for oneself. What I discovered were jobs that had not existed two or three years ago. I noticed that the hon. Member did not talk about the further jobs in J. I. Case or in Lee Cooper. To a certain extent he undermined the Comishmen. I saw them, as I met them, and they were

very proud of their county. They followed exactly the line that my right hon. Friend the Member for Taunton was putting. They were not sitting there being gloomy. I can assure the hon. Member that I am more than aware of the problem.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Falmouth and Camborne talked about an advisory body. As he developed his argument one saw more and more the point of what he was saying. I would have thought that in the initial stages this work could be co-ordinated by the county council, but that would be a matter for the county council rather than for my hon. Friend or myself.<br/>
I was interested to hear what my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Drake (Miss Fookes) said about the work force in part of Plymouth getting new industry. I also agree with her that, over a period, if there is successful oil exploration Plymouth and Falmouth are bound to benefit substantially.<br/>
The hon. Member for Eton and Slough talked about what sounded like the devastation of Slough. As the hon. Member admitted, the unemployment rate is just over 6 per cent. Of course that is bad, but as compared with other parts of the country it is relatively not too bad. The hon. Lady did not remind us that there was some good news from Slough, too. Being a good constituency Member she will know that last year McMichael Radio took on 119 new employees, including 24 school leavers. The company hopes to expand its work force again this year by 15 per cent. It has fuller order books than ever before. That is backing success, and I am sure that the hon.

<p>I quote:
<q>Can a product which requires clean water, good sanitation, adequate family income and a literate parent to follow printed instruction be properly and safely used in areas where water is contaminated, sewage runs in the streets, poverty is severe and illiteracy is high?</q>
That penetrating question was asked by Senator Edward Kennedy in 1978 when he chaired Senate hearings on the use and promotion of artificial baby formulas in developing countries. He was focusing on the issue I want to put before the House tonight&#x2014;whether familiar commercial activities such as promotion, advertising and marketing can be justified in developing countries if they result in illness or death for children.<br/>
The issue is an important aspect of hunger and suffering in the world. It affects the health and, indeed, the lives of millions of children. If we fail to cope with this problem, more children will die unnecessarily in each year of this decade than the approximate 700,000 who are born each year in Britain.<br/>
In fact, James Grant, the executive director of UNICEF, said in a speech at the United Nations on 15 January of this year:
<q>If we in the international community are successful in our efforts to promote and protect the practice of breast feeding, we can save one million infant deaths each year in the 1980s.</q>
Why should so eminent a man feel it necessary to promote and protect a human process that has evolved and supported mankind for 200 million years? It is because there has been a great social revolution. Breast milk substitutes which have been widely available for only 50 years or so have been sweeping on a tide of marketing into poor developing countries during the last: few decades. The effect, amid poverty and polluted water, has been disastrous.<br/>
It is an unchallengeable fact that a mother's natural milk meets all a baby's nutritional requirements and gives resistance against disease. It is readily available, hygienic and free. Although there is some dispute as to the exact percentage of women who are unable to breast-feed, it is very low. Some companies claim that it is 5 per cent., the medical profession says 2 to 3 per cent., while the head of nutrition at the World Health Organisation believes it to be less than 1 per cent.<br/>
In this small percentage of cases where breast feeding is not possible or is rejected, an artifical product may, if properly used, be a satisfactory substitute. But when misused, because the instructions cannot be understood, or germ-ridden because of water contamination and unhygienic conditions, or over-diluted because of poverty, it becomes an instrument of ill-health. The baby's bottle becomes the poisoned chalice.<br/>
One of the most important reasons why mothers in under-developed countries have rushed to use products more suited to Western ways has been described by the Jelliffes, two eminent professors, as the
<q>ill effects of exploitive commercial advertising and promotion".</q>
Thousands of loving parents, anxious that their babies should be as healthy as the blooming ones adorning the


baby food tins, have been gulled and lulled by high-pressure advertising and aggressive salesmanship. It was a case of the despicable exploiting the gullible. Some companies were better than others, but the unscrupulous ones wrought havoc. There has been some considerable improvement in recent years, but there is still a long way to go.<br/>
Of course, malnutrition is part of the wider problems of poverty, lack of resources and social justice. But questionable promotional methods of artificial substitutes have exacerbated rather than mitigated the problems.<br/>
The success of these promotional methods has been stiking. In Brazil, for example, one study showed that the percentage of breast-fed babies fell catastrophically from 96 per cent. in 1940 to 39 per cent. in 1974. Although there were other factors, the impact of promotional methods cannot be doubted. They included the use of newspapers, magazines, billboardings, posters and radio. In addition, there were free samples, gifts for doctors, and sales personnel dressed as nurses.<br/>
In Africa, Asia and South America, the use of breast-milk substitutes has spread rapidly. It is spreading still, and is a cause for continuing concern That is why the World Health Organisation and UNICEF have become so deeply involved. Their actions are due in part to the efforts of Governments involved, but a special debt is owed to those who have drawn the attention of Governments and citizens to what is happpening as baby milk powders flood into the underdeveloped world. The detailed research of Mike Muller, Andy Chetley, John Clark and others in the various organisations has illuminated the problem.<br/>
In October 1979, at a meeting in Geneva called by WHO and UNICEF, a series of recommendations was agreed by representatives of Governments, international agencies, non-governmental organisations, the baby food industry and its critics. There was also a call for an international code of marketing which has now been drafted by the executive board of WHO. It is to be discussed at the World Health Assembly in May&#x2014;and that is where the British Government can play a very important role indeed. It is because we are approaching that important deadline that we are having this debate tonight.<br/>
There has been an acrimonious dispute between the industry and its critics about the recommendations agreed in 1979. When the first 117 allegations of violations were made by the critics, the industry sought to refute most of them, although the complainants stood by their strictures and offered photographic evidence. Since then, over 500 further charges of unfair marketing practices have been made, and no doubt these will be the subject of further dispute.<br/>
There has been a change in the companies' promotional activities in response to the pressure. Some of the firms' spokesmen say that they are convinced that breast milk is best, and many say so in their adverstisements and on their tins of powdered milk. However, it is reasonable to ask why they do not all make that message the main one rather than, as often happens, giving it a minimal mention which is insignificant compared with the textual and pictorial presentation of the product.<br/>
These are not merely issues of interpreting recommendations. These are questions of attitudes of companies and of corporate responsibility on matters of life and death. The concern about the health of the babies will

diminish only if there is a significant return to breast feeding. That means a very considerable reduction in the use of tinned baby food.<br/>
The draft code, unanimously agreed by the executive board of WHO, is to be proposed as the minimum necessary. The code will ban all forms of of media advertising to the public in developing countries. It will place the responsibility for producing educational information in the hands of local health authorities and ban all forms sampling to the public. It will also establish a monitoring system and oblige the director general of WHO to report on the workings of the code at the assembly.<br/>
The industry's attitude to the code is mixed. Some welcome it, while simultaneously expressing reservations which would undermine it. The president of the International Council of Infant Food Industries, Mr. E. W. Saunders, appears to be in no doubt. He says that the code would be irrelevant and unworkable and could have a megative effect on child health by restricting the flow of factual and objective information. I hope that one will be influenced by this selective response&#x2014;especially the Government.<br/>
It is the Government's response which is really important. That is why over 150 Members of the House have signed the early-day motion on this subject, and I would appreciate it if the Minister would clarify the Government's attitude to some vital qustions&#x2014;and I pay tribute to him as a man who has accomplished much with the tobacco industry.<br/>
Can the Minister assure the House that the Government will not seek to weaken in any way the draft code agreed by the executive board of WHO? It would reduce Britain's moral and political standing in the world if we fell out of step now on an issue of such crucial importance to developing countries.<br/>
Does the Minister agree with the WHO executive board's view that the draft code should be regarded as an absolute minimum and that it should be reviewed in two years? Without detailed monitoring, this code can become just another piece of paper, especially as it covers such a wide area. Does the Minister agree that monitoring is crucial to its effective implementation and will he support the recommendation on monitoring? Does he agree that the code will be more effective if it is a regulation? Will he accept that this is an objective to be pursued, and is one for which the Government will press now?<br/>
Personally, I was concerned at the reply that I received to a parliamentary question asking if the Government would make the health and welfare of infants the sole consideration when considering the code. The Minister of State said it would be a prime consideration which, since we are dealing with issues of life and death, is a disturbingly different thing. It is possible that delicate and complex legal matters of trade relations have to be taken into account. However, may we have an assurance that no political or commercial considerations will be allowed to hold sway on this one specific and unique issue?<br/>
This country has a good record in the past and co-sponsored two resolutions at WHO in 1974&#x2013;78. If the Government intend to put the health and welfare of children in developing countries above all other considerations, I believe that they will have the support of the whole House&#x2014;apart, of course, from the few eccentrics who lurk around. Furthermore, I believe that a positive and constructive role by the Government will win the wholehearted consent of the people of Britain. It will


increase our moral stature in the world. Above all, it will help to improve the health and save the lives of millions of children throughout the developing countries.</p>

<p>I congratulate the right hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Ashley) on once again identifying an important issue which has far-reaching effects upon the health and well-being of children and on championing an important cause which is of great interest to many hon. Members. I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for letting me see an advance copy of the text of his speech.<br/>
The right hon. Member has placed on the record his concern; it is a concern which is shared not only by this Government but by the Governments of a large number of countries throughout the world. I welcome this opportunity to outline the positive role played so far by the United Kingdom and to talk about the way in which we hope to be able to influence future developments.<br/>
It is all too easy for those of us living in developed countries to convince ourselves that, because we can see little adverse effects of the promotion of manufactured breast milk substitutes, the problem does not exist. It does exist, as the right hon. Gentleman has so graphically described, although I acknowledge that the scale and cause of the problem are the subject of disagreement between interested parties.<br/>
This Government continue to support all efforts to promote breast feeding both at home and overseas, being convinced that it is the natural and ideal way of feeding babies and of helping to secure their healthy development. While we of course recognise that in certain circumstances breast milk substitutes are necessary, there is a need to ensure that nothing is done to suggest to mothers that such substitutes are preferable to breast milk itself. Mother's milk is the perfect food for babies. Not only is it free but it has all the nourishment a baby needs, and provides protection against common illnesses and allergies. I speak as a beneficiary.<br/>
Despite the obvious advantages of breast milk, however, millions of mothers in poor countries are turning to manufactured substitutes. In many cases, mothers are too poor to be able to buy sufficient quantities of these substitutes to feed their children. Attempts to eke out the food which they do buy by over-diluting it or reducing the number of daily feeds recommended by the manufacturers results in malnutrition.<br/>
An even more alarming situation stems from the absence of a ready access to a clean water supply&#x2014;a situation which unhappily exists in large parts of the developing world. This can result in feeds being prepared with unsafe water unless the most scrupulous precautions are taken to sterilise both the water and the utensils used. In both cases the results can be that babies become seriously ill and even die. Both situations may arise either because mothers are unable to understand, or because they are unable to comply with, the manufacturer's instructions as printed on the labels of the food containers.<br/>
Because we are conscious of this whole problem, our country has for many years supported measures designed

to improve the standard of child nutrition. It is, therefore, hardly surprising that we should have a very close interest in the initiatives recently taken by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF. Officials from both the DHSS and the ODA took part in the WHO/UNICEF jointly sponsored meeting on infant and young child feeding which was held in Geneva in the autumn of 1979. They gave their full support to the recommendations which included the proposal that a code of marketing should be drawn up to cover the promotion and sale of breast milk substitutes. We believed then, and continue to believe, that such a code could play an important part in securing improvements in the standards of child feeding, particularly in developing countries.<br/>
The recommendations of that meeting were endorsed last May by the World Health Assembly, which is the governing body of the WHO. During the course of the assembly the United Kingdom delegation took an active part in the discussions. The assembly supported the idea of a code of the kind suggested, and instructed its secretariat to put forward proposals for consideration by the WHO's executive board. In the months that followed, the WHO sought the views of its 155 member States on the format of the code. As far as this country was concerned, close consultation was already being maintained between a number of Government Departments with specific interest in the subject.<br/>
The WHO produced a draft code which was discussed in detail with representatives of a number of member States, non-governmental organisations, the industry and organisations with a particular interest in the welfare of children in the developing world. Officials from the DHSS and MAFF took the opportunity to put forward the United Kingdom's views during that stage of the code's development.<br/>
I apologise to the right hon. Gentleman for recounting the earlier stages of the code's production in some detail, particularly as I am sure that the history is already known to him. However, I feel that it is important to emphasise that the United Kingdom has played a very active part in the development of the code.<br/>
Last month, the results of all these efforts were brought before the executive board of the World Health Organisation. Each member of that board is nominated to serve in a personal capacity as an expert in health care. The significance of this is that, in common with the other 29 members, our own nominee was not mandated to speak as a national representative. The board was presented with draft versions of the code together with a paper detailing its development. It was asked to submit the code to the next World Health Assembly, together with proposals for its promotion and implementation. The options for consideration were that the code be adopted either as a recommendation to member States under article 23 of the WHO constitution or by means of a regulation under articles 21 and 22.<br/>
I realise that for some months conflicting opinions have been expressed as to whether the code's adoption as a recommendation or as a regulation would be the more effective way of proceeding. Not surprisingly, there has been widespread feeling that by the very meaning of the word, a "regulation" must be a stronger form of adoption than a "recommendation".<br/>
The board members discussed the issue at some length. One of the board's longest serving members said that in the 30 years of his association with the WHO he had never received so much correspondence on a single agenda item. Board members were clearly concerned that a number of member States thought that there would be difficulties in applying the code as a regulation in their national, legislative and constitutional frameworks. The result of such difficulties could be that at best long delays would take place before the effects of the code came into operation and that at worst, its implementation would become impossible. The executive board was concerned that in this case, as far as many babies were concerned, delay could literally be fatal. Furthermore, lack of unanimity among member States could persuade some countries to delay decisions still further. The code's adoption as a recommendation would introduce a degree of flexibility, enabling member States to avoid unnecessary delays of this nature.<br/>
In those circumstances, the board decided that on balance, the adoption of the code as a recommendation to the WHO member States would be the more effective course of action. In making its proposal, the board added two important recommendations. Firstly, it has proposed that the operation of the code should be reviewed after two years to establish the degree of compliance with its recommendations at country, regional and global levels. Secondly, it has proposed that the World Health Assembly should reserve the right to make future proposals, if necessary, for the revision of the code, including further measures for its effective application.<br/>
In its present form, the code seeks to achieve its objective by banning the advertising of breast-milk substitutes. It also seeks to ban the use of sale inducements such as free samples, gifts and discounts, either directly to mothers or to hospitals and clinics. It contains provisions to prevent manufacturers making financial inducements to health workers to promote breast-milk substitutes and paying their own employees bonuses based on the volume of sales of these products.<br/>
The code also calls for appropriate information on infant feeding to be provided by the health care system. In addition, it recommends action to govern the production and storage of infant feeding products and proposes that such products should meet international standards of quality and presentation, in particular those developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission, and that their labels should clearly inform the public of the superiority of breast feeding.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that the final decision on all aspects of the code rests with the World Health Assembly, which meets in May. Between now and May the code, as approved by the board, will be examined in detail by officials of the interested Government Departments who will continue to consult those with an interest in the matter. Our prime objective will be to press for the code that I have described to be adopted in the most effective form and manner, and the United Kingdom delegation will be briefed accordingly. I understand the right hon. Gentleman's concern that the code should be worded in such a way as to avoid loopholes that would enable its aims to be thwarted. I shall give careful

consideration to the points that he has made during these final stages of the code's examination in order to see whether we can block the loopholes.<br/>
I should, however, like to reply to the specific questions raised by the right hon. Gentleman. I reassure him that it was not the Government's intention to try to weaken the code at any stage in its development. It is now generally accepted by all concerned that the earlier drafts of the code were impractical and inoperable, and in common with other Governments we took the opportunity to point out those difficulties. The United Kingdom delegation in May will have to use its discretion in considering proposals for further drafting changes in the light of discussions.<br/>
Turning to some of the other points that the right hon. Gentleman made about the proposal being the minimum, the final preambular paragraph of the executive board's proposed resolution for the assembly's consideration reads as follows:
<q>Stressing that the adoption of and adherence to the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes is a minimum requirement and only one of several important actions required in order to protect healthy practices in respect of infant and young child feeding.</q>
I believe that statement to be true. We also support the proposals that the code should be subject to a review in two years' time.<br/>
I am sorry if my hon. Friend the Minister of State's reply to the right hon. Gentleman's earlier question caused some doubt in his mind. There was no intention to suggest other than that the health and welfare of infants is of paramount importance in consideration of the code, more important than some of the other factors that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned towards the end of his speech. The other consideration which the Government had in mind was the vital one of getting the code adopted and operational without delay.<br/>
The question of monitoring is one that we shall have to consider in the light of the final version of the code. I have, however, taken on board the right hon. Gentleman's views on the matter.<br/>
I should perhaps also point out to the right hon. Gentleman that responsibility for controlling the advertising and marketing of breast milk substitutes within any country lies with the Government of that country. The code does not require individual countries to control the overseas marketing facilities of their baby food manufacturers. Any such action would trespass on the sovereignty of importing countries to manage their own markets. Within the United Kingdom, I am happy to say, British manufacturers already take a responsible attitude towards advertising and marketing their breast-milk substitutes, voluntarily confining their advertisements solely to specialist publications. Furthermore, unless they have been approved by MAFF and on my Department, certain foods which might be used as breast-milk substitutes are required by law to bear a warning statement that they are not fit for babies. That responsible attitude on the part of manufacturers towards advertising and quality standards is what is required in the developing world.<br/>
The WHO's 155 member States are clearly of the opinion that urgent action needs to be taken. Those who have devoted their lives to studying child nutrition know that there are quite sufficient problems to be faced in combating it throughout the world without adding problems of our own making.<br/>
Finally, in thanking the right hon. Gentleman once again for his constructive comments, I give him an assurance that we shall continue to take account of the views expressed by all those with an interest in the subject before we finally brief the United Kingdom delegation to the World Health Assembly in May. I look forward to discussing the whole subject in more detail when I meettheright hon. Gentleman in the near future.</p>
