<p>Most certainly. There has been active co-operation between the Minister, the chairman of the corporations, and the accountancy sections and auditors of the corporations.

<p>asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Civil Aviation whether, as a result of the acquisition by the State of Doncaster airport, he now proposes to construct the necessary runways and other essential works; when he anticipates the plans will be ready or the work of reconstruction will commence; who will use the airport in the meantime; and what facilities will be given to commercial operators or charter companies to develop, in the near future, regular airline services.</p>

<p>I would refer the hon. Member to the statement I made in regard to aerodromes in the United Kingdom on 9th July, in answer to a Question by the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Beswick), but I may add with regard to Doncaster that preliminary plans for its development, which is a heavy constructional undertaking, have been prepared, though for the reasons given in my earlier statement I am unable to forecast the date of implementation. Meanwhile, the


aerodrome is already being used by one aircraft repair and maintenance firm, and will be available within the limits of its capacity and accommodation to other commercial, charter and private flying interests to engage in their legitimate actiivties. A civil operated reserve school will resume flying activities there in the autumn.</p>

<p>Is not the Minister aware that we in the West Riding of Yorkshire, particularly in the City of Sheffield and other towns around Doncaster, attach considerable importance to the development of this airport? Will my hon.

<p>The settlement law passed in the United States zone was carefully studied before the issue of the British Draft Ordinance.

<p>The Rumanian Government have not discontinued arrests of political opponents. They have recently arrested Monsieur Maniu and the leading members of the National Peasant Party.

<p>The principal point is in the case of Italy.

<p>My hon. Friend has been misinformed. His Majesty's Government encouraged the project of a visit to this country of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra last year, after it had been purged of 17 of its members with Nazi connections. For commercial reasons it was not found possible to arrange engagements for the orchestra last year, but no political aspect was involved. I am satisfied that the Austrian Government, whose de-Nazification Law of 6th February, 1947, was only issued after thorough examination by the Allied Council in Vienna, has carried out the de-Nazification of the implicated members of the orchestra. Wolfgang Schneiderhahn is not a figure of any political importance.</p>

<p>As the House is aware, Netherlands troops began military action against the Indonesian forces at dawn on 21st July. The reasons for the actual breakdown have been described in detail in an official statement by the Netherlands Prime Minister on 20th July, and I do not propose to comment on these at the moment. I would like, however, to give the House some account of the efforts which His Majesty's Government have made over a long period to avert this breakdown.<br/>
I have learned of the decision of the Netherlands Government with the keenest regret. Ever since December, 1945, when the Political Adviser to the Supreme Allied Commander in South-East Asia was authorised to make our first attempt to exercise good offices and bring the two parties together, we have continued our efforts to this end. It will be recalled that early in 1946 Lord Inverchapel was sent to Batavia by His Majesty's Government and succeeded in securing a wide measure of agreement between the Netherlands authorities and the Indonesians on certain proposals providing for Indonesian autonomy within the framework of the Netherlands Kingdom, a state of affairs which had been foreshadowed in a broadcast declaration by Her Majesty the Queen of the Netherlands in 1942. Unfortunately, these proposals were subsequently found to be unacceptable by the Netherlands Government at The Hague.<br/>
In August, 1946, Lord Killearn was invited by both parties to exercise his good offices. The result of the ensuing negotiations was the Linggadjati Agreement, which provided for the establishment by 1st January, 1949, of a federal government to be known as the United States of Indonesia, and of a Netherlands-Indonesian Union in which the Kingdom of the Netherlands, on the one hand, and the United States of Indonesia, on the other, were to co-operate on a basis of joint partnership. Since March last, when the Agreement was signed, negotiations have been going on between the Netherlands and Indonesian authorities for its practical implementation.<br/>
Until recently these negotiations were going fairly well. We know that a wide measure of agreement was reached, but


there were one or two outstanding points on which the Indonesian authorities were reluctant to accept the Dutch proposals. One of the chief points was a Dutch proposal for the creation of a joint Netherlands-Indonesian gendarmerie, which would restore order in the interior. Even on this a compromise seemed possible, since the Indonesian authorities were ready to pursue negotiations with a view to meeting, in some measure, the Netherlands proposals. In the hope of promoting agreement, His Majesty's Government suggested to the Netherlands Government the possible appointment of a neutral police commissioner, but this idea did not prove acceptable. Meanwhile, His Majesty's Consul-General in Batavia, Mr. Mitcheson, has done a lot of valuable work to bridge the differences between the two parties, which was very greatly appreciated by both.<br/>
At all times His Majesty's Government have made it plain that they were ready to place their good offices at the disposal of both parties, and in our official statement of 21st July this offer of good offices was renewed. I would add that His Majesty's Government have acted throughout in full consultation with the United States, to whom also, on various occasions, the Netherlands Government and the Indonesian authorities have appealed for help. They have also kept in close touch with all members of the Commonwealth.<br/>
In reply to our offer, which was published yesterday at The Hague, the Netherlands Government state that they are grateful to the United States and His Majesty's Governments for their help; that they have taken good note of our offer of good offices; and that it will depend on developments whether, and if so when, it will be opportune to appeal again to the U.S. Government and His Majesty's Government. I am keeping in very close touch with events, and will take advantage of any opportunity to bring about a peaceful settlement, but I cannot, at the moment, express any view as to the quickest and best way of bringing this conflict to an end. I cannot, therefore, at present give an opinion as to whether the Security Council is the best and most appropriate means of achieving this object.</p>

<p>While fully appreciating the efforts which have been made, and are being made, in regard to mediation, may I ask if the Foreign Secretary does not feel that the situation has now so deteriorated that there is both a technical and a moral obligation to refer the matter to the United Nations and, indeed, would not this be in the best interests of all concerned, and of the world at large?</p>

<p>I am giving very careful consideration to that. Obviously, I do not rule it out, but I have to be guided by experience. In regard to questions we referred to the Security Council recently, it does not bring about a final and peaceful solution, and the matter drags on, with vetoes, and all sorts of difficulties going on, which is disappointing. What His Majesty's Government are determined to do is, to try to use their good offices to bring this matter to a satisfactory solution at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<p>The Government of the Malayan Union has spent 4,200,000 Straits dollars on short-term food production for crops, including rice, during the period April, 1946, to June, 1947, of which over 2,000,000 dollars is capital expenditure. Five thousand, three hundred and twenty-three acres have been planted, the weight of crops harvested being 196 tons, value at 20,000 dollars. Heavy expenditure has been entailed in the preliminary work of


clearing and preparing land for cultivation, and it must be some time before the full benefits of this development become apparent. Nevertheless, in the Governor's view, the results have so far been disappointing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1224.6" hansard_membership_id="8189" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30149" speakername="The Minister of Supply (Mr. John Wilmot)" colnum="1224" time="">
<p>Mr. Speaker, with your permission, I propose to make a statement about the proposed atomic energy plant in West Cumberland.<br/>
On 29th January, last year, the Prime Minister announced the setting up of an organisation to be responsible for the provision of fissile material. It has since been announced that the first stage of this process, the production of pure uranium from pitch-blende concentrates, will be carried out at the Ministry of Supply factory at Springfields, near Preston. Consideration has been given to the location of the second stage of the process, the production in a chain-reacting pile of fissile


material from the uranium produced, at Springfields. In addition to purely technical considerations, it was necessary, in order to save much time, to find a prepared site with services already developed, and, if possible, in reasonable proximity to Springfields. At one stage it was thought that these requirements could only be met by the use of the former explosives factory at Drigg in West Cumberland.<br/>
When it was learned that His Majesty's Government were considering the construction of an atomic energy plant at Drigg, Courtaulds Limited, who were proceeding with a project for a new rayon factory on the site of the Royal Ordnance Factory at Sellafield, a few miles north of Drigg, informed His Majesty's Government that it seemed unlikely to them that there would be sufficient constructional and operational labour for both schemes. His Majesty's Government concurred in this view. This made it possible to consider the Sellafield site as an alternative to Drigg for the atomic energy project. Sellafield has proved to be technically more suitable, and in addition has the advantage that its use for industrial purposes is consistent with planning proposals for the area, and, in particular, with the proposals for a Lake District National Park, which will include part of the coast line, and that it will permit re-examination of the scheme for raising the level of Ennerdale Water. The atomic energy project will, therefore, be located at Sellafield. Building and engineering work will begin in the near future, and will employ a considerable number of men for some time to come. For the time being, there will be no change in the present use of the Royal Ordnance Factory at Drigg.</p>

<p>In view of the Minister's statement, may I ask when ho will he able to announce that this factory at Drigg can be used for something which is really productive?</p>

<p>For the time being, I think that the factory at Drigg must proceed with the work it is now doing.</p>

<p>Can the right hon. Gentleman say what type of employment will be given by the atomic energy factory at Sellafield? We understood that Courtaulds were going to employ a large number of women, for whom there is little employment in West Cumberland Will the atomic energy plant employ women,

or what type of employment will be offered?</p>

<p>For some Lime the labour employed on the site will be constructional building labour, as would nave been the case with the construction of the rayon factory. Later on, the special staff of the atomic energy project will be the labour employed. I think we had better leave it at that.</p>

<p>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of the House, I will make a statement about a late night transport service for the House of Commons staff. Arrangements have been made for the Ministry of Supply to

operate, as from this week, a small number of six seater vehicles to convey staff to points near their homes along four main routes when the House rises after midnight. It is impossible to include Members of Parliament in this scheme. The fares charged will be the same as before. The estimated cost is about &#x00A3;500 in a full year, a small proportion of which will be recovered from receipts.</p>

<p>May I, at this stage, ask your guidance, Mr. Speaker, as to the procedure which we might follow for the general convenience of the House? In referring to three documents, those which set out the Lords Amendments, the Motions on the Order Paper in my name, and the Bill as it left this House&#x2014;and which has been considerably altered by the Lords Amendments&#x2014;we may find ourselves in a difficulty in following various related matters There are 10 major issues on which the Government will ask the House to disagree with the Lords, and there are 42 Amendments which are connected with these major issues. There are some 240 Amendments which have been made in another place, some 200 of which are either mainly drafting, or result from agreement which took place during the discussions, or

which give effect to pledges and undertakings which I gave on the Report stage. If it meets with the general convenience of the House I would like, on behalf of the Government, to advise acceptance of those Amendments, limiting, in the main, our discussion to the major Amendments on which there is disagreement. If it meets with your approval, Sir, and the general convenience of the House, would it be desirable to consider each related group of Amendments, and take the discussion on each of them on the main Amendment?<br/>
I would like to run over, briefly, the issues on which there is major disagreement between this House and another place. They are the limitation of the powers of direction; the appointments to the Executive; the Scottish Executive; the doubling of the mileage limit for road haulage; the exclusion of "A" contracts; the exclusion of milk; the onus of proof; the subordination to the licensing authority; the decision of the referees on staff compensation, and the procedure on inquiries. I would be glad, Sir, if you could give me your guidance on the submission I have made.</p>

<p>I agree that the position is a little complicated, but, speaking for myself and my hon. and right hon. Friends on this side, the procedure which the Minister has outlined seems to be convenient to the House, and if it meets with your approval, Mr. Speaker, I shall be very glad to support it.</p>

<p>I have no particular wish to fall out with any understanding that may have been arrived at. If we are going to discuss the Amendments in groups, that is one thing; but there are a vast number of other Amendments Which, it would seem to me, we should have a chance of discussing separately when coming to the group of vetos. I think that we should be careful not to rule


out those that are not exactly dealing with the same point. I am not quite clear whether the Amendments are printed correctly. May I draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, to page 22 of the Lords Amendments. Near the bottom of the page will be seen "page 101," and then comes "page 108," after that "page 105." In going through the Amendments, I found very great difficulty, and I could not follow what happens after the first one in fitting in the Amendments on pages 28 and 29. It seems that there must be a misprint and I am not sure that this is the only one. I should like to know when we come to these, if we may have the position made clear.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct. There are some misprints. I have a list of them. I do not think that they are our fault; I believe that the fault arises in another place. I would propose as we come to each misprint&#x2014;I do not think that they are serious&#x2014;to read it out, and to make it perfectly plain to the House how it should read. As regards the other point, I thought that this arrangement might be generally for the convenience of the House, but I cannot, of course, very well put the Amendments <i>en bloc</i> to disagree with another place, in case there is a desire to discuss any particular point. I think that it would be better to put them separately, unless they are purely drafting or consequential Amendments. With regard to points generally agreed, I suggest that I put these page by page, and if any hon. Member wishes to raise a point he should stop me when I read out the Amendment.</p>

This is one of the Amendments on which there is agreement, but I think that it is of sufficient substance for me to say a word or two about it. In the Committee stage of the Bill, I resisted a similar Amendment, but later on, the Government reconsidered this decision and, on the understanding that the whole of the increased members should

not be full-time members, it was agreed to modify the decision. So we have agreed with the Lords Amendment, which lays down that the chairman and four members of the Commission shall be full-time, leaving the others open to part-time appointments if so desired.</p>

<p>The OFFICIAL REPORT is published for our convenience, and for their convenience, and is not really an official record.

<p>I am not quite clear about this matter, because I understand you Sir, said to the House not long ago that you knew there were certain things wrong with these Lords Amendments.

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
I think we can easily resolve the difficulty by rejecting this Lords' Amendment. That is the course which I propose to recommend to the House on behalf of the Government. To relieve the anxiety of the right hon. Member for the City of London (Mr. Assheton) I will say that I would have moved the same Motion whether the words
<q>as or will be likely to be</q>
were in, or out. It occurs to me that we should devote our attention to what such an Amendment seeks to accomplish. The purpose of it is to limit the Minister's power to give directions to the Commission in reference to the carrying on of their undertakings if, in the opinion of the Minister, such a direction is necessary in the national interest. As a matter of fact, I am informed that it is very doubtful whether even if this Amendment were accepted in its present form, it would in fact limit the Minister's power. We all know from experience


that it might in circumstances of very serious national emergency, be the subject of legal action for the purpose of delaying any action which the Government of the day might take in the exercise of such power. Therefore, in the opinion of the Government, we cannot possibly have in regard to important services which represent a considerable volume of employment in the country, the possibility of expenditure of large sums of capital either in accelerating or retarding development, as the case may be, and in other matters. I should have thought, in view of experiences which this country had in the early part of this year, that the wisdom of the Minister having power of direction of this character should be abundantly plain to hon. Members of this House, and of the other place.<br/>
Hon. Members are aware that during the fuel crisis it was imperative to maintain the economic life of this country when certain action had to he taken in regard to the use of transport for the transport of coal. Even today, the community is being compelled to suffer considerable inconvenience for the necessity of the railways contributing to and augmenting the coal stock position. A decision like the 10 per cent. cut in passenger services for the sake of building up coal stocks, represents an interference with the revenue-taking capacity of the railways at present. That is quite a recent example of the need for the Minister to have powers of this description. For those reasons, I have not the slightest hesitation in asking the House to disagree with the Lords in this Amendment.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1239.0" hansard_membership_id="667" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22802" speakername="Mr. Assheton" colnum="1239" time="">
<p>We are dealing with this Amendment as it is reported to us on the Order Paper, and I apprehend that when we have dealt with it we shall not have dealt with the Amendment which their Lordships made to the Bill, and that some further opportunity will be given to the House to deal with the Amendment which in fact was made in another place. By that time, no doubt, we shall have had a report from the other place as to what the position may be. As the House will recall, Clause 3 (3) lays it down that:
<q>All the business carried on by the Commission, whether or not arising from undertakings or parts of undertakings vested in them by or under any provision of this Act, shall form one undertaking, and the Commission shall so conduct that undertaking and, subject

to the provisions of this Act, levy such fares, rates, tolls, dues and other charges, as to secure that the revenue of the Commission is not less than sufficient for making provision for the meeting of charges properly chargeable to revenue, taking one year with another.</q>
That is a very important Amendment indeed because on it depends the whole finance of this Bill, and this House laid it down and intended to lay it down that the Transport Commission should not run at a loss. It was not intended that there should be a subsidy from the Exchequer towards deficits made by the Transport Commission, but it was laid down that, taking one year with another&#x2014;although I should have preferred to have omitted those words&#x2014;the Commission would have to pay its way. It appears from the answer which the right hon. Gentleman has given this afternoon that he is prepared, in certain circumstances, to depart from that position. When this matter was discussed in another place it was not quite clear whether the Government thought that the Amendment was undesirable or merely unnecessary. It appears to me now from what the Minister has told us today that they definitely think that it is undesirable. That was not made sufficiently clear perhaps&#x2014;</p>

<p>In asking the House to disagree with this Amendment, I would point out to the right hon. Gentleman that it does not alter at all the obligation on the Commission to carry out the duties laid down in Subsection (3). Action along those lines would follow if it were necessary.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1240.1" hansard_membership_id="667" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22802" speakername="Mr. Assheton" colnum="1240" time="">
<p>I fully appreciate the point which the right hon. Gentleman makes, but it was pointed out in another place with considerable weight and with the authority of at least two former Lord Chancellors, that the position was not as the right hon. Gentleman has now described it to us. It is true that Subsection (3) is not directly contradicted by this provision, but it is equally true that if the Minister were to give a direction which resulted in losses falling upon the Commission then, if the Commission carried out his direction, it might not be able to recoup those losses. A situation might very easily arise in which the Commission was led into making a loss whether it wanted to do so or not. The Minister has taken powers to give these directions, and all that we have sought to do is to limit those powers in such a way that he cannot put the Commission into the position of making


a loss against its own intentions. Of course, in the Amendment which the Lords have sent to us, there is an exception in the interests of national security, and everybody in both Houses would agree with that, but the Minister wants to go a great deal further than that.<br/>
I am bound to say that I am not at all happy at the attitude which the Minister has taken on this Amendment, and I hope very much that on reading what has been said in another place, he will be prepared to concede this Amendment. I am still not quite certain from his intervention whether he is suggesting to the House that the Commission cannot be put in the position of being forced to lose money under his direction, but it is clear to me that certain directions he could give might have that effect, and therefore I suggest very strongly that we should agree with the Lords in this Amendment.</p>

<p>I was worried by the Minister's speech because it seemed to me that his main theme was that he should have the powers of direction in an emergency such as we had last winter. But surely this Amendment gives him those powers, since at the end, it provides for exception in the case of national security. That makes it plain that in time of war or at any other difficult period, the Minister could make regulations under this very Amendment which he says deprives him of that power. That was explained by his argument, but the other part of the Amendment seems to have been rather avoided in his speech. I do not know whether it is because of the doubtful clarity of the Amendment, but the guiding purpose of the Amendment is that the Minister should not give directions to these Commissioners which will compel them to run the railways in such a way that they will be financially unsound. When the Minister in his original reply leaves out that part of the Amendment, I find it rather surprising, because I know that he has a very sound financial mind as far as certain business interests are concerned, and I do not think that he wants to run the railways at a loss. I can think of Ministers who might give directions which could lead to such a loss, and I should have thought that there was a very strong case for the Amendment since no one desires that. In these circumstances, at this early stage in our discussions, it would he what I might call a

lubricant on the part of the Minister to give way on this and to say that on further consideration this is a matter in which be can accept the Lords Amendment.</p>

<p>We may agree or disagree with the Lords in this Amendment, but before we get to that stage we should understand clearly what is the attitude of the Government to the Amendment. I do not understand it at the moment and, at the risk of being, a little repetitive, I should like to put the point to the right hon. Gentleman again. Clause 3 lays down that this Commission must balance its revenue with its expenditure, taking one year with another. Its says nothing whatever about the national interests or anything of that kind, but simply lays a duty upon them to balance revenue with expenditure. It all depends upon one's point of view, and, according to the view taken, the national interest might involve many other things besides effecting such a balance. There might be hon. Gentlemen opposite who thought that the national interest demanded that we should subsidise the railways out of public funds, that we should run them at a loss, or that we should use the transport system to subsidise coal or exports, or something of that kind. In Clause 4 the Minister is given power to make directions which the Commission have to follow and which, in the opinion of the Minister, will favour the national interest. It is therefore evident that the Minister can override the obligations placed upon the Commission in Clause 3. Does the Minister agree with that? I think it is self-evident. If there is any disagreement about it, I hope that the Minister will say so.<br/>
4.30 p.m.<br/>
The purpose of the Amendment is to ensure that whatever directions the Minister may give, they shall in no sense override the obligation of the Commission to balance revenue with expenditure. I do not know whether the Minister agrees with that object or not. I do not know what his case is yet. He ought to tell the House before we go to a Division. Is it his case that the Amendment is unnecessary because the Minister could not give such directions? Is that his case? He has not told us at all. If it is his case that, although he agrees with the principle behind the words, the words are wholly unnecessary, he should tell us. I think


that the Minister can override the general provisions of Clause 3. That is made even more plain by Subsection (5), of Clause 4, in which the Minister can give directions to the Commission to discontinue any of their activities or dispose of any part of their undertaking. In fact, he can override the whole purpose and object for which the Commission is set up to operate. It is obvious that the general directions which the Minister can give are powerful and can override at any moment Clause 3, or any other part of the Bill. His direction can, for example, tell the Commission to stop owning docks. So far, the only case which the Government have made is that the proposal in the Amendment is unnecessary, but it is wholly unsupported by any sort of argument. The House is entitled to know whether the Minister contends that the Amendment is wholly unnecessary. The Minister said he was doubtful whether the words would limit the Minister's power. What does he mean? Does he want them to limit the Minister's power or does he not? That is what we want to know. Will he tell us?<br/>
Then he said something about another coal crisis, and that in the winter we might be moving into a difficult period, and somebody might start a law action in some way or another and that somehow, this Amendment would make it more difficult for the Government to deal with that situation. How on earth would directions from the Minister making the Commission unbalance its revenue and expenditure, help in a coal crisis or any other sort of crisis? Will the Minister explain what he means? I do not want to delay the House, but we have not had an adequate explanation from the Government. Will the Minister tell us at this stage? We cannot proceed with the argument very much further until we have had a further explanation. Will the Minister tell us whether he thinks the Amendment is unnecessary, and if so, will he meet the argument which I have brought forward to show that the words are necessary and that his power of direction will override all the duties of the Commission? Will he tell us whether he thinks that the Minister should have power to direct the Commission to unbalance its revenue or expenditure or not? If he tells us the answer, we might be able to proceed with

the Debate upon a rather more intelligible basis.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends and I do not want to go into the Division Lobby on this matter. We want to know what the Minister intends. My hon. Friend has just used arguments which contain a very important principle. Clause 3 lays down obligations which were considered by many of us, and were supported by us, in the Committee. We want to know whether the Minister can, under Clause 4, override those provisions which were laid down very clearly as a safeguard in Clause 3, and which we supported. I think I am speaking on behalf of quite a number of hon. Gentlemen when I say we are anxious to know whether that is so or not.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a couple of points made by the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft). Clause 3 provides for the carrying on of nationalised under-takings in the national interest. Subsection (1) lays down that the Commission must take such steps as they consider necessary
<q>to provide most efficiently and conveniently for the needs of the public, agriculture, commerce and industry.</q>
Those words are subject to very wide interpretation. It might easily be that for a temporary period in time of crisis or otherwise it would be necessary that the railways or some other section of the transport industry should operate at a loss, and it is conceivable that the loss might be temporary. Take, for instance, the staggering of hours of work which is to be brought in during the coming winter. It might be necessary to put on extra buses for the carriage of people to work at uneconomic periods, and it might be necessary for the Minister to give instructions to that effect, even though the buses were run at a loss. The Amendment is tampering with that very&#x2014;</p>

<p>I think the hon. Member is getting unnecessarily at cross-purposes with us. Clause 3 lays down no obligation about particular bus services, but it does oblige the Commission, in Subsection (3) to secure that its revenue is not less than sufficient to balance its expenditure, taking one year with another. The purpose of the Amendment is to prevent Clause 4 from


overriding that broad instruction as to balancing income and expenditure, taking one year with another.</p>

<p>We all agree with that, and the Bill lays that down. The argument on the other side of the House is that the Amendment is necessary because the instructions given by the Minister might cause a loss of revenue and prevent the Commission balancing its accounts. I am arguing that the Amendment might be so interpreted so that any direction by the Minister which caused a loss of revenue to the Commission could not be operative. There is no doubt that the financial position of the transport industry today as disclosed by answers to Questions put to the Minister on Monday, is such that any addition to expenditure might make it very difficult to balance its accounts. Any direction which led to an increase in expenditure could, therefore, be resisted, under the Amendment. For that reason, I think the Amendment is a hampering one.</p>

<p>I wonder whether hon. Members opposite who know something about railways realise that, even under nationalisation, there may be times when losses will be sustained? Simply because you nationalise an industry, it does not mean that you put right all its difficulties. I have read very carefully the Debates which took place in another place, and there it was clearly demonstrated that the Government opposition to the Amendment was on the ground that the Amendment was unnecessary. Now it is said that the Minister must have the power to instruct the Commission on any occasion he desires, even if it has an effect on the balancing of the budget of an undertaking. I thought that throughout the stages of the Bill in another place and even today, we had accepted the principle&#x2014;the hon. Member for Enfield (Mr. Ernest Davies) implied that he believed it&#x2014;that all transport undertakings brought under nationalisation should be made, as a Yorkshire friend of mine says, "To meet and tie" In other words, revenue should equal expenditure. That is the principle involved in this Amendment. We either believe in that and vote for the Amendment, or we do not believe it and vote for the Government Motion. If we accept the Lords Amendment and the undertakings

are balanced financially we shall have an exact record of their efficiency. We shall know whether under nationalisation the industry is more efficient than under private enterprise. It is a measuring stick which I ask the Minister to bear in mind. I hope that he has sufficient faith in this nationalisation scheme to allow this Lords Amendment to be carried.</p>

<p>There seems to be a certain amount of shadow boxing about the objection to the objection to the Amendment from another place. The first part of Clause 4 says that the Minister shall only direct the Commission on matters which appeal to him to affect the national interest, and that is sufficient indication of how rarely this power will be used. It will only be used on rare and important occasions, and it is a very necessary power for the Minister if we believe that transport must come before finance. There might be occasions in some particular emergency when it would be unnecessarily hampering the conduct of the transport system if such a provision as this were inserted. The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft) quoted Clause 4 (5) as to the powers of the Commission and said that under that the Minister could direct the Commission to close docks and had the power to issue all kinds of instructions to cease activities, but in the second portion of Clause 5 it is laid down that the Minister can only give those directions if he is satisfied that the undertaking is unnecessary for the proper discharge of the duties of the Commission under this Act. It is not therefore, conceivable that he would issue an instruction to close docks because presumably docks will be necessary to this country for a long time.</p>

It would be very wrong and unnecessary to insert a limitation of this kind, and I hope the Minister will stick to his guns.</p>

<p>Surely there are two points at issue here. The first is the major one, and the second the lesser one. As my hon. Friends have said, we have got to clear up the major one first. The major one is whether in the Bill as it stands without the Amendment, Clauses 3 and 4 are not mutually antagonistic. Is it the intention that Clause 3 in its broad lines is to operate and that Clause 4 is to take nothing away from it, namely, that taking one year with another, the proceeds which the Commission draw shall meet its expenses and that it shall be a paying concern? The Minister, who was followed even more emphatically by the hon. Member for Enfield (Mr. Ernest Davies), pointed out that in certain temporary circumstances or national interest circumstances, that might not happen. The Minister instanced the coal situation last year. Are we to suppose that the words, "taking one year with another" would have got rid of that difficulty? Perhaps the Minister expects that coal situation to return. If it was only a temporary situation, this Amendment allows the Minister to deal with it in the way he wants. If it is a question of national emergency, once again this Amendment allows him to deal with it in the way he wants. I am, therefore, led inescapably to the conclusion that the Minister wants to have Clause 4 and Clause 3 mutually antagonistic and to cut out one of the broad principles on which we have insisted throughout the Bill.</p>

<p>I want to ask the right hon. Gentleman one question. It is very much that which my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Central Glasgow (Colonel Hutchison) has in mind. Two quite separate questions arise here. I can quite

well imagine that one of them gives rise to a real difference between the two sides of the House. It is whether or not certain powers should be given to the Minister. That is a matter on which we may well differ, but there is another question on which we ought to be agreed, and that is: What are the powers of the Minister under the Clause as it stands? Whatever else may divide one side of the House from the other, we should be absolutely clear on the powers that are being given to the Minister under this Clause. The question I wish to put to the Minister is a perfectly simple one. Does he or does he not say that he would be entitled to give directions under Clause 4 (1) which disregard the obligations of Clause 3 (3)? He will agree that that is a perfectly simple and direct question. He will he able to obtain skilled legal advice on the question whether or not in the Clause as it stands unamended he is taking that power. In the first view that some of us take, it would appear that he is, but, if he advises the House that on the most skilled legal advice open to him he would not be able to give any direction under Clause 4 (1) which would disregard the obligation of Clause 3 (3), it might carry great weight in certain sections of the House. So far, he has not given that assurance, and to talk about the Amendment being unnecessary may mean so many different things.<br/>
The only point on which I differ from my hon. and gallant Friend is that he asked the Minister to state what his intentions are. I am asking something different. I am asking what he is advised his powers are. Intentions would only govern himself and not his successors, but powers would bind him and his successors. I hope he will give a perfectly clear and direct answer to the quite simple question as to whether on the Clause as it stands he could over-ride the obligation which is laid down in the Bill under Clause 3 (3). While this House may be willing to give many powers to the Minister, it does not want to give him powers to disregard other Clauses in the Bill.</p>

<p>Replying to the specific point which has just been submitted to me, it appears to me that it could have been put with more purpose when the Bill was before the House, because it has very little relation to the Amendment we are discussing. The powers given to the


Minister under Clause 4 (1) are quite specific and do not over-ride the clear and specific responsibility placed upon the Commission to balance its budget one year with another laid down in Clause 3 (3). One does have to take into consideration a direction from the Minister under circumstances in the national interest made for the moment and for the period affecting the situation, but the responsibility for discharging that situation would be net and steps and action would have to be taken for the purpose of righting any temporary position. However, that is not the issue which the House is considering now, which is the Amendment proposed in another place that introduces into Clause 3, where it is inappropriate, the intention to limit the Minister's powers&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am sorry, it is Clause 4. I was referring to Subsection (3) which is the responsibility of the Commission. The purpose of the Lords' Amendment is to introduce words as to which, I am advised, it is doubtful whether they do limit the Minister's powers. The fact that they are inserted, may raise a doubt and, on the occasion of the Minister using those powers, it may&#x2014;I do not say it will&#x2014;lead to legal action. In the opinion of the Government there is no doubt about the situation as it exists today, and we do not see the value of accepting this Amendment which tends only to add confusion. I venture to suggest that the discussion which has taken place this afternoon supports the wisdom of the Government's action. The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft) put up all sorts of bogies and assumptions&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2014;and then proceeded, in the hearty and vigorous way to which we are accustomed, to destroy his own assumptions. Therefore, from the point of view of the Government, having made the position clear, I ask the House to come to a decision on this Amendment.</p>

<p>I have listened, as I always do, with the greatest care to

what the right hon. Gentleman has said on this Amendment, and I should like to remind him that we are in the happy position in this instance, of not only having had the advantage of knowing what Government spokesmen have said, to which we can refer, but also the brief on which Government spokesmen made their pronouncement, because that was quoted with great frankness by their representative in another place. This is the difficulty which I put to the right hon. Gentleman. The Government brief on the point was:
<q>The amendment is entirely unnecessary as, having regard to the requirement in Clause 3, subsection (3), that the Commission shall make both ends meet, it would not be competent to the Minister to give a direction under Clause 4 (1), to a contrary effect.</q>
May I put to the right hon. Gentleman our difficulties on that? Under Clause 3 (3) there is a duty placed on the Commission. When in a Statute, after placing a duty on one body&#x2014;in this case a public corporation set up by the Bill&#x2014;then in a subsequent Clause you give a right to a different body which, by its terms, may override or interfere with the duty, the subsequent provision giving the right to the Minister would be the prevailing provision in the Statute. The right hon. Gentleman knows that this is not merely my own opinion. I cannot go into it in detail, but it is the opinion of high legal authorities.<br/>
If the position he that the Government, as is stated in their brief, do not think this is necessary, but high legal opinion in various quarters thinks that this doubt may arise, then surely it is reasonable to put words into the Bill which will remove this doubt? That is all we are seeking to do. The right hon. Gentleman his said that it raises a doubt, but there cannot be any doubt because, according to their view, it is governed by Clause 3 (3). If we put in these words, then it makes clear that the Minister's directions are limited so that he cannot interfere with Clause 3 (3), and in that case assurance is made doubly sure. We have been rather worried on this side of the House by the arguments advanced in favour of the Government case by their more intrepid supporters because, of course, they always go a bit further in finding arguments which do not accord with that main argument which has been advanced, and it is the feeling and attitude behind these arguments which make it difficult for


those on this side of the House to depart from this Amendment.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman knows very well that there are three difficulties about which we are alarmed, and from which we are trying to protect the country. The first is an interference by the Minister&#x2014;I am not referring to the right hon. Gentleman but to the person who holds the office of Minister of Transport for the moment&#x2014;with charging schemes that have gone up through the process from the Commission to the tribunal and are being considered by the tribunal. If there is then an interference with the charging schemes, the whole of that work may be thrown up. Secondly, you may have the imposition of such grave obligations on the Commission that it cannot pay its way on the present charging scheme which it has got up. Then it has to go back for further charging schemes and, as the right hon. Gentleman and every hon. Member knows, there comes a point where you</p>

<p>Thirdly, we want to strengthen the hands of the Minister in the direction of freights. The right hon. Gentleman the Lord President of the Council and Leader of this House has emphasised on many an occasion that, if the public corporation is to succeed at all, it must be protected from its charges and its fares being subjected to political pressure. Now the direction of the Minister is the vehicle of political pressure, and it is in order to restrict that possibility, to keep the Transport Commission within the unsullied lines which the Lord President of the Council has laid down as desirable, that we feel we cannot let opposition to the rejection of this Amendment go, but must support the Amendment in the Division Lobby.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
This Amendment and the series of Amendments which you, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, have just indicated, transfer to the Commission the power of the Minister to appoint Executives. Hon. and right hon. Members will recall that this subject was debated at great length both in Standing Committee and on the Report stage. Here we see evidence of the acknowledgment which the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft) made in the discussion on a previous Amendment, that is, that in carrying this type of Amendment the other place was, in fact, carrying out the Conservative Opposition's attitude. The hon. Member referred to the previous Amendment as "our Amendment," indicating clearly that it represented an Opposition attitude to the Bill. In this Amendment that emerges even more clearly. The Government have considered this, and we advise the House to disagree with this Amendment. A good deal of confusion and misunderstanding has surrounded this question of the Minister appointing the Executives, and reference has been made,


in the discussions, to other appointments It is essential that we should recognise the structure, both for policy and management, which this Bill embodies&#x2014;the division of the two. In this case the Executives are not area or regional bodies; they are national and functional bodies, and the Commission, by an instrument, delegates to the Railway Executive, if I may use that as an example, the running and the conduct of the whole of the railways of this country.<br/>
Therefore, if one considers the importance of the Executives, the extent to which their functions will affect the whole community, both in their capacity as traders and as the travelling public, I cannot for a moment conceive that Parliament would not, in the larger aspects of administration, wish to be able to examine, or to put to the Minister from time to time their requests or observations or opinions on, certain aspects of the administration of these Executives. Therefore, from the point of view of Parliamentary control, there is a lot to be said for the Executives being appointed by the Minister, rather than that he should delegate that duty to the Commission. Further, in matters of this description it is far better, in the public interest, that they, should know clearly where the responsibility rests. If the Commission had the responsibility of appointing these Executives, it is inconceivable that they would proceed to do so without consultation with the Minister. If, in these consultations, there developed a divergence of opinion, at the commencement of the establishment of bodies of this character, I do not think it would make for a good ultimate result. On the other hand, if the Minister is charged with the responsibility of appointment, there is no question of the Minister riding off on the assumption that another body has appointed persons of this importance.<br/>
The next aspect of this problem to which I wish to refer is that I have noticed in another place, and in speeches by Members of Parliament, that the question of patronage has been introduced. HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I gather that that has some support. I want to deal with the question of patronage fairly and frankly. I find that usually it is raised when persons of the wage-earning or working classes are appointed to positions of importance. We are dealing with those who are going to run the

railways of this country in their capacity as a Railway Executive, and with the appointment of a limited number of persons who are to run the ports, and so on.<br/>
Since the fall of the last Government, a number of right lion Members sitting on the other side of the House have been appointed as railway directors In the ordinary way, I would not raise a matter of that kind, but is that patronage or is it not? If the Minister did a similar thing to what the existing railway boards have done, and if he appointed a person of that character, would hon. Members then allege that patronage had been applied? I have sat in this House for many years and I have witnessed many appointments by Governments. Usually they were drawn from a very limited circle in the community, and I have never heard the question of patronage raised by hon. Members opposite. It is only when some individual who, as a rule, has fought his way up against many adverse circumstances and won through by character and determination, normally over great odds, is appointed to a post of this description, that we hear this question of patronage raised. I hold the view that when we come to the executive positions in industry, commerce and administration, the personnel have been drawn from a far too limited circle in the community. During the Committee stage of this Bill I made no secret and caused no doubt about the position.<br/>
In an industry like the transport industry, where there will be over one million persons employed possessing a very wide range of experience and knowledge of their industry, I would not accept the position that those who are to run the industry should be drawn from a very limited class in the community. I think it is essential when Parliament is establishing and carrying out a great change of this kind, which springs from new ideas moving in the community, that the Minister should see that in the executive administration all walks of life and all experiences are reflected in the public administration. When a Minister makes appointments of that description, he should be prepared to have his appointments examined publicly on the Floor of the House, in the Press, or anywhere else. The Minister should accept responsibility for the appointments he has made. I have made it quite clear through all our


discussions, both here and elsewhere, that the appointment of the Commission and the Executives is primarily a job which the Minister must do. He must see that this administration starts off with a personnel capable of doing the task, the very onerous task, placed upon them, namely, to co-ordinate the whole of the transport system of this country and to run it in the interests of trade and of the community generally.<br/>
Therefore, I state that the Government have considered this issue, which has run through all the stages of this Bill, on more than one occasion. We have examined all the views that have been put forward, both in this House and in another place, and we have come to the considered decision that we intend to adhere to the position of the Minister appointing not only the Commission but the Executives. We think it is essential and, in the long run, desirable that, if we are to have criticism of that kind in our public life at this stage, the best thing is that it should not be in the form of an underground type of campaign of criticism, but that the Minister should make the appointments and should be able to stand on the Floor of the House and defend those appointments</p>

<p>I should like to deal with the points which the right hon. Gentleman has made in proposing this disagreement, in the order in which he has put them before the House. Like him, I cannot but remember that we have discussed this matter before. I think it is important that we should give a little time to it today because this is one of a number of Amendments which show how carefully the improvement of the structure proposed in the nationalisation of transport has been examined in another place. From the point of view of the right hon. Gentleman's own words on structure and policy, I put my first considerations before the House. The Executives are to be the agents of the Commission with delegated powers. Once again, I base my argument on the conception of the public corporation that has been put forward. It is essential, if such a public corporation is to have any chance of success, that it must have full powers and be able to carry on its business undertaking. That is the essence of the Socialist approach, and so far, and

within the severe limits of our general objections, that is common sense<br/>
5.30 p.m.<br/>
Our point all along has been, How can your structure succeed, how can your set-up work, if it has this sag in the middle? You have the Minister with great powers, you have the Executives carrying on the day-to-day work, and between them you have a body so hamstrung that it has not even got the power to appoint its own agents.' That is my answer to the right hon. Gentleman's point&#x2014;that we are not giving sufficient consideration to the structure and policy of this Commission. It seems a very long time ago, but I gather that it is only some seven months, since I moved the rejection of this Bill on Second Reading, when I said that one of the dangers to which we had to have regard was whether we would get on the Commission "yes-men" and sycophants. That will be a danger if we give the Commission such limited powers that, on the one side, it is subject at every turn to the directions of the Minister, and, on the other, has not even the power to appoint the agents by which it works.<br/>
There is another practical point on which the right hon. Gentleman did not touch, and, therefore, I venture once again to bring it to his attention. That is the point that we do not know when the Executives will be appointed. We know that there is a contemplated delay in appointing the Hotels Executive, and others may or may not come, but the body which will be there, and which it is planned to have from the start, is the Commission. The Commission will be working, and that seems to me an additional point for leaving it to this body, which is tackling the problem, to appoint those who are going to work under it.<br/>
I want now to deal, with equal frankness to that of the right hon. Gentleman, with the question of patronage. As he knows, I have, probably more often than anyone else, raised this point in the House and in speeches outside it, and I want to deal today with his argument and to give what I conceive to be the counter argument to it. The right hon. Gentleman has referred to those of my colleagues on these benches who have been made directors of railway companies. Those are appointments made by the companies for reasons


which seemed good to them and in the expectation that useful members of the board would be obtained, but, whatever disadvantages there may be, the right hon. Gentleman, who has been in this House longer than I have&#x2014;and I have been here for a good many years&#x2014;must agree with me that one of the points on which we have all been primed is the complete frankness with which interests have been declared in this House. It was referred to the other day when we were discussing Privilege. It does not matter whether they were railway directorships or anything else, such interests have always been disclosed with complete frankness, so that hon. Members could attach such importance to, or make such discounts from, what somebody said as they thought was right. What we are worried about in the set-up of these nationalisation schemes is the largely increased political patronage which is placed in the hands of Ministers. The right hon. Gentleman has considered this subject, and he will know that, over the centuries, and especially in the 18th century, the fact that Ministers had well-paid jobs at their disposal was used as a method of attracting votes and getting men of a certain political line. I am not making any personal reflections, but just raising the general point.<br/>
It is, I submit, putting too big a strain on the Minister, and putting too big a strain on Members of Parliament, to have in front of them as they come along, an ever-growing number of jobs which they can get from one or other of their political leaders on the Front Bench. I say that, by making a large and ever-growing number of jobs open to political patronage, we are doing a dangerous thing. The right hon. Gentleman has had some regard to that matter, and he has said "Well, the answer to that is that, although the jobs are in my hands, I am subject to Parliamentary control, and people can blame rue if they do not like it." I am trying to make a general point, and there is no personal edge in this in any way. Parliamentary control, in the last resort, however, is control by the party that has the majority in the House. The party that has the majority in the House is in this matter <i>ex hypothesi,</i> the party that is to be affected by the Ministerial appointments, and the Parliamentary control which will operate in the last resort

can be decided by the majority of those who are potential beneficiaries. That again is dangerous. I seriously put this point to the Minister, because it is a danger and a difficulty in the way not only of the working of nationalisation schemes, but in the working of the democracy which is so dear to us all.<br/>
I want only to say very few words on the other aspect of the right hon. Gentleman's remarks, namely, the category of people from whom the appointments are made. I am sure that I speak for everyone of my colleagues on these benches when I say that the background or the past of the appointees does not matter at all to me or to anyone who co-operates with me in this matter. We are only too anxious that if they have had the requisite experience, they shall come from whatever section of the community will provide that experience, and the right hon. Gentleman may take that as being a firm view, but here we are dealing&#x2014;and the right hon. Gentleman will realise it&#x2014;with highly-paid jobs, and it is a case of the first consideration which I have endeavoured to develop, that of the political background. We consider that there is a danger in its application, and not from the other point of view. Therefore, from the point of view of the set-up and its workability, from the point of view of making it work in time, and from the point of view of avoiding this patronage, in which we see some dangers, we believe that the Commission is the proper body to make these appointments, and I shall advise my hon. and right hon. Friends to vote in that sense.</p>

<p>The Minister, in suggesting that this Amendment should be rejected by the House, dealt particularly with three aspects. The first was responsibility to Parliament in the appointments, the second was patronage, and the third the selection of personnel. But there is another aspect connected with this Amendment, and I think win other Amendments, and that is the commercial aspect. We are now approaching tremendous economic difficulties. We are being exhorted by Members of the Government, and by all people of good will to do everything possible to increase production. Production is completely interlocked with transport. In this question of the appointment of the Executive, the commercial aspect must be taken into


consideration. I cannot conceive that the Commission, which will be selected from the ablest men that the Minister can induce to accept appointment, will thank him for taking on the job of appointing the Executive. After all, it is not the kind of thing that would be done in a commercial concern. If the board of directors of a commercial concern was responsible for the operation of branches throughout the country, that board would not thank some ordinary shareholder who had a controlling interest in the company for making the appointments of branch managers.<br/>
In Committee upstairs&#x2014;I do not know whether I am in Order in referring to what happened there&#x2014;it was said, over and over again, that the Bill having been given a Second Reading, it was the duty of everyone concerned to make it work properly. Amendment after Amendment was introduced for the purpose of making the. Bill work properly. The Minister has an immense responsibility to make transport in this country efficient and successful. If we go back over the history of the Bill since it was first introduced, and consider the various Amendments to it, it will be found that they have been very helpful. Personally, I deplore and deprecate the feeling that seems to have arisen that these Amendments from another place are in the nature of obstruction, and that they should. <i>ipso facto.</i> be rejected. I know that these things were argued out in Committee, but we have had more time since then to consider many of the Clauses and others which were not debated there at all. I think that, from a commercial point of view, as well as from many other points of view, this is a good Amendment, and I propose to support it.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman urged the House to reject this Amendment on three grounds. The first was that it had come down from another place, and that, therefore, it was an obstructionist Conservative Amendment and, <i>ipso facto,</i> should be rejected. The second reason he gave was that the possibility of patronage had already been considered. He then referred to some of my hon. Friends who may or may not have been directors of railway companies, and virtually said that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. His

third reason was that he, himself, would be personally responsible for the appointments. I suggest that every one of those reasons is bad. He said that the matter had been argued at very great length on every stage of the Bill, and that he and Parliament had taken careful note of what had been said about it. I should have thought that he would have put forward a better argument than he has done for the rejection of this Amendment.<br/>
It is quite obvious that there is no substance in the argument that the Amendment ought to be rejected. What most concerns me is how is this really going to work. Is the Minister going to say to the Commission, "I am going to make you responsible for this enormous task"&#x2014;and no one can lay down a complete blueprint of how the Commission will work&#x2014;"but I do not consider that you are capable of choosing the Executives who are to put your policy into practice"? How can the right hon. Gentleman have so little confidence in his choice of people that he should believe that they will not choose the right people to put their policy into effect? He says that he must be responsible to this House for the appointment of the Executive. He is responsible for the Commission, and, therefore, is responsible for all their actions. But why does he limit his responsibility to appointing the Executive? Why does he not say that he is going to appoint everyone, all the way down?<br/>
5.45 P.m.<br/>
The reason why we have fought for this Amendment throughout the whole proceedings of this Bill is because experience has shown that, where there is divided responsibility at the top, the thing must automatically fail. That has happened over and over again in every walk of life. It happened in Government departments during the war, in the Services, and in business. To any of us who have had the least experience of these things that is the one salient feature. We are starting this vast organisation&#x2014;far greater than anything hitherto&#x2014;with no idea of how it is going to work. This Bill is really the broad outline of what the Commission is going to do, and yet the first thing we do is to put divided responsibility at the top. It is absolutely indefensible. If I needed any further proof that it was indefensible, I would listen to the ridiculous argument put for-


ward by the right hon. Gentleman for the rejection of this Amendment. I hope that, even at this last stage, the Government will reconsider the matter. I shall vote against it again unless they are able to do that.</p>

<p>I listened with great interest to the opening remarks of the Minister as to why this Amendment should be rejected. It seemed to me that he was less logical than usual, and certainly less clear headed. He spoke about patronage as though it were something new, and objected to it as such. The fact is that patronage is inescapable with any Government. After all, the Government Chief Whip is officially the Patronage Secretary, and what we on this side of the House have objected to, with growing anxiety, is the unchecked development of that patronage beyond all possibility of control until it creates and spreads corruption.</p>

<p>With respect, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, you were not in the Chamber when the Minister spoke on this Amendment. He criticised the attitude of hon. Members on this side of the House because we said that patronage was a bad thing, and he accused us, as a party, of blaming the Government only when it appointed a wage-earner to a job, whereas, he said, had it been some mysterious member of the upper classes, we would, for some reason, not object to it. The point was very strongly made by the Minister, and I do submit to you, Sir, that I am not out of Order in dealing with it.</p>

<p>I think it is only right to point out that the Minister devoted pretty well two-thirds of his speech to the question of patronage, a question which, I understand, has been raised and debated at length in another place.

<p>I shall endeavour not to go beyond your Ruling, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. At the same time, I must say this about patronage, because the subject was brought up before us, and I think we must discuss it. What we are doing here is to try to protect the Minister. [<i>Laughter.</i>] We are becoming very accustomed in this House, every time a serious point is made, to hear this cackling laughter from the other side. A famous dramatic critic once described the laughter of a certain comedian as being like the falling of February sleet upon the roof of an empty coffin. That is what the laughter of hon. Members opposite is like. The development of patronage will be carried another stage further, unless this Amendment is accepted. It does not involve the personal honour of the Minister, because none of us doubts his honesty; but it is the approaches to him which become fouled&#x2014;those who advise him, right down the line. If the Socialist Party think they will escape the inevitable corollary of this increasing patronage, they are wrong, and sometimes I begin to wonder if the Government want to escape it, and whether they have got these unlimited perquisites to hand out.<br/>
I would have liked to discuss the appointment of the Governor of the B.B.C., but I think that might be a little "off the line." I wish to ask this question of the Parliamentary Secretary, in the absence of his chief. Nowadays we do not expect Ministers to speak with the same voice. They are a very discordant choir. The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he would not appoint to the Electricity Board any man who said he did not believe in nationalisation. May we ask whether the Minister of Transport is going to take that same attitude? If a capable man in the transport business honestly opposes this Bill, is he now to be excluded from these new appointments, or is his ability to count? We have a right to know where we are, and


whether Tammany Hall is being established here or not. This growing patronage is a very great menace to the country and to its future. We have a right to know whether it is the Minister of Fuel and Power or the Minister of Transport who speaks for the Government, and we want an answer. The other House has done good service, and we in this House should be very grateful for the wise counsel they have given. They have brought to this subject vast experience and impartiality. For that reason, I hope this House will reject the Minister's advice and will accept this Amendment as the first check which the Government will ever have made to the growing and inevitable corruption.</p>

<p>My objection to the Minister's attitude to this Amendment arises from the tendency of His Majesty's Government to concentrate power in the hands of Ministers, in the whole of the legislation which they are now promoting. I rise particularly to say to the Minister that I think his suggestion that the administration of the railways by past railway directors has not been on as high a level as the administration in any other part of the world, should not have been expressed. I served on both the Committees of this House in 1921, and we all know the men who were railway directors then. Think of the contributions they made to the problems concerning the railways at that time. Think of the contribution which Lord Banbury made. He was, perhaps, rather a peculiar character in this House, but he was also a very competent authority on railway administration. Think of the contribution made by Lord Horne. These gentlemen were directors of railways in this country, and they administered the railways on the very highest level. Think of what the late Lord Stamp did for railway administration.</p>

<p>He was a very efficient man, and he did a first-class job. Unfortunately, he was killed during the

raids on this city. In spite of the good intentions of the Government Front Bench, political influence will play a big part in these appointments if this Amendment is rejected. The Parliamentary Secretary will receive letters from his constituents saying that Mr. Smith or Mr. Jones is a fit and proper person to serve on the Executive. All the Members of the Front Bench will be subjected to the same kind of attack from their constituents; and if this Amendment is rejected, applicants for these appointments will, no doubt, receive favourable consideration from the Minister when this Bill becomes law, provided they have strong Socialist convictions. It is a very strange situation that the Minister, in spite of the consideration extended to him in Standing Committee upstairs, has arrogated to himself the power to appoint the members of the Executive to carry out the management of the railways. No doubt hon. Members opposite will go into the Lobby in support of their Front Bench, no matter what happens. No matter how much wisdom or what authority we may quote, or how much we may plead for the exercise of sound judgment, they will still support their Front Bench.</p>

<p>The speeches made on both sides have dealt with two particular questions. One is whether this Amendment is right or resistance to it is right, having regard to the structure of the Bill. The other question is the question of patronage. These two questions are related to this extent. If we find that the Government's proposal is entirely bad, having regard to the structure of the Bill, that will very much strengthen our suspicion that the object of the bad pro-


vision is patronage. Let me deal straight away with the question of the structure of the Bill. Here let me remind the House that, while my party has taken this line on the appointment of the executives from the beginning, critics of the Government's proposal are by no means confined to the Conservative Party on this issue. On this particular issue of the structure of the Bill an intelligent Socialist is as much entitled to object to the Government's proposal as a good Conservative.<br/>
Let us deal with one of the things that the right hon. Gentleman the Minister quite rightly said was important, namely, the responsibility. Let us consider the question of the responsibility of the Commission. How on earth can the Commission be held responsible if it is not even entitled to choose its own servants and agents? Whatever else the effect of the Government's proposal is, it must be to diminish and to make vain any idea of the responsibility of the Commission. Let me remind the House of the relevant phrases in the Bill itself. If hon. Members will look at Clause 3 (4) they will find that:
<q>Each Executive shall, as agents for the Commission, exercise their functions, etc.</q>
If it had been said that these Executives were to be agents of the Minister, then, of course, the Minister would be quite right to appoint them. What is so utterly wrong in the structure is for the Minister to appoint them and then to say they are not his agents but those of somebody else. If hon. and right hon. Gentlemen will look at Clause 5 (6) they will see the words:
<q>Every Executive shall, in the exercise of their functions, give effect to any directions which may from time to time be given to them by the Commission.</q>
Throughout the structure of the Bill they are made the servants and agents of the Commission and not of the Minister. For the Minister, in the circumstances, to take upon himself their appointment can have one main effect only, which is to diminish the responsibility and the effectiveness of the Commission. Now that is not good sense. It is not even good Socialism. If the Government are going to nationalise an industry at all and set up a statutory body for that purpose, and if they are good Socialists, they want to make that statutory body a good and effective body.

That is not done by the structure of the Bill as it stands.<br/>
Let me pass to the question of patronage. The right hon. Gentleman said, "What about the case of an ex-Minister or a former politician, either inside or outside this House, being appointed to a railway board?" Let me say at once that any such appointment, it seems to me, may be good or may be bad: it depends on the circumstances. But the responsibility of the board is to its shareholders, and those appointments can be called in question. Whether it is good or bad, there is no doubt at all as to the effect of the appointment. The patronage here in question is a patronage about which the House of Commons is always right to concern itself. These enormous powers of patronage in the hands of the executive Government constitute a matter which is rightly of concern to the House and to lovers of our constitutional machinery in whatever quarter of the House they may sit. The power of the Executive through patronage is a matter of great importance which had, in the past, legislative and other checks, and- in which this House has always been rightly concerned.<br/>
At this part of the right hon. Gentleman's case he made it quite clear that what he desired was patronage. That was why he welcomed this Clause. That was why he was so loudly cheered in getting up to move disagreement with the Lords Amendment before he had even addressed a word to the House. It is frankly welcomed on the benches opposite, not in spite of making patronage possible, but precisely because it makes it possible. [<i>Interruption.</i>] These words and cries, whether they are in some cases of assent or in some cases of misunderstanding of what is taking place in the House, very much confirm the view I have just expressed. There is no doubt that these powers of patronage which the Government are taking by this provision, as I have pointed out, are entirely wrong even on the principles of good Socialism. These powers the Government are taking are welcomed precisely because they make patronage possible. One of the things that I wonder is this: whether the Government not only say, "We shall not accept this Amendment," but have already put it out of their own power to accept this Amendment by the promises


they have already made for filling these positions. It is, I think daily the expectation of reward, the expectation of reward for political&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am not going to give way for the moment. If the right hon. Gentleman thinks, when I have finished my reply, that I have evaded him I shall give' way again. Secondly, I say that the fact that this is utterly wrong from the point of view of the structure of the Bill strengthens my own suspicion that its object is to secure what it undoubtedly does secure&#x2014;the increased power of patronage.

rumour&#x2014;with which I have acquainted the House, and which I certainly believed to have some foundation; the right hon.

<p>On nationalisation Bills, and particularly with this one, it is of the utmost importance that the House shall watch what opportunities are being given of patronage by the Executive, particularly when these opportunities are wholly unnecessary and can be avoided by an Amendment which positively improves the structure of the Bill. That criticism has been made, not only by

Conservatives, but by commentators on this Bill from the time it was introduced, and in papers so divergent as the "Manchester Guardian" and the "Economist." There is no doubt whatever that the structure of this Bill will be improved by accepting this Amendment, which will also have the effect of diminishing the Government's opportunity of patronage. On both these grounds I commend the Amendment, which has been made in another place, to the good sense of the House.</p>

<p>The Minister pointed in the general direction of this side of the House, inferring that the Conservative Party had had the right in the past&#x2014;goodness knows where they got it from&#x2014;to appoint railway directors. That is certainly an argument which none of my hon. Friends has been able to discover before; it is the most wonderful invention of the Minister. I will not ask the Minister to withdraw it. If he likes to make that sort of point, the intelligent public can give it the weight it deserves. If the railway directorships in the past were given to Conservative Members because they were Conservative Members, then I think that it is a thoroughly disreputable thing, and so do most of my hon. Friends. If that had been the case in the past, the right hon. Gentleman and I would have joined hands in condemning it, and I have no doubt that hon. Members opposite know that I am speaking the truth. The point is that there happened to be many Conservative


Members of Parliament who were in business before they came into the House. If they had been appointed to railway boards on the grounds that they were competent administrators that is not my affair, because they were appointed on their merits.<br/>
If the Minister will appoint members of the executives purely on their merits, then there will not be a great deal of complaint in any part of the House. The Minister implied that the provisions of this Bill were to make it possible to put working men on the Executives. I beg leave to doubt whether any single working man will be put on one of these Executives. Do right hon. Gentlemen on the opposite Front Bench think that they are working men? Some, but very few, may have been working men 20 or 30 years ago.</p>

<p>I apologise to you, Sir, and to the hon. Member for that digression. What we on this side of the House are trying to do is to prevent the worst features of political patronage becoming a reality. The Minister is an honest man, but we cannot guarantee that future Ministers of Transport, of any party&#x2014;I

want to be perfectly fair in this matter&#x2014;will be as honest and straightforward as the right hon. Gentleman. We know that there are far too many men with political ambitions to give <i>carte blanche</i> to all future Ministers of Transport. There can be no doubt that resistance to this Amendment will put power into the hands of all future Ministers of Transport to distribute political patronage far and wide. It is on those grounds that my right hon. and hon. Friends and I will oppose the Government on this issue.</p>

<p>The Minister and the party opposite seem to be nervous of this Amendment, and I think they have good reason to be. There arise the questions: How far will there be incompetence through red tape, and how far will there be incentive towards corruption and graft? Taking the former question first I am surprised that we have not had a speech from the Government side in support of this Amendment. In the past, I have heard the hon. Member for East Middlesbrough (Mr. A. Edwards) speak on this very point of the danger of incompetence through red tape. He has said that there must not be over-centralisation in nationalisation proposals, that a certain amount of freedom must be given to a Commission. This Amendment raises that very point. Here, the Government are to appoint to the Commission men who
<q>have shown capacity in transport, industrial, commercial, or financial matters, or in administration or in the organisation of workers.</q>
Those men, I should have thought, could be trusted to choose the Executives. The Government have done that under the Civil Aviation Act. There they appointed three corporations, and gave them the job of choosing the Executives. The Hotel Executive was chosen, not by the Minister of Civil Aviation, but by the corporation. Now the Government are doing something entirely different which, I believe, the Labour Party will rue afterwards.<br/>
The Minister, in opposing this Amendment, asked whether it would make for a good ultimate result if there was divergence of opinion. The man the Commission chose might be a man who was disagreeable to the Minister. Why should the Minister impose on the Commission a man who is not fit for the job?


If he does not intend to do this, there is no point in the right hon. Gentleman trying to reject this Amendment. I cannot see that transport in this country will be run competently if, at any time, the Minister can appoint to the Executive a man who has not the confidence of the Commission. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for the Combined English Universities (Mr. H. Strauss) pointed out that the Executives were the agents of the Commission. In that case, the Commission should be entitled to choose their own agents. I am an opponent of the Government in this business of the nationalisation of transport, but I feel strongly that if we are to have nationalisation we must make it work efficiently. It will not be efficient if it is bound up with red tape. It is a facile but dangerous argument for the Minister to say, "It is all right. Parliament will be able to 'vet' everything we do." If the Government continue to prosecute their present programme this House will be cluttered up with Questions, which will make the work of the Transport Commission unwieldy.<br/>
A great deal has been said about patronage. This country, since the time of Lord Liverpool, has had a great reputation for honesty in public life, and for absence of inducements towards graft. I am afraid that these nationalisation Measures are being regarded in the country as giving opportunities for graft. The rumours that go about, which Ministers have to contradict, show that danger. The wisest way of dealing with this problem is to remove the opportunity for those rumours. In other countries, there are jobs that are given by the parties in power&#x2014;</p>

<p>I have lately been in a country where the allocation of the oil ration was handed out to the Communist Party. I am sorry that the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) has left the Chamber. That went on for about six months until there was such an uproar that all the Communist Ministers were dismissed from the Government. That happened two months ago, in South America. That is the kind of thing which everybody wants to avoid happening in this country. At present, there is general dissatisfaction here with the way things are run. People believe

that there is too much red tape, and there are rumours of blackmail and corruption. I hope that the House will not disagree with this Amendment.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I did not hear the whole of this Debate, but I was at a Cabinet meeting. On the point of the merit of the Amendment to which the hon. Gentleman has just referred, I would put the following considerations to the House. These Executives are to be bodies of very great importance. They are not merely departmental bodies within the transport organisation of a domestic character. The Railway Executive will be in the executive sense responsible. I agree, under the Transport Commission, for running the whole of the railway system of this country. The Road Transport Executive will be similarly responsible for the whole of the road transport system, and so on. I think that in these cases where there are bodies which are running great undertakings as distinct elements of the British transport' system, nevertheless being coordinated by the British Transport Commission, it would be wrong from the Parliamentary point of view if there was no Ministerial accountancy for the appointment of these important executives.<br/>
I think that the House would not be much older before it complained if the Minister said, "I have no responsibility for the appointment of these Executives," and the House would complain if he said he had no responsibility for their salaries or conditions of service. In these cases, where they are, from time to time, discharging big functions and running vast economic units, it is right that there should be Parliamentary responsibility for the appointment of these executive bodies. It is proposed, and the Bill provides, that the Minister appoints the Executives after consultation with the British Transport Commission; therefore, the Commission will have a good opportunity of discussing with the Minister the appointments that are to be made. Personally, I think, as does my right hon. Friend, that that is the happiest way out of this problem, having regard to the very important nature of these bodies.<br/>
I would remind hon. Members opposite that they have repeatedly pursued my right hon. Friend the Minister of Fuel and Power with regard to the appoint-


ment of the divisional boards under the Coal Industry Act. They have complained most vigorously&#x2014;we had a discussion on the Adjournment only last week&#x2014;that the Minister has refused to accept responsibility for the appointments of the divisional boards or to give the House information as to their salaries and conditions of service. The reason he does not do so is that in the case of the Coal Industry Act, the same provision was made in respect of the divisional boards&#x2014;not quite the same&#x2014;nevertheless, the provision was made or implied that the appointment of the divisional boards under the National Coal Board was the responsibility of the National Coal Board.<br/>
I really think that the Opposition ought to make up their minds. If they accept the view that within the Coal Board the appointment of boards for its geographical organisation, much less important than the appointment of these bodies, which are really conducting vast industries within the wider industry&#x2014;if they accept the view that the divisional coal boards should be the responsibility of appointment by the National Coal Board, they ought not to follow that up by Parliamentary questions and agitations wanting to know why the Minister of Fuel and Power will not give the House information or, in fact, take responsibility for the appointment of the divisional boards.<br/>
On this occasion, they are taking the line that the Minister should not appoint. Do they appreciate that if the Minister is not responsible, it will be utterly useless to come along hereafter and question my right hon. Friend as to why he has appointed Mr. So-and-so to an executive? It will be quite impossible. The question of their salaries would, I submit, be ruled out of Order on the ground that the Minister has not the responsibility. The fact is that the Opposition have got themselves into a thorough muddle as to their point of view and philosophy on this matter. They must make up their minds whether they want Parliamentary responsibility or whether they do not. I admit that all these things are a matter of fair argument &#x2014;I do not complain that there should be argument. We thought in the case of the Coal Board that as these were domestic geographical units within the Coal Board organisation, it was right that they should be a domestic matter for the Coal Board itself. We equally thought in the case of

these Executives which have very big direct executive powers, in one case over the whole of the railway field, and in another case over the whole of the road transport field&#x2014;we thought it was right that the Minister should be in a position of taking responsibility for the appointment, and that this House should have the right to shoot at the Minister for the appointments which he made to these executives. I think that the Opposition ought to make up their minds as to what they want.<br/>
6.45 P.m.<br/>
I am told that the hon. and learned Member for the English Universities (Mr. H. Strauss) made an allegation which I am a little surprised should come from a university Member of this House; but we live and learn about university Members as we go along. I understand that he made an allegation that my right hon. Friend was not free to accept this Amendment because he had already committed himself to certain appointments. That followed on a rather low-down speech, if I may say so, that was made in the country by the right hon. Member for Bromley (Mr. H. Macmillan) in which allegations of corruption and jobbery were made against this Government. I do not feel that I need to stand up to defend the Labour Party about jobbery and corruption. Our record is open&#x2014;it is public&#x2014;and I am prepared to defend it and my own.</p>

<p>The hon. and gallant Gentleman says that I am out of Order. I thought that Mr. Speaker was in the Chair, but I will be careful in view of the hon. and gallant Gentleman's great knowledge of procedure. I do not want to argue back and to say that the Conservative Party has been guilty of irregularities in public appointments. I dare say that I could make something like a case if I wanted to. But it is not going to help to hurl these cases across the House, nor will it help the hon. and learned Member for the English Universities if he makes a serious allegation of that kind against my right hon. Friend. I have known my right hon. Friend for a great many years and, with great respect, I do not believe that he is the kind of man who has engaged in or ever will


engage in irregular practices. If the hon. and learned Gentleman says it, he ought to prove it. He should produce some evidence, or he should withdraw it, one of the two.

<p>I understand so. That was what I was told. What was the point of mentioning it? The fact is&#x2014;and


I can assure the House that this comes from my own knowledge&#x2014;my right hon. Friend has not approached or sounded anybody for any of these appointments. If he had done so, and if he had made provision for appointments as was done in the case of coal or of the organising committee in the case of electricity, his right course would be to tell the House. He has not done so. I can assure the hon. and learned Gentleman and the House that he has made no such provision at all, and, therefore, in those circumstances I say again that if these allegations, which come particularly ill from the so-called gentlemanly party, are made, if these smear tactics are to he indulged in, and if this mud-slinging is to be gone in for, then I say to hon.

<p>I am ready to accept your Ruling, Sir. I was en-deavouring to introduce a soothing note into the Debate. I think a great deal of heat has been generated about very little. It did not seem to me that the suggestion that Lord Latham was going to be invited to be a member of the executive&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] &#x2014;that he had been invited by the Minister to act on the executive should have been treated as a charge of gross indecency. The broad charge on patronage, if I might put it to the Lord President, was raised not by this side of the House at all, but by the right hon. Gentleman the Minister of Transport, who devoted two-thirds of his opening speech to this question of patronage and the allegations about manipulations with regard to railway directors and the Conservative Party. That was why the matter was raised in the form that it was. I mention it only because the Lord President was not in the House, and I think he should know the way the discussion generally developed. The main point about the question of patronage was largely this: without making an allegation against the Minister of Transport, the Government or anybody else, if we go on in Act after Act putting more and more jobs at the disposal of the people who are the political leaders of the country today, it makes for a bad system. All history has shown it to be so.<br/>
If I may leave this, following your advice, Mr. Speaker, not to generate any more heat than is necessary, may I say one word on the merits of this Amendment, because merits have been neglected in this discussion. I am not sure that the Minister, in devoting two-thirds of his speech to the question of patronage, did not hope that the merits would be somewhat neglected; but the merits are important. They have nothing to do with the principle of whether transport is nationalised or not. It is simply a question of efficiency. Therefore, I take the case which the Lord President has put forward. He said that these are very big Executives; but what has that got to do with it? The point is that somebody


is responsible for the policy of the Commission, and the Minister is responsible for laying down the main points, just as a board of directors of a company are responsible for laying down the broad policy of the company. Surely, in those circumstances the Commission who are responsible for laying down policy should have the power to appoint the executives. What board of directors of any company, however vast, could ever tolerate the managers of the departments &#x2014;however big those departments&#x2014;being appointed by someone else? It seemed to me that the Lord President's point about the size of the executives was utterly irrelevant.<br/>
7.0 p.m.<br/>
Then the right hon. Gentleman comes along and says, "Well, supposing the Commission do in fact appoint these Executives; then the House of Commons cannot ask about them." The right hon. Gentleman says this, but personally I have never quite understood why, and I think that it is a very nice point. Whether the Executives are appointed by the Commission of the Minister, I really cannot understand why the Minister should not disclose the details of the appointments and salaries, not of the smaller people, but of the main officials. That would be a fair, courteous and sensible way of dealing with the House. It does not appear to me that the question and answer is dependent upon this particular decision.<br/>
Why does the Minister want this power? He said that he wanted to see</p>

<p>men of all classes appointed to the Executives, and I am sure that everybody would like to see that, but why should not the Commission appoint to those bodies men from all walks of life: Surely, the test of whether a man is suit able for the Executives is whether he knows about transport, and not whether he went to Eton or somewhere else: [<i>Interruption.</i>] My remark was inspired by the sight of an old Etonian on the benches opposite. As I say, it is question of whether a person knows about transport. The Minister appoints this Commission, and surely the Commission itself is as good a judge as he is? The worst solution of all, which is thaadopted by the Government, is not really to make up their minds who is responsible, but to have someone doing some thing after consultation with someone else so that no one will, in fact, be responsible for the appointments.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
The Amendment proposes to introduce an entirely new type of board into the Bill, and for that reason we disagree with it. I would recall that so far, we have established the British Transport Commission and a series of functional executives to conduct the operations of the railways, ports, hotels, and 1 catering. If the Amend-

ment were adopted, we should be creating a new type of body. In no way have their Lordships attempted to define the duties which the proposed Scottish Transport Executive would have to perform. I would briefly indicate what the present position is and how the Amendment would work out. I think hon. Members will sec the anomalies that would develop if the. Amendment were accepted.<br/>
The existing railway organisation in Scotland will be merged into one railway system, and the management side will be unified and strengthened. From the point of view of being able to function in the executive and management way, the requirements and railway needs of Scotland are bound to be better served. On the road passenger side, when the area schemes are developed, it is inevitable that there will be two, three, four or more road passenger transport organisations developed. The bodies that will be appointed to administer those area transport schemes will be drawn from bodies representative of the locality and will be


largely responsible for the operation of the schemes, in consultation, conforming to the co-ordination policy of the executive at the national end. The Commission are under the obligation to consult local opinion fully, and it is only when a large measure of agreement is eventually achieved that the Minister can approve the scheme. If at any time there is a divergence of opinion, the matter must be submitted to Parliament, and it becomes subject to the special Parliamentary procedure.<br/>
During the Debate on the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive, I explained that there was nothing in the Bill to prevent the Commission and the ports executive, if they represented opinion on the Clyde, from accepting and putting into force a scheme similar to that reported upon by the Cooper Committee. Therefore, on the road passenger side, and on the ports and harbours side, it is clear that the type of organisation which will administer these schemes locally in Scotland will be essentially Scottish in character The Scottish Transport Executive proposed in the Amendment would have to have formulated for it a transport executive for Scotland, and would have to cut through the whole of that executive machinery. So, in fact, unless it dealt with railways alone, if it absorbed the functions of the other executives it would become a Scottish transport authority. I do not know what kind of function or responsibility, financial or otherwise, such a body would exercise within the provisions of the Bill.<br/>
In the Amendment which comes from the Lords we are, therefore, confronted with a completely anomalous situation. I am satisfied that with the Scottish Consultative Committee which the Bill establishes, and with the machinery provided for area transport and port schemes, the legitimate desire of Scottish opinion to manage, as far as possible, their own affairs is attended to, without completely destroying the economy, co-ordination, and integration which the Bill establishes. The Bill meets legitimate Scottish aspirations.<br/>
Further, I am satisfied that I am serving Scottish national interests by adhering to the existing structure of the Bill, because if, by any chance, Scottish transport in all its aspects is cut off cleanly

from British transport as a whole, it meets many difficult circumstances which are peculiar to Scotland and represent heavy financial obligations upon any transport system. Therefore, from the angle of the economic interests of Scotland, there is everything to be said for it being integrated in the British transport system and for capital control and receipts passing into a common pool so that the peculiar physical handicaps which affect many parts of Scotland can be taken in its stride. Hon. Members who were on the Standing Committee will recollect that Members representing Scottish constituencies pressed very strongly the peculiar and urgent needs, particularly of the Highlands and the Western Isles. Although I was not able to meet their requests in the Standing Committee in regard to certain shipping services, on another occasion in this House quite recently a further step was taken in that direction, and I gave a general undertaking that I hoped that when the position was established, these peculiar problems would, for the first time, receive special and sympathetic study in a way possibly to enable them to be met in the future in a form which has never been possible in the past because transport has been broken up into so many pieces.<br/>
I have taken a little time in explaining the situation on this Amendment, not because I consider this Amendment, of itself, of any definite value to the Bill, but because it is essential that the relationship of these problems in Scotland to the British transport system as a whole should be thoroughly appreciated so that we can dispel any attempt to exploit on false sentimental or nationalistic grounds a proposal which, on the face of it, might appear to be giving Scotland an advantage but which is anomalous in the structure of the Bill and in its ultimate result. If the Government had accepted this Amendment and then attempted to clothe the Amendment with the necessary powers to make it work, I am confident that we would have injured Scottish national interests rather than advanced them.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman said that he did not consider this Amendment was a very valuable one in itself. I would start by pointing out that it was designed not to wreck the Bill, but to make the scheme workable


in Scotland. There is a very remarkable circumstance in connection with this Amendment. If the record of what has gone on in Scotland is of any value, this is not and cannot be a party matter. Let me quote to the House what one or two Scottish bodies have said about this, bodies which are in no way identified with any political party. I refer, first, to the Scottish Council for Trade and Industry, which consists of members owning allegiance to every political party. This is what they say:
<q>The Council feel very strongly, however, that if firm provision is not made beforehand for a system of control in Scotland which will be satisfactory in practice, there is no guarantee that a satisfactory system will in fact be provided. The Council, therefore, urge the Government to insure by direction beforehand, either by the insertion of a suitable Clause in the Bill that &#x2026; that provision must be met by the Transport Commission for the fullest possible delegation of effective administrative authority to offices in Scotland.&#x2026;</q>
&#x2014;and so on. Then we have the opinion of the Scottish T.U.C. In moving the rejection of this Amendment, the Minister said that he was satisfied with the Consultative Committee in terms of Scotland's interest being well and truly served. That is not at all what the Scottish T.U.C. thinks of the Consultative Committee.</p>

<p>This is what it says:

That is what the General Council of the Scottish T.U.C. says about it. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman knows very much better what they meant, but that is what they said.</p>

<p>The third non-party source which I would quote is the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, whose opinion is as follows:
<q>The General Assembly, seriously considering the possible invasion of human rights and local independence by large-scale collectivism, and noting the continued disregard of Scottish sentiment and the claims of Scotland as a nation in many matters which vitally affect the prosperity of the Scottish people, declare their conviction that schemes of

nationalisation must be accompanied by a large measure of devolution and decentralisation if the achievements of a genuine democracy is not to be frustrated.</q>
There are three opinions, all of them given by bodies composed of men belonging to all political parties, completely ignored by the Government. If this Amendment is not accepted, the Government will merely be fomenting Scottish Nationalism. There is no one who would regret that fomentation more than I. In its concept it is wrong, and inimical both to the interests of Scotland and of the United Kingdom, but this is just the way in which that kind of undesirable trend will be encouraged. The Government would have a precedent if they allowed the formation of a Scottish Executive. They would find it in the Transport Bill which the Labour Government brought in in 1930. That Bill treated Scotland as a separate region for the purpose of the Bill, and I cannot see why this Government could not do the same thing.<br/>
7.30 p.m.<br/>
I quoted at the beginning of my speech three non-party sources in favour of the setting up of a Scottish Executive, and in that connection I would quote two admittedly biased sources, both distinguished Members ef the Labour Party, in favour of this kind of decentralisation. First that distinguished Scottish Socialist, Mr. Thomas Johnston, considered the statutory creation of a Scottish Board in land transport essential
<q>it the social and administrative services of the country are to be run with efficiency and with a minimum of frustration and annoyance to the North.</q></p>

<p>That was from the "Sunday Times." [An HON. MEMBER: "A Tory paper."] Whether it is a Socialist or Tory paper&#x2014;and whether I his is in Order or not&#x2014;Mr. Johnston is surely recognised by hon. Members opposite as a distinguished and loyal Member of the Labour Party. The final authority I wish to quote from the Socialist ranks is the right hon. Gentleman the Lord President of the Council who, in his speech winding up the Second Reading Debate, made the following two observations:
<q>I believe fervently that, in regard to the detailed management of an undertaking in its


day-to-day activities, the Minister had be out of it&#x2014;</q>
and he added rather unkindly:
<q>and Members of Parliament had better be out of it as well.</q>
He then said:
<q>In the administrative scheme, it is the intention of the Government to prevent over-centralisation. There will be the maximum practical amount of devolution.&#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFICIAL REPORT, 18th December, 1946; Vol. 431, cc. 2082 and 2083.]</q>
Neither of those suggestions is being followed by the Government in their refusal to set up a Scottish Board, and I would utter a friendly but firm warning to the Minister that, if he continues to neglect non-party Scottish opinion, and the desires of the Scottish people generally in this matter, he may well have the distinction of starting a legend which will tell the story of Alfred who burnt, not the cakes, but his fingers.</p>

<p>The argument,we have been hearing from the noble Lord the Member for Midlothian and Peebles, Northern (Lord John Hope) mentioned the Scottish National Party, Mr. Tom Johnston, the Church of Scotland Assembly, the Scottish Council of Trade and Industry, and the T.U.C. the most bizarre coalition of which I have ever heard. As for the Church of Scotland Assembly, even that draws a subsidy from the British Exchequer in order to continue as the Church of Scotland&#x2014;but I will not pursue that point, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. There is nothing Scotland wants more than what this Bill is trying to provide in this Clause. We have suffered from the lack of what this Bill will provide, a decent co-ordinated system of transport in Scotland; and nowhere more than in the North of Scotland where, under this Bill, we hope to see the progress we have never had under the existing system&#x2014;I would call it chaos, rather than system. The noble Lord said we must not pander to the Scottish Nationalists on this issue. He said they were wrong, and then went on to argue that we should give them all they ask and so create more Scottish Nationalists.</p>

<p>The noble Lord brought in all the arguments the Scottish Nationalists use. They certainly are not wrong over everything, but in this Amendment as it is framed they are wrong. We have a Bill here which implies throughout that Scotland will have the same financial consideration as England and will have an adequate transport system which has not existed before under private enterprise or any other system. Indeed, it is by State subsidies we have provided a shipping company, in the West Highlands and Islands. We have even with the subsidy an inadequate transport system, and everything has pointed to the need for taking it over completely and running it properly as a service for the people and industry. To provide such service ultimately is what this Bill is trying to do, and in trying to destroy the Bill hon. Members opposite are depriving Scotland of it. I do not suggest for a moment that is their intention, but that will be the effect; it will deprive Scotland of the hope of getting what it has never had before, a properly integrated system of transport. The noble Lord said he would not wreck the Bill, but he would do much more than that&#x2014;he would rob Scotland of a decent transport system; and it is no use dragging in the Scottish T.U.C.&#x2014;</p>

<p>Of course, if it was heartfelt, as it now seems to be, and also spontaneous. I make no apology for delaying the House on this question, because, although the Minister gave the impression that this had been closely considered in another stage of the Bill, in fact that was not so. Owing, perhaps, to my unfamiliarity with the complicated technique aid machinery, Amendments down in my name and in the names of hon. Friends in this direction were in fact never called, and we thought that our opportunity of speaking to this matter had gone. I draw the attention of the hon Member for the Western Isles to the fact that this is not in support of Scottish Nationalism, but for the very purpose of

providing an antidote. We never had an opportunity of dealing with this mater until out of the treadmill at length has come this Amendment. I ask the House to disagree with the Government in disagreeing with the Lords Amendment, and in fact to support the Amendment. We in Scotland consider this Amendment desirable and helpful. My hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian and Peebles (Lord John Hope) has already mentioned bodies which supported this course, and hon. Members opposite threw scorn on the quotations. But I would like to know from them what more suitable examples they would like given. He mentioned the Scottish Council for Industry, which advocated something very like what the Amendment proposes. The Scottish Council for Industry is made up of industrialists and trade union representatives. Can hon. Members opposite give a better example of representation for Scotland. Then, in order to clinch the matter, in case it were thought not completely representative of trade union interests, he quoted the Scottish T.U.C. who, in contradistinction to what one hon. Member opposite said, have in fact asked for this executive.</p>

<p>What is this executive for which we are asking? Let me draw attention to exactly what an executive is, as described in the Bill:
<q>Each executive shall, as agents for the Commission, exercise such functions of the Commission as are for the time being delegated to them by or under a scheme made by the Commission and approved by the Minister.</q>
The right hon. Gentleman threw some scorn on the fact that we have not defined


the functions of the executive, but they are defined there. They are, in fact, the agents of the Commission, and are to carry out such tasks as the Commission think right. When we tried to consider this in Committee upstairs, we thought we were being helpful in not trying to tie it down too closely. So far from this executive being ill-defined and unfavourable to our contention, we submit that it ought to help.<br/>
On what do we base our demands, and on what do these bodies base a demand for a Scottish executive? First, on the statement of the Lord President of the Council that devolution was to be sought in all these nationalisation Measures: we still have confidence in promises of that kind, but I am bound to admit that in the nationalisation Measures I have watched so far&#x2014;and I have taken part in most of them&#x2014;there has been a very poor attempt at devolution, and at carrying out that promise. We also base the demand on the special character of the Scottish problem. It cannot too often be emphasised that Scotland has separate rating, separate land tenure, and a separate law system, different geography, and different customs. Yet it is claimed that there is no foundation for our claim that we should be treated somewhat separately because of all these differences and distinctions. The next reason upon which we base our claim is that we see an overgrown colossus being established to run the transport system in London. Already many think that each of the four railways were too big to be run by one set of men. Yet here, we have the four lumped together and the whole of their policy and functioning being dictated from London. There the Government are creating a Juggernaut car which will drive&#x2014;slowly, I have no doubt, as Government machines do not go fast&#x2014;over Scottish aspirations, Scottish hopes, and Scottish incentives.<br/>
In this matter there is much in the incentive there would be for a Scottish transport system of road or rail, or, as I would like to see, both, controlled from Scotland, and an element of competition, which is the lifeblood of efficiency, if a Scottish Executive were set up and given a chance of running transport in its own country.</p>

<p>Easily. If the hon.

<p>I suggest that the hon. Member goes to the Library afterwards and looks up the definition of the word "competition." We claim that there is another advantage in the question of speed of decision. I want to give an illustration of what has happened in the past. [An HON. MEMBER: "Why?"] Because illustrations are perhaps rather more graphic than academic discussions. There was the case of a graving dock belonging to a railway company and the dock was closed down for widening. The problem went from those working the dock to the Scottish committee of the railway company concerned. They then had to submit it to London, and the London committee then had to consider it, and pass it back to the Scottish committee. I may say that each of these moves took a minimum of a month. The Scottish committee passed it back to the concern, the concern had certain questions to ask about the answer, and the whole matter took about a year before a conclusion was reached. This kind of thing is typical, and will be even greater and slower under this Measure. We say that it should be possible for a decision of that kind to be taken locally, by people who know the local circumstances, and who have the power to say "Yes" or "No."<br/>
What, then, are we offered? In his opening statement, the Minister said that we were in fact being offered everything that was good for Scotland&#x2014;perhaps he will allow us to know what we think is good for ourselves&#x2014;and that he would be doing a disservice to Scotland if he agreed to what we are now asking. There was some question about financial responsibility. What difference would it make in that respect if Scotland had its own executive? That executive would have the


same financial powers as the other executives which are being set up under the Commission. We are to be fobbed off with a consultative committee, with no executive powers, area boards for transport, approved authorities for ports, but all ultimately subjected to the main body, part of the colossus in London. Local initiative and power of decision is what we want. If the Minister would give power to these local boards, a great deal of our objection would be removed. We have seen little coming to us so far from these consultative or advisory committees which have been set up already. I do not know how many Members opposite noticed the figures given by the Minister today in reply to a Question of mine, as to the activity going on at Prestwick on the part of foreign air lines and the lack of attention which Prestwick is being given by our Corporation. That is not a great advertisement for the Scottish Advisory Committee, which was to put Scotland and Scotland's air lines on to the map.</p>

<p>I am too gullible. I would say that if we are to take examples from the past of what advisory and consultative committees have done for Scotland then those in this Bill will not get us anywhere near where we want to be.<br/>
I again quote the Scottish T.U.C., who have said that this proposal which the Government have put into the Bill, and the Bill as it stands now, will not

adequately meet the wishes of the Scottish people&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "When."] This is the same quotation as before, and I will furnish the context to any hon. Member when I sit down. At the same time, they went on to say that what the Minister said is good enough for us, is not, in fact, good enough for them. What is the Government's objection to this proposal? First, they make a great deal of play with the point that everything must be functional and not regional. I cannot see that there is anything sacrosanct about functionalism as against regionalism. By geography and by distance, one place can be so different from another that it becomes functionally different. The Government have allowed the London Passenger Transport Board to have its own executive. Is there not just as big a difference in the carriage of persons and goods between England and Scotland as there is between Middlesex and London? Are the populations not comparable? In fact, is not the number of vehicles ran-fling in Scotland probably greater than the number running in London? Therefore, why should there be this clear-cut case, which no doubt existed in the Minister's mind, in favour of London having its own executive and for Scotland being denied the same?<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman considers it is difficult to handle a Scottish Transport executive because a train has to go across the Border, then leave that aspect cut. The more the executive handles the better I shall be pleased. It is really nonsense to say that because a train is to go from London to Edinburgh or Glasgow, and has to cross the Border, it makes it impossible for the two countries to have their own transport systems. What about a train which, starting in Paris, crosses Italy, then Yugoslavia and finally arrives at Istanbul? Is it to be argued that neither the Yugoslays, the Italians nor the Turks are entitled to have their own transport system because that train crosses their frontiers? There is nothing in such an argument; it does not make much sense. There is a growing depth of feeling about this matter. I say to hon. Gentlemen opposite, and particularly to the hon. Member for the Western Isles, who, I think, purposely tried to pull wool over the eyes of the House, that this is not a question of Scottish Nationalism but one of an antidote to Scottish Nationalism


because those Members who represent Scottish constituencies are aware, and cannot help being aware, of the growing feeling at this centralisation of all Scottish interests in London. Those who are English Members know nothing about it. I have no doubt that the Press considered that we were benefiting when they instituted the system from which we are suffering of the major English daily papers having brought out a Scottish edition, with the result that Scottish matters, such as demands for Scottish transport&#x2014;</p>

<p>I would conclude the matter by saying that these Scottish questions are not known to the English public. They live in a watertight compartment. We who represent Scottish constituencies are very much aware of how much is felt in Scotland on this and analogous questions. We have devolution in health, education and housing, and we have a separate Scottish Tourist Board. Why, then, is it not possible for us to have an executive for Scotland on this equally important question of Scottish transport? I regret that the Government are to refuse us. For a moment, a breath of fresh air and sanity came through those doors from another place, and it blew up to Scotland, and the Scots were grateful, and approved. Now, if it is again to be stifled, I say, in all seriousness, to hon. Members opposite, that a man is appearing in front of this Juggernaut car which the Government are driving with their Transport Bill. He is carrying a red flag, but hon. Members need not cheer; he is no supporter of theirs. He is giving the warning "If you go further along this road, you do so with danger."</p>

<p>It is only since the last General Election that we have seen the slightest indication the part of Tories of a desire to have Scottish affairs brought to the fore. Over and over again I have seen Scottish Home Rule Bills introduced into this House, but I have never heard a word from the Tory benches in favour of Scottish Home Rule. But here we have a Transport Bill, and there comes

from another place a proposal that we should have a separate Executive for Scotland. I want as much control of Scottish affairs by Scotsmen as is possible, but I have never disguised the fact that even if we had Scottish Home Rule, we could not have purely Scottish railways.</p>

<p>I am discussing the question of a Scottish Executive in connection with this Measure, and I am pointing out that it is impossible to separate Scotland from England when we have such organisations as the present railway system. We never had any objection from hon. Members opposite when the four railway companies, including the two which serve Scotland, were created. There was no objection to any executive, no criticism of the way in which the railways were run. It is only now, when we have this Bill before us, that there is a demand from the other side of the House for a Scottish Executive. As has been pointed out, there is no indication in the Amendment how this Executive is to function, what powers it is to have, and what financial control there will be.</p>

<p>It will function all right, and hon. Members opposite know it. What is troubling them is that all these nationalisation schemes are coming along. As a last resort, we have this development of Scottish Nationalism. I could have understood it, had it been on this side of the House, because we have always been in favour of the largest measure of Scottish self-government. Every Measure that has been introduced has been condemned on the assumption that what we were asking for was purely separation from England. Here is a Measure which simply proposes to deal with transport. I am one who wishes as much self-government as possible for Scotland, but I am still prepared to accept this Measure. My reason is that, under it, there is a chance of a co-ordinated system, a really effective system of transport for Scotland, including the Isles and the Highlands. We know that improved transport is needed there.


I believe that the provisions of this Bill, coupled with the assurances we have had from the Minister, are ample to safeguard our interests. We have plenty of other things to attend to in Scotland apart from transport, even if, by and by, we get a Scottish Parliament.<br/>
I would remind hon. Members that this question is not confined to railway transport. There are English interests in other forms of Scottish transport. Finance knows no borders. English finance does not stop at Berwick. Finance crosses rivers and borders. It knows no frontiers, nor does it know nationalism. I hope that we are not going to waste more time on this. We have a considerable amount of work to get through before we dispose of all the Amendments on the Order Paper. I hope that we will not spend more time in a useless attempt on the part of hon. Members opposite to raise the issue of Scottish Nationalism, because it will cut no ice at the next General Election. This attitude has developed since the last Election. They have been attempting to show the people that they stand for Scottish Nationalism, but Scotland is not following them. The people know sufficient of the peers who have represented Scotland in another place to know that they are not the leaders of the Scottish people.</p>

<p>There are one or two points with which I wish to deal, and I hope that it will not be a waste of time. I am sorry that the hon. Member for Dunfermline Burghs (Mr. Watson) feels that we are wasting time, because this is very important. My first point is in relation to something which the Minister said in his speech. It was a point which was worrying me. He pointed out that there will be a large degree of decentralisation and of area control. I am very grateful to the Minister for accepting some Amendments and putting in certain qualifications which make that more and more certain. The Minister also referred to the area road passenger transport scheme. I am not quite clear whether that does away with the need for a Scottish Transport Executive. What we are really after is effective decentralisation. I think hon. Members in all parts of the House want that. What we want is proper co-ordination and the production of a properly integrated service. The Minister talked about unification.<br/>
Before I come to the main argument on integration, I would ask, what about long-distance road transport of goods? I think I am right in saying that that does not come under the area schemes. It is to be operated by whichever Executive is responsible. In the main, it must be operated from London. There is something in what the Minister said when it is applied to passenger road transport. There is a great deal in it when applied to docks and harbours. But I would point out what my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Central Glasgcw (Colonel Hutchison) said, that this Amendment does not necessarily impose on the Scottish Transport Executive, if it comes into existence, the necessity of dealing with all and everything in the Bill. The Amendment would merely pit a Scottish Transport Executive there and the Executive would have such functions as the Commission for the time being delegated to it. If I understand the Amendment correctly, that is the position.<br/>
What would be the function of a Scottish Transport Executive? I submit that before long the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan) will wish there was a Scottish Executive to overcome the very difficulties about which he spoke. One thing which the hon. Member for the Western Isles is never going to overcome, is the fact that the Minch gets rough and that a certain type of ship is necessary for transport. Unfortunately, it is an expensive type of ship which must be fast, and which must co-ordinate with road transport at ore end and rail transport at the other. If the hon. Member hopes that nationalisation will solve the problem of people getting across the Minch without being sick, he is more of an optimist than I am.</p>

<p>Surely, the hon. Member will admit that private enterprise would never have given us any service there? That is shown by the very fact that we have to pay such immense subsidies from the State to support private enterprise which never gave us goods service until it had State assistance.</p>

<p>My argument was merely by way of illustration, but I submit that the hon. Member for the Western Isles went further, and I did not want to follow him. The point is that we need the proper co-ordination of the railways and other transport services. Will the hon. Member get that in this set-up? I submit that there is the strongest possible case for a Scottish Executive with powers delegated to it as the Commission may desire. If we had that, we could put to the Scottish Transport Executive the peculiar problems of certain areas of Scotland, including the area of the hon. Member for the Western Isles, which constitutes one of our great difficulties. It is going to be extremely difficult to decide on the best form of this service, and there is the problem of providing services for islands which provide very little traffic. I think that, in regard to some of the smaller islands, the problems are incapable of solution under the present set-up, and are a matter for a Scottish Executive, and I do not think this is denied by the Advisory Committee. I think that, even with passenger road transport, we shall need some body in Scotland which can do the co-ordinating which is not possible, or, at any rate, very difficult, under the Bill as it stands. For that reason, I feel bound to support the Amendment.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two about the Amendment sent to us by another place asking for a Scottish Transport Executive. I can understand the Road Transport Executive, as mentioned in the Bill, but I cannot understand what is meant by a Scottish Transport Executive. The Bill itself is drafted very definitely on industrial lines, and it creates a Railway Executive, a Docks and Inland Waterways Executive, and others. If this particular Amendment is accepted, for the establishment of a Scottish Transport Executive, would it mean that we should have English and Welsh Transport Executives, a London Transport Executive and a Scottish Transport Executive as well, and, at the same time, a Scottish Consultative Committee in addition to the various Consultative Committees for the other areas? It does not seem to me that that is at all helping to amend the Bill in a proper spirit. All the claims that have been made for it have been made on the

grounds that only the Scottish people, or some of their representatives, know the problems of transport that confront Scotland. Complete provision has been made for that in Clause 6 of the Bill, which says:
<q>a Transport Users Consultative Committee in respect of both passenger and goods traffic for Scotland.</q>
Obviously, if we have a consultative committee for Scotland, it will be composed of merchants, industrialists, trade unionists and all the different interests, and there is no way in which we can get a body that can advise on their own needs better than that. But there is something more than that. The situation at present is that, under the merger that took place in the railway transport system, when the Glasgow and South-Western Railway, the Caledonian Railway and the North British Railway&#x2014;</p>

<p>Prior to that merger, we had these separate railways, but we also had the North British Railway locomotive and wagon works, the Caledonian Railway locomotive and wagon works, and the Glasgow and South-Western Railway locomotive and wagon works; but when the capitalist merger took place, all these works were transferred from Glasgow to Crewe and Derby, and not a single voice was raised against it. But now what do we get? For the first time we are getting the right to raise on public bodies the need of some particular part of Scotland. For the first time in the history of Scotland, the people of a given locality can say to their representative, "We are not being properly catered for by the transport system, and we want you to take up the matter." What hon. Members opposite are saying is that they want some kind of Scottish autonomy, such as this ambiguous body, the Scottish Transport Executive. If they had it, it would mean that the consultative body would have to disappear; there would he no point in having the two.</p>

nigger in the wood pile; somebody is looking for a job. The leopard cannot change its spots.

<p>I will do so with pleasure, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, because the other subject is a very dismal and sorry one. The hopes of the people of Scotland, as expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan), are the main points in regard to this Bill [here is no question that, in the past. whatever the ambitions of the Scottish people have been to develop the northern part of Scotland, they have been largely frustrated owing to the fact that transport was almost impossible. That has been the biggest obstacle to the development of northern Scotland. When the new developments which are visualised actually take place, it is obvious that somebody must be prepared to spend the necessary money in order to develop that part of the country. No capitalist company ever spends money for the purpose of development; it spends money only when it is sure that it is going to get back something extra in the process.<br/>
It will take years before the people of this country will be repaid, but the thing

must obviously be done. It can be done only by a nationalised transport system, where there is a common pool of money, and a sensible and long-range vision about expenditure in certain places for the purpose of developing the country The potential wealth of the North has not been developed by the people who pay lip service to it. It can be developed, but this is the only way to do it. I hope that my right hon. Friend the Minister will resist this Amendment.</p>

<p>I rise at this stage of the Debate for the purpose of putting to the Secretary of State for Scotland, whom I now see in his place, the view of this side of the House that he ought to take part in the Debate, and I think my reason for saying that will become obvious as I go along. I trust that my rising now will enable him to have time to prepare his reply while those of my hon. Friends who so desire follow me. I think it is quite clear that there is a vast number of points to be covered in this, which is, perhaps, the most important question relating to Scotland which has yet been brought up in this Parliament. I doubt whether the Secretary of State would disagree with that statement. It is certainly very much more important than points on which we have spent a whole day on the Second Reading of Bills, and the detail involved is even greater than in most Bills, and nearly as great as, and of much more importance than, the Town and Country Planning Bill which took us a very long time to consider. Therefore, I have no doubt that a number of points will be covered by those on this side of the House who will follow me.<br/>
The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan) alluded to a "bizarre coalition" opposing the Government's view on this question. It is perfectly true that in Scotland there are persons united on this issue who have probably never been united before on a political issue, and, perhaps, will rarely be united again. When that kind of thing occurs, when people who are lifelong political enemies, or who have no politics at all, take the same view, there is a very high probability that they are right. I can think of no other reason why there should be this "bizarre coalition," as the hon. Member calls it, against the Government's proposal.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that the right hon. and learned Gentleman will make his case as efficiently, as he always does, but he must not say that I said the Scottish T.U.C. is a Nationalist body. The reason this "bizarre coalition" I mentioned is so bizarre is the fact that we have on the one hand the Scottish Nationalists, and on the other hand the T.U.C., the Church of Scotland and the Tory Party. The very essence of this bizarre position is the fact that the Scottish T.U.C. is attached to such an assortment of people.</p>

<p>I should have thought the hon.

I will have occasion in a few moments to remark on another part of the hon. Gentleman's speech which, I think, carries more weight than it would otherwise have done, by reason of the fact that he is the chairman of the Scottish Members who sit on the opposite benches, and, therefore, he may be supposed to speak for them in this matter, to a certain extent at least.<br/>
Coming to the merits of the Amendment, the Minister and others have said that the Amendment is vague. I do not think it lies in the mouth of the Minister producing this Bill to complain of vagueness; of course, the Amendment is vague. The Clause is vague, and it would not be possible on such a vague Clause to draft a detailed Amendment. Observe what the Clause says. It says:
<q>Each executive shall, as agents for the Commission, exercise such functions of the Commission as are for the time being delegated to them by or under a scheme made

by the Commission and approved by the Minister.</q>
There is no definition of the powers or duties of any of the executives; and, indeed, plain notice that they may vary from time to time. They may vary from time to time in the most fundamental manner. Therefore, it does not seem odd that an Amendment to such a Clause should be vague in its terms. But what is behind the Amendment is not in the least vague, as the right hon. Gentleman himself very well knows, because the Scottish Council of Development and Industry has had some communications with the Minister on this matter, and the chairman, presenting a unanimous resolution, has put forward in great detail a scheme which that Council has sponsored, and it is not in the least a vague scheme.<br/>
It is a scheme which could be given effect to with ease under the Amendment, but it would be quite impossible for a scheme of this sort to be brought into effect if the Amendment is rejected. The scheme occupies half a column in print, and the history of the matter is this. Representatives of the Council, who represent every shade of political thought in Scotland, who represent all classes of the community, met the Minister and got the same sort of soothing syrup as we have had today&#x2014;I shall say more about it in a moment&#x2014;and went away completely dissatisfied. They took the view that there was no guarantee that a statutory scheme would be provided, and they set themselves to devise a positive scheme for Scotland within the framework of the Transport Bill, and they did that because, as they say,
<q>Embracing as it does all shades of effective political opinion, the Council is itself strictly non-political. It is completely impartial on the question of the nationalisation as such, but is vitally concerned to ensure that the arrangements made with particular industries which are nationalised are not prejudicial to legitimate Scottish economic interests.</q>
That is the basis on which this Council&#x2014;as I say, completely representative and unanimous&#x2014;set forth to devise a scheme; and they devised a long scheme. I shall not weary the House by reading it. The Minister knows perfectly well what it is about. If he or somebody else, likes to get up to pick holes in it, to show why it will not work, let him do so. All I can say is that it is very odd, if he thinks it will not work, that he has not said so before now. I should have thought


that, in the course of these Debates, the plain answer to this Amendment, if there is an answer, would be, "This Amendment, if it is founded on anything, is founded on the Scottish Council's scheme; I can show you here and now that it is an unworkable scheme; nobody has suggested any other reasons for the Amendment, and, therefore, the Amendment is a bad Amendment." It would have been a devastating argument, but it has never been advanced because it cannot be advanced, as the Minister knows quite well. What the Scottish Council has said is perfectly true.</p>

<p>It is surprising that, in the right hon. and learned Gentleman's argument he attaches so much importance to the Scottish Council for Industry, which is a non-statutory, non-elected, non-executive, purely advisory body, with no status of any kind except the status created by itself.</p>

<p>I do t of say anything about that. I do not think the hon. Member is right, because it is quite clear that this Council is, among other things, directly representative of local authorities.

<p>Of course, I know that hon. Members opposite are doing their best today, and otherwise, to diminish the importance of all local authorities in Scotland. They are deliberately doing that; they have done it time and again; and I am not surprised at that attitude, for the very simple reason that local authorities&#x2014;be they Unionist, Socialist, or non-political&#x2014;are Scotsmen first, whereas hon. Members opposite are showing by their conduct that they are not only Socialists first, but English Socialists first. [<i>Laughter.</i>] Hon. Members laugh but I will justify that before I have finished.<br/>
I wish to put on record the views of representative Scottish bodies who are unanimous upon this. I think the Secretary of State for Scotland may now begin to see why I think he ought to reply to this Debate. The document before me ends thus:
<q>A system of this nature"&#x2014;</q>
that is to say, a system which this Amendment would allow, but which we have no indication that the Government will accept&#x2014;
<q>would ensure the co-ordination of all transport in Scotland, and would provide for decisions on transport questions being taken in Scotland. The Scottish Council is satisfied that it would be entirely workable in practice, and that it would meet the needs of Scotland without conflicting in any way with the essential principles of the Transport Bill.</q>
That is what the Scottish Council found it necessary to publish after having been to the Minister and having been dissatisfied with his view&#x2014;and found it necessary unanimously. Let us see what the Minister said against that very detailed statement. The Minister said that this scheme was apparently attempting exploitation on false sentimental or nationalist grounds. I was not quite clear what it was attempting to exploit, but I did take down those words. Does he still say that? Does he say that the Scottish Council were attempting to exploit the situation on sentimental or nationalist grounds. Does he say that about the Scottish T.U.C., I wonder? I am not quite certain whether the Scottish Cooperative Wholesale Society come into this matter, but if they do, I am quite sure they take the same view as the T.U.C. and the Development Council. Perhaps the Minister might ask some of his friends there what they think about it.<br/>
All I could gather from the right hon. Gentleman was that railway devolution was to be unified and strengthened. I am bound to say that those words did not convey any clear picture to my mind. I have not seen a clear picture in the earlier proceedings of this Bill. I may have missed it, but I have not seen it. Then we were told we would probably have an area road transport. I wonder why the right hon. Gentleman wants to call Scotland merely an area? I should have thought he might have been learning not to do that by now. But let that be. What was the only argument he put forward? I was able to detect only one. He was satisfied that it was serving Scottish interests, because


under the Bill we are to be subsidised by England whereas under the Amendment we would not be. Now, he did not say those words, but I listened very carefully to the words which he did use and I could read no other meaning out of them. If he really meant something else I would be much obliged if he would tell us, but the impression which I certainly got was that he took the view that Scottish transport could not stand upon its own feet and must be subsidised by England. If that is right&#x2014;and I very much doubt whether it is right&#x2014;then let us know about it. I have not heard it stated in that way before. Let us know what calculated amount of subsidy the right hon. Gentleman thinks England should pay to Scotland for Scotland to have an adequate transport system. I am sure that the Scottish Council did not realise that that was the position; otherwise I find it difficult to understand why they should have pursued the line that they took.<br/>
I do not want to put forward my own argument in this matter. I do not profess to be an expert in transport in any shape or form. What I am trying to do is to gather together and put before the House the consensus of opinion from all quarters in Scotland. Among those who really know about it, we have not discovered a single Scottish source which takes the opposite view, apart from those directly subordinate to the Socialist Party. I want to read certain words as part of my argument, and then say a word about them.
<q>Indeed, to most Scotsmen, it would appear as if Whitehall's insistence upon long-distance control in administration is calculated to secure for these new public service ventures the worst possible start. Nothing is more certain than that other Scottish boards, and particularly in air and land transport, will require to have separate statutory creation if the social and administrative services of the country are to be run efficiently with knowledge of local circumstances and with a minimum of frustration and annoyance to the lieges in the North.</q>
These are the words of Mr. Tom Johnston. I think that Scotland is rather interested in this matter, because to most Scotsmen Mr. Tom Johnston appears to be the most eminent living Socialist in that country. I doubt whether hon. Members opposite will deny that he has rendered to their party in the past very great services. I was a little surprised at the chairman of the Scottish Socialist Members saying that Mr. Tom

Johnston was no longer a Socialist, and that he was now only a Scottish Nationalist. If that is the view of Scottish Socialist Members, and if they have moved so far away from their own past that they must now disown Mr. Tom Johnston, let it be made public to Scotland.</p>

<p>With a considerable amount of diffidence I intervene at this late stage in the discussion. I have nothing but the greatest admiration for Members representing English constituencies at the patience they have exhibited while Scottish Members have been discussing this Amendment. I think all sides of the House must he appreciative of, and grateful to, the Members of another place for putting down this Amendment, and giving Scottish Members the opportunity to express their views on this matter. For a moment or two I will leave Mr. Tom Johnston and the Scottish Nationalist Party alone, and try to take Members to "Bonnie Scotland." Scotland differs considerably from any part of England and Wales, because there are great areas of land divided by mountains, hills, and rivers.<br/>
A very distinguished Member of this House asked me, the other week, where he could go to Scotland for a holiday, and I suggested a place called Rothesay, in the Kyles of Bute. I gave him the name of a good hotel, and he said he would go there. But a few weeks later he said he had changed his mind. He had wanted to take his car and his family, hut after inquiries he found that the car would take him only to a certain part of Scotland, and that he would then have to get a boat to take the car across the Firth of Clyde and land him at the Madeira of Scotland. Because of this trouble, and the fact that boats were available only at high tide for the conveyance of cars, he scrapped his arrangements, and decided to go to another part of Scotland.</p>

<p>Boats will accept motor cars only at certain times of the day, when high tide prevails. I am sorry that the hon. Member for West Renfrew (Mr. Scollan) has contradicted me, but I think I am perfectly right. I produce that evidence to prove the difficulty that bound to be experienced in connection with the nationalisation of transport so far as Scotland is concerned. I think it is most desirable that these Executives should be composed of people who will have an intimate knowledge of the difficulties of Scotland, and I am more than surprised to hear the opposition from hon. Members on the other side of the House. A great many of them I have had the privilege of knowing for a long number of years, and they have expressed the greatest concern about the conditions in Scotland, and how it has been unjustly treated by English Governments. Here is a golden opportunity for them to go into the Division Lobby today and render something more than lip service in the cause of Scotland. I was greatly struck by the speech of a noble Lord in another place, in which he wound up on behalf of His Majesty's Government. He was replying to certain riticism responsible for the Amendment being carried, and he said:

He with his experience and his background in Glasgow knows perfectly well that the purpose behind this Amendment is just as it was described by the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for the Central Division of Glasgow (Colonel Hutchison)&#x2014;an anti dote to Scottish Nationalism. I have never known of a recovery in any country in the world which was such an antidote. If I read the Bill correctly, if this Executive were appointed they would carry out the desires and instructions of the Commission. If that is so, the Scottish Executive is not even an antidote; it is a negative commodity. The amazing thing about this is&#x2014;I have known many hon. Gentlemen opposite, including some on the Front Bench, who hoped some day to qualify for higher office, on every conceivable occasion express this intensive desire to remove the remote control of Whitehall. As a matter of fact the right hon. and gallant Member for the Scottish Universities (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) had ample opportunity of removing the clammy hand of Whitehall. Instead of that he transferred his services to the Ministry of Agriculture in England.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman challenges me as one of the crowd. He did me the honour of saying that I had been in control for a time of a certain Government Department. Does he realise that when I set up the Milk Board, I gave it no power over Scotland, but provided a separate Scottish Milk Board which had powers similar to those held here? If the party opposite will do in this case, what I did for the Milk Board we will be satisfied as Scotsmen.</p>

<p>I am surprised at the right hon. and gallant Gentleman, with his knowledge of Parliamentary procedure, introducing such a subject as that. In any case, so far as concerns the much boosted Milk Board&#x2014;and I am using this by way of illustration, Mr. Deputy-Speaker&#x2014;there was a man whose name has been unfairly dealt with here tonight and who was the father of organised milk distribution among school children, which is the most important thing. I myself have had to drink milk imported from England.</p>

<p>I do not wish to challenge your Ruling, Mr. Deputy-Speaks r, but I am trying to develop my point as to how the Board could improve its transport system to bring that milk to Scotland in a more orderly way. Even the hon. and gallant Gentleman opposite who seems to have forgotten but who used to sit for one of the Belfast constituencies would agree that an efficient transport system could distribute Ulster milk in the West of Scotland rather more quickly than can be done at the moment.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Gentleman is confusing&#x2014;I will not say his own representation with mine but the fact is that I have always been in the North-West and have never represented Belfast. I have always represented Londonderry. And when we distribute milk to Scotland we do so by sea&#x2014;oddly enough.</p>

<p>The antidote contained in this Amendment has evidently net penetrated to the North of Ireland. What really brought me to my feet is the fact that Scottish devolution is receiving stir-port from the most peculiar quarter, so much so that I am beginning to think that I have been wrong all my life. I am suspicious. If any hon. Member on the other side believes that the appointment of the Scottish Executive will strengthen Scottish transport, will he please explain how, so long as the Treasury control the purse strings, what the purpose is of creating the proposed Scottish Executive, to act under the directions of a Commission still located in Whitehall? I have not heard any hon. Member try to explain that point.<br/>
I am speaking on behalf of all the Labour Members without exception, who have discussed this matter inside out. If we cannot get the reasonable explanation for


which I am asking I do not think that there is much hope of our departing from our decision to support the Minister. We think he is correct, and that a co-ordinated service can only come by the methods which he proposes and which are contained in the Bill.</p>

<p>I would like to bring the discussion back to the Amendment which has been sent from another place. I have listened to all the arguments that have been used and I have not found one answer given by the Minister or any of his supporters that appeals either to the reason or the intellect. To passion and to prejudice, yes, but not to reason. I sometimes wonder whether there may be a discrimination taking place by which Scotsmen are not to be given executive jobs in their own country but are to be dragged out of Scotland, with the object of giving them jobs in England. Is England indeed so short of men of capacity and experience that Government policy is designed to make good the deficiency with Scots. Is there any plan to deny Scotsmen work in their own country?<br/>
After the fantastic farrago of nonsense that has been talked by hon. Gentlemen opposite, one wonders how the Government can carry on its work at all. One is torn, in discussions of this kind, between two clashing interests. One is how to give more control to Scotsmen over Scottish affairs in Scotland. The other is how to maintain as close as possible the link between the two countries, Scotland and the larger though less important country South of the Border. Despite the economic depths into which we are about to be hurled and in which we may lose everything that we have been building up for so long, I say that the point in the proposed Amendment means a great deal to Scotland.<br/>
I see the Secretary of State here in his place, I hope ready to abandon his participation in this surrender. I warn him that Scotland is getting rather tired of control by England, and of being included in every piece of English legislation. Occasionally we get a sop like the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Bill, or the National Health Services Bill but still the control remains here. Whether or not we get those sporadic last Clauses

in a Bill saying that the Bill applies or does not apply to Scotland does not alter the fact that control still remains in Westminster and that we still suffer from the old overlordship of England. The hon. Member for Dumbartonshire (Mr. McKinlay) who has just spoken, referred to the power of the Treasury. We cannot deny that, but we want to ensure that Scotsmen in Scotland are permitted to administer such funds as they receive from the Treasury, and to use the knowledge they have of Scottish affairs.<br/>
I referred to the Secretary of State just now. I would like to say, that I like him personally very much, as he knows, but I blame him for some of the results from which we are suffering and especially for the result that we are discussing tonight. I do not say that he did not fight in the Cabinet for this Amendment&#x2014;I am sure he did&#x2014;but he does not fight for the position of the Secretary of State for Scotland, which should dominate not only the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but every other English Minister, because the Secretary of State for Scotland is the Prime Minister of Scotland, and he should recognise himself as such and not allow himself to be treated as a shuttlecock between the various contending interests in England. The time has come for us to put our foot down on this question. I ask the Secretary of State to realise the strength of the feeling that exists and urge him to exercise his authority in order to ensure that Scotsmen get the chance of running Scotland as they want to run it and not as the Minister of Transport wants to run it.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dumbartonshire (Mr. McKinlay) asked if anyone on this side would tell him what an Executive Committee would do in Scotland. He referred to the fact that if it were set up in Scotland, it would have no power of its own because it would be under the Commission. Why should any Executives be set up at all? Five or six other Executives are laid down in the Bill to work under the Commission, but if they work independently and have a certain autonomy of action on occasions, surely the Scottish Executive set up would have an autonomy of action? If a Scottish Executive is set up, the result would be that we should have men and women who know the conditions in Scotland taking


action on the spot when it was needed and not a month late, as would probably happen if the matter is done by Whitehall. The Minister rather misled us when he implied that Scotland would be worse off financially if we had our own Executive. That has been debunked by the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Hillhead (Mr. J. S. C. Reid). There can be no doubt that if Scotland got an Executive it would be no worse off financially than it would be working under the main Committee from Whitehall.<br/>
The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. M. MacMillan) said that the call for an Executive for Scotland was a flash in the pan and an isolated case. He has faithfully attended at the Scottish Grand Committee and he will know the feeling in Scotland today and the continuous efforts that have been made from this sid of the House to get as much local control as possible of our own affairs. I quite understand the uneasiness of hon. Members opposite. They remember their Election speeches. I remember them, too. They will have to explain to their constituents when they go back this weekend why they did not go into the Lobby on our side.</p>

<p>When this Debate is read in Scotland tomorrow, there will be a considerable amount of disappointment at the smallness of the arguments from the other side directed to the merits of the Amendment. The other side have attacked this Amendment almost wholly on political grounds. They have attacked it with ridicule and levity. But they have done nothing whatever to argue the case for the coordination in Scotland of transport in Scotland. The hon. Member for Dumbartonshire (Mr. McKinlay) argued that even this Executive would have to take orders from London. What is likely to be the order of the Executive in London? Surely, it wil be, "Get on with the job, co-ordinate transport in Scotland, and leave us alone as far as possible." That is what Scotland wants and that is the kind of order we expect to be given by the Commission. So far as co-ordination with England is concerned, that can be done between the Scottish Board and the Commission, or with any separate board or Executive that may be set up in England, but the essential thing is that the co-ordination in Scotland should be

done in Scotland by those who have the needs of Scotland in mind. For that reason, I strongly support the Amendment.</p>

<p>This has been a very interesting Debate, rather an epoch-making Debate for Scotland. I was very astonished at the remarks of the hon. Member for West Renfrew (Mr. Scollan) when he said that he thought our object in putting down the Amendment was to get jobs for ourselves. One thing we are absolutely certain of on this side is that as long as the present Government remain in power, there is not a hope of any of us getting a job. We know there are many jobs going and we know where they are going. I am not bitter about it. It is one of the unpleasant facts of life which has to be faced.<br/>
I did not follow the argument of the hon. Member for West Renfrew in that connection. Little did I think that I should live to see the day when Tom Johnston would be thrown to the winds by the party opposite. The hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr. H. MacMillan) threw him out and described him as an ex-Socialist. I hope this does not mean that he will be sacked from the Hydro-Electric Board, because he is doing a very good job there. I beg the Minister to give some assurance on that point. Nevertheless, it is another indication of the rising tide of anti-Scottish prejudice which is gripping hon. Members opposite, particularly the Scottish Socialist hon. Members. I cannot understand what has come over them. If we read their Electron addresses, we find&#x2014;</p>

<p>With great respect and all humility, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, I submit that we are discussing a project of devolution and a project to set up a separate executive for transport in Scotland. That raises in a most critical form the whole question of self-government in greater or less degree in Scotland. That is the issue tonight.</p>

<p>I shall not, Mr. Deputy-Speaker, but I do not think you can rule


me out of Order if I confine myself rigidly to what the Minister of Transport himself said. He said the Scottish Transport system must be integrated with that of England. We say that it should be dis-integrated from that of England to a certain extent. We want decentralisation and devolution, and that is what hon. Gentlemen opposite have in the past always claimed they wanted for Scotland. We have never been great advocates in the past of a marked degree of separation between England and Scotland. They have. How do we know it was not purely for the purpose of getting votes from the Nationalists in Scotland?</p>

<p>Not only did the Minister of Transport say that the Scottish transport system had to be closely integrated with that of England but he went on to refer in what I regarded as rather an offensive phrase, to the peculiar physical handicaps of Scotland. What did he mean by that? [An HON. MEMBER: "He was looking at you."] No further remarks of that nature, or I shall have to claim your protection, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. I propose to overlook it on this occasion. Nevertheless, the Minister referred to the peculiar physical handicaps of Scotland. I did not like the phrase. It showed a certain prejudice against Scotland. Do not let us have any "havers" now from the party opposite about decentralisation, devolution and self-government for Scotland. "Government of the people of Scotland by Whitehall, for Whitehall" is their slogan now, and at least we know where we are.<br/>
There is very little we can do to rectify the situation. We are bound to be outvoted in the Lobby tonight, but I think many hon. Members of the Labour Party will go into the Lobby with a heavy heart, and with an uneasy, queasy feeling in the pit of the stomach that they are doing the wrong thing. I think Scottish Members of the party are unhappy about this thing, but do not wish to make a rift in the party. Nevertheless, they are dealing a very damaging blow at the economy and the general interests of Scotland. Not a single argument has been adduced in the whole course of the Debate to show why the proposal we are making in this

Amendment should not be adopted, and why we should not run an executive in Scotland. It would do no harm whatever to the general structure of the Bill, or to the transport system of the country as a whole. Not a single argument has been put forward to show what is wrong with this proposal, or why it would not work.<br/>
We in Scotland must reconcile ourselves to the fact that the only way in which we can have any say in the conduct of our affairs is to come down to Whitehall to run them from there. That, of course, is what we are doing to a great extent, but it is no great consolation to those who remain faithful in body as well as in spirit to the land of their birth, and who want to have some say in our affairs in Scotland. To throw cut the suggestion of Newcastle as a sop is not good enough; the Executive should be in Scotland.</p>

<p>While this Amendment is being treated with a certain amount of levity by hon. Members on the Government benches, it is nevertheless a matter of supreme importance to Scotland. It is a matter on which much of the future of Scotland depends, and it should have been debated in all seriousness. It is perfectly obvious from representations which have been put forward, and to which my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Hillhead (Mr. J. S. C. Reid) referred, that this matter is considered as serious to the future of Scotland.<br/>
Hitherto, at least as long as I have been in this House, I have always understood that the Secretary of State for Scotland was the champion of Scotland's rights. I should have thought it would have been fitting for him to rise tonight to answer the very serious problems which have been put forward in argument from this side of the House. Not only so, but I think he has a duty to tell the people of Scotland why it is that he does not agree with the Lords in this Amendment. There have been many cogent arguments put forward, and many public bodies truly non-political in Scotland, representing what I believe to be the true voice of Scotland, have made representations on the subject. Yet the right hon. Gentleman does not think it is a worthy subject on which to rise and reply to a Debate in this House. I have waited all the evening for the right hon.


Gentleman to rise in his place. I am astonished and astounded, as Scotland will be tomorrow, that he has not had the courtesy to do so.</p>

<p>We are, of course, only at an early stage of this Debate, and, therefore, I apologise for intervening so soon, but we are determined to have an answer from a Scottish Minister&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] We are perfectly entitled to say that the Debate should go on. There are many arguments which can be adduced, and which will be adduced, until Scotland hears from its own Minister some answer to the case put by Scottish Members on this side of the House. Hon. Members opposite have adduced no argument against this Amendment, save the one that in any nationalisation scheme no devaluation of any kind or discretions such as this Amendment envisages may be permitted. This is, therefore, the beginning of a very serious process, which we intend to withstand. The Minister of Transport insisted that not merely an integration but a complete assimilation of the two systems was necessary before his scheme could work at all. This is not the only nationalisation Bill which is now before the House of Commons, and if that is to be so, we must take it as the stated policy of the Government, which is to he extended in many other directions. I see in his place the Lord President of the Council, who himself on a previous occasion steered a considerable Transport Measure through the House of Commons. He did it with great acceptance, but he was wise then not to bring forward any such extravagant claims as those which are being made by his successor the present Minister of Transport. I would that the Minister of Transport might borrow some of that sweet reasonableness with which the Lord President of the Council proceeded on those occasions.</p>

<p>Whether or not honours were even before, I think it may be said that the hon. Member has done his best to get down as far as he can just now. The hon. Member for the Western Isles, whose incursions into our Debates we always greet with hilarity, has been pleased to make some animadversions upon his fellow Scotsmen. He says that he finds it impossible to believe that a Scottish Executive situated in Scotland will do justice to every part of Scotland. He totally failed to advance any argument to show why that should be so. He totally failed to justify in any way the many animadversions which he cast out against his own fellow-countrymen and, Sir, more particularly against that fellow-countryman, the most distinguished member which the Socialist Party has ever had, one whose boots he is not fit to black, Tom Johnston.<br/>
The difficulties in which the House is placed by the action of the Government are simple and obvious. The Government have put up a Minister who is not acquainted with the affairs of Scotland to justify their action in connection with this matter which is of the greatest importance to Scotland herself. We have attempted to elicit from a Scottish Minister on a Scottish subject justification of actions which will be of the greatest importance to Scotland. The Executive for which we ask here is certainly not an Executive which anyone would describe as a wrecking of the Bill. In one of his wilder moments, the hon. Member for the Western Isles described this as an attempt to wreck the Bill although his own colleague pointed out that from their point of view the danger of the Amendment was that it was not sufficiently important and would not do anything to justify putting it in the Bill. Hon. Members opposite must have it one way or the

other. They cannot have it both ways. I take it that they wish&#x2014;</p>

<p>Which of these two arguments does the right hon. and gallant Gentleman accept&#x2014;that it will wreck the Bill or that it is unimportant?</p>

<p>The hon. Member for the Western Isles, not for the first time, is placing an entirely false dilemma before the House. It will not wreck the Bill and it is not unimportant. I hope that he will be able to understand that plain answer. It is important and it will not wreck the Bill. It is important because it will place in Scotland the executive power over Scottish transport. The suggestion that before one changes a bus fare or a tram fare in Glasgow or Camlachie one has to get permission of the Minister of Transport&#x2014;for that is what it comes to&#x2014;that and other questions, as we all know ourselves, are questions of principle. They have to be brought down here before they can be answered and when we ask, "How do we obtain redress?" the answer is, "You obtain redress by putting a Question on the Floor of the House." That is a point which has been put time and again as an answer to the complaints made by hon. and right hon. Gentlemen on this side of the House that an impossible degree of centralisation is being carried out.<br/>
The possibility of managing the great affairs of Scotland by Questions on the Floor of this House may be judged by the rigid refusal of the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for Scotland and his Under-Secretary to make any reply tonight on a very much more important question than some small point of procedure, or even of principle, in the management of some portion of Scottish administration. The right hon. Gentleman owes it to his great office and owes it to the House to make some answer to this point which we have pressed upon him, because of the arguments which have been put forward, the far-reaching argument which will certainly stop any similar devolution being carried through in any other Bill before the House.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
Surely on this occasion, the Secretary of State for Scotland will give us an answer? I am perfectly willing to resume my seat if he will do so. I am offering


to facilitate the Government's business by resuming my seat to receive an answer from the Minister. If we are not to have it, then we must do our best to try and press our point of view. Will anybody, on behalf of the Government, explain why an executive in Edinburgh should be regarded as damaging to the prospects of this Bill? It still is subject to the overriding authority of the Commission. The hon. Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McKinlay) said that, as long as the executive power remained in the Commission, and as long as the clammy hand of the Treasury remained, this Amendment would really not be of any great importance. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Well, let him say that to the T.U.C., and to the Industrial Development Council for Scotland, and to those many bodies and hon. Members&#x2014;</p>

<p>Will the right hon. and gallant Gentleman allow me? I have said that to 4,000 delegates in St. Andrew's Hall drawn from trade unions and other organisations throughout Scotland, and I will say it again to any trade union branch in the country.</p>

<p>Well, the hon. Member has certainly done what we begged the Secretary of State to do&#x2014;to attempt some sort of reply on behalf of Scotland. Is it to be that the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary will do nothing in any way to defend themselves on their own case? The hon. Member who has just spoken explained that he has put the point before a delegate conference, and we must accept that horn him, but</p>

<p>the Secretary of State has not answered or explained how he thinks this modest Amendment from another place could be regarded as injuring the Bill nor has he given any reason to suppose that the Minister of Transport, if he were to put the case strongly to him, would not concede this point. We beg him to do so, and, if he refuses, we must continue to ask him to do so, but at the present moment, it is clear that he is not going to rise, and all I can say is that we shall continue our opposition to the Government's proposal on every occasion when we can.</p>

<p>This Amendment covers a financial point, and I think we might have some explanation from the Government as to why they are accepting it. When we are accepting Amendments from another place I do not think that we should accept them all without discussion. There is, presumably, a good reason why the Government are accepting this Amendment, and I think the House is entitled to know what that reason is.</p>

<p>This Amendment was agreed to in another place. It is the result of discussions which took place with the interested parties following on discussions which we had in Committee when we were considering this matter. It was there alleged that the Bill provided an inadequate amount for the railway


companies to distribute to their shareholders, and the wording was drawn so tightly that they would only be able to distribute certain net revenues and would have to exclude certain amounts which they would, in the ordinary way, have been enabled to distribute to their shareholders. We undertook in Committee to consider the case which was put up, and to see whether any injustice was in fact being clone, and whether the shareholders were properly entitled to a greater distribution than the Bill as drafted allowed.<br/>
We considered this matter very carefully with the interests concerned, and it seemed to us that they put up an unanswerable case in respect of some parts of their claim. We met that case. Each railway company concerned was considered on the merits of their claim and the principal circumstances affecting them. Finally, we agreed that they would be allowed to distribute the extra amount shown in Subsection (8) on the Amendment Paper. The sums differ because each railway company is in a different situation, and one company is able to substantiate a greater claim than another. The total sum is quite substantial&#x2014;&#x00A3;1,800,000&#x2014;but we are satisfied that this amount could justifiably be paid out to the shareholders. We invite the House to accept the Lords Amendment because we have gone into the matter exceedingly closely, and we can assure the House that no one is receiving more than they are properly entitled to get.</p>

<p>We are passing these things very quickly and very satisfactorily, but I should like to know in regard to this Amendment precisely why it was not in the Bill when it was first brought in.

<p>I always want to answer any question put by the hon. Member. This Amendment is consequential on one we have already passed, and it was put in when it was found that it would be desirable for drafting purposes.

It is usual to find that certain small drafting Amendments are necessary as a Bill such as this proceeds.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
We are confining ourselves on these two Amendments to the definition of long-distance road haulage. According to the Bill as considered in this House and in the Committee, and finally passed by the House, long-distance road haulage was described as road haulage where the haulier did most of his work over distances greater than 40 miles within a radius of 25 miles from his base. The arguments for and against that particular definition were advanced on many occasions in the House and in the Committee, and it was agreed that the figure was an arbitrary one and that there was no scientific figure which one could say was the correct one. Nevertheless we believed that it was right, but the Lords in their Amendment have exactly doubled it.<br/>
I suggest that if we accepted the Lords Amendment we would, in fact, be saying that the Commission should have no road haulage organisation at all, because if only those vehicles which came within the definition suggested by the Lords could be taken over, the number of vehicles would he so exceedingly small that it would be quite impossible for the Commission to have the resources with which to carry on long-distance road haulage work and which it is essential for it to have for the integration purposes defined in Clause 3. I say quite definitely, and I think it is generally accepted outside this House in responsible circles, that this is, in fact, a wrecking Amendment&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No "]&#x2014;in so far as if it is carried it will be impossible for the Com mission to do long-distance road haulage effectively, if at all.<br/>
I noticed that hon. Members opposite disagreed with me just now when I said that this was a wrecking Amendment. Perhaps I may quote a few lines from a source which I am sure they would not consider biased in our favour&#x2014;an article in the "Financial Times" of 23rd June in which this matter and other Lords Amendments were considered. On that occasion, the "Financial Times" said:


<q>The Lords have now, for all practical purposes, deleted long-distance road haulage from the scope of the Bill, and has done much the same for harbours and docks. These deletions &#x2014;particularly the former&#x2014;strike at the heart of complete co-ordination, which means that the economies of fusion cannot be secured and the possibility of making both ends meet is remote.</q>
That is a fact. I quote this independent source, which is unbiased, but which clearly indicates what the effect would be if this definition of long distance road haulage were accepted.<br/>
Under the provisions of the Bill as they stood when the Bill left the House, we anticipated that there would be approximately 20,000 "A"-licensed vehicles taken over and about 2,500 "B"-licensed vehicles, as well as a number of vehicles taken over with the railway companies. If we are to take over only those vehicles which do long distance work of over 80 miles instead of 40 miles, the number of vehicles which will be taken over by the Commission will be reduced&#x2014;I cannot say exactly how much because there is no means of saying with any certainty&#x2014;probably to a third of that amount and it may be to less.</p>

<p>that is a very interesting argument, but are we to understand that the Commissioners are never to have any new vehicles in the future and that they will always use the vehicles taken over?</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort. They have to get going. If the Commission are to start with about 8,000 vehicles, it will not be able to give a long distance road haulage service to the country and there will be all the disadvantages of disintegration. We shall have competition from the road hauliers with the Commission. The Commission will be unable to take those unremunerative services which are so essential. Indeed, the whole purpose of the Bill of getting a properly integrated road and rail service will be frustrated. For those reasons we invite the House to say that the definition put in by the Lords, just doubling the figures which were inserted by this House, is unreasonable, and that we cannot accept it.<br/>
I would say further that any definition of long distance road haulage which has been put forward in the past by representatives of road haulage concerns, has been in the neighbourhood of 25 miles,

and not of 50. There was one definition put before the Royal Commission which sat in 1930, in which the road haulage industry said they considered that 30 miles was the boundary between the long distance and the short distance road haulage. On another occasion, as I have already cited to the House on the Third Reading, many leaders of the roar haulage industry considered for another purpose that 20 miles was correct.<br/>
After careful consideration we are convinced that 25 miles is the correct radius, and that the journey of 40 miles is the correct criterion to judge whether a haulage activity is long distance or short distance. Because we believe our figure is correct; and because we are convinced that if the Commission takes over only those concerns which do long distance haulage on the basis of 80 miles that it will have so few vehicles as not to be able to give a proper service to industry; and because we feel that this is a wrecking Amendment, we ask the House to disagree with the Lords in their Amendment.</p>

<p>It is not without interest that this Amendment, which has been so contemptuously rejected with such an economy of words by the hon. Gentleman, is the Amendment on which the House was engaged when the Guillotine fell at the end of the Report stage and discussion was prevented, and even the few crumbs contained in the speech of the hon. Gentleman show that there are certain matters on his side of the argument which might profitably be discussed. I observe also that none of the arguments which we advanced have been discussed or met in any way. I will take the hon. Gentleman, first, through the arguments which he has put to us tonight. He commenced&#x2014;and so far we are in agreement with him&#x2014;by saying that the declared object of the Bill was to nationalise long-distance road haulage. Therefore, it is necessary to decide&#x2014;and, we suggest, to decide by ordinary commonsense rules and tests&#x2014;what is long-distance road haulage.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has confessed that this is an entirely arbitrary figure, and we are still waiting, after seven months' consideration of this problem, for some reason why the figure has been suggested. Today we have had from the hon. Gentleman one or two tentative suggestions. He said that 30 miles was put


before the Royal Commission and that 20 miles was mentioned on another occasion by some leader of the road haulage industry, and so those two had been put together and divided by two and this figure had been arrived at. That is not the sort of basis on which the businesses of thousands of hardworking people who have built them up should be taken away. When we come to this stage we are really entitled to have some reason for the test which the Government have attempted to put into operation.<br/>
I ask the Government once again to try to find a test by ordinary reasonable considerations of the most important parts of the country. Greater London is being planned, and the arrangements of London for a great variety of purposes are being based on the area of Sir Patrick Abercrombie's plan for Greater London. There we have an area of approximately 2,700 square miles, with a diameter of approximately 60 miles and a radius, therefore, of approximately 30 miles, so that from the point of view of London in this problem anyone on the outskirts of the Greater London area cannot come in to Hyde Park Corner and remain a short-distance haulier. That is the test for London.</p>

<p>I am sorry to interrupt the right hon. and learned Gentleman, but I understood that at his request we were discussing only the definition of long-distance road haulage from the point of view of taking it over. I understand that he is now arguing about the distance which hauliers who are not being taken over will be allowed to run.</p>

<p>the hon. Gentleman has quite misunderstood me. I am certain that he must have misunderstood the basis of this argument, or else he could not have put before the House the arguments he did. What I am saying i3 that he has totally failed to give any basis for his figure of 25 miles, that he has admitted it is an arbitrary figure, and that I am, therefore, trying to find a test or what is long-distance road haulage by taking the circumstances on the most important parts of the country I submit that is a most reasonable way of approaching the matter. First, I take the Metropolitan area. I have defined what is the Greater London area, and I go to an

area which has general acceptance in all parts,of the House&#x2014;the area of the Abercrombie plan for Greater London. My argument, I submit, is a sound one. The radius of 25 miles is less than the radius of the Greater London Area as laid down by Sir Patrick Abercrombie. In my own part of the country, take the distance between Liverpool and Manchester. Even on the short haul from Liverpool to Manchester, the Government s test again fails. I will go further North, to the town where I was born, Edinburgh, and there again say that if the test is less than the haul between Edinburgh and Glasgow&#x2014;and it is an understandable test&#x2014;it fails.<br/>
I ask the House to travel with me to the rural counties. 1 care not whether it is in Devonshire or in the North of England, or the counties In the North of Scotland: I say that any test which prevents a man from going more than 25 miles from his operating centre and does not allow him to make a total mileage of over 40 miles is a test which is utterly out of touch with reality, judged by rural conditions today. That is the first point I make. Surely, the hon. Gentleman follows the argument I am making; I do not ask his agreement, of course, but I ask him to appreciate that argument, for I am seeking to find a reasonable test. The hon. Gentleman will remember that these figures which we have put forward are the ones on which I was engaged when we last discussed this matter in the House. They are the same figures If the hon. Gentleman could give us any criterion, on the basis I have endeavoured to put before the House, that is, the basis of the needs of important sections of the community, then we would be prepared to consider it.</p>

<p>I am very anxious to understand the purpose of the right hon. and learned Gentleman's argument There has been a series of distances chosen and the right hon. and learned Gentleman has mentioned a number of distances, and apparently contends that on the figures as they stand, haulage over those areas will become impossible.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. Member will allow me to explain the matter we are now discussing. The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out that as a test of long distance the Government suggest that a haulier is not to go beyond a radius of 25 miles from his operating


base. That is one of the things he must not do, and while he must not do that, he must not, at the same tine, make his total carriage more than 40 miles Suppose that he starts 20 miles on one side of his operating base, he cannot go more than 20 miles on the other side of it. That the is effect of the test in Clause 39</p>

<p>I am still uncertain about the right hon. and learned Gentleman's contention. It seems to me that he is arguing that on a 25 miles limit we shall stop traffic beyond that distance.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman will read a copy of the Bill, and particularly Clause 39, he will see that the test that is being suggested for taking away the businesses of road hauliers is the one I have stated. If he does not accept the test I have stated, I ask him to read the Bill again, and he will then see that I have correctly stated it. If he will look at Clause 52 in the Bill, he will see that the other point which I mentioned is dealt with in that Clause. It is important that before people's businesses are taken over, the test should be understood. The test is a flat rate of 25 miles and being confined to the radius of 25 miles, which is not commonsense or reasonable test of what is long-distance haulage.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary fortified his argument on the question of the effect on the number of vehicles taken over. As I understood him, he said that now it is 20,000 "A" licences, 2,500 "B" licences, and, of course, all the railway vehicles, which includes Carter Paterson, and the like. But he said that he would reduce the 20,000 "A" licence vehicles to about one-third. The hon. Gentleman, with the frankness which he has always shown during the consideration of this Bill, was the first to admit that that was entirely a guess. When the Government attitude on this point was indicated in another place by the Government spokesman, he said that he anticipated that, roughly, the number of vehicles now being taken over would be nearer 2,000 than 20,000. He said that he put it in that vague way, but he did not think anyone could make a better guess.<br/>
That is the position which the Government have always taken&#x2014;that this is entirely guesswork; and it is, surely. If that argument is to be adduced against what I. suggest is the commonsense and

reasonable basis of test, then we ought to hay more information than has been given to us on this point. I remind the Parliamentary Secretary and the House that, apart from this test, the acquiring body has two other great factors in its favour; it is allowed to go either on a basis of weight or on a basis of cost, in applying the test; that is in deciding whet traffic falls into the alleged long-distance and the short-distance classes. It had the further advantage, until an Amendment was made to the Bill which will come before us shortly, of not even having to prove its case on that very favourable test which has been put forward. When these points are taken into account, we come back to consider what is the purpose of this Bill as originally put before us. It was to take over long-distance haulage.<br/>
As I understand the Parliamentary Secretary's argument today, he has said that this Amendment would interfere with integration and co-ordination. May I point out two answers to this? First, the Government have deliberately chosen to set up under this Bill, Executives which perpetuate functional differences, and Executives based on functional differences. Secondly, when this long-distance road haulage which it is sought to nationalise has been treated by this legislation, what one will really have to deal with, as I understand it, is the goods road haulage which would compete with the railways over the distance where it is desired to limit that competition. Taking that point of view&#x2014;and that is what co-ordination has come down to&#x2014;I ask bow will it help to make the carrying of goods over 25 miles a co-ordinated matter? I entirely fail to see that. The difference between the results of which the Parliamentary Secretary has complained bitterly tonight and results originally intended by the Bill cannot seriously affect that point<br/>
But we on this side are back to the point which we have always maintained; that is, that before one takes away a person's business on the plea that it is a long-distance haulage business, one must fix a test as to what is long-distance haulage. The 25 miles contention is not common sense. In another place they have taken a distance much more in accord with common sense, and I hope the House will face up to its original determination to apply the common-sense test once again.</p>

<p>I was surprised at the casual way in which this important Amendment was rejected by the Parliamentary Secretary. I suppose that casual manner comes from the knowledge of the support of the great majority behind him, but I think we must not be dispirited, but rather we ought to examine the case as it really is. The Parliamentary Secretary's case is not a sound one. He gave some arguments, but the arguments he put forward would cause me to vote for this Amendment. I would say at once that I agree that no figure can be correct. Any figure must be an arbitrary figure although we would prefer to see road haulage free of nationalisation. We have always made that clear&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Not always."] I repeat that we have always made it quite clear. If one is going to take over these vehicles, the wider the radius one gives the less problems one will have to face in administering the Measure. I think the actual calculations necessary for running vehicles on this formula of 25 miles and no farther will be necessarily tremendous. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to extend this radius as far as we can. The Government would do this if they were reasonable people. What really stops the Government from widening this radius is the fact that they fear competition from road haulage concerns against the nationalised undertakings. Quite frankly, I think that is a fantastic way in which to go into public ownership.<br/>
We on these Benches are supporters of a limited amount of public ownership. Hon. Members opposite cannot complain. We have supported them on a number of nationalisation Measures.&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Oh!"]&#x2014;Yes, we have. I make no apology for it; but I say that, in an industry like this, public ownership ought to be able to stand up to the test of private enterprise competition. The Parliamentary Secretary says, "If we extend this radius, instead of taking in 20,000 vehicles we should take in 8,000, and, therefore, the Commission would not be able to provide the service." I ask hon. Members opposite to note that. The emphasis should be on the fact that the Commission would not be able to provide the service. But the service would be there all the same. Those 12,000 vehicles would not disappear. They would run, and I believe that we would get very efficient service.</p>

<p>The hon. Member says, "Why take any of it over?". The hon. Member is on my side. I am in difficulty because I do not believe in any of these figures; but I suggest that the wider we make the radius the better. The reason the Government want to take over these vehicles is, not to give public service, but to get rid of those vehicles as competitors. Do not let us make any mistake about that. I say it is a pretty shocking thing&#x2014;that the first thing public ownership is to do is to knock competitors out of business. Is not that what we have rightly been attacking the Conservative Party for doing over a good many years? I suggest that the hon. Member for Norwich (Mr. J. Paton) made a very interesting intervention when he tried to prove that the right hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for West Derby (Sir D. Maxwell Fyfe) was trying to say, in his argument, that, as a result of the Government's rejection of the Amendment, there would not be a service. My point is that there will be a service. The service up to 80 miles will be by private enterprise. Does the hon. Member object to that?</p>

<p>The hon. Member says he does not believe in private enterprise in this industry.&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "No."] &#x2014;I believe it is the only way in which it can work, and I believe we have got to put forward our case. That service will still be there. What the Government are trying to do is to clear competition out of the way. They know they cannot stand up against it. I suggest that it is not 'common sense. Let us suppose we went to a place tonight and said to a man running road haulage between one town and another&#x2014;a distance of 30 miles &#x2014;"So you are a long-distance road haulier." Do hon. Members think that he would call himself a long-distance road haulier when he runs 30 miles one way and back? Of course, he would not. That is not long-distance road haulage. I consider that the Government have been motivated by one concern, and that is to get out of the way competition they know they cannot face. If they cannot stand up against that competition, then it is a rotten system which the Govern-


ment are bringing in. On those grounds, I shall certainly vote for the Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1361.0" hansard_membership_id="12659" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19655" speakername="Mr. Poole" colnum="1361" time="">
<p>It is not a very great surprise to me that the Parliamentary Secretary, in moving the rejection of this Amendment, did not give any very clear reasons why the particular figures of 25 miles and 40 miles had been selected by the Government; because throughout all the stages of this Bill, in Committee upstairs and in this Chamber, we have had no clear guidance from the Government as to what really actuated them in selecting those figures, when we ourselves have pressed these alternative figures, for these figures in this Amendment are the same figures as hon. Members of this side have proposed.<br/>
We have been told that the Amendment is designed to wreck the Bill, and far mere time has been spent by the Parliamentary Secretary in trying to prove how wrong are our figures than in showing that the Government's figures are right. That is all the more remarkable since we have had it clearly stated by the hon. Gentleman that the Government's figures were necessarily purely arbitrary. It is, therefore, reasonable that we should be allowed to argue other figures on the basis that any figure chosen is an arbitrary enc. We are trying to select a middle position, in view of the fact that there are great differences between localities in different parts of the country. I do not think it is reasonable to say this Amendment is a wrecking Amendment without giving reasons or logical arguments.<br/>
In point of fact, a very great deal more argument can be put forward for the 80 miles limit than for the 40 miles. I base part of my argument on the statement made during the war by the Road Haulage Organisation which operated on a 60 mile limit. Experience showed that 60 miles was not far enough. A Select Committee made a report on the work of the Road Haulage Organisation in which a most scathing criticism was made, and it was pointed out how impossible it was for the Road Haulage Organisation to take over vehicles working over such short distances. It must be borne in mind that the Road Haulage Organisation was working during the war to a limit of 60 miles. Yet the Government are now bringing in a figure 20 miles less than that of the Road Haulage Organisation, and with a limitation of radius as well. I should have

thought that on that argument there was a great deal more to be said for our figure of So miles than for the figure put forward by the Government<br/>
Another argument mentioned briefly by the Parliamentary Secretary is in reference to the number of vehicles being taken over. The Parliamentary Secretary made a rather curious statement. He estimated the number of vehicles to De taken over on the 40 miles and 20 miles basis, and said it would be impossible to calculate the number of vehicles to be taken over on a wider basis. If the Government can bring out the number of vehicles for the one, it would be perfectly simple to find out the number of vehicles for the other. I believe that the figures the Government are working on are built up on the experience of the Road Haulage Organisation which was based on 60 miles, and had no radius limitation.<br/>
I suggest that the Government have not the slightest idea of the number of vehicles they are taking over, and that it will be vastly more than they have budgeted for so far. If one accepts what the Parliamentary Secretary said--that it is impossible to estimate the nurnber of vehicles which would be taken over under the Amendment&#x2014;it might be suggested that this is a wrecking Amendment; but in fact it has been clearly shown that the distances of 40 miles and 25 miles will be absolutely impracticable in many parts of England. They can lead only to inefficiency in the transport services. Vehicles would run empty and a large number of vehicles being taken over by the Commission would be engaged solely on short distances and never embark on long distances at all. For these reasons I urge the Government not to treat this as a wrecking Amendment, but to treat it on the merits, and to see whether there is not some possibility of taking it into the Bill, because if it is rejected great chaos and disturbance will be created especially in tie earlier stages.</p>

<p>The hon. Member can make a speech later. I am glad to see that the Minister of Transport has returned. We realise he is having a hard day, but he will probably have a harder night. From the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Oswestry (Mr. Poole) he would have learnt that we are wholly unsatisfied with the Parliamentary Secretary's reasons for rejecting this Lords Amendment. The Parliamentary Secretary's main case, I would remind the Minister, was that if the Lords Amendment were accepted, he would not be able to take over a sufficient number of vehicles. That was his main case. [<i>Interruption.</i>] If hon. Members will not contribute to the Debate, they might at least listen to those who do. The case which the Parliamentary Secretary put forward was that if the Lords Amendment were accepted, he would take over an insufficient number of vehicles. The point struck me that he quite obviously had not the faintest idea whatever of how many vehicles he was going to take over. It is a remarkable thing that we should have reached this stage in the Bill without any ascertainment of what the practical effect would be on the transport industry. I should have thought that some inquiry would have been made before this stage. The Parliamentary Secretary quoted the "Financial Times" as lending some support to his arguments. He said it was an unbiased newspaper. I am sure it is, and I would like to quote this extract from today's issue:
<q>This all goes to show that the Government would have been better advised at the outset either to leave transport alone or wait until they have devised something better than a series of half-baked proposals for a problem which would tax Solomon himself</q>
I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will accept that as an unbiased view.<br/>
What we are discussing are the terms and circumstances in which road haulage lorries are to be taken over, and the Clauses which deal with it are Clauses 39 and 41. A very complex system of tests is laid down. Those tests involve the distance that a vehicle travels: they also involve, quite separately, the radius of its

operation from its operating centre; they involve the weight of goods which it carries and the amount of takings which should be appropriated to long-distance and short-distance. At the same time, some tribunal&#x2014;and I have a great sympathy with it&#x2014;has to decide, within an appropriate period of time, which distances broadly are long and which are short. My first criticism of the Government is that I do not really see that this is practical at all. I hope the Minister will give at least a little further explanation of what this 40 mile distance and 25 mile radius really mean. I do not believe that anyone on either side of the House understands it.<br/>
11.0 p.m.<br/>
Let me give to the right hon. Gentleman an example with which he might deal in his reply. Supposing a vehicle starts off in the morning&#x2014;it does not go to one place but to six places&#x2014;with a mixed load. Let us call the places, A, B, C, D, E and F. Supposing A and B are inside the 25 miles limit, no problem arises there. Supposing it goes to C, still within the 25 miles limit, that is well and good. But supposing that, in order to get to D, it has to make part of the journey outside the 25 miles limit. It drops its load at D and then returns to E and F doing a total of 70 to 80 miles, part of which is caught up in Clause 39, because it went outside the 25 miles radius. How is the tribunal supposed to differentiate as to the weight of that particular operation? Is the route or the double journey to be taken into account, are the supplies for that particular customer to be taken into account, or is the whole of that journey to be treated as long-distance haulage? That is the sort of thing which will have to be decided, because this is a fantastic, complicated arrangement which the Government have set up.<br/>
The question is what ought to be a proper distance? In my reading of this Bill, it is difficult to find. I cannot see why we have the distance and radius factor. I do not see why we should have the radius factor. Possibly the right hon. Gentleman will be able to explain that when he replies. I do not know why. It seems to me that the whole thing is an unnecessary complication as to what should be the distance. All sorts of tests could be applied. Take the case of the Road Haulage Association. They suggested 60 miles, and the right hon. Gentle-


man knows that that was not a radius, but 60 miles from the point of collection to the point of delivery, which was more generous to the road haulage industry. Why has that been abandoned? May we have an explanation? What factors in the operation of the road haulage system caused the right hon. Gentleman to abandon a system which was tried out? He may have some practical experience of that matter, and if he has, could we be informed of it?<br/>
For my part, I agree with the opinion of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for West Derby (Sir D. Maxwell Fyfe) that the test should not be what some road haulage association said at some time or other, but should be a practical test. Again, if there had been some inquiry before this, if someone had paused a moment before launching into this particular scheme and had looked at the operation of practical hauls in this country, we would have had some better argument than that which has been put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary. The sort of test which should be applied is such as was suggested by my right hon. and learned Friend&#x2014;a long-distance haul which a haulier operates between distant and differing towns. That is the sort of long-distance haulage picture that I have. Short-distance haulage means operating in the Greater London area or between Cardiff and Swansea or between Glasgow and Edinburgh or some regular orbit of that kind.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman has not the slightest idea where the preponderance of traffic is, because he has never troubled to find out. If he had done so we would have been able to apply practical tests to these things. We would have been told the particular number of haulage lorries which would, in fact, have been taken over by the Commission, and what number would have been left. We could have looked at the thing objectively, and would have been able to judge it on the basis of adequate co-operation and coordination Instead of that, we are invited to judge matters on some basis put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary. That is a wholly unsatisfactory system and for that reason, I would reject it. I do not know whether the Amendment itself is satisfactory, but it does make some extension in this matter and offers some measure of freedom to the road hauliers.<br/>
There is only one other thing I want to say. I believe that the Government have got themselves into a difficulty over this matter in another way. This point was made by a well-known transport authority in "The Times" this morning. The difficulty the Government have get into is the result of making it the duty of the Commission to take over all the men who happen to fall into their own arbitrary definition. If they had made a definition that would have allowed the Commission to have exercised some common sense, and to say that in the Greater London area, for example, or in the Scottish Region, or something of that kind&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. If the point is conceded and there is no compulsion, though it does come within the definition, naturally I withdraw what I was saving. I do not want to make a false point. But in the matter of distance my point is this: I think it is based on no evidence whatever, but on guesswork, and that it will do an extraordinary amount of harm and little good. I hope the House will support the Lords Amendment, extend this area, and reduce the number of men whose businesses are to be taken away.</p>

<p>In view of the bait thrown out by the hon. Member, it is necessary for me to say that I do not like the Amendment, I do not like those who are supporting it, I do not like being drawn into a silly campaign of obstruction, and so with your permission, Mr. Speaker, I will resume my seat.</p>

<p>I wart to ask the Minister one or two questions which I think have not yet been raised. It is very important that when we are asked to reject these Amendments, we should think of what the effect will be. I want to ask how the Minister envisages that the limit of 25 miles will he enforced There can be no doubt that a very heavy burden will be placed on the police. Serious crime, as we, know, is giving Home Secretary and the Government&#x2014;and indeed all of us&#x2014;very great anxiety.<br/>
When this Bill becomes law, there will be a very heavy burden on the police. If it is not to be on the police, the right hon. Gentleman may be forced to imitate his colleague the Minister of Food and employ "snoopers."<br/>
Some of these people who are not being taken over will find it very difficult when they are going in and out of the 25 miles radius. I cannot envisage that an ordinary driver will not be able to get past any police block or check if he wants to do so, particularly in the London area, or any area where there is a large number of side roads. In the case of the coastal towns it might be possible to use some scheme of colours, but there are not enough colours in the rainbow to put marks for every village and town. It might be possible to use blackboards with the name of the town, but what a frightful waste of time and money that would be I am certain that what will happen is that the police will be spending their time checking petty little breaches of these regulations instead of getting on with their job. Furthermore, just at a time when manpower is stretched to the full and when we are all being asked to work harder, unnecessary work will he placed on an already overworked force. If the Amendment were accepted, there would still be a certain amount of additional work put on the police, but not so much.<br/>
From the point of view of the coastal towns, I regard this refusal to accept the Amendment as most unjust and unfair. It does not need anyone of brilliance to work out that in a place like Cornwall or East Kent, not only will an operator be restricted to half a circle, but sometimes to a segment of a circle. I cannot understand why an inquiry is not being held in connection with these coastal towns. I regard it as absolutely fatal to the horticultural industry, and am perfectly certain that no one will be able to get fresh fruit to town. If a lot of forms have to be filled in, the situation will be a great deal worse. It is a first-class scandal.</p>

Movements of goods in different stages of processes have to be made from one town to another. With that background, let him take his "notional callipers," fxed arbitrarily,

and with these not very snbtle planning instruments, let him start to measure out what it will mean if he puts this scheme into operation. He will sec that it will produce complete chaos.

<p>I want to try to find out what the Government have in mind. I oppose this nationalisation of road transport and believe it is a form of lunacy which will result in a great deal of unpopularity for the Government Let us assume a right to nationalise the long-distance haulier, leaving the vehicles of the local carriers unnationaliseo How are you going to apply that in the country area of Britain&#x2014;to local carriers in Yorkshire, who go far beyond a radius of 25 miles&#x2014;to lorries that collect milk in tanks, which go up to 30 miles and hack and are the only way in which the milk can be got to the towns for the children to drink? The vehicles of these carriers, who are really local carriers, will be taken over by the Government. I am speaking for the men who are producing the milk, the men who want to get on to their farms the fertilisers which have to be moved in the moorland areas a good deal more than 30 miles.<br/>
I ask the Government whether they a<ob/> wise, in their experiment of road nationalisation, to undertake the task of feeding the most difficult areas in England&#x2014;the dales of Yorkshire and, equally I suppose, the Highlands of Scotland That is what they have to do under this Bill. Local carriers at present serving those areas are predominantly working over 25 miles, and often more than 40 miles. I cannot find that the Parliamentary Secretary had any argument against this Amendment. I thought he had one. I thought there was one argument in which he referred to some special cases that were regulated under this Bill presume that he means C1ause 40 Subsection (3). If not, per taps he will enlighten us. Clause 40, Subsection (3), will not help +he remote areas<br/>
11.15 p.m.<br/>
I ask the Government to think over this matter again. They ought to have a different yardstick for the built-up areas and the remote country districts, and if they do not make an Amendment, I warn the Government that they are going to get


themselves into very great administrative difficulties. One cannot have a state of affairs in the remote areas of Britain where, under State transport, there is a 30 miles basis. In the case I am thinking of, there is a distance of some 60 miles, and I ask the Government, in their own safety, to try to get some compromise on this matter, and to arrive at a limit that will exclude the remote areas while securing that private transport collects the milk it, churns and brings the fertilisers and materials to the farms. One of the tasks that will face the right hon. Gentleman, if he adheres to the basis in the Pill, will be to get his transport over most difficult roads for 40 or 50 miles in the northern areas of Britain. At the present time it is being done by local carriers. I do not see that right hon. Gentlemen on the Government Front Bench are fitted to take on that work, and I disagree with the right hon. Gentleman in the discrimination that has been made.</p>

<p>We have heard of the position in Yorkshire and West Derbyshire, so I think that Devonshire should be mentioned. The Bill applies in all its worst aspects to a countryside that is full of winding, twisting roads, and which is a segment of a circle bounded on one side by the sea. There are two points which I want to raise. They have been mentioned already but not in detail. One relates to how the Bill is to be enforced. I noticed that, in the Debate in another place, it was said that records of road hauliers were not in all cases available, but that there was a good deal of information available from their applications for petrol licences. That may hit the road haulier rather where he does not wish to be hit, because when he applies for a petrol licence he makes out that he has to go as far as possible. If that evidence is to be used, the majority who have applied and who are just over the margin owing to their licence being for more than 25 miles radius, will presumably be taken over.<br/>
The second point, as I understood it, is that within the limit of the 25 miles radius a carrier may go any distance he likes; he is not limited to any distance of 40 miles, or any other distance. I should very much like the Minister of Transport to confirm this, so that people in the country may understand it. It is rather difficult. If a small cage were erected and one were allowed to rotate within

that cage as much as one liked, one would not escape from it, and could not get out beyond the 25 miles. That, I am sure, is not understood in the country. I can only say that I shall strongly oppose the Measure and Vote in favour of this Amendment.</p>

<p>My brief support of this Amendment is based on an inherent dislike of injustice. I suppose that injustice is inevitable in nationalisation schemes; but in this scheme we find it in a number of peculiarly vicious forms-First, we find it in the compensation pro-visions. It is easy to see that this is-inescapable if we throw our minds back to the words of the hon. Member for Enfield (Mr. Ernest Davies), for I was aghast to hear him say that the amount of compensation which should be paid&#x2014;</p>

<p>I will pass on to another matter. It is clear that whatever arbitrary yardstick is taken for measuring the distance in a Bill of this kind, some concerns will be left with a reasonable trade and others with something which is quite unworkable and not worth having. I can understand the Government's dilemma. They have put themselves in the difficult position of trying to solve what is I think, an insoluble question, That is not our fault. The Government are there to produce a Measure with an amount of equity and reasonableness behind it which will commend it to the community. In that they have failed. Tacitly, the Government's dilemma has been admitted. The Parliamentary Secretary said that if, in fact, this change were made from 25 and 40 miles to 50 and 80 miles, he would be left with an unworkable amount of business under the long-distance definition.<br/>
I want to tell the Parliamentary Secretary that he will be left with an unworkable amount of business now. I have heard remarks made when concerns were seriously discussing whether they should now buy their own vehicles and run them under "C" licences. A smile may pass over the Minister's face, but when I said to these men, "Are you so satisfied that this is going to be a failure before it has even been tried?" They said that they were. Here was a set of men who,


after all, are not going to cut off their noses to spite their faces. They were hard-headed business men, but they were so satisfied that the scheme would. be a failure that they were talking about purchasing their own property. What will be the use of the Minister's 20,000 vehicles if, in fact, there is no trade left for them to carry? I believe the scheme is un- workable, and because I believe this definition will lead to a large measure of injustice, I support the Amendment which has come to us from another place.</p>

<p>I rise only to endeavour to get information on a point which has been raised. I, too, read the letter in "The Times" this morning, and I thought it contained a valuable suggestion. According to the Minister, the letter was unnecessary and redundant be- cause the matter was provided for. I am only asking for information. The matter is not clear to me. In the first line of Clause 39, it says
<q>Where the Commission are of opinion,</q>
and it goes on to refer to certain long-distance undertakings&#x2014;
<q>it shall be the duty of the Commission to give, in accordance with the subsequent pro-visions of this Part of this Act, a notice of acquisition in respect to the undertaking</q>
The latter part of the Clause gives them no option at all. They must acquire it. I assure the Minister that I am only asking for information, and I think that many other hon. Members are interested in this matter. I hope he will make this provision clear.</p>

<p>I have listened to most of the arguments tonight, and having listened to them, I think there can be no doubt that this rejection of the Lords' Amendment by the Minister is for the purpose of eliminating competition and creating a "closed shop" in the transport industry. It is not a good augury for this nationalisation Bill that the Minister feels so touchy about a little competition from the road hauliers. If he rejects this Amendment and leaves the restriction of 25 miles, it will create chaos in the rural areas&#x2014;and I am speaking for Scotland, whose voice has only been heard for a few moments tonight&#x2014;and it will bring chaos to our agricultural life. There are a number of provisions later in the Clauses which deal with exemptions for livestock, and so on, but that does not cover the

whole picture. If the Minister can show us tonight where the powers lie and where is the direction that carriers are, in certain circumstances, not to be taken over, we shall feel grateful. Can we have a statement that Edinburgh and Glasgow, and I might say, Aberdeen, are to be treated as local areas?</p>

<p>My right hon. and learned Friend the Member for West Derby (Sir D. Maxwell Fyfe) and other hon. Members on this side have made a most impressive case in support of why the House should agree with the Lords Amendment. On the other hand, we have had a short and rather sketchy speech from the Parliamentary Secretary, and I have been waiting to see whether the Minister would get up, but he has shown no inclination to do so. If I deal first with the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft), it will clear the air a bit. Some of us found it difficult to understand, in view of Clause 39, how it was that the Parliamentary Secretary could give the assurance that the Commission would have a discretion for taking over any particular road haulier, but I observe that in one of the Lords Amendments we have this provision. There was much ribald laughter when my hon. Friend made that point, but I do not think that any of the hon. Members opposite who joined in the ribald laughter understood what they were laughing at. In the Standing Committee, the Government refused to give way and we assumed that the Clause remained as it was originally in the Bill. The last Amendment, which was passed without any discussion, had not been entirely appreciated by my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth and certainly not by myself, nor, I think, by other of my hon. Friends. Those who laughed did not know what they were laughing about. I am not suggesting, of course, that the Parliamentary Secretary did not know the answer, but those behind him did not.<br/>
11.30 p.m.<br/>
We have had no answer to the case made by my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for West Derby. He gave three very good examples; he spoke of Greater London, Liverpool and Manchester, and Glasgow and Edinburgh, and pointed out how ludicrous it was that road hauliers within those areas should be


called long-distance hauliers. The only case made by the Parliamentary Secretary was that if we accepted the Lords Amendment, it would reduce to a very small number the vehicles that were to be taken over. Of course, that is a thing we should naturally welcome on this side of the House. The hon. Gentleman the Member for North Dorset (Mr. Byers), on the Liberal benches, was quite right in what he said. He said the reason the Government reject this Amendment is to get rid of as much competition as they can. They know it perfectly well, and I hope the Minister will tell the House that that is the real reason. The road hauliers who are being dealt with in this Clause are being dealt with in a most frivolous manner. They are not being given a fair deal. It is entirely an arbitrary test, for which no sound reason has been given in the House. The Parliamentary Secretary admitted and confessed that it was an arbitrary test, and he did not give any reason for it that we could accept. It is not a reasonable test of what long-distance haulage is. I suggest that the Lords Amendment is a reasonable and sensible one, and I hope the House will accept it.</p>

<p>With the permission of the House, I should like to answer one or two of the points that have been made in the Debate. Let me first repeat to the House, as there has been some confusion, what is the purpose of the Clause we are discussing. The Clause lays down which road haulage firms shall and which shall not be taken over by the Commission. It has nothing to do with permits for running over certain distances by the firms that are left free; it merely lays clown criteria as to which firms should be taken over completely. The Commission is charged with the duty of running long-distance road haulage, and, therefore, it is essential to lay down some criteria.<br/>
The question is, what shall the criteria be? I can understand the views of hon. Members opposite, who believe that the Commission should not run road haulage at all, and that it should be left entirely to the free competition of the existing firms. They argue that the limits we have put in are not satisfactory, that the much bigger limits put in by the Lords are better, and that if there were bigger limits still, it would be better still. That is logical from their point of view, because

if that happened, no firms would be taken over by the Commission, and long-distance road haulage would remain entirely, or almost entirely, in the hands of the existing road haulage companies. But the purpose of the Bill is to effect the integration of transport, and the most important integration and the most urgent, as is recognised by everybody in the transport industry, is that of rail and long-distance road haulage; and it is essential, if this Bill is to be a success, that the Commission should be empowered to take over long-distance road haulage.<br/>
What is long-distance road haulage? I ask the House this question in reverse. What is short-distance road haulage? Our object has been to leave out the local haulier, because we think it is desirable that he should be able to carry on his work as he does at the moment. It does not interfere with the rail services and the railways' short-distance to al haulage. Surely, the radius of 25 miles that the local haulier has is a generous one? A radius of 25 miles includes an area of 2,000 square miles, and I suggest that anything larger than that area would be quite unreasonable. The definition laid down by the Road Haulage Association itself some years ago&#x2014;the House must bear it in mind&#x2014;was 30 miles. We think that for the purpose of setting up a national road haulage service&#x2014;it has to be a good service for industry, it has to be efficient, it must have resources, 25 miles is the correct radius, with a 40 miles distance. That is definitely our view, and I would point out that some of the figures that have been men-tioned&#x2014;</p>

<p>That was not the question. Supposing the area in which he operates covers 2,000 square miles, can lie live in the middle and go 25 miles north and 25 miles south, so that his real distance is 49 miles.</p>

<p>He will be allowed to operate 25 miles north, south, east or


west. I was making this point in reply to the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft), who said it would be difficult to work this scheme at all with the 25 miles and 40 miles proposal. In some cases it will not be easy, I agree, but it would not be any easier if one made it 50 and 80 miles. The same difficulties would arise, and the method of ascertaining whether a firm came within the definition or not would be exactly the same whether the Lords Amenament were accepted or whether the Bill is allowed to stand as it is. I have been asked to amplify the statement I made, and on which the right hon. Member for the City of London (Mr. Assheton) touched, about compulsion, that is, whether the Commission is bound to take over road haulage vehicles.</p>

<p>Before the hon Gentleman leaves the point about the 40 miles and 80 miles limit, will he answer the question I put? When a journey is of go miles, part of which, for one delivery, is outside the area, does the whole of that journey count for long distance, or only that portion of it which arises from the delivery outside?</p>

<p>To decide whether a firm comes within the category of long-distance, the records over the year will be examined and the case will be argued before the tribunal. There will be difficult cases, I agree, where it will Le difficult to decide; but the, work of the vehicles and the records, where kept, will all he put before the tribunal, and the tribunal will be able to decide, not one journey, but on the records of the firm for a Year, whether it falls within or outside the definition. Exactly the same problem would arise regarding long distance if the Lords Amendment were accepted, so it is quite irrelevant to the discussion we are now having</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary should understand his own Bill sufficiently to give me an explanation which I am entitled to have It has nothing to do with the particular difficulties of the tribunal. Unless the Parliamentary Secretary knows what the Clause means, it is very unlikely that the tribunal will know. Will he answer the the specific point I made? Will a journey of over 40 miles&#x2014;say, go miles, if you like&#x2014;part of which is outside the radius,

be considered, when the tribunal comes to consider journeys of that kind, long distance or short distance, or a portion as long distance in respect of.,nods delivered outside the area?</p>

<p>I have answered that point. If the hon. Gentleman did not hear me, I will repeat it. The records of the firm, which would show the journeys each vehicle had made over the year, would be taken and would be considered. These total records&#x2014;not one tricky journey&#x2014;would be considered, and on them the tribunal would decide whether they constituted long-distance journeys or not.<br/>
Secondly, it. is quite impossible to establish a road haulage service&#x2014;a national service&#x2014;which is efficient and which gives industry what it wants, unless the Commission have a sufficient number of vehicles and proper resources with which to carry out that work. For those two reasons, I ask the House to accept what was originally in this Bill, and which was with great care put before the House and discussed at length in Committee. All that another place has done has been to double the figures, making 25 miles 50 miles and 50 miles 80 miles. As the "Financial Times," which is opposed to this Bill, has said, if we were to accept this Amendment it would make impossible the fusion which the Bill seeks to provide.</p>

<p>I must press this point. It is absolutely vital that we in this House, in passing legislation, should know how the Government propose to carry it out. From an administrative point of view it is difficult for the police or anyone else to say when a vehicle has gone beyond the 25 miles. My hon.

<p>know what the position is in these areas, for in many cases the operators cannot have half the area to go over, and when the Parliamentary Secretary refers to a great number of square miles, it must be remember that our position is entirely different from that which exists in the centre of England. Considering the enormous number of these vehicles operating in coastal districts, I hope that in some other part of the Bill they will be given consideration. This matter affects many ports and all the seaside towns. I do not want to go back to my constituency with tie message that the Government absolutely refuse to think about them, but I shall have to do so if I do not get an answer.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
The effect of this Amendment is to exclude from the computation to determine whether an undertaking is long-distance road haulage or not, the type of traffic that is carried in an "A" contract vehicle. Under Section 7 of the Road and Rail Traffic Act, a road haulier can enter into a direct contract to carry the commodities of a particular firm in an "A" contract vehicle, and very often part of the arrangement is that the hirer arranges for the name of his firm or company to be also inscribed on the vehicle. The argument which has been advanced to support the exclusion of the "A" contract vehicle has been that this type of vehicle is very similar to the "C" licence vehicle. I have never been able to accept that position, because the "A" contract vehicle is in fact hired for reward and a variation, in so far as it is tied to one particular company, does not alter the character when the vehicle is plying for hire and reward. Therefore, as it is essential that this type of vehicle should be treated in the same way as the haulier who generally takes on any type of contract, we are unable to accept this Amendment. The Commission obviously can undertake work of this description in the same sense as any private haulier can do so, and I do not consider that any case has been made out for this Amendment.</p>

<p>One of the things that used to endear the Minister to us in Committee was his ability to indicate agreement with a nod of the head, and then, when he got up to speak, we found that he was going directly contrary to what he had indicated earlier in the day. Recently, he was the recipient of the hospitality of the shareholders of one of the great shipping companies, and today we hoped that he would be somewhat more generous in the acceptance of some

of these Amendments sent down from another place. But the way in which he has treated this particular Amendment is extremely brief, and I cannot see the logic in his refusal.<br/>
I will deal very briefly with the object of this Amendment as I see it. It is to exclude from the acquisition, as he has said, any vehicle under an "A" licence which is subject to a licence limiting its use to the goods of a particular undertaking. It is often the custom for a specific undertaking to have one, two or three vehicles. It is not economic and efficient for it to run as a single unit, but much better to operate with others in a pool. A group of firms in a town will get together and have one individual to run the business for them. The individual firm, whether a laundry or someone sending perishable foodstuffs about, or whatever it may be, has its name inscribed on the side of the vehicle, and it is, to all intents and purposes, a "C" licence run by someone else for that firm for the sake of economy and efficiency of operation. I say efficiency, because I think, as some hon. Members will be aware, that perhaps the one case where it was not efficient was when the Government tried to do this sort of thing during the war. On one occasion two hundred trailer films were to be taken round. The Post Office was invited to distribute them, but this distribution by the Post Office broke down and a private undertaking had to be brought in to do it. That was not a good augury for what the Government are proposing to do, namely, to nationalise these "A" contract vehicles.<br/>
The second point I want to make is that of economy. Obviously, if a firm has one or two vehicles, it has certain overheads to meet. It must have the vehicle overhauled, and once a week it must give the driver his day off. If it wants to use the vehicle for six or seven days a week, it is more economical o run it in a group under some appointed individual. The firms may appoint this person for a year and, if at the end of the year they find that he has not been very satisfactory, they can change to someone else.<br/>
The Minister will probably say, or at least imply, that the Government could carry this out as effectively as could private enterprise; but I think he would find that his colleague, the Secretary of State


for War, and even his well-known and very respected war-time colleague, Jane, would not place one R.E.M.E. company in the same class as another. With those who had any choice, one R.E.M.E. company would go up rapidly in favour, while another would pass out altogether. Under the proposals in the Bill, there will be no consumers' choice. This "A" licence system ensures that choice to the users of road vehicles. Those are two reasons why this Amendment should be accepted. The system of running a comparatively limited number of vehicles is more efficient.<br/>
Another suggestion put forward elsewhere which the Minister may consider, and which I believe was elsewhere not unfavourably considered is that a number of these people in a certain town should be permitted to run a pool of vehicles on a certain basis, and see if that would work. I ask the Minister to say whether it would not be possible to make an attempt of this nature, running it on a co-operative basis by some person for the individual users of vehicles, who could contract in or contract out of a particular pool as they wished.<br/>
I put it to the Minister that this seems to us to be another instance of the fear of competition. The Government maintain that the nationalised services will give the country and the individual trader who employes this type of vehicle the service he needs and that, therefore, there is no need for the contract "A" vehicle. Why not let them go ahead and see? If the Government's services were good, in a year or so there would be no need for contract "A" vehicles. Why not give them a chance? Just as in another place it was urged by the Government that the Commission should be given a chance, let us give this system of "A" contract licence vehicles a chance and see which comes out best from that competition. If what the Government have maintained throughout this Bill, is correct, that the Government's system will be perfect, and no one else will want to run any vehicles and even the "C" licence vehicles will go out, let them try it. Then we shall see.<br/>
Finally, I would put it to the Minister that we believe and fear that this is another example of the Government wanting to set up an absolute monopoly. Of

course, the hon. Member for Enfield (Mr. Ernest Davies) holds the view that the figure ought not to be 25 miles, but nought miles. We see the Government creating an absolute monopoly to do away with the consumer's choice, and we see that the small employer is not to be allowed to do what he has done in the past. I suggest that the Minister, who sometimes starts by saying "No" to the first Amendment and then changes his mind on later Amendments, should, in this case, say "Yes".</p>

<p>The proposed rejection of this Amendment would be more easily understood if there were any certainty that the business connected with contract "A" licence holders would be brought into nationalised transport, but the whole situation changed during the Committee stage when it was decided to give freedom to the "C" licence holders. The contract "A" licence is a very specialised thing and a trader does not enter into a contract of that kind without good reason. One of those reasons is that he uses a particular type of vehicle and he does not want to run his own transport, but gets a haulier to do it for him. What will happen? If this Amendment is rejected on the general idea that all these Amendments must be rejected, it will <ob/>e. that an individual or firm requiring that specialised type of vehicle will have to get one made and run it as a "C" licence holder. It may well be that he will not use the vehicle to full capacity and, speaking in general terms, transport will not be as efficient as it ought to be. The proposal to reject this Amendment which would enable contract "A" licence holders to have the same freedom, more or less, as "C" licence holders appears to be very petty, and it would compel traders of the sort to whom I have referred to place orders for vehicles. That would be undesirable in the present state of the motor industry, and in the end none of this particular business would he brought into the nationalised transport undertaking.</p>

<p>I apologise for not having been in my place during the whole of this discussion, but I would like to speak particularly on the points made about the contract "A" licences. Even if the Parliamentary Secretary were here, could he say that this was a "wrecking


Amendment," or that it was a matter of great party difference? It is a technical matter, and I hope that we can argue it on those lines. I think that even the hon. Member for Enfield (Mr. Ernest Davies) would support me when I say that the whole aspect of the contract "A" licence was changed when the regulations about the "C" licences were changed. Certain trades have certain reasons for contracting vehicles rather than having vehicles of their own. They prefer to go to a haulier who manages the vehicle for the trader, who advertises on the vehicle. If that situation is changed, one of two things will happen. Either the trader will try to acquire a vehicle with a "C" licence and will run it himself, or he will have to go to the Commission and ask for his goods to be carried. He will consider that less efficient. If that were a satisfactory arrangement, he would have a haulier providing those services for him. I cannot see any justification for including the "A" licence contracts in the Bill.<br/>
I think there is at the present time&#x2014;I hope the situation will be changed in due course&#x2014;one other factor to be taken into consideration. If the Commission takes over haulage with "A" licences, it will take over the "A" licence men's vehicles. Many of these vehicles are of a specialised nature, and the trader will have difficulty in acquiring a new vehicle in getting a "C" licence. Therefore, there will be a considerable gap between his losing his "A" licence vehicle and getting his new vehicle and the "C" licence.</p>

<p>Will the hon. Gentleman inform us why those vehicles should not be used by the Commission for the carrying of that trader's goods in the same way as they are carried by "A" licence contractors?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1389.1" hansard_membership_id="12659" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/19655" speakername="Mr. Poole" colnum="1389" time="">
<p>I think the answer is because, in practically every case, there is a special reason why a trader prefers to have an "A" contract vehicle provided for him permanently, rather than to have a vehicle provided casually. These people are not competing against any particular road haulier. They will not be putting up enormous competition against the Commission. This will not make a great hole in the work that the Commission carries out. Obviously, it is undersirable from

many points of view to increase the number of "C" licences more than is absolutely necessary. I should have thought that in this case it would have been worth the Government's while to have accepted the Amendment, since it does not seem to me to be a major issue, and it does not affect the principle of this Bill.</p>

<p>It does not involve major principles as did the last two Amendments on which we divided. It is rather a matter of small, specialised traders in "A" contract businesses for the special purpose and special convenience of small firms. I do not believe that the right hon. Gentleman really wants to make things more difficult for the little firms which, in the main, will be affected by this Amendment. I do not honestly believe he wants to do that. These little firms like to have a van provided by a haulier, with their own names and advertisements on them, to carry specialised goods. When the vehicles come under the enormously powerful, large system of the Government, these firms cannot hope to have the same special consideration and special vans which carry their own advertisements.</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman wishes to speak, I am sure we shall be delighted to hear him. I know he is an expert, and I am just an ordinary person who happens to see and hear people. I do not move in his high falutin' circles. I think the Ministry of Transport has a kind spot in its hear if only one can find it. I plead for the smaller people, as my friends have done By this Amendment we would help the small specialised businesses. It is exceedingly unlikely that one great, colossal transport business is going to dead with them. I ask the Minister on this Amendment to give something to this side of the House. It would be a concession which would show the human side of the Government to those outside the House and show them that the Government do not use their power ruthlessly to squash every section of the community.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1391.0" hansard_membership_id="8457" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18074" speakername="Sir D. Maxwell Fyfe" colnum="1391" time="">
<p>I should like to deal with one point which the right hon. Gentleman raised, and which I think i., vital to this special problem. The right hon. Gentleman said that he had noted the arguments that the contract "A" licence was in a similar position to the "C" licence. He rejected that argument because the contract ' A vehicle is a vehicle that is hired to carry goods for reward. The position of doth these types of vehicle under the old Road and Rail Act should be borne in mind. It seems to be a most material and consider, able factor. The right hon Gentleman will remember that under that Act, so long as a holder of the contras, "A' vehicle tied himself down to carrying goods for one particular person for a period of up to a year, he was not able to carry the goods of another person. When he put that limitation on himself, he was, under Section I of the Act, in exactly the same position as the holder of the "C" licence under Section 6; that is, he could make application and the application could not be refused.<br/>
That is statutory history. I am sorry to have inflicted it on the right hon. Gentleman, but I think he will see the effect it has on the present position. It means that up to now, the contract "A" vehicle has been in the same position as the "C" licence holder. Therefore the problem the right hon. Gentleman now has to face is why he should change the position that has obtained up to the present. I have tried to appreciate the arguments, but I cannot see why the fact that the person who wishes goods to be moved wants to hire a vehicle which is confined to his goods, should alter the position. At the same time it is perfectly rational that he should want the servicing of his vehicle, or a number of vehicles of which his is one, to be done by an expert; but none the less, the governing factor that the vehicle is being restricted to carrying his goods, and his goods alone, still remains and still, brings it into the same position
12.30 a.m.<br/>
If that is so, then what we are really asking for here is that there should not be a mileage restriction on the contract "A" vehicle, and that the vehicle, by reason of the longer carry that it may do, should be brought in to swell the amount of what is long-distance carriage under the Bill. That seems to us very reason-

able, and there is not a very large number of vehicles involved, because the right hon. Gentleman will appreciate that he has to take the whole of the contract 'A" vehicles and diminish that number in proportion to the number that carry over the 25 miles and the 40miles.agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Oswestry (Mr. Poole) that this Amendment falls into a very different category from the others. It is a very practical one which will affect number of people who have wanted a particular and individual vehicle appropriate to their own needs for special reasons, and they have wanted the upkeep and maintenance of the vehicles to remain with the haulage business. That is not an unreasonable position The Amendment affects a very small number of vehicles, and I suggest that it would not do any harm to the right hon. Gentleman's principles, or affect his Bill, if he were to make a concession in this matter.</p>

This service of "A" contract vehicles has grown up side by side with the "A" licence, the "B" licence and the "C" licence, and has definitely filled a need for which none of the other services catered. The firms which use these types of vehicles&#x2014;and I illustrate my point by giving the instance of chocolate firms, which require a special type of van and also a specialised type of driver&#x2014;could not be served by pool vehicles. In many cases the drivers have to collect cash, to return empties, to give receipts and credit notes, and have to build up at the same time the goodwill of the firm for which they carry. All these services could not be done by a nationalised transport service.&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "Why not? "]&#x2014;Because they not only require a specialised type of van, but trusted workpeople who know the firm's customers, and in a nationalised pool service I cannot believe that they would have the same service. I hope the Minister will reconsider this Amendment sympathetically because there is a need for this service. If he does not give it himself, he will be driving all these services into "C'' licences. By conceding this point&#x2014;and it is a very little one&#x2014;he can surely give greater efficiency to the transport services'</p>

<p>I intervene in this Debate with a strong desire to be helpful, because


judging from some of the speeches tonight, some hon. Members do not know what they are talking about. I hope that, if the Minister is going to reply to this general discussion, he will clarify one point in regard to the "A" licences. Is it true that it is possible, having surveyed a firm to see whether it is eligible to 'be taken over, that its contract "A" vehicles need not necessarily be taken over if they operate outside a 25 miles' limit? It would be a great help to the House and to the country, if we could get it absolutely clear whether, under the Clause we are now discussing, that is correct. As I understand it, we are concerned with whether it is predominantly a long or a short haul. If it is predominantly a long haul, it will be taken over, but if it is a short haul under an "A" licence, it will not he taken over even if it should happen to operate outside the 25 miles' limit.</p>

<p>It the right hon. Gentleman cannot control his own followers, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary, who presumably knows the Minister's case on this Amendment, can put forward the Government's point of view. This is a very important matter. A great deal of laundry is carried in rural areas with the help of these "A" contract vehicles, and if the Minister is to take them over, it will mean great inconvenience in rural areas, with the present shortage of soap. It might even lead to unhealthy conditions for those

who live in the rural areas. As usual, the Government have hit the small man, and the big sinner&#x2014;in their view&#x2014;gets oft because he is a "C" licence holder. It is the very small man who has vehicles for this purpose. With this encouragement, I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will now have sufficient courage to address the House on this matter and not convey that he knows nothing about the "A" licence holder. We have the advantage of having the Solicitor-General with us, and he is at present reading the Minister's brief. If I can go on a little longer, it will give him more time in which to grasp the essentials in that brief, and knowing his capacity for grasping quickly a point put before him, that will be sufficient time for him to understand the Amendment and its implications, as well as the Government's view on the matter. Perhaps he will now be able to address the House and give us an answer to the arguments that have been adduced on this Amendment.</p>

<p>If I may have the leave of the House, perhaps we can, without developing a controversy on a subject which does not really justify it, have a solution to the problem. I do not accept the view put forward that the "A" contract vehicle requires a specialised driver with a particular knowledge of delivery. The average person who undertakes "A" licence work performs it daily and weekly, and there are thousands of such persons in the country. The real point at issue is whether, in equity, a vehicle is for hire and reward. There is no dispute that an "A" contract vehicle comes under that definition. It represents a special contract, and it is probably tied to a particular firm by agreement with the road haulage undertaking. There are many other contracts that are not tied in the same specific form as 'A" contract vehicles, but nevertheless they are carrying goods of other firms regularly week after week. On the point of equity, I cannot possibly see how Parliament should apply to one haulier this test of whether the majority of his journeys are over 40 miles or not while another contractor, because of his special type of contract, is excluded from the Bill. Any "A" contract journey that is below the 25 miles will count in his favour; any journey over 40 miles will count for the long-distance calculation.<br/>
When we talk about the small contractor, who is often trotted out on these occa-


sions, I would remind the House that "A" contract operators would come in only if the majority of their journeys were over 40 miles distance. There are from 8,000 to 10,000 vehicles hired under this system and it is too big a block of vehicles to be treated in any special way. What I have added does not alter substantially the explanation I gave in asking the House to disagree with the Lords Amendment. I hope the House will now come to a decision.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
In some respects, this is similar to the previous Amendment&#x2014;that milk should be excluded from long-distance traffic. This, too, has been debated at length through all the stages of the Bill, but those who desire to accomplish this purpose have, I consider, signally failed to make out a case. Therefore, I should like to repeat again the facts of the situation before the House comes to a decision. A very considerable quantity of milk is carried by rail. Therefore, under the terms of this Bill it would continue to be carried by the Commission. Also, there is a considerable quantity of milk carried in the owners' own vehicles, the "C" licence vehicles. Glass-lined tanks that carry milk are exempt because of the character of the vehicles. The percentage of milk carried by road hauliers probably is not more than from 10 to 20 per cent. of the total. Many of these road haulage organisations pick up the milk&#x2014;that is, the churns&#x2014;at the farm gate and carry them either to creameries, processing plants, or the rail head as the case may be; and I consider that no case has been made out to suggest that the picking up of the churns and taking them either to the creameries or to the rail head requires any special qualification. The Commission will be able to perform that function quite as well as, and probably better than, it is done at the present time, and therefore, I ask the House to disagree with this amendment because there is no reason why the carriage of milk should be exempt.</p>

<p>I am very disappointed. This is an Amendment which the right hon. Gentleman could well accept without feeling that he had given way on a substantial point. The supply of milk is a very serious matter, and hon. members opposite should realise it. Many of us feel that we want an assurance on many points. First, it has been argued&#x2014;and the Minister would be the last to deny it&#x2014;that meat has been accepted and that milk is a very perishable food commodity. On this side we join issue with the Minister, for we maintain that under the Commission there would be delay. The Minister says that the Commission would give as good service, but we do not think there will be the personal touch.

This matter requires personal knowledge and experience in many cases. Those who are engaged in the collection and delivery of milk are farmers or ex-farmers, and they make a point of knowing all the various circumstances. One day milk may be required to be collected at a certain time. The flow of milk changes and arrangements have to be made to meet special circumstances. [<i>Laughter.</i>] Hon. Members opposite may enjoy themselves to their hearts' content, but it will not prevent hon. members on this side of the House from doing their duty. There is another essential required in this matter of the collection and delivery of milk, and it is that the service should be a flexible one, ready to change, whatever circumstances may arise, such as a change in the weather or a change in the place where the milk has to be sent under the orders of the Ministry of Food.<br/>
1.0 a.m.<br/>
The last point I wish to make is that in the past, the collection and delivery of milk has been a very intricate and complicated organisation. It has been built up very largely by the Milk Marketing Board, and it has, as far as I know, given most efficient service. I suggest that the Minister should think two or three times before he is prepared to smash a service which it has taken so long to build up, and which has given such excellent results. The right hon. Gentleman, during one stage of the Bill, said that he would like to be made aware of what the Milk Marketing Board thought about this. The Board has expressed its opinion in no uncertain manner. I hope hon. Members will bear with me if I quote from a letter sent to me by the chairman of the Milk Marketing Board on this matter. He says:
<q>The sudden diversion of loads&#x2014;and we collect from 120,000 farms"&#x2014;</q>
so it is not so small&#x2014;
<q>is a feature in the day-to-day marketing of milk.</q>
He then goes on to say:
<q>The Board determines which individual farm supplies shall be carried by each haulier, and the destination to which the load is to be conveyed. This transport service represents one phase of the wider service of marketing milk which is the Board's primary function, and there would be unnecessary duplication if a second authority"&#x2014;</q>


It is not only the Ministry of Food, but the Transport Commission&#x2014;
<q>Intervenes in this service.</q>
He then states:
<q>The service is under constant review and is being constantly amended to meet the flow of milk.</q>
At the very last moment they may have to change their orders. It may be found that only a certain amount of milk is going, or that instead of its going to a certain place, it has to go somewhere else. Hon. Members cannot possibly maintain that these people could get the same quick alteration of plans from the Transport Commission as they get when they have made these arrangements themselves. I have never known a Government organisation or board to act with the same swiftness as one gets in private enterprise. Hon. Members may have had contrary experiences, but I have not. The chairman of the Milk Marketing Board finishes with these serious words:
<q>I trust, as chairman of the Milk Marketing Board, that after a final review of our case, the Minister will feel able to add the carriage of milk to the lost of excluded traffic, in the same way as meat and livestock. In that way duplication of control by two statutory bodies can be avoided, and the delay which that would cause.</q>
That is our case, and we put it forward with all earnestness to the right hon. Gentleman. The supply of milk is a vital service, and I hope the right hon. Gentleman will ask himself seriously whether that service will be carried out as efficiently under his proposals. We on this side of the House do not believe it. I am prepared to concede that the Minister is earnest in his views, but at the same time I would like him to know of the responsibility which he will be taking over. I would like to point out to him that if the milk is not delivered he will be responsible all over the country for the supplies being carried in an inefficient way. It is a responsibility which I would not be prepared to assume if I were in his shoes.</p>

<p>I must say that, of all the Amendments in the Order Paper, I am most surprised that the Government are not prepared to accept this Amendment. I feel that the reason is partly that the right hon. Gentleman has not got all the facts correctly in connection with the supply of milk. First, this Bill applies only to 18 per cent. of the total milk

supplies of the country. I know that there are certain exempted traffics&#x2014;tanks and the like, and milk which has not travelled more than 25 miles from the farm&#x2014;but there will be a disorganisation in not allowing that 18 per cent. of milk traffic to be exempted. The Milk Marketing Board have clone excellent service in co-ordinating the milk traffic, and they actually take milk from 120,000 farms in England and Wales.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, Mr. Deputy-Speaker. It has been stated that a great deal of milk is transported by rail. In fact, the figure is 0.4 per cent. of the milk traffic, and that, I suggest, is not a high figure. In the Committee stage of the Bill, the Minister, in reply to the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Renton), said that this business of transporting milk was not so much one of a contracting, interest as an accounting interest. In other words, it was a matter of figures. The Minister said that he was speaking not so much as a Minister, but as one who had had great experience in this trade. What are the facts? In addition to operating its own fleets, 3,945 vehicles are operated on its behalf. I give these facts because the Minister should know them. The Government speakers in another place said that the Milk Marketing Board did not actually carry milk. The Boards owns between 200 and 300 commercial vehicles collecting and carrying milk, and with that number I suggest that they are very large hauliers. The motion to reject this Amendment is based on false information. There is a co-ordination of transport in existence. If the Minister takes over this 18 per cent. he will create great chaos in the distribution of milk, and of all perishable articles, milk is perhaps the most perishable. I ask the Minister to reconsider his view.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1402.4" hansard_membership_id="6726" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/22375" speakername="Mr. York" colnum="1402" time="">
<p>I would like to deal with the question of how the Milk Marketing Board is to be treated. The Minister has not mentioned that co-operative organisation, I am sorry to say, but it is the producers' main weapon, and so far as I can see from the figures that have been


given, there are to be three different types of operator to deal with the milk supply. Today, under a very carefully worked out scheme, the Milk Marketing Board has the complete confidence of the Ministry of Food. It delivers the goods to the satisfaction of all concerned, and it uses one type of organisation&#x2014;in addition to the amount that comes in glass lined tanks on the railways, I admit. I am surprised that the figure is only 0.4 per cent., for I should have thought it was rather larger.<br/>
What will happen if this Amendment is not accepted? First, most of the milk will be handled by the small carriers who operate over distances of less than 25 miles. In addition, we shall get the Commission coming in for those areas which extend beyond the 25 miles' radius, unless the Commission use the powers contained in the Amendment with which we agreed a short time ago. I shall have a word to say about that in a minute Thus we shall get two separate organisations working in the same area, and, if not in the same area, certainly under the mantle of the Milk Marketing Board's co-ordination scheme. In addition to that, we shall get a third type of collection, and that will be by the "C" licence dairy companies.<br/>
I had some experience of milk distribution during the war, and I have no love of anything in the way of organisation or of investigation handled by a Government Department. I had in my own constituency a case which shows how much reliance we can place upon the investigation which may take place under the Commission. In the particular circumstances, in Nidderdale, there was a small haulier, and the Ministry of Food, in their wisdom, decided to put that man out of business, because they said the job could be done much more economically by a larger haulier. So they set to work to try to do this. Fortunately, the whole of the dale was up in arms, and, with a certain amount of pressure from myself, we fought that case. I was actually given a categorical set of figures and information by the Ministry of Food which proved in the end to be wholly inaccurate. As a result of my finding what the proper figures were, we did eventually&#x2014;it took about six months&#x2014;get that decision reversed. That is exactly the type of case which will come before the Commission, and which may get the same cursory and

inadequate investigation as was given by the Ministry of Food; and it may be a very much more difficult case to undo than in that instance I have mentioned. Therefore, I say we should not place much reliance upon the possibilities of investigation by this Commission.<br/>
1.15 a.m.<br/>
It has been stated that specialised vehicles are not required for this work; but that I believe to be inaccurate, in a number of cases&#x2014;I am not quite sure how many. There is a large number of vehicles operating on the roads today which are used almost wholly, if not wholly, for the carriage of milk churns I believe they could also carry beer barrels if there were any beer. I doubt very much if a joint organization for carrying milk and beer would be an easy one to handle. If there are specialised areas where there is a large number of vehicles used in the carriage of milk churns, I think we ought to know. I think the Minister has got to show us what the position is in regard to the Milk Marketing Board.<br/>
Whatever the right hon. Gentleman may say, there is no safeguard that the Commission will investigate and pronounce accurately and fairly as to whether a particular case is or is not to be exempted. I am sure that if the Minister persists in refusing this Amendment, he will not only break up&#x2014;break down, if you like&#x2014;what is now acknowledged on every side to be a thoroughly efficient organisation, but he will also have to bear the onus when the market supplies slow down as a result of bringing this part of the Bill into force. Therefore, I hope that he realises what he is doing in breaking up this organisation. The effect of his inability to see the practical difficulties of what he is doing will place upon him the responsibility for a breakdown in the milk distribution industry which it has taken farmers and the Milk Marketing Board many years to build up. That is not the sort of thing which should happen as a side wind under the Transport Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1404.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. McKie" colnum="1404" time="">
<p>I hope the Minister will think again on this matter. I represent the biggest dairy constituency in this country, and I cannot for one moment accept the figures given by the Minister with regard to their difficulties <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> long-distance haulage. Nearly all the farms in my constituency are between 80 and 100 miles from the Glasgow distribut-


ing centre. I can assure the Minister that if he does not think again, chaos will immediately ensue in that very important milk producing area, and I am sure that is not what the Minister wants. I impress upon him the fact that he certainly did not give the House an accurate picture of the situation, especially so far as Scotland is concerned.<br/>
The effect of the policy of this Government as also of the previous Government and the Government before that, has been to encourage milk production above everything els in agriculture. Possibly that has been overdone; perhaps the true balance has not been held But what do we see in the Bill as it now stands? The carriage of meat is to be allowed and the carriage of milk is to be excluded as a result of the Minister's refusal to accept the Lords Amendment. This certainly mystifies me. If the Government live up to their maxim and encourage milk production over meat, why include meat and exclude milk? I should have thought the right hon. Gentleman would have joined with us, if there was to be a choice, by including milk and excluding meat. We are told that too much eating of meat is bad for blood pressure, and that the consumption and production of milk should be encouraged. Surely, if the Minister thinks on those lines and is prepared to act accordingly, he will see that this is a reasonable Amendment and on second thoughts, in order to avoid a complete breakdown which undoubtedly there will be, particularly in Scotland, he will agree with the Lords Amendments.</p>

<p>I should like to tell the House that it is not only farmers from the North of England and Scotland who are concerned in this matter. Those in the South are equally anxious that the economies in their co-ordination schemes should not be lost. One of the most interesting exhibits in the Royal Show at Lincoln was on the stand of the Milk Marketing Board, where they had a demonstration of the whole of their collecting system, how it was planned, routed, and how many churns a lorry could take up. The right hon. Gentleman is quite wrong in saying that this is not a specialised job, for it is a specialised job, and that is how the Milk Marketing Board have achieved their economies. It is difficult to believe that nationalised transport will achieve the same results, and the Minister would be well advised to

leave well alone. I cannot see what advantage he or the Commissioners will get from this provision of the Bill. They will not do the job more economically from the point of view of the producer or the consumer.</p>

<p>During the last six months quite a number of hon. Gentlemen opposite have asked me to give them particulars about the Northern Ireland Transport Board of which I have been a member since its inception, with the exception of the war years, and I think it is not without significance to point out that milk was excluded from the operations of the Northern Ireland Transpert Board in the 1935 Act. Over there milk production has increased out of all knowledge, and during last year millions of gallons have been supplied to the city of Glasgow from the surplus of whole milk produced in Northern Ireland. At present there is a surplus which cannot be taken by that great city, and I think it gives some idea of the production, and a better one than could be obtained by quoting figures.<br/>
Being very interested in this Transport I have re-studied the system of the transport of milk which enables the supplies not only to come to the cities, but to be shipped overseas. It is a tremendously specialised job which involves seven days' work a week, at all hours and I am very doubtful whether it could be handled successfully by a nationalised scheme of transport. The.-e is in this case, a working example to be seen by any Member who cares to look at it in operation. The transport industry has been doing a very successful job, and it has been left on its own to accomplish it. Instead of disagreeing with the Amendment, would it not be possible for the Minister to say that later on, having gone into the matter and seen what is taking place in Northern Ireland, a scheme would be framed? At any rate over there, the transport of milk has been kept outside the operation of the Northern Ireland Transport Board, and I think that is worthy of note.</p>

<p>I want to add one word by way of a request to the Minister to look at this matter again and do something about it. I represent one of the Divisions of the County of Somerset, which is one of the


oldest milk-producing counties in England. I will not quote figures, but everyone knows that a high proportion of agricultural activities in Somerset is devoted, as has always been the case, to the production of milk. I have been looking at this thing on the spot to try to get some picture of how it will work in my own county. The picture I have is very alarming indeed. What strikes me most is the question of elasticity. The difficulty is once we get a system which is as centrally controlled as this system is bound to be&#x2014;I do not say that it is to be controlled from Whitehall, or any nonsense of that kind, because it will not be, though it is bound to be more centrally controlled than the present system&#x2014;the reaction to sudden diversion is slowed down, just at the moment when sudden diversion has to be carried out.<br/>
That would not matter very much if a perishable commodity like milk were not being dealt with, but we have to remember that, in addition to dealing with such a perishable commodity, we are dealing also with a most intricate network of narrow lanes and roads in the country. If, suddenly, supplies are diverted down one of those side roads, there are bound to be most appalling difficulties when there are zones centrally controlled. There will be long delays in picking up supplies, and deliveries will be made at the wrong place. During the war years, and in the recent extreme weather, we had some experience of sudden diversion. I do not think the Minister, no matter how strongly he believes in this system, would claim that it is likely to be more elastic than the present one. If he is claiming that, I hope he will tell us so, though I do not see that he has really any grounds for so believing.<br/>
In the present elastic system the greatest problem is that of handling. The men working in this business and dealing with the milk have been engaged in it for years, especially in a county like Somerset. Long before there was any Milk Marketing Board, Somerset was a great milk supplying area for such places as Bristol and South Wales. The men who are engaged in milk production in that county know what they are talking about. They are unanimous in declaring that the Minister's proposal will not work as efficiently as the present system. The

Minister will make a grave mistake if he does not accept this Amendment.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the argument about milk appears to be a one-sided argument tonight. There are a number of Socialists who represent agricultural constituencies, and I should have thought it would have been interesting to the House and to their constituencies for them to give their views on a matter which cannot be a controversy between parties. It is a question of what will be best for agriculture and for the health of our people. The hon. and gallant Member for King's Lynn (Major Wise), who occupies a distinguished position in the Socialist Party in regard to agriculture, should tell the House what he thinks of the Minister's proposal to take away from the Milk Marketing Board and the Ministry of Food the question of allocating milk supplies, for that is what it boils down to. It is true to say that in certain areas school children are not going to get supplies of milk sufficient to meet their needs. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] It means that in certain parts the hospitals are going to have their supply of milk delayed. [HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] I am trying to explain to hon. Members how the existing organisation operates. I should have thought that if they had listened carefully while I was trying to explain it, they would have understood why.</p>

<p>In another place, when this matter was raised, the Lord Chancellor drew attention to the fact that the carriage of milk was not a specialised carriage and that the vehicles could be used for the carriage of other commodities. That is against the regulations of the Milk Marketing Board and the Ministries of Food and Health. That is why, if there is a system of having milk sent with other loads by the Transport Commission it will jeopardise its safety for hospitals. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I should have thought the hon. Member for Reading (Mr. Mikardo) would have had a more humble attitude towards his leaders. After all, the Lord Chancellor is now a Socialist. If the Minister of Food were to regard the Transport Commission as the best body, the safest body, to transport this 18 per cent, of milk, even if we did not disagree with this Amendment it would be open to


the Minister of Food and the Transport Commission to turn over this work to the nationalised industry. This Amendment would not stop that happening. The allocation is made at the present time by a reputable board under the Milk Marketing Act and by the Ministry of Food. Why does the Minister fear the competition of the men at present carrying milk for the Milk Marketing Board? I hope that hon. Gentlemen opposite who represent agricultural constituencies, will give the House their views on this Amendment. Are they prepared to say that what the Minister is proposing is a safe thing for the children and other consumers of milk, and an economic thing for this country?</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman asked the House to disagree with this Amendment on the ground that no sufficient argument had been put forward in favour of the case for it. The arguments in favour of the Amendment were fully set out in another place, and I think we have heard substantial arguments in favour of the Amendment since the right hon. Gentleman spoke. If he really meant that he wished this Amendment to be rejected, lie did not show the reasons why the change in the present system should be made. I venture to think that his opinion may have been altered after he has heard many opinions put forward for his consideration.<br/>
Moreover, I think the argument should be the other way round. The right hon. Gentleman has adduced no reasons whatsoever why the present system should be changed, and if a change is to take place in the present system, surely the House is entitled to receive some argument in favour of that change. We have, on the other hand, had the benefit of the acceptance of the maintenance of the existing principle with regard to the carriage of other perishable commodities. No argument has been put forward to show why this particular perishable commodity should be separated from meat, livestock, and other things of that sort. I am not surprised that neither the Minister of Agriculture nor his Parliamentary Secretary is present. Both of them would have great difficulty in sitting on that Bench and listening to the proposals now being advocated for the disruption of the organisation of milk distribution which they have played a great Dart in building up.<br/>
An argument has been advanced against some other Amendments that they were wrecking Amendments, because they were of so much substance. I do not accent that argument as correct. But now the Government advance, in regard to this Amendment, the argument that it is of little substance because it affects so small a part of the trade that is carried. The Government cannot have it both ways. Why should they seek to impress the House with an argument one way on one Amendment, and at another time use an argument the other way? Naturally it is a small proportion of the trade that is carried, but it is a vitally important proportion, and if&#x2014;owing to the disruption of the system that has been built up over many years, and which has, in consequence of trial and experience, reached something that is near perfection&#x2014;the milk distribution system of this country is jeopardised, the one claim that the Government can make at the present time about increased food supplies will go by the board. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to bear that in mind when he ha s to face his Cabinet colleagues about the breakdown of milk distribution.<br/>
May I put another point for the right hon. Gentleman's consideration? We why are in closer association with the question of agricultural distribution realise, perhaps even more than he has had the opportunity of doing, how essential it is to have a flexible service. Often it happens that for one reason or another, the collection from the farms, and the distribution, has to be switched in regard to both time and place. Suppose a lorry is collecting 10 miles from its centre, and is delivering within a radius of 25 miles, and it is switched to deliver to a point which takes it outside the 25 miles; is the driver or the owner of that lorry going to be able to obey an instruction, and switch in that way, without feeling that he is jeopardising his position as a shortdistance haulier? He will be going outside his radius to fulfil a necessity, but I think that will be an occasion when the delivery and distribution of milk will be jeopardised.<br/>
If that happens, what will arise in connection with claims relating to this perishable commodity? Many claims are bound to arise, and hardship will be caused to farmers if, because of delays due to this or many other reasons, the milk goes bad. It will be very difficult to decide


when the milk went bad. It is hard enough to do that under the present system, but in future, when questions such as those I have described arise owing to the switching or alteration of routes, it is going to be infinitely harder, and the claims for compensation will be substantial and extremely difficult.<br/>
Finally, I appeal to the Minister to revise his original opinion&#x2014;first, because he has given no ground whatever why the present system should be discarded and the new system brought into force, and, secondly, because in the interests of the consumers of the country there is no clue or indication, and no presumption, that they will be better served by whatever plan, if any, the Minister has. He has given no indication of his plans for carrying out his new proposals.</p>

<p>May I hark back to the West Country. In Devonshire, we produce even better milk than Somerset, and we are very proud of our milk transport system&#x2014;both as regards the county and the Milk Board organisation. I would like to echo the plea of my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Hurd) that the Minister should leave well alone in this matter, and accept the Lords Amendment.</p>

<p>I think my hon. Friends have built up a formidable case for the Minister to answer. We had some discussion on these matters, as the Minister will remember, in Committee and at that time I suggested that he should take account of the views of the Milk Marketing Board on this subject. I was not at that time aware of the views of the Board. I received a letter from the chairman of the Milk Marketing Board only today in which he expressed his views most clearly and enclosed a copy of a letter he had addressed to the Minister. The Ministry have acknowledged the letter formally, but no further reply has been received. The chairman of the Milk Marketing Board has very considerable responsibilities with regard to marketing, and I should have thought the representations which he made would be considered very carefully by the Minister. He put a very strong case in his letter to the Minister and most of the points have already been admirably put by Members on this side of the House. I do not propose to go over them again. I urge the Minister to think again on this

matter, and particularly not to take the very unnecessary risk which it appears he is going to take in this regard. Nobody has suggested that this question of the transport of milk is not being satisfactorily tackled at the present time by the Board, and it does seem very extraordinary that a new Board should be set up to take on some of the work of a Board set up by a previous Government.<br/>
I suggest that the difficulties of milk transport are rather more considerable than the Minister has so far recognised. There are all sorts of fluctuations to which attention has to be paid. There are occasions when there is a glut of milk in particular parts of the country, and others when there are considerable reductions of supply. There are times when great variations are caused&#x2014;such as at school holidays, at weekends, during holiday rushes, and so on. There was an occasion not long ago&#x2014;I hardly dare to mention it&#x2014;when there was a strike of workers of the Co-operative Society, and that resulted in a considerable diversion of milk suddenly from Essex to another county. All these things happen, and it is rather a difficult job.<br/>
1.45 a.m.<br/>
The Milk Marketing Board have had very considerable experience of doing this job, and they have done the job very well indeed. I cannot understand how it is that the Minister wants to take away from the Board this job which they are doing satisfactorily and to take upon himself the unnecessary risk of depriving himself of their services and doing it himself. Surely, he has enough troubles on his hands. All the new tasks which the Ministry is taking upon itself now will need a great deal of doing. This is a job which has been perfectly well done by the Board, which was set up under the approval of Parliament. It has done the job very satisfactorily, and I ask the Minister to reconsider his opposition to this Amendment, and to accept it.</p>

<p>If, with the leave of the House, I may speak again, I will reply to one or two points. I take the figures which the hon. Member for Buckrose (Mr. Wadsworth) gave, that approximately r8 per cent. of milk supplies at the outside are affected by this Amendment. I also gather that there is practically complete unanimity, among those who have asked me to reconsider the position, that the Milk Marketing Board are doing a good


job on this occasion. The Milk Marketing Board are a statutory body and they are working on the lines of centralised control of the milk supply&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Co-ordinated."]&#x2014;Centrally co-ordinated.&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Not centrally."] I thought hon. Members said that the Milk Marketing Board were doing the job. Are they doing it or not? Surely, there is no dispute now among hon. Members. I cannot see their point in introducing the Milk Marketing Board into this discussion, unless they are satisfied that the Milk Marketing Board, with centrally controlled distribution, is doing a very good job. I would like to know if that is their case or not; otherwise, the Milk Marketing Board has nothing to do with this matter.</p>

<p>Centralised control is a quite different thing from administration. Of course, it is centralised control, but the actual action and order given is decentralised to a very high degree. The system would never work under the Milk Marketing Board unless there were decentralisation.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1413.1" hansard_membership_id="928" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28712" speakername="Mr. Barnes" colnum="1413" time="">
<p>If that is the case, I cannot understand why, when we are to shift to the Transport Board, it should be assumed that the Transport Commission will not be able to do the job as efficiently as the Milk Marketing Board. Let me come to the question of decentralisation. I made it plain that there is nothing in this Clause or in the measure of control which we are proposing to institute that will affect 80 per cent. of the milk that is now handled through the machinery of the Milk Marketing Board. Of the 18 per cent. that is in dispute, I think hon. Members will agree that a very large proportion of it is short-distance milk carried by road. I say that it is, and hon. Members in argument have proved that case.<br/>
The only point really raised in this Debate concerned the occasions when it is necessary to divert the milk. In the ordinary way the bulk of the milk carried by road is within the 25 miles radius. It is not affected at all. The only point I am now dealing with under the Amendment is whether the milk traffic of an operator should be computed within the test of whether he is in fact a long-distance operator or not. If an operator is carrying a quantity of milk in churns&#x2014;because it cannot be in a glass-lined tank&#x2014;it can-

not be a "C" licence vehicle; if that operator, for hire or reward, is carrying churns of milk for 40 miles, on what grounds of equity should that traffic be excluded from this Bill?&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Meat.") In the case of meat, 80 per cent. is carried less than 25 miles, and the majority of long-distance meat is carried in insulated vehicles of the meat organisation. When one comes to milk, the question is raised whether the small percentage of traffic carried for 40 miles could not be equitably excluded from the long-distance provisions. I have listened to the discussion on milk all through the proceedings on this Bill, and I know of no matter which has been subject to greater exaggeration or more grossly misunderstood that this commodity. If a long-distance operator is carrying mill: and his business is taken over by the Transport Commission and passes to the Road Executive, the business of the Mill: Marketing Board need not be interrupted because a haulier business ceases to belong to a private company and becomes part of the Transport Commission. If the Commission has to carry out any particular milk transport, it can fall in with the scheme just as well as any private operator.</p>

<p>It certainly will not have control over the Executive, but it will have the same service and will be able to give the same directions, if you like, with regard to a consignment of milk carried on a lorry operated by the Transport Commission, as it could to any private haulier carrying its milk supplies.</p>

<p>Certainly. The Commission will be able to carry out the task of moving milk, just as it can carry out the task of moving any other commodity. My final observation is that the arguments put forward today, and on another occasion in another place, about disturbing the machinery of distribution of the Milk Marketing Board have not been sustained.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to get a permit if a haulier exceeds the 25 miles radius. If a sudden emergency arises and a milk haulier wants to take milk for more than the permitted distance,


is it not the case that he will not be able to get the necessary permit from the Transport Commission in the necessary time?</p>

<p>I do not consider there would be any difficulty in the Road Executive of the British Transport Commission coming to arrangements to deal with any sudden traffic emergency. One might imagine that these things are not done every day in the field of road transport. Actually, they are quite a common occurrence in the industry, and the British Transport Commission, with its organisation and the extensive range of vehicles and services under its control, will be equal to them. Any suggestion that the organisation will not be able to perform these services as well as the limited organisations do today would not stand a moment's examination. With regard to the issuing of permits, I am sure that the Commission, working in co-operation with the Milk Marketing Board, will be able to meet all emergencies. In fact, day by day, in all kinds of industries, and under all kinds of circumstances, there will be similar transport emergencies.</p>

<p>Are we really to be fobbed off in this way? I am certainly not clear about this matter, although I have listened to at least the last sir speeches, and I was on the Standing Committee; and I am quite sure that other hon. Members on this side are as uncertain. Hon. Members opposite think that every question can be answered merely by saying that the Commission can give just as good, or better, service than the private people are giving today&#x2014;[An HON. MEMBER: "It is being done with coal"]&#x2014;The Government have still to prove that it can be done with coal, but, in any case, that is not the argument. My argument is that

it is of no use saying the Commission can and will provide a better service, and then sitting back with the hope that it will. Hauliers are restricted to the 25 miles limit, and we are all agreed that, in the case of milk, sudden diversions are likely and necessary&#x2014;diversions which would normally take the vehicles outside the 25 miles limit.<br/>
There are three things which can be done. The haulier can, first, break the law, secondly, he can get a permit, or, thirdly, he can transfer the milk to one of the Commission's lorries. Of course, what will happen, if the haulier is keen to get the milk to the right place at the right time, is that he will break the law. Is it suggested that one can get a permit to divert a lorry over 25 miles within two or three hours? I ask the Minister, can one?&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: Why not?]&#x2014; Well, if one can get the permit which becomes necessary, it is quite obvious that there is to be machinery set up to enable these diversions to be catered for. But it has to be remembered that these diversions occur daily. If we are to have a permit issued with that ease every day, what is the purpose of having permits at all? One has to make a proper application and say for what one needs it. Or is one, as in the Army, going to ring up and say, "Can we go to such and such a place?" These are all important matters. I do not mind telling hon. Members opposite that, within a year or eighteen months, they will be answering these questions when the crisis has occurred.<br/>
The Minister has certainly not given an explanation of why he is now seeking to introduce the Transport Commission into part of the milk distributing system when the Milk Marketing Board are apparently running the thing properly. I have no interest in milk, except that I represent a rural constituency. It is not, indeed, a question of milk: it is a question of proper administration. I do not believe there is an atom of foresight on the Government Front Bench. I am quite convinced that the reason the Minister cannot give satisfactory answers tonight is that he does not know what is going to happen. He has not looked into it, and he is just hoping.</p>

<p>This Debate has served two or three useful purposes. I had always understood that the Socialist Party were rather proud of the Milk Marketing


Board. It took a considerable time to build up its transport system. Having built it up, largely by the help of outside people&#x2014;at least, by the help of their knowledge&#x2014;and having created a system which is really doing something to help agriculture and to bring good food in the form of milk to the people, the Government are now setting up this new system. We are to tack the present system on to another system which is far bigger. It cannot have any other than one effect. It means the reorganisation of the milk apply all over again. When we have built up a system in this way, it is rather a pity to throw it over in the manner the Minister is doing.<br/>
It is rather interesting to note this further point. We have had on a good many occasions from hon. and right hon. Gentleman on the other side, the profession of a desire to organise agriculture and milk and other things in a high degree; a profession of concern for them. It is, however, quite obvious from the Minister's reply that he shares the rather common feeling on the Government Front</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
This Amendment deals with what is to happen when the matter comes before the Arbitration Tribunal, and it is to be decided whether a particular undertaking is a long-distance haulage undertaking within the meaning of Clause 39 of the Bill. What the Amendment seeks to do is place the whole onus of proof on the Commission that the undertaking is such an undertaking. We seek to leave out that Amendment and to restore the Clause to what it was before it went to another place, because we feel that the Amendment is based on a misconception of what has been done by this Clause.<br/>
The Amendment is based upon the view that when the matter comes before the Arbitration Tribunal, it is a law suit between rival claimants, and that the Commission is perfectly free to make a claim for certain relief against the owners of the undertaking or not to make that claim before the Arbitration Tribunal, and that it is perfectly free to establish that claim or not. That is a complete misunderstanding as to the system upon which this Clause is drafted. After all, it is the policy of the Bill that when undertakings which comply with the description under Clause 39 are to be taken over, the Commission is not in any sense in the position of a free litigant voluntarily going before a court seeking relief, for which it is free to ask or not. The Commission is charged with a certain duty, and it is the duty of the Commission to form a certain opinion. If that opinion is that the activities of an undertaking come within Clause 39, the notice of acquisition has to be served. It is quite wrong, in my submission to the House, to place

the Commission in the same position as a free litigant when it has, perforce, a duty placed upon it, which it has no option to, refuse. It is not right in those circumstances to try to assimilate the position of such a body to the position of a perfectly free litigant.<br/>
It is not perhaps unreasonable to say that a private litigant, when he is seeking relief, must frame a case that he is entitled to that relief. The position vie are considering here is entirely different, and if hon. Members will look at the Clause, they will see that it is founded on a different assumption. What happens when a matter comes before the Tribunal? The Tribunal is charged with the duty of making inquiries to order to ascertain whether the requirements of Clause 39 are fulfilled or not. The key to the thing is in Clause 41. If hon. Members will look at Clause 41, they will see how the plan is to be worked out. Clause 41 (1, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>) sets out two alternative tests which are to be applied. If they are applied and the tribunal is satisfied, then the undertaking is deemed to carry on a long-distance haulage business.<br/>
This Clause then deals with the case in which it is not possible for the Commission to arrive at a complete and absolute certainty as a result of the application of those tests and other factors. If hon. Members will look at the concluding words of Subsection (1), they will see that the Tribunal is charged with the duty of doing what it thinks right in all the circumstances which obtain, after an inquiry into all the circumstances. That is how it is meant to work. The position, in other words, is that the Bill sets up a Tribunal, and if a certain eventuality arises, the Tribunal is charged with the duty of making inquiries. Therefore, the Tribunal is really the sponsor of the investigation. The two parties, the Commission and the undertaking, are represented, and it is for the Tribunal to inquire into the circumstances. There is no reason in these circumstances why the onus should be placed on the Commission to do what a private litigant might well be expected to do. It is for the Tribunal to apply these tests, and if it cannot arrive at some decision by these two tests, then it has to do what is reasonable and fair in the circumstances.<br/>
It may often be extremely difficult to ascertain from records that do exist pre-


cisely what the application of alternative tests may be. There may not be adequate records. Some records are not kept for a long period of time. It may be extremely difficult, as a matter of fact, to obtain the necessary information. The Tribunal will be in a much better position than the Commission to do that, because the Arbitration Act will be applied to the appreciation of the circumstances. Under the 1889 Act, the Tribunal have powers to require both sides to submit to investigation and power to require the production of documents, and it is perfectly competent for the Tribunal to do what it may be extremely difficult for the Commission to do.<br/>
It may be extremely difficult for the Commission, in the position of a plaintiff claiming relief, to produce evidence very often entirely in the possession of the undertaking. If the Commission is charged with the duty of discharging beyond any reasonable doubt, the onus of showing that the undertaking has carried on long-distance haulage, it will over and over again fail to discharge that duty. In point of fact, the evidence is there, and if it can be produced by the Tribunal, then it can be shown perfectly clearly to be an undertaking as contemplated under the 1939 Bill.<br/>
I hope I have satisfied hon. Gentlemen opposite. I believe they feel most strongly on this point. I believe our side is in agreement with the view I am advancing. I hope hon. Gentlemen opposite also share the same view, but if they do not, I urge on them that if we want the object of the Bill to be carried out, if we want to make it possible for long-distance haulage undertakings to be taken over without obstruction, without delay and without difficulties being placed in the way owing to defective records, and if we want the purpose of the Bill not to be hindered, it is obviously reasonable to say that it shall be the Tribunal that will be charged with the duty of conducting the investigation. If hon. Members do not share that view, they will put the Commission in the position of a petitioning plaintiff and will bring about the result, over and over again, through a deficiency of proof when there is available evidence if it could be produced, that the Commission will fail in making out its claim, so that one after

another haulage undertaking which should be brought under public ownership will be left out for that reason.<br/>
I strongly urge the House that the correct view of what is happening in this case is not that it is a suit as between two contending private parties. It is not. It is a Commission charged with exercising a duty under the Measure, and it is a Tribunal which is charged with certain duties, including the duty of making an inquiry into a doubtful issue. It is for that reason that Clause 41 (1) is framed as it is, to put the whole matter in the discretion of the Tribunal&#x2014;as it does in its concluding sentence&#x2014;where the result of the two tests in Subsection 1, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> does not lead to certainty in the matter. I hope the House will think that is right.</p>

<p>In some ways, in view of the wealth of legal talent on the Bench below me, it may appear a little inappropriate that I should reply to the Solicitor-General. I am not put up as an insult to the Solicitor-General, but because the point of law involved is of such an elementary character that my right hon. Friends think that even I can deal with it. Perhaps it would be most convenient if I first dealt with the principle that we are seeking to establish, and then went on to deal with the reasons that the Solicitor-General advanced why the principle should not apply in this case.<br/>
The principle is a simple one. It is that the onus or burden of proving any particular fact should normally rest with the person who asserts the fact. That is the principle we are trying to establish. I think it will commend itself to all sides of the House. It certainly did so a few hours ago. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for the Combined English Universities (Mr. H. Strauss) was alleging that Lord Latham had been offered a post. Immediately hon. Members opposite challenged him on the evidence on which he put that forward. One could take that example or many others. If a man does murder, it is the duty of the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute him, but the onus is on the prosecution to prove their case. It is the duty of the Minister of Pensions to provide those pensions which are laid down by Parliament, but if I claim a pension from him, I have to establish that I am a widow, or whatever


it may be. I cannot understand what the Solicitor-General's point was about the onus being somehow different if there was a duty on some body. There is a duty on the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute in a case of murder, but that does not shift the onus of proof. There is a a duty on the Minister of Pensions to provide pensions, but that does not shift the onus of proof. The argument is wholly irrelevant to the issue we are discussing.<br/>
2.30 a.m.<br/>
What we say here is simply that the principle shall apply in this case&#x2014;that where the Commission is of the opinion that a firm is a long-distance firm and claims that it should be taken over, then the Commission should be in the same position as an individual, and the onus or burden of proving that fact should be placed upon it. Why should the State be put in a different or more advantageous position than the individual? This is a matter of common justice. If you try a man for his life, or if his liberty is involved, the onus is upon the prosecution. The same rule should apply where his livelihood is to be taken away. It is not only a matter of common justice, but of common convenience and common sense.<br/>
As to the task which is going to confront the Tribunal, we have already discussed some of the considerations which will come before it&#x2014;whether over a particular period a certain number of lorries travel a certain distance, whether they will travel outside a certain radius, and the rather complex provisions, to which the Solicitor-General referred, in Clause 41. All these complex facts come out at some stage of the proceedings before the Tribunal. It is inevitable that there will be cases in which it will not be easy to say on which side the balance of advantage will lie, and when it will not be easy to say on which side the Tribunal should come down. It is just to provide for cases of that kind that the doctrine of the onus of proof has been introduced. When any tribunal or court finds itself in the position in which the arguments on both sides are nicely balanced, it says: "Whose job is it to prove this?" Failing such a course, some instructions have to be given to the Tribunal; even the Solicitor-General admits you cannot leave that matter in the air. What he has done&#x2014;or what the draftsmen have done in consultation with the Law Officers of the Crown

&#x2014;has been to introduce something really novel and really remarkable in substitution of the Common Law rule for the onus of proof. This substitute for 100 years of Common Law is worth reading:
<q>Provided that if the information available in any such proceedings is insufficient to enable the tribunal to conclude either that one or other of the said conditions was satisfied as aforesaid or that neither of the conditions was so satisfied, the tribunal shall determine that the activities of the undertaking in the said year, so far as they consisted of the carriage of goods in goods vehicles in respect of which licences were in force, consisted to a predominant extent of ordinary long distance carriage for hire and reward, if it appears to the tribunal, from the information available in those proceedings, that those activities ought, in all the circumstances, properly to be regarded as having consisted to a predominant extent of such carriage.</q>
May I translate it? What it means is that if that Tribunal has not the faintest idea whether the undertaking is long-distance or short-distance, it will have a case. It will take into account information and circumstances which, <i>ex hypothesi,</i> are not that information and circumstances which Parliament has laid down for the proceedings, but other information and circumstances the nature of which we are not informed. I think that is a terribly poor substitute for the ordinary rules laid down in the courts and arbitration tribunals of this country, the straightforward principle of onus of proof. I think the Solicitor-General will bear me out when I say that they have never been introduced into any code before. They are wholly novel. I do not think the Solicitor-General understands them, and I am quite certain that I do not understand them, and I do not think that anyone in the House understands them. In the circumstances we are placing a wholly unwarranted burden on the Tribunal.<br/>
I pass now to the arguments which were advanced by the Solicitor-General as to why this onus of proof could not apply in this case. The same arguments were advanced by the highest legal authority in this country in another place. He said that this is quite different from any ordinary case where you have two contending parties before an arbitration tribunal. He said&#x2014;and I have his exact words here&#x2014;that there is no choice in the matter, there is no option. Well, that is not quite true. I was under the same delusion as the Solicitor-General. As a matter of fact, there is an option. It escaped my attention that an Amendment


had been introduced in another place which, in fact, gives the Commission an option as to whether they take over or not, and the introduction of that Amendment knocks the bottom completely out of the case of the Lord Chancellor and the Solicitor-General. There is nothing left of that case. The whole basis of that argument now disappears.<br/>
I think that the final point the Solicitor-General made was that in some cases it is difficult for the claimant to make out his case as he has not access to all the evidence. I know that there are cases in law where Parliament in its wisdom has deliberately shifted the onus. One case occurs to me. When a man is found in possession of goods proved to be recently stolen, the onus is upon him in such circumstances. But these road transport hauliers are not men in possession of goods recently stolen. These are road hauliers carrying on a perfectly respectable business. Why should they be put into the narrow class of criminals who, for one reason or another, have been put into a particular position under criminal law?<br/>
Briefly, I would say that we want the ordinary common principles of the Common Law introduced into this matter. We say that if a man's livelihood is to be taken away, it is up to those who want to take it away to see that the case against him is established. The substitute phrases introduced by the Parliamentary draftsmen and the Law Officers are misplaced and we reject the excuses put forward by the Law Officers who have sought to distinguish this case from an ordinary case. If there was any substance in the Law Officers' case at all, it has been wholly swept away by the Amendment that the Government themselves have accepted and introduced into this Bill, which gives the Commission an option in this matter; so that the whole of the argument of the Solicitor-General is defeated. I doubt whether any hon. Member who has consulted his intellect and conscience in this matter can doubt that the Amendment should be accepted.</p>

<p>As he so often does, the Solicitor-General put in a most reasonable manner a wholly unreasonable case. After all, the attitude which the Government are taking has this significance, that the un-

fortunate Tribunal is not going to know one way or the other how it is to decide if the evidence, either one way or the other, is insufficient. I think the House is entitled to be told what the Tribunal is to do in these circumstances. The Solicitor-General knows perfectly well, and so do most hon. Members, that if there are cases in which, for one reason or another, there is insufficient evidence for a decision to be given one way or the other, to lay down this onus of proof would permit the Tribunal to come to a reasonable decision. By throwing out the Lords' Amendment, the Government would throw the Tribunal into great difficulty. When the evidence either one way or the other is insufficient, what is the Tribunal to do? Is it to find that the concern involved is a long-distance enterprise or not?<br/>
The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft) riddled the Solicitor-General's argument that because a duty is laid on the Commission, therefore the Commission should not have to establish its case. The Solicitor-General knows perfectly well that throughout this country there are officials and institutions on which duties are laid. My hon. Friend referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Duties are laid upon him, and the Solicitor-General knows quite well that duties are laid on the Treasury Solicitor; but the Solicitor-General surely does not suggest that the Treasury Solicitor is completely free from the onus of making out his case in all cases.<br/>
There is another aspect of the matter. We have here a conflict with regard to the point of view of an undertaking which is being taken over and the Commission. It is possible that it is a small undertaking. The Solicitor-General knows that in the courts, other things being equal, it is a good thing to have money and legal resources behind one, and that they are helpful. In a dispute it is sometimes an advantage to be represented by the Law Officers of the Crown. We have heard of the possibility of a dispute between the Commission, with all the resources of the Government behind it, and a concern fighting for its life. If there is one case more than another where the onus should be on the Government, or the Government's representative or monopoly, to prove its case, surely this is it. Whatever else is not clear, it, surely must be apparent to the House that the


matters to be decided by the tribunal may be matters of the greatest difficulty. Let me give an example. If an undertaking is engaged in the removal of furniture, it is apparently exempted from the risk of being taken over, but it may be a matter of considerable difficulty to ascertain one way or the other whether the particular undertaking is to be classed as a furniture-moving undertaking.<br/>
It is no argument for the Solicitor-General to say, as he did, that it may become more and more difficult for the Commission to prove its case, and therefore it must be freed from the duty of proving its case. Surely, that is not the way to legislate. We are providing in this Clause a means of settling disputes, and it is right that we should so provide, but surely it is absolutely wrong to take away most of the value of that provision by taking away the ordinary common law principle of onus of proof. It is really making a fool of the people concerned to say that they shall have the right to go before the Tribunal, but if the Transport Commission's case against them is not particularly strong, or if, as the Solicitor-General said, there is insufficient evidence, instead of giving them the chance of getting away with it, the common law principle of the onus of proof is to be removed. That is not good legislation, and it is not playing fair either with the transport concerns or with the country. I hope that the Solicitor-General will, even at this late stage, reconsider the attitude which the Government are taking, and will abandon this attempt to allow something which is very unfair in this Clause.</p>

<p>As this is so much a lawyer's matter, I almost apologise for intruding into the Debate, but unless we can agree with the other place in this matter, we shall perpetrate a great injustice on the many people to be called before the Tribunal. Common justice and commonsense work hand in hand here, and wisdom should be shown in this House. The Lords have had much wisdom on their side in this matter. The Solicitor-General said that the Commission are not a free litigant in these matters. The Commission, however, are very much more free than the road transport undertaking, because the Commission have to be of the opinion,

in respect of an undertaking, that that undertaking should be taken over but if they decide that it is inexpedient, they need not serve their notice. If the Commission are an unwilling litigant, how much more unwilling is the poor transport undertaking which is to be taken over? It is compelled to go into court. Hon. Members opposite think that this Commission will be the most magnificient thing, but it has been attacked continually, and not one of them has risen to defend it.<br/>
What is the position? The learned Solicitor-General says this is not a case in which two parties are compelled to make a case against a defendant, but the moment the undertaking comes before the Tribunal, entirely different results are sought. The Commission will appeal for a decision that the undertaking is long-distance and, on the other hand, it will be endeavoured to show that it is short-distance. In every other similar case which I can discover where property of this character is to be taken, somebody has to assume the burden of proving certain matters to the satisfaction of a tribunal. We have many members of the learned profession here, and they would, I believe, rapidly rise if they could find an instance where no onus a proof was put on one party or the other.<br/>
The alternative is in those terrible words read out by the hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft). I do not know how anybody preparing a case for a road haulage undertaking could say, "Come before this body because we cal succeed." Surely, it is wrong that an undertaking should be left in the position where the Commission makes a vague guess and makes a decision on the passing impulse of the moment. This is one of the worst cases which the learned Solicitor-General has ever had the task of putting from the Front Bench, and I say that with the knowledge of all the bad cases which he has had to put on behalf of this Government. Perhaps, he will ransack his mind and let us know of similar cases where a tribunal is required to determine facts in such a strange and arbitrary way.</p>

<p>I wish to add only a few words to those of my hon. Friends. I think that all the lawyers present, at any rate, wilt have considerable sympathy with the


hon. and learned Solicitor-General in having to argue an extremely difficult proposition. I do not think that the test can conceivably be whether there is a duty on the Commission to put their case forward. Surely, the test must be this. The Bill makes it clear that there is an issue of fact to be determined by the Tribunal. Some guidance, surely, should be given as to where the onus of proof is to lie.<br/>
If the hon. and learned Solicitor-General would refer to the opening words of Clause 39, which were quoted in another place by the only Government supporter who spoke in that place on this issue, he would find that it is obligatory on the Commission to put forward a claim where they are of opinion that certain facts apply. But it is made absolutely clear in that and the following Clause that their opinion, though amply justifying them in putting forward a claim, is an opinion which the Bill well recognises may be wrong. The Bill makes it quite clear that in forming that opinion they may be wrong, and the issue whether or not they are wrong is precisely that which has to be tried. If the hon. and learned Solicitor-General will look at the grounds of objection in the next Clause, in Clause 40, the Clause in which this Amendment is sought to be made, he will find in Subsection (3) what the Tribunal are to do if satisfied that the contention of the person carrying on the undertaking is correct. It is quite clear, in other words, in these two Clauses, that there is an issue of fact to be determined, and according to the way in which it is to be determined the man's undertaking will or will not be compulsorily acquired. Why should not the onus lie where on ordinary principles it ought to lie?<br/>
The only point where I differ trom my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft) is that I think he was wrong in law in suggesting that the provisions of Clause 41 are an alternative. No Amendment is, in fact, being put forward to Clause 41, and the provisions in Clause 41, quoted by the hon. and learned Solicitor-General, will apply even if the Lords Amendment to Clause 40 is adopted. It was never suggested by any of the learned Lords in another place, and I am sure it will not be suggested by the hon. and learned Solicitor-General here, that it is impossible to adopt the

Lords' Amendment on the ground that it is inconsistent with Clause 41. The words quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth are most remarkable and they go a very long way in cone ding to the Government something very much in favour of the Commission in presenting their case before the Tribunal. But, nevertheless, in this Amendment they are not being questioned. What is being said is that, while they will enjoy the benefit of Clause 41, it shall, nevertheless, be necessary for the Commission to prove their case, to the satisfaction of the Tribunal, before a man's property is compulsorily taken from him.<br/>
The Solicitor-General would not argue for a moment that what is being done in the action of which we complain is not novel. In this Clause&#x2014;he will not dispute it&#x2014;power is taken to do something quite novel in our law. The principle of the onus of proving an essential fact resting on the person asserting that fact is so deeply embedded in our proceedings, civil and criminal, that I am sure the Solicitor-General will say that it should not be lightly discarded.<br/>
What are the reasons why he says it should be discarded in the present case? The fact that the Commission is under a duty cannot possibly be a good reason. He put forward another possible reason, which was that the Commission might be under great difficulties in obtaining the necessary evidence, though that evidence were available, whereas the 'Tribunal would be under no such difficulty. In other words, the Tribunal could obtain discovery which the Commission could not. I have not examined that matter as closely as the Solicitor-General, and therefore I am prepared to accept from him, for the purpose of my argument, that what he says is quite correct&#x2014;that there would be such difficulty. But what is the remedy if such a difficulty exists. It is surely to give the Commission better powers of discovery and not to shift the onus; to give them the necessary powers in order to prepare their case&#x2014;which he says the Tribunal have under the Arbitration Act.<br/>
I am assuming that the Solicitor-General's contention which I have quoted is sound in fact. But, if it is, the shifting of the onus or leaving it vague where the onus lies, cannot be the right remedy. I wonder whether the Government proposal in this Clause is even convenient.


I should have thought very great difficulties would arise on procedure in deciding the order of speeches and other questions of that kind. Everyone knows that it is possible for other systems of law to have quite different views about presumptions of innocence, guilt, the burden of proof, and so on. But I do not think the hon. and learned Solicitor-General would dispute for one moment that a country whose legal system is so deeply wedded to the system of the onus of proof being on the claimant, applicant, plaintiff, or prosecution&#x2014;that such a country with such a legal system should reverse it, as it is reversed under the Bill, would be to take a most serious step.<br/>
For these reasons, I hope the Government will think again about this matter, and I hope that, in any event, if they do not, hon. Members of this House, whether they are lawyers or laymen, will consider this matter carefully from the point of view of the interests of justice. If they do I am certain they will come to the conclusion that, if this Amendment is resisted, the interest of justice will not be served.</p>

<p>I hesitate to detain the House, but demonstrably there was one further particular fallacy in the Solicitor-General's arguments. He started his argument, if I understood him aright, by saying there was nothing here in the nature of a lawsuit, there was nothing to dispute or contend. Obviously, that was not the view of the draftsman of this Clause. If he will look at Subsection (2), he will see:
<q>If a person on whom notice is served by the Commission with respect to an undertaking desires to contend that the undertaking is not such an undertaking.&#x2026;</q>
It is a very odd thing if you have one side contending but the other side not contending, and quite frankly the draftsmen thought that both the undertaking and the Commission were going to contend before the Tribunal. There is no possible dispute about it. The Solicitor-General, in his argument, has thrown over the draftsmen, and in so doing has forgotten to amend his Bill in order to bring it into line with his argument. Frankly, I prefer the Bill to his arguments.<br/>
What does the Solicitor-General really seek to argue? I cannot help feeling that

he expects the Tribunal to take the view that if the matter is not crystal clear, it is for the undertaking to get out of the clutches of the Commission if it can. That is the only interpretation I was able to put on the Solicitor-General's statement, and I put that interpretation forward for this reason. It is true, he said&#x2014;at least, I think he said&#x2014;that the Tribunal had discretion when there was difficulty, but he went on to say that, as a leading example, he thought it would he possible to prove the case one way or the other unless there was obstruction. If it is merely a question of a refusal to produce records, then the remedy is perfectly simple&#x2014;the Commission appeals to the Tribunal in order that an order may be made upon the undertaking ordering them to produce all their books and records. I do not know whether there is in the Bill provision for this. If there is not, it is a lamentable oversight, but I took it from his remarks that it was so.<br/>
If the fear is that undertakings will destroy records, all I can say is that there are black sheep in every country and in every section of the community, and there may be one or two here. Personally, I should not object to a proviso that if the Tribunal is satisfied that evidence has been destroyed, then it shall presume all things against the wrongdoer. That is an ordinary and proper principle of law, and therefore it would perfectly simple if the Tribunal and the Commission were armed with these simple powers, first, to call for the production of all records, and secondly, to presume everything against a person who could not produce records and not give a satisfactory reason for not producing them. If there were provisions of that sort, stringent and drastic, I would not say that they were contrary to the genius of our law or our justice.<br/>
But here one has something very different. If it is not possible to come to a conclusion one way or another, then it is apparently left to the Commission to do exactly as they choose. There will be the necessity for the Commission to create their own onus of proof and their own rules, because Parliament has given them no rules. The result is that Parliament is asked to delegate to the Tribunal the decision on this vital and important point as to what are the relevant circumstances when it cannot reach a conclusion on the evidence and where the onus then lies. The Tribunal must establish for.


itself the onus of proof in dealing with those borderline cases. Therefore, the Bill is deficit in two details, first, how to deal with any proof which ought to be taken into account; and secondly, how it is to deal with the final number of cases still left in the balance. I think the circumstances that ought to be taken into account in those cases are lack of records. That is an important question. Records will be called for before a case is dealt with, and if, having got the records, it is found they are defective, it is natural to ask, why are they defective? No doubt it will be agreed that</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
This matter is one that has been carefully discussed both in the House and in Committee and in our view it would wholly frustrate the work of the Commission in running an efficient long-distance road haulage service if this Amendment were accepted. What it seeks to do is to permit a road haulier left outside the Commission's operations to run to a distance of 50 miles from his base without any permit from the Commission, whereas we have said in the Bill that the correct distance should be 25 miles. Twenty-five miles from a base represents a very generous view of the work of a local road haulier.<br/>
It is our object in the Bill to leave the small haulier outside the scope of the Commission's activities, and that he is able to go up to 25 miles from his base is, in my view, a reasonable and generous provision. Moreover, the House earlier this evening accepted the view that the Commisson should be entitled to purchase all firms whose operations were predominantly over 25 miles from their base. It would, therefore, I suggest, be illogical that, having accepted that view, the House should accept the Lords Amendment as it stands on the Order Paper&#x2014;that a firm should be able to operate up to 50 miles from its base without a special permit. There would be an immense area of overlapping between the Commission's services and the road hauliers' services, and that overlapping would in our view be bad

because it would prevent the integration which we believe nececssary. Proper integration means economic working which will enable the Commission to run unremunerative services and to do all sorts of things which it could not do if there were such competition, and the chaos and anarchy which would result from a large number of firms trying to do the same job. For that reason primarily, we ask the House to reject the Amendment.<br/>
One other argument is that the road hauliers themselves&#x2014;or anyhow, a large number of responsible leaders&#x2014;when they put forward a policy for the proper integration of the road haulage industry and its better conduct in the future, suggested that the local haulier&#x2014;the small man with one vehicle&#x2014;should be confined to an area not of 25 miles, but 20 miles from his base. That was their proposal. We say that distance is too short, and make 25 miles the limit. Over 25 miles, any haulier can take work provided he gets a permit, and that permit will always be given where the Commission cannot do the work itself.<br/>
We therefore think the provisions of the Bill are reasonable, that the Lords Amendment would make the work of the road haulage organisation of the Commission impossible, or at any rate impossible of successful performance. For these reasons, we ask the House to reject the Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1440.0" hansard_membership_id="8457" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18074" speakername="Sir D. Maxwell Fyfe" colnum="1440" time="">
<p>I think the House has seized the difference between this Amendment and that which we were discussing some two or three hours ago. Then we were discussing the test under which an undertaking would be nationalised. Now we are discussing what limitation will be placed on those road haulage undertakings which are left outside the attack of nationalisation. Every argument which I adduced on the last Amendment, as to the unfairness and undesirability of the test which it is sought to apply, that is, the complete failure of such a distance as 25 miles to apply either to the Metropolitan area, the industrial areas, central Scotland, or the rural areas, applies to this condition also, and to the position in which the road hauliers left outside nationalisation are placed. I want without enlarging on the same points, to take up the hon. Gentleman where he says


it would only frustrate the work of the Commission. That is a large claim which is even more unfounded than most of the claims put forward by the Government tonight.<br/>
In the first place, the Commission are to have the somewhat unusual and certainly unfair and unfortunate right of being judge in their own cause. A person who wants to go over the 25 miles distance does not have to apply to the licensing authority to settle matters. He has to get the permission of his trade rivals. That puts him in a remarkable and unfair position, but it does not stop there. The Commission are to have the right to compete with those road hauliers who are left outside nationalisation with at least two further advantages. They will have the right to provide long-distance services, but in acquiring long-distance services they will be bound to have acquired a number of short-distance vehicles at the same time because of the composite nature of the undertakings. Therefore, they will be competing with those who are left and with the right to carry not only over short, but over long-distances and the inestimable advantage that this will create.<br/>
In addition to that, in taking over the railway vehicles and those owned by the firms and companies which are subsidiary to the railways, they are again taking over vehicles whose work is largely short-distance and special traffic work. I speak from memory and if I am wrong in a slight percentage, and it will be only a slight percentage, I hope that the House will excuse me. Pickford's work is, I think, 95 per cent. special traffic and short-distance work, and that shows again how the Commission are to get an enormous number of vehicles by which they will be able to compete on the most advantageous and unfair basis. To say that the Commission in that position are going to be frustrated&#x2014;for that is the claim of the hon. Gentleman&#x2014;because those road haulage undertakings that are left are to have their distance extended from 25 to 50 miles is simply not playing with, but abusing words. Twenty-five miles is a ridiculous distance to limit a road haulier over any aspect of our national carriage by road that one cares to take into account. Especially when he has not, at the moment, merely to compete with

others in the same line of business, but to compete with the octopus of the Con-mission, with its special advantages and with the tyrannical dice loaded in its favour.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has tried to put forward another argument. He has tried to say, "Well, we have beaten you on the question of the test, and, therefore, you ought to give in to us on the rights of those who are left." We entirely fail to be convinced by the logic of that argument, or to be over-awed by it. We say that, whatever it is they take. If we want in this country a proper and flourishing road transport industry we have not only to do justice to those who have built up that industry with such courage in the past, but we have to provide a system which will give reasonable service to the people who need it. For that we must have a road haulage service which will be of proper local application and carry out decentralised work for the people who need it. There is only one thing which will give us a good road transport service in this country, or in any country; and that is, to have the right vehicle, with the right driver, at the right place, at the right time. Once again&#x2014;and I put it to the House with every confidence and with all the vigour that I possess&#x2014;we can only get that from a decentralised service with true local application. We shall only get it if we have a small unit service; and we shall only get a good working small unit service if we give our local hauliers a chance. For that reason, I ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to rally to the aid of small road hauliers.</p>

<p>To limit the remaining hauliers to a radius of 25 miles is extremely unfair. It does not require much imagination or knowledge of this country for one to realise the tremendous difference between a distance of 25 miles in the country districts, such, for instance, as those which I represent, and 25 miles in the towns. In my part of the world the roads twist about here and there, so that there are few occasions when I visit my constituency when I am riot more than 25 miles from my operating centre. although I have not left the Division Nearly all the major towns are separated by a distance of more than 25 miles If this Amendment is not accepted it will mean


that hauliers will have to make sure that their drivers do not, in fact, go more than 25 miles from their operating centre. It will be extremely difficult for those drivers to know when they are just inside, or outside, that distance, unless every driver goes round with a pair of compasses and a map measuring the distance. Very often, to get from one point to another, it is necessary to make a long detour.<br/>
Very early in these discussions the Parliamentary Secretary made a statement which I thought was extremely misleading, and, although we interrupted him, he made no attempt to correct it. He said that under the new system road hauliers would have an area of 2,000 square miles in which to operate. But he forgot to Say that there are a large number of road hauliers around the coast who will have nothing approaching that area; who, if they are lucky, will have something like half of it. There has been no previous occasion to raise this matter on the Floor of the House. It was raised upstairs and we met with curious arguments from the Minister. What he told us was:
<q>If we went round the coast and extended the radius, we would not get equity in any way."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee B,</i> 19th March, 1947, col. 969.]</q>
Then he went on to suggest that if one had incomplete equity, it did not matter how unfair the position. Apparently, because one cannot have fairness, it does not matter if one haulier has only half of what the other has. In these coastal areas not only is the distance about half of what it is elsewhere, but the population is more sparse than in the inland districts. This is a most unfair provision. It simply does not work out in these coastal districts and the Amendment ought to be accepted.</p>

<p>Before I launch upon any questions to the Front Bench, might I ask if somebody is going to answer what has been said previously, because we have spent a considerable time asking for information and there has been no answer at all. Shall we have some reply to the important points put forward? Let me take the case which the Parliamentary Secretary had in mind. He said that if anybody operated more than 25 miles there would be damage to the Commission. What does he mean? I think I know what he means. I think he means

that the Commission&#x2014;this great new commission&#x2014;will be open to the competition of one of the free road hauliers. Well, we are not so much concerned with damage to the Commission as with damage to the public. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary how this thing is going to work out?<br/>
A haulier has decided under these complex provisions to be a short-distance haulier and he is left in. But he can only operate 25 miles from his centre and a large number of his customers, for that reason, cannot be served. He may have to sell his lorries. In the course of time&#x2014;and this is what the Parliamentary Secretary wants to happen&#x2014;the Commission will expand, subject as it is to no competition, and it will take over these customers. But in the meantime there will be a period of considerable dislocation. Has the Parliamentary Secretary any plan for dealing with those customers who are cut off? I hope somebody will answer these points, also, about the coast towns, raised by the hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Di&#x00A3;by). It is time some answer was forthcoming. There is a strong and substantial point in this matter, for there are hundreds of thousands of these operators around the sea coast of Britain. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I wish hon. Members opposite would not make such curious noises in their sleep. If only they would get up and contribute to our discussion!<br/>
I was saying there are large numbers of these operators round the coasts of Britain. Their case ought to be put in the House of Commons and, above all, it ought to be answered in the House of Commons. Will the Parliamentary Secretary say on what basis of justice or logic he should give the sea-coast operators only half the area he gives to anybody else?</p>

<p>It would make a very considerable difference to them. If the area were extended by 25 miles, at least the sea-coast operator would have some sizeable area in which to operate. If the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) wishes to address the House upon this matter there is really no earthly reason why he should not do so: I am tired of standing on my feet. We were discussing some little time ago the definition of long-distance and


short-distance hauliers, and the factors which should be taken into account in determining whether a man should be deemed to be a short-distance man.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary addressed to the House a long argument, saying he had gone into the matter most fairly, and had come to the conclusion that a fair definition of short-distance haulage was, "Not more than 40 miles altogether, but as far as one liked inside the 25 mile limit." Can he tell me why more onerous conditions than that are imposed on the haulier once it is decided he can operate within such short distance haulage? He&#x2014;or it may have been the Minister &#x2014;argued at some length what he thought was a fair definition of haulage, which was something more than the 25 mile limit. He did not contend on that occasion at all that everybody who operated outside the 25-mile limit should be treated as a long-distance operator. Within that short distance he was more generous than that. He said the operator could travel, not only 25 miles, but as far as he liked in it. He could go outside it, provided that at no time did he travel more than 40 miles. That having been decided, on those terms, for the man as a short distance, why does he not allow him to travel 40 miles? Why does the Parliamentary Secretary make the conditions even harder for the man who is left to operate?<br/>
There is no possible justification for that. The conditions should be at least as generous on the operating side as in determining whether the distance be long or short. I think some explanation is clearly indicated upon that matter. I am going to sit down [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."] I shall not if hon. Members would rather I did not. [HON. MEMBERS: "Go on."] I do hope I am going to get an answer. Unless somebody does rise to give an answer on this occasion I hope some of my hon. Friends will continue the Debate.</p>

<p>It is impossible to let this Amendment go past without pointing out how extremely important it is to Scotland. It applies to Cornwall and other lonely regions; but it is immensely important to parts of Scotland, and, above all, I say frankly, to my own constituency, where we have Forfar, the richest agricultural area in Scotland, with a fine firm operating transport there. The

produce of the Orkneys, Aberdeenshire, Perthshire, Forfar, has to be transported into the cities for distances exceeding 25 miles, and transport operators on short distances will be obliged under the Bill to get permits. The reason why one speaks on this particular Amendment is that even though 50 miles might not be a big figure, it is better than 25. Twenty-five miles seems to me, as far as Scotland is concerned, a hopeless figure; 50 would be a great deal better. I would emphasise that very strongly.</p>

<p>I must ask now for an answer to the two questions I put to the Government in the recent discussion. The first relates to coastal areas. Feeling is very strong in the coastal areas and if the Minister would come down to the coastal areas in my constituency I shall be pleased to show them to him. But just deliberately not to answer my question is an insult to them. The other question is this: How are these regulations going to be implemented? Have the Government thought them out or not? What is going to be the effect on the police? An enormous burden is going to be placed on the police force. It is going to lead without doubt, to a considerable waste of manpower. I want an explanation of how these regulations are to be enforced? Is the Minister going to have cards, checks and work tickets? If he is to use work tickets, I can assure him he will find it will entail a colossal amount of work.</p>

<p>There used to be a time when this was a Debating Chamber. It appears that now it has turn ed into something quite different. When constructive suggestions are made from this side of the House they are merely greeted with cheers and cynical laughter from opposite side of the House. It is a travesty of Parliament, which is intended to legislate, to try to produce a well-shaped Bill, to have that sort of conduct from the other side of the House. The hon. Gentleman's argument resolved itself into one point&#x2014;"We cannot give way, because if we do we shall be unable to stand up to competition." That was the sole basis of the hon. Gentleman's argument. He dared not give way because we should be faced with competition which we would not be strong enough lo stand up to."<br/>
I want to deal with the question of the coastal areas. It is a very simple problem which does not seem to have impressed itself on the hon. Gentleman opposite. It is a mathmatical problem: a semicircle is half the size of a circle. I wish I could make the Gentleman opposite understand the position where you have a coast line area of 25 miles. It would appear to be a most unfortunate thing that in my Division of Brighton the people who are drivers of lorries are not able to drive them into the sea. The coast means that their area is precisely half that of a person 25 miles inland who is able to drive in all directions. The hon. Gentleman did not at any time attempt to deal with that situation. It is one of enormous importance, certainly to thousands of transport owners around the whole of the coastal areas. The hon. Gentleman has not attempted to deal with it because he has got no answer to it. It is time he gave in. No arguments have been put forward by anyone supporting him. One realises that they do not know what the Debate is about. At least the hon. Gentleman knows what this Bill and Debate are about, and if no one behind him puts up any arguments the onus is on him and I hope he will answer.</p>

<p>I have very considerable sympathy with the Parliamentary Secretary. Every time I have listened to him he gets more and more frightened of his own scheme. Every time he opens his mouth he tells us of fears of competition and overlapping. He knows that the machine they are setting up cannot compete with anything on the road at the present time. He has now learned that, and yet he insists, with the colossal majority behind him, on this point, which is almost imbecile in regard to location and distance. Just now he told us that the 25-mile limit was a wonderful thing and that whoever had it could go north, south, east, and west. There is a town of considerable importance as a port in Cornwall called Falmouth, where it is not a matter of going one way or another. It is cut off by two rivers, on the South and West and the South-East. Before one can get coal to the populous area in the centre of the county one has to go 20 or 30 and only by one practical route to the north; in other words, the area of delivery is far less than one half and not much more than one quarter.<br/>
Take the case of Plymouth. There is no one here to speak for it tonight but I must point out the unfortunate position of this town because it is completely cut off by the sea, They cannot go south. I suppose the sympathetic Parliamentary Secretary would then say, "You can have a duck ' and take it out to the Eddystone Lighthouse," or some such nonsense of that sort. That is the sort of thing he is offering, and that sort of thing is the ministerial idea of transport. I believe there is not a single individual on the benches opposite who would not rather employ his next-door neighbour than a Government Department if he had a free choice.<br/>
I am sorry I cannot say a great deal to please Members opposite. I do not think the Minister is as frightened as his Parliamentary Secretary because he does not realise how bad the Bill is. The real grievance which many of us feel in regard to this Amendment is that it leaves a gap between the time when the new Ministry is set up&#x2014;which may take years and it may well be a long time before it is working properly &#x2014;and the time when the efficient private enterprise industry which we know today is abolished. I appeal once more to the Minister to give us some concession. He has not really given us very much.<br/>
I have, so far, been dealing with neighbouring constituencies because the Members representing them are not here to deal with their problems. Now I want for a moment to turn to my own constituency. Large numbers of hon. Members opposite have visited it and have benefited from being there. Our difficulty, too, is that we are completely cut off. Before we can get our goods right into the centre of Devon or to Brixham we have to hire a lorry from some mysterious body which is going to be placed somewhere&#x2014;though no one knows where&#x2014;but by the time we get that lorry the stuff will have been sent back, which will be absolutely in keeping with the Government at the present time. My hon. Friend said that he hoped we would divide on this subject. I hope we shall, and I hope that in this really desperate situation which threatens us that we shall hear something from some of the Scottish Members. How in the world am I to get help if my lorry breaks down 40 miles from a station? It might well take the Govern-


ment weeks or months to get help there. That is a simple illustration of what will happen under this system. It is too much to expect that we shall hear anything from any English Socialist Members, who, apparently, are not allowed to speak, but perhaps some of the Scottish Socialists will have the courage to state their views on this matter. We might even hear from a Welsh Socialist.</p>

<p>I should like to give the Minister another opportunity to give some reply to the reasoned arguments which have been put before the Government in favour of this Amendment. It is surely scant courtesy to the House and to the very large number of independent, hard-working people who have put their life savings into their business to give them no sort of a reply, whatever. Why should they not be entitled to carry on their business as they could within the 50 miles' limit, because they will find great difficulty in carrying it on within the 23 miles' limit? Why was the figure of 25 selected? What is the virtue of 25 which has been retained in the Bill?</p>

<p>It is likely that the Communist Party is quite right when they say that it is the Minister's lucky number. Recently when we were discussing another figure, namely, making it 80 instead of 40, the Minister said that the only reason why that figure of 80 had been chosen was because it was double the figure 40. He argued that, therefore, it should be rejected. The only argument advanced in favour of 25 is that it is a quarter more than the figure of 20, which is the only other figure he had in mind. Now that is no better answer than the answer he rejected in his own argument. What is the virtue of this figure of 25? I do ask the Minister to give some reply to this point. I also think the Parliamentary Secretary should be afforded an opportunity of clearing up the misunderstanding his previous remark must have created. In reply to the hon. Member for Lonsdale (Sir I. Fraser), he made it quite clear that a haulier would be able to go 25 miles north, south, east and west from the operating centre. If the hauliers in my cons-

stituency have an operating centre at Bognor Regis they cannot go 25 miles south. They would end up halt way to France, and what is the good of that? I think the right hon. Gentleman is unnecessarily misleading all these seaside hauliers. He said quite deliberately they would have 2,000 square miles in which to operate. Obviously, that is intended to mean on land. It is perfectly clear that seaside operators under this Clause cannot have the area which he said they were to have.<br/>
May I put one further argument before the right hon. Gentleman? I venture to differ from some of my hon. Friends on this side of the House in believing that the British haulier who has built up his business and put his livelihood and savings into that business is going to allow himself to be put out of business by the Minister, the Transport Commission or any Government Department. He is going to find a way round the position. He is going to make a living not within the law, but by evasion of the law. I am prepared to have a small bet with the Minister that he will succeed. It will make it much easier for the efficient administration of the road haulage system if he is limited to 50 miles and not 25. What will happen will be the setting up between the normal centres of transport, such as, London and Brighton, London and Wales, London and Bognor Regis, of intermediate transmission stations where independent hauliers coming to the end of their operating distances, will meet independent hauliers centred in another operating sphere at the end of their radius, and transfer their loads from one lorry to another. Within the provisions of the Bill they could continue their service and continue it more economically and more efficiently than any service set up by the Commission, but it would be more economical and more efficient if that transmission could take place at the end of 50 miles instead of at the end of 25. In the interests of efficiency, I hope the Minister will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I do not know w hat the cheers are for. I was only waiting for hon. Members to finish putting their


points before I rose to answer this Debate. It seems to me that we can confine ourselves to only one of the arguments. But I must ask leave of the House before I can speak again. The points which have been put forward by hon. Members opposite have not really been relevant to the issue we are debating. One Member after another argued that it was grossly unfair to hauliers in seaside towns, that they should be confined to the limit of 25 miles provided in the Bill. But if the Lords Amendment were accepted and the 25 miles became 50 miles, then, obviously, there would be exactly the same disparity between seaside towns and inland towns as there is now. Therefore, the arguments which have been put forward with such vigour&#x2014;and they are interesting and important arguments&#x2014;are quite irrelevant to the issue we are discussing.</p>

<p>As the matter has been raised I would like to make two brief points. It would be quite impossible to make provision just for seaside towns, because so many of our major towns, including London, Liverpool, Glasgow, Cardiff, and many others, are seaside towns, and a very large proportion of the hauliers are naturally in those centres. I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that we have made special provision for areas where there is some peculiar difficulty, or some local reason why the Commissioners should grant permits more easily. In an Amendment moved in another place by the Government the House will see that we have met that point as far as it is possible to do so. It is quoted on page 13 of the Amendments, and is as follows:
<q>Provided that the Commission shall, in exercising their discretion, take into consideration the needs of, and any special circumstances affecting, the locality in which is

situated the operating centre of any vehicle to which the permit would relate.</q></p>

<p>I was pointing out that the -Bill specially gives discretion to the Commission, and suggests that they should exercise this discretion. Otherwise most of the arguments seem irrelevant to the issue before us. The hon. Member for Monmouth (Mr. P. Thorneycroft) says that we are not being so generous to the road haulier in this provision, in which we give him 25 miles to operate without a permit, as we were in a previous Clause which defines the long-distance and the short-distance road hauliers for the purpose of acquisition. We say in Clause 39 that we consider a man a short-distance road haulier if he operates less than 40 miles in an area 25 miles from his base. In this Clause we are saying that he can go anywhere he likes within 25 miles from his base, up to 50 miles in fact from the centre. We are, therefore, being more generous here, if that is the way to put it, than we were in the earlier Clause. I say again, that 25 miles distance from the base is a generous estimate for the work which the normal local road haulier would want to do; that the Commission has the power&#x2014;which I am certain they would exercise on a substantial scale, wherever it was appropriate&#x2014;to give hauliers permission to go beyond that distance; and we draw attention to the desirability of giving permission to extend that distance where local hauliers need it.<br/>
But if the local haulier were allowed to go up to 50 miles from his base without any permit he would be creaming off much of the essential work which the Commission is ordered by Parliament to do to carry out a proper long-distance


road haulage service for the community and for the industry of this country. That responsibility is being placed fairly and squarely on the Commission. Having given the local haulier the duty and monopoly of work in his own area, it would be quite grotesque to say that any road haulier could undertake long-distance work, creaming off what traffic he wants and leaving the Commission the job of providing the most unremunerative services. A proper job cannot be done that way.<br/>
Hon. Members opposite say&#x2014;and I can quite understand their view&#x2014;that one can only get a proper road haulage service if one leaves it to small units. They said, further, that they were not concerned with any damage to the Commission, but only with the damage to the public. We say the welfare and interests of the Commission, charged with this duty of carrying on long-distance road service work, is identical with the welfare of industry, and that any damage done to the Commission by unfair competition or by outsiders creaming off work will be damage not only to the Commission, but to the industries of this country. We say this work can effectively be done only with the fusion and integration which every person and section in the transport industry knows is necessary and has been demanding for years. That can only be effected if the long-distance road services become integrated through the work of the Commission with rail operations, when the Commission becomes responsible. Taking that view, we disagree with the arguments of hon. Members opposite, who want to limit&#x2014;and damage as much as they can&#x2014;the work of the Commission in its road transport operations. They want to leave the work in the hands of the existing road hauliers. They can do that, but they will not get integration and fusion. They will get the same anarchy and chaos as has existed in the industry in the past. The purpose of the Bill is to get order in the transport industry, and that can only be obtained with a monopoly of road transport services and integration. The local haulier must be confined to a proper and reasonable distance, which is 25 miles.</p>

<p>Hon. Members opposite ale sometimes asleep and sometimes they wake up. This is really a serious matter, specially for the remote areas and the coastal towns. Are we to understand, first of all, that there is to be general permission for a particular haulier over the distance of 25 miles, or will it be directed to a particular load? I hope that when the Minister replies he will indicate that it is to be a general permission, in view of


the fact that the operation is over rather wild country, in Yorkshire, or Torquay, or where the periphery or semi-circle influences the scope of the haulier's operation. Unfortunately, we find that the Commission has power at any time to vary or withdraw permission, and it makes the validity of the Parliamentary Secretary's argument very much less. The next point that arises is in relation to the particular load, as to whether the haulier will have to apply to the Commission for permission. The delay will mean that consumers will get worse service. The position is not clear, and we have not yet had an explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary. I gathered from the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary that it was on this Clause that they would make some concession about particular traffics; but in that Amendment they merely deal with certain localities. I would like to get a ruling from the learned Solicitor-General on the question whether, having drafted that Amendment to refer merely to particular localities, it is not really limiting this question so that the Commission cannot take into consideration special loads, such as milk in churns, or eggs&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "What about bacon?"]&#x2014;I hope that some light will be thrown on this rather obscure situation. I believe the Parliamentary Secretary has not thought enough about the public. That, I think, is the real difference between the two sides of the House&#x2014;which is to come first? Which is the more important, the needs of the consuming public, or the convenience of the Transport Commission, which we hear is not to be presided over by Lord Latham?</p>

<p>On a point of Order.

<p>The hon. Member noticed that the Parliamentary Secretary was irrelevant and out of Order, but that does not prevent my putting my point to him. The Parliamentary Secretary's argument was that 25 miles to a coast town might be unjust, but 50 miles would also be unjust, and that the argument was, therefore, irrelevant. That is, roughly, what he said, but he does not apparently appreciate that 50 miles would be less unjust&#x2014;</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. Member, who is speaking while seated, will allow me to develop my argument. It would be less injustice because the operator in the coast town would have further to go, and would not be limited to 25 miles. He would have further to go, and his ordinary activities would be less restricted. The coast town operator whose livelihood is taken away would be better off on a radius of 50 miles, although that would be unjust compared with other operators if they go on a diameter of 50 miles. The advantage of this Amendment would be a lessening of the injustice. The Parliamentary Secretary rejected the whole thing by a piece of dialectic, and saying it did not apply at all.</p>

<p>This is very true, but there is, I think, no difference between us about that. The Parliamentary Secretary said the argument was irrelevant. If one said to any coast town operator, "Do you think the injustice caused by having a fixed radius would be ameliorated if you were allowed to go twice as far?" he would say he would have this Amendment. If it is acceptable to the coast town operator, that is an argument in favour of it. We cannot discuss whether it would be better for different radii to be given to different parts of the country; that would not be in Order. But


it is in Order, I think, to say that this Amendment would be of immense benefit to the coast town operator, and that is why we are' supporting it on this side of the House. With respect, I would say that the Parliamentary Secretary did not treat the House with respect with his false dialectics. He should address himself, at this hour of the night, to serious argument. An hon. Member for one of the Scottish constituencies pointed out that a 25 mile radius in many parts of the country has no meaning&#x2014;</p>

<p>It has no meaning because the operators are short haulage operators in areas where centres of consumption and production are more than 25 miles apart, and it must be remembered that no road operator can operate in a vacuum. The Parliamentary Secretary did not say, "Well, I agree that 25 miles, where the towns are 30 or 40 miles apart, is not of much use." If the trader places his van between towns he may go 25 miles to towns 50 miles apart. These are quite obvious points which have been made by people in the trade and industry, but which have not been made by the Parliamentary Secretary. He never alluded to that argument. All he did was to repeat that the 25 miles was a fair and reasonable distance, and that if the 50 mile radius were allowed it would mean creaming off the profitable part of the road transport industry. He treated the Amendment which was passed in another place as a wrecking Amendment, instead of one which was made for the benefit of the industry as a whole within the limits of nationalisation. To benefit the industry as much as we can within those limits is all we can do now.<br/>
4.30 a.m.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary adopted the attitude that the object on this side of the House was to wreck the Commission, and take the cream off road haulage operations, so that nationalisation would not work. I should have thought it would work very much better were the 50 mile radius adopted. It would work better if the majority&#x2014;or, at least, a great proportion&#x2014;of the road haulage undertakings which are short road haulage undertaking were working within a framework of about 50 miles. In sea coast areas, and areas in which the big centres are more than 50

miles apart, the road haulage undertakings will have to change their character, in order to operate within these restrictive limits. That will make nationalisation work much the worse. The Parliamentary Secretary did not meet that point. He spoke as though those in another place were not responsible, and had acted to wreck the Bill; and he seemed to allege that the Amendment was designed to enable us on this side of this House to wreck the Bill. Does he realise what he is doing? He is saying that this nationalisation scheme is so fragile that the introduction of a 50 miles limit, instead of the 25 mile limit, would bring the whole thing down like a pack of cards. If the Parliamentary Secretary thinks that a larger limit than 25 miles would make the Commission unprofitable, then he does not know how the industry is conducted. I do not believe he has ever seen applications made for "A" and "B" licences; or, if he has, he has not understood them. The industry is not based on tiny routes of 25 miles, except, perhaps, in centres like Manchester or London. When applications are made for licences, and evidence of need is given, the basis is something like 35 to 50 miles. None of these technical matters was dealt with by the Parliamentary Secretary.<br/>
I should like to complain about the fact that not enough speeches are made from the other side. It is a serious complaint, because the whole basis of English Parliamentary life is that the Government and Opposition play a part in team work. It is one of the remarkable things about English Parliamentary life. If serious arguments on this side are met only by one person who is rather apt to repeat himself, and who does not address himself to the arguments&#x2014;</p>

<p>If the hon. Gentleman waits, he will hear the reason. I had asked my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Scottish Universities (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot) to put one or two points to the Minister on which I desired some explanation.

courteously gave way to the Minister. Therefore, I have to put these questions to the hon. Gentleman myself. I wish to develop the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Torquay (Mr. C.

Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) has just come into the Chamber, because he might be able to answer my questions.<br/>
I want to allude to a very peculiar situation which exists in many parts of Scotland, where there are long and narrow peninsulas. There is Black Isle which lies by Cromarty, and is one of the richest agricultural areas in Scotland. Operators working in Rosemarkie would only be able to go to the end of the peninsula, and that is the only business they could do. That is the point on which I would like some assistance. The question I would like him to consider next is the case of Campbelltown, near the Mull of Kintyre, a promontory which runs north and south, and is very narrow.

<p>The hon. Lady is quite mistaken. My lorry would run further north than it is permitted to go now. My hon. Friend the Member for Galloway (Mr. McKie) has a very difficult constituency, and in the Isle of Whithorn a similar difficulty arises. The hon. Member for Dumbarton Burghs (Mr. Kirkwood) has in his constituency quite a

large town which goes by the name of Helensburgh which has on one side the Gairloch and on the other side Loch Lomond. What is going to happen there? I hope I may have a reply to this problem which faces Scotland.</p>

<p>I ask the Minister to come, in his imagination, with me into my constituency, the greater part of which is in the Lake District, a sparsely populated area. The coast-line there is indented with many bays, notably one called the Sands, across which the coaches used to go when taking people to be married at Gretna Green. This is the question which exercises the minds of my constituents: how this special licence, which can be granted in special cases, would apply? If this Amendment were carried, and 50 miles were substituted for 25 miles, the journey round this bay, or the Sands, would be taken care of, but if 25 miles is the limit, then no haulier can do any business on one side of the Sands or the other. If it is said that he can get a special licence, does he apply for it in relation to the journey, or each period of time, or each traffic, or whether he gets a licence over an extended period for the whole of his business? This is a vital matter, and I hope an answer will be given.<br/>
One solution would be to give a licence with a permanent period attached to it. No businessman can work from week to week if he does not know whether a licence is to be cancelled or withdrawn. The solution is to give a long-term licence because of the geographical situation of the haulier, or, alternatively, pass an Amendment so that a licence cannot be taken away. I prefer the Amendment, and I hope we shall continue to press the Government and even persuade them to agree to it.</p>

<p>I have not previously spoken on this subject, and I want hon. Members to realise that we are debating a very human question. The small lorry drivers we are talking about are human beings, some of whom no doubt voted for some of us on both sides of this House. I want hon. Members to think in terms of human beings. I have heard the Parliamentary Secretary


tell us how the test of definition of what is a small short-distance haulage is to be applied. The test&#x2014;he will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;is one in which his officials will look at the records of the journeys of a haulier over a long period&#x2014;I think he said a year&#x2014;and that test will be what is statistically called the mode. One or more journeys may easily be less than 25 miles and one even over 50 miles, and the officer of the Commission will say, "What about this one of 50 miles?" The haulier may well reply "My mother-in-law is living in my house, and I could get her out of my house into a new one if I moved her and made that journey. That is why I went more than 50 miles in that particular case." The Commission would say, as I understand it, "That is right. You are a short distance haulier. Your journeys are round the statistical mode of 25 miles." The test for definition on the statistical mode is a different thing from what we are talking about in this case, because, here, we are talking about the limit on the longest journey that is about the peak, which is something entirely different statistically.<br/>
4.45 a.m.<br/>
In another place they have made a very good point on this Amendment, because a peak of 50 miles is probably the fair equivalent of a 25-mile mode. I hope hon. Members on the other side of the House do not think that if this Amendment goes through 50 miles will be obtained by the haulier for every journey. His mode could continue to be 25 miles, notwithstanding a peak journey of 50 miles. The Parliamentary Secretary. has asked what other system could he have. He has this Amendment of 50 miles, which, I submit, is thoroughly satisfactory to take for a mode of 25 miles. If he really wants to cover both mode and peak he can do it in the same way as he proposes for covering the test for definition. He could dearly have the situation reviewed from time to time to see that practice continued in line with the original test for definition. It is ludicrous to impose on somebody whose mode is 25 miles a peak of 25 miles. Statistically it is absolute nonsense, and it is for that reason I commend to the House this Amendment which has come from another place.</p>

<p>That is my point. It arises out of what the Parliamentary Secretary said. I made that remark with reference particularly to what he said about the monopoly we are setting up in this Bill in the Commission. It has always interested me what hon. and right hon. Gentlemen would do with monopoly in view of what they have said so often in the past about it, and in particular their remarks about Tory misrule and other such phrases as that. The hon. Gentleman, the Parliamentary Secretary, came down and openly boasted that the Commission set up under this Bill is to have a monopoly and, what is more, that it is to have a monopoly which is deliberately to be shielded from any form of competition whatsoever. It seems to me that the hon. Gentleman has failed to distinguish between a monopoly run by the State and a monopoly under private enterprise. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I see that my opening remarks are being endorsed every moment I go on.</p>

<p>I would most respectfully point out that at that moment I was made virtually inaudible to hon. Members on this side, let alone on the other, by the&#x2014;as I think&#x2014;frivolous laughter as a result of my having said that hon. Members opposite apparently did not appreciate the difference between a monoply run by the State and a monopoly run by private enterprise. That apparently was the cause of wild hilarity. I say that if it is the intention under this Bill to set up a Commission which is to be a monopoly protected by the State from any form of competition whatever, then any charges that hon. Members have ever levied against monopolies under private enterprise are far outstripped by the charges that will be brought upon the State management of this industry. I ask the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this.<br/>
Do they really consider that this overlapping of which the Parliamentary Secretary spoke is all the danger that they make it out to be? Do they really consider that any road haulier is going to stay in business if he is having to compete with a really efficient State system which can undercut him at every corner? Is he going to struggle on limited by the terms of this Bill as it will be if the Amendment is not accepted? Do they conceive that any road haulier is going to carry on very long under those conditions? He may make a gallant attempt at the beginning, but I do not think he will carry on for very long. I believe that by this Amendment we can ensure that there is fair competition with the State monopoly, fair competition as judged by the only people who are entitled to judge these matters&#x2014;the people who want to use the transport. I believe that to turn down this Amendment will be most injurious to the Bill. I believe that the Amendment, when it was passed by another place, greatly improved the Bill.<br/>
I would also like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary what he meant when he said that under Clause 39 the Government were being less generous than they were under this Clause. Under Clause 39, as I understand it, a vehicle can go within a 25 miles radius up to 40 miles, whereas under the Clause we


are discussing it seems to me that a vehicle can only go 25 miles from its base. I cannot see how that can be considered to be more generous than the provision of Clause 39. It is precisely the other way round. I still maintain that if the Government are to make this nationalised transport a success they would do well to encourage all the competition to it they can. There is no better way of ensuring efficiency. Hon. and right hon. Gentlemen opposite so often flaunt efficiency in the face of the House as being the end of these nationalisation Bills, but there is no surer way of undermining any efficiency likely to come out of this Bill than deliberately eliminating all forms of competition and creating and directing a State monopoly.</p>

<p>I hope that someone on the Government Front Bench will respond to the invitation which has been extended, and say something on the points raised regarding Scotland [<i>Interruption</i>]. if only the Parliamentary Secretary had not risen just before my hon. Friend spoke, a further intervention in this Debate, which has gone on for a long time, might have been avoided. My hon. Friend alluded to certain places in Cornwall and Scotland in which, because of their configuration, road hauliers will be seriously jeopardised if this quite modest Amendment of the Lords is denied.<br/>
My constituency has a very long coastline. I will not attempt to estimate its length: I hate inaccuracies; there I differ from my hon. Friends on the other side. There are many arms and legs in my constituency, and one may say that it has two exposures, south and west. I will give an instance of how road hauliers on the sea-board facing west will suffer, and will take the ancient burgh of Stranraer. Members will readily recall that great prominence attained by Stranraer during the war, and the great part it played in bringing the war effort to a successful conclusion. [<i>Interruption.</i>] Six million members of the Armed Forces passed through Stranraer during the war years. Road hauliers there will be seriously affected, because there are two promontories to north and south. The road hauliers will be completely bottled&#x2014;[Horn.

<p>I was not alluding to my hon. Friend's road hauliers. I was explaining the very great difficulties which road hauliers will experience because of promontories to the north and south.<br/>
It is not only the hauliers in the coastal part of my constituency that I am concerned about, though I am, of course, very concerned about them. A good Member of Parliament is concerned with the welfare of all his constituents, with all people, big or small, whoever they may be, whatever party they may belong to. Perhaps we shall have a reply from the Front Bench in relation to hauliers in the coastal parts of my constituency, and in other constituencies. It may be that the hon. Member for Dunfermline Burghs (Mr. Watson) will say a few words about the coastal towns of Scotland, which he so well knows. This is a very serious mater affecting the lives of many people who will suffer by the obstinacy and obduracy of the Minister in his refusal to accept the Amendment. By acceptance he could save the whole situation with regard to the distribution of milk from my constituency. He has turned down the Amendment so I must tell him again that milk distribution will be seriously affected there. Let the Minister make a deathbed repentance for it is quite manifest that even if we were to substitute 50 miles or 25 miles in a constituency such as mine the hauliers would be in a very serious plight indeed.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams) knows a good deal about these matters. He has instanoN1 the extreme difficulty that he will have,.to miles from a station, in bringing his wool to market When we go to the Division Lobby I hope that we shall have a sufficiently large number of hon. and right hon. Gentlemen who support the Government voting with us to ensure that the Amendment is inserted in the Bill Especially do I hope that even the hon. and learned Member for Kettering (Mr. Mitchison), who was good enough to include a sneer in his remarks, as he often does, will be in the Lobby with us. Certainly we would he failing in our duty -o our constituents if we were to allow the Motion of the Minister to disagree with the Lords Amendment to go unchallenged.</p>

<p>After a long period in which it was, by the rules of Order&#x2014;of which I do not complain&#x2014; necessary for me to refrain from addressing the House, that unnatural barrier has been lifted and I am now in a position of having my ordinary Parliamentary privileges once more. The Minister has moved to disagree with the Lords Amendment, greatly to our sorrow, because we had hoped that he might be more willing to look on this one with more favour than the previous Amendment. It is true, as the Minister said, that it is related, but only distantly so, to the previous discussion on this subject. This, as he will agree, refers to the long-distance hauliers, and whether they should or should not be allowed to carry milk for these longer distances. I did not intervene on the previous discussion, because I was anxious to facilitate progress, but I listened with very great interest to the discussion on milk, and, more particularly, the Milk Marketing Board, which I myself had a great deal to do with setting up. I was very glad to listen to the tributes paid to it. The difficulty in which it will be placed if this Amendment is not accepted is well known to the House, and I should like the Minister to consider whether he is not introducing an unnecessary rigidity in the arrangements he is setting up under the Bill.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary has explained that many of the points we have raised will be more fittingly discussed on an Amendment which the Minister will move later, dealing with special localities and conditions, and we shall postpone many of our remarks until that occasion when we can have a discussion at greater</p>

<p>length. This point as to not having what we might call niggling limitations on the carriage of milk is one on which the Minister might meet us. I do not consider that the Minister wishes to limit or hamper the adequate distribution of milk, or that he thinks that it would be in the best interests of public health or agriculture that the distribution of milk, either by public or private enterprise, should in any way be hampered. Nor can I see that the Parliamentary Secretary's powerful arguments on the need for every possible protection of the nationalised industry has the slightest impact, or that private enterprise, to use a lactic phrase, would cream the traffic and bring his enterprise crashing to the ground. I am sure that would not apply in the case of milk.</p>

<p>This cannot, in the nature of things, be an important province or field of this Commission's enterprises. Would it be possible for the right hon. Gentleman to give some consideration to this matter if suppose this Amendment to be rejected, an alternative Amendment were suggested in another place? If it were possible for him to meet us it might well facilitate our discussion tonight.&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I am using "night" in the Parliamentary sense, although it is astronomically wrong. I am not at all anxious to take up time. Some hours ago, had I been allowed to speak a great deal of compression would undoubtedly have taken place, but the Government must learn that it is not possible for them to ride roughshod over the Opposition and that if they attempt to do it they will be punished as they have been punished. We are not desirous of delaying consideration, but we find ourselves in hearty agreement with the other place in this Amendment. We think the Minister is taking an unwise view in asking the House to disagree with this Amendment, and if he carries the matter to a Division we shall certainly divide against him.</p>

<p>I cannot possibly say that I am yet persuaded on this point, after all the time and effort that the Government have spent in trying to persuade us on the previous Amendment. I think I ought to be more fully persuaded. The Amendment deals with goods consisting of felled timber carried in a vehicle specially constructed for the purpose. I would like to contrast the favoured position of timber, which is to be given the most valuable advantage of being carried to a much greater extent by private enterprise, with that of milk, for you are depriving the Milk Board and the people who want milk of that opportunity. I can only assume that the Forestry Commission has some pull over the Milk Board. Are we to understand that the Minister of Health, who wants this timber for housing, and, therefore, knows that he must have it carried by private enterprise, has not the same pull in connection with milk for the children?</p>

<p>Yes, I was just contrasting the unfortunate position in which we find ourselves, and saying that as far as timber is concerned I would be only too willing to give the concession that timber should be carried by good and

efficient transport rather than by Government and inefficient transport. But I think I should be told why timber should be given this advantage. The Government are right in what they are doing, but I cannot explain to my constituents why timber should have this concession and other things not. There seems to be some unfairness about it. Someone ought to try and tell us why there should be this concession. I do not want to hurt the timber industry in any way, but must be persuaded why we are granting this concession in the case of timber</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1478.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. McKie" colnum="1478" time="">
<p>I share to the full the desire that we should be fully informed as to the reason why the Government have decided to agree with the Lords in this Amendment, but I have more alacrity in agreeing to agree with the Government that we should agree. Timber is grown much more generally in my constituency than in that of my hon. Friend, though I am sure he would not wish to deprive me of any direct benefit in which he would only share indirectly. What has actuated the Government in asking us to agree with the Lords Amendment is that they realise the difficult position in which we are because of the shortage of timber. The whole housing programme is held up through lack of timber. The Lords Amendment will help only in a small way along the road, but it does afford some help. The right hon. Gentleman realises that here is some little thing which may prove to be for the public welfare of the country and the better housing of the people, and so there is to be this exemption. I am concerned with the timber industry of this country, and will not raise a dissentient voice against the suggestion that we should agree with this proposal.</p>

<p>Can the right hon. Gentleman say whether it is certain that when timber is conveyed by a specially-constructed vehicle it is conveyed "in" such a vehicle, and not "on" such a vehicle? The point although small, is one of some substance. If the explanation is not a technical one, it means that this special right is only granted for vehicles specially-constructed to carry timber in them&#x2014;and these will have to be very specially constructed vehicles indeed. If I am right, the privilege is completely valueless. Is not the intention that the privilege shall be granted to vehicles specially-constructed for carrying timber on them, and not in them?</p>

<p>By leave of the House, I should say the Parliamentary draftsmen who drafted these words have assumed that they have covered the point. If there is a weakness, it will be properly examined in negotiations with another place. If the hon. Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams) speaks for his hon. Friends opposite, and they disagree with my proposal in this case, I want to make it plain I shall not resist them in their desire to cut this out. I did hear representations made to me from the other place, which appeared to be founded on substance&#x2014; that the felling of trees and the carting of them to sawmills represented just a part of the process of saw-milling. That seemed sensible to me.</p>

<p>I must make some remarks on this Amendment though the Minister probably did not notice that I deliberately abstained from voting when this matter was previously discussed. I will not abstain this time if there is a vote on it. It seems to me that when you come to the question of licensing there is a really foolproof case for putting the "A" contract vehicle on the same footing as the "C" licence. I simply cannot see that there is any conceivable reason for not granting exactly the same facility as for the "C" licence holder. There was some discussion before on this point, but I do not think that it covered the specific point, for it is not a question of abolishing the "A" licensee. He is allowed a certificate, and being allowed a certificate, why should there be discrimination against him?</p>

<p>I want to support what my hon. Friend the Member for Montrose Burghs (Mr. Maclay) has said about the "A" contract licence. This has never been discussed before, either here or upstairs. On what ground does the Minister regard these "A" contract licences as not analogous to the "C" licences? People have contracted to employ these vehicles on exactly the same conditions as the "C" licences. I would put to the Minister the effect that will result if he does not accept this Amendment. The individual will be driven to apply for a "C" licence&#x2014;and many would agree that we do not want an undue number of "C" licences to be increased&#x2014;and if he does take out a "C" licence he will be running the vehicle in the least economic and efficient way. The alternative is that he will restrict distribution; that is, say, the distribution of someone who has a laundry, about which we have heard a certain amount today, particularly those who have laundries in the north of Scotland. He will be restricted from going outside the 25 miles limit. I do suggest most strongly to the Minister that he should not throw this Amendment out. It is an Amendment which is entirely distinct from the one which was discussed six or seven hours ago, because no case has been made out here, or in another place, that these contract "A"


vehicles are not exactly analogous with the "C" licence vehicles.</p>

<p>When the right hon. Gentleman replied to the discussion, some hours ago, he made, I think, two main points that there was almost nothing in the case, and that these were ordinary lorries fulfilling ordinary requirements. I cannot accept that argument. It is obvious that it is convenient for the trader to have in "A" licence vehicle, or he would not have one at all. It is obvious that he is getting some service and facilities by having that "A" licence vehicle, rather than going to a road haulier or to a "C" licence holder. The Minister said that it would be unfair if the vehicles of a man holding "A" contract licences were excluded from the provisions of the Bill, and the vehicles of the holder of another licence were taken over. There is some force in that argument. But when we come to this Amendment, which deals purely with operation, I suggest that the second part of the right hon. Gentleman's argument does not apply. It would not create any great anomaly&#x2014;once the Commission had decided which vehicles they were going to take over and which vehicles were to be left in the hands of the road hauliers&#x2014;for "A" licences to be put on the same basis as "C" licences. I am concerned at the idea of having "A" licence holders who are already in existence on a different basis from the "C" licence holders. In this case, I think there is a big difference from the case which the Minister put forward on the previous Amendment. I hope that he will give further consideration to this point.</p>

<p>I would like to emphasise the points which my hon. Friends have made with regard to these figures. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Dodds-Parker), that there might have been some difficulty as to how these vehicles would count when one was applying the test for long distance haulage. After the test has been applied, and when considering the limitation which is put on the road vehicles which are not nationalised, it seems to me that the difficulty disappears and we are faced once again with the position that obtained before this Bill. Under the Road and Rail Act, the contract "A"

vehicle was given a licence without any power of objection by the Commissioners. Having been given that licence, the vehicle could be driven over any distance which was necessary, in the same way as a "C" licence vehicle. The "C" licence holder has still got that right, and a limitation&#x2014;a very severe one&#x2014;of 25 miles has been put on the contract "A" licence holder. I have tried to follow the arguments on this point, but when a person hires a vehicle with his own name on it, and uses it for the carriage of his own goods, and pays a rent for the vehicle, instead of a purchase price, and leaves it for servicing to an expert, he is not in a different position. He is appropriating that vehicle to carrying his own goods, and I ask the right hon. Gentleman, who has gained his point on the long-distance road haulage, seriously to reconsider th-s Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1482.0" hansard_membership_id="928" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28712" speakername="Mr. Barnes" colnum="1482" time="">
<p>I should like, with the permission of the House, to respond to the requests to deal with the question as to whether the contract "A" vehicle is an equivalent vehicle to the "C" licence vehicle. I am in difficulty in following the arguments of Members opposite just as they have claimed they were unable to follow my argument. A person who has goods to carry has three choices He can use his own vehicle, if that suits his purpose, and get a "C" licence. He can go into the open market and hire a vehicle from any road haulier, and use that for carrying his goods, or, he can go to a haulier and get the vehicle at an agreed price. It is a contract between two persons, and the vehicle is acquired for a certain period. If the trader decides that he would prefer to hire an "A" contract vehicle, I cannot see how he can claim that the licence should be on the "C" licence basis. Everybody is quite clear as to the different factors which vary according to the type of licence taken out, and in this case, the remedy is in the hands of the trader. If the trader takes out his own vehicles, that represents the type of evasion to which I have referred on the question of the "C" licences. Members ought to bear this in mind. If I take the extraordinary step of putting contract "A" licences on the same basis as the "C" licences, it would be an open invitation to all kinds of organisations to adopt this practice and evade the intentions of the Bill. On both counts,


I cannot differentiate on this occasion any more than I could when it was a question for the computation of the mileage figure, and I cannot respond to the invitation.</p>

The crane on a harbour would be helpful to the carriage of goods from the ships on to a truck, and that truck might belong to the Minister of Transport.</p>

<p>I beg to move: "That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
I rise only because in our previous Debates great interest was displayed in this matter, and a good deal of confusion arose as to the place in the Bill at which this point should be discussed. If Members will turn to Clause 52, Subsection (2), they will see the words:
<q>The Commission shall have full power in their discretion either to grant or to refuse any such permit as aforesaid, and any such permit may be granted by them for such period&#x2026;</q>
That makes it clear that it is not limited to the journey.

This is not contrary to present day practice. Licensing authorities do attach conditions, particularly to "B" licences, and for the purposes of meeting the anxiety of Members in both Houses, in regard to crofter counties, coastal towns, or sparsely populated areas, this proviso is being inserted, and provides:
<q>&#x2026; the Commission shall, in exercising their discretion, take into consideration the needs of, and any special circumstances affecting, the locality in which is situated the operating centre of any vehicle to which the permit would relate.</q>

<p>As the Minister has said this is a very important Amendment, and I think it is a great pity that owing to the operation of the Guillotine it was not possible to discuss this matter on the normal stage&#x2014;the Report stage&#x2014;and that it should have to be taken at this most unseasonable hour of the morning. The Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary referred to this Amendment as meeting many of the points which hon. Members of this House were raising. It is true that this Amendment does go some distance towards meeting them, but it meets them in a way which is all too frequent nowadays, by administrative discretion instead of by statutory provision&#x2014;instead of doing what we wish to do, to insert in the Bill conditions which the hauliers can look to when exercising their calling. It will be left now to the discretion of the Commission and from the explanation of the Minister and Parliamentary Secretary it would seem that they could nearly re-write the Bill as far as the road hauliers are concerned.<br/>
We are not told any of the conditions under which these permits are to be issued. It simply says that they shall
<q>take into consideration the needs of, and any special circumstances affecting the locality in which is situated the operating centre.</q>
The Minister, in reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Torquay (Mr. C. Williams), said, for instance, that a town in a devastated area might be held as being special circumstances. That certainly goes very wide indeed. Does it mean that these permits are to be granted for a period, and what is the length of the period which is left within the discretion of the Commissioner. It might well be possible for the Commission to extend the 25-mile limit to the 50-mile limit. The House will see the vast im-

portance of this Amendment, which has come before the House at twenty-five past six in the morning. I suggest it is a great pity indeed that some fuller explanation could not have been given, and that more time was not available to consider an Amendment of this importance.<br/>
Would the Minister undertake to issue some sort of advice as soon as the Bill is on the Statute Book about the conditions in which the hauliers might apply the proposals which can only be in draft before the Commission begin to issue these things. I take it that as soon as possible he will enjoin on the Commissioners the desirability of putting out some skeleton forms, in which the people may see first of all how to apply for such permits; and, secondly, some of the general principles which guided the Commissioners in issuing such permits. The extension of the rules dealing with special areas such as the coastal towns, a point which has been raised by several hon. Members here, and the far wider points such as the emergency handling of perishable cargoes like fish, mentioned in an earlier stage of the Debate, are all matters on which we should have some explanation.<br/>
As I understand it, it would be quite possible for the Commissioners to issue permits for, say, heavier landings of fish at some port, and thereupon to issue permits for longer hauls to go beyond the 25 mile limit even to 50 to 80 miles. I think the House will see that the arguments which we pressed on the Minister from this side of the House have impressed the Government to a considerable extent. They have brought forward these wide, dispensing powers, and while we are grateful for them, we consider it important to remember that they are such as will provide conditions in which private enterprise may continue to compete with this great monopoly which is being set up under the Bill, and which monopoly by that method can be broken down.<br/>
While we are grateful that the Bill should be improved in this way, we do feel it is being left entirely to the discretion of the Minister. That which has been created by the Minister, may be revoked by the Minister, and it will be a very good thing for those carrying on their trade to know exactly where they stand I consider this is perhaps the most


important Amendment that has been inserted in the Bill. I think it will lead to very great confusion and it would be very much better if the Government could have seen fit to accept some of our earlier proposals. While we are creating a new crime, that of being found 25 miles away from home with a lorry trying to carry goods, this new crime can be modified by a number of regulations, about which the House of Commons are not being told, because of any special circumstances or any geographical considerations which may seem good to the Commissioners.<br/>
6.30 a.m.<br/>
To create a crime first and then modify it by a series of unspecified regulations is not a businesslike way of going about the administration of this country. I feel that even yet the Minister will find it better to limit this area of vagueness by allowing the insertion in the Bill of more statutory provisions and not leaving the Bill as it is, a perfectly fixed and rigid thing, and then putting in unspecified modifications under which apparently almost anything can be done according to any decision of the Commissioners of the time. This Bill stands for a long time. Other Government may well come in and other Commissioners may well be appointed and so far as I can see by the mere <i>ipse dixit</i> of the Minister the whole Bill can be turned inside out and the work the House has been doing over so many hours can be totally nullified. I do hope the Government will take an early step to define on the whole what they are doing. Frankly, if the Bill is left as it is now, it will be so vague that any road haulier reading the Bill will be completely unable to see if he shall or shall not be put out of business by the provisions which Parliament has now put through.</p>

<p>I think this Amendment looks very attractive at first sight, but I am not very happy about it. I hope the Government, after what I have said, will

consider some Amendment to this Amendment and that the Solicitor-General, who has been very arduous in his attendance, will assist us on this matter. It appears to me that here one is really limiting the discretion of the Commission to these cases that we may call remote or coastal areas. My right hon.

<p>&#x2014;in the event of a strike or dislocation or a serious shortage or any contingency that well may happen in the administration of a Socialist Government. They are matters which we must try and cover by this Amendment if possible. The House will see from Clause 52 (2) that:
<q>The Commission shall have full power in their discretion.</q>
That is how the Bill originally was. Now we are going to say:
<q>Provided that the Commission shall, in exercising their discretion, take into consideration the needs of, and special circumstances affecting, the locality.</q>
Not the type of goods carried, not the emergency you are trying to cover, but merely the locality. It would be easy, I suggest, to get over the difficulty by merely putting the words "<i>inter alia</i>" before the words "the needs of." Earlier the Minister said that he was expecting under Clause 52 to cover the position of emergency shortages of milk. I am sorry if I am misquoting him, and I hope that he will correct me if that is so, but I heard him say this was the place where he would deal with the case, and that the Commission would have no hesitation in granting a permit for milk to be carried more than 25 miles by a small trader to deal with a temporary shortage, or the case of hospitals and schools. That was the way he managed to persuade most of his followers to go into the Lobby with him. Now I believe that by this Amendment he is preventing the Commission dealing with a case of the emergency character by these means.</p>

<p>I share with the right hon. and gallant Member for the Scottish Universities (Lieut. - Colonel Elliot) anxiety as to the interpretation and effect of this Amendment. It certainly is not clear to me, and I think it would be


tar from clear in its effect to any road haulier who would be affected by the Clause. So far as the point I was reasing earlier is concerned, which we hoped was to be met by this Amendment, I shall be grateful if the Minister can give me some further guidance, and, if possible, an assurance. The point was the one about the sea coast areas. I think it was the Parliamentary Secretary who said, in effect, that it would be possible in such a case, where the haulier was unable to have the 2,000 square miles because he only had a radius as opposed to a diameter of 25 miles, to apply for this permit, under which he could be granted additional facilities. What I want to know is whether it will be open to the Commission on this Amendment to grant a general open permit, to say a road haulier in Bognor Regis&#x2014;"Notwithstanding that the Bill says 25 miles is the limit, you may for next year extend your limit to a radius of 50 miles." Can we have a categorical answer to that? If the answer is "yes," may we take advantage of the presence of the Solicitor-General to get an assurance that there will not be any legal difficulty under Clause 52 (1) and the provision that goods shall not be carried more than 25 miles except in accordance with a permit granted by the Commission. Can he assure us that that interpretation of the proviso we are now discussing is&#x2014;as we hope it is, and as we understand the Parliamentary Secretary intended it to be&#x2014;for the benefit of persons in the position I have described that the widespread effect of the proviso will not nullify the general intention of Subsection r of the same Clause?</p>

<p>We have been told remarkably little about the intentions of the Government in the use of the very wide powers which this Amendment will give them. The only hint we have had came a good many hours ago when the Parliamentary Secretary indicated to some extent how the special needs of the coastal areas could be met. If I recollect rightly, the Parliamentary Secretary drew the attention of the House in this connection to this particular provision. May I put to him the difficulty which occurs to me in this particular matter? The Parliamentary Secretary in resisting the argument that the Bill itself should contain statutory

provision for the coastal areas put forward the argument that to do so would wreck the Bill because so many of the large centres of population&#x2014;I think he mentioned London, Liverpool and Cardiff&#x2014;were coastal areas. If this is a valid objection to statutory provision in the Bill, surely it is an equally valid or invalid objection to this provision, which does it by administrative means. Is it the intention of the Government that the Transport Commission can use these powers under this Amendment in order to deal specifically with the problem of the coastal areas?<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister are perfectly well aware that the difficult problems of London and Greater London are unique. Is this provision designed to deal with that and to deal, in particular, with the difficulties which arise under the Bill as it now stands&#x2014;that is, that an operator in one part of Greater London cannot without a licence reach certain other parts of the Greater London area? Is it the intention of the Government and the Commission to deal with that anomaly so as to secure that a traffic operator located, say, at Kingston shall be entitled to operate his vehicle to any part of the Greater London area without a licence, whether the distance is 25 miles or more?</p>

<p>I think the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton) has raised an important point in saying that this Clause is not wide enough, and probably the words, <i>inter alia,</i> would considerably strengthen the hands of the Minister. The word "locality," so far as I know, is a geographical term and would cover the case of Plymouth and any seaside place which constituted only a segment of a circle. I am not sure it would cover the instance of perishable fish, which was raised by my hon. and right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Scottish Universities (Lieut.-Colonel Elliot). "Locality" is a very special word, and has a geographical meaning, and whereas I admit that a fishing "area" is likely to produce fish, I am not quite sure that "locality" quite covers the point. I have in my own constituency, for example, a famous firm which manufactures sausages and meat pies, which are also perishable, and it is a question as to whether they&#x2014;quite a small portion of the city of Bath&#x2014;are really a "locality" within the meaning of this provision.<br/>
6.45 a.m.<br/>
I would like to go back to the important hypothetical case of moving a friend or a mother-in-law. This is what the Minister calls the machinery for the tests for the purposes of definition and there will be literally hundreds of hauliers who are genuinely short-distance hauliers who will, in exceptional circumstances, have exceeded the 25 miles and may even have gone over a long-distance to move a friend who has a house and it is very important that he should be moved. The Commission would need to have the power to call that small haulier a short-distance haulier notwithstanding that he had once or twice gone a very long distance. If the Minister is relying upon this particular Clause, then I am afraid that it is not wide enough, and that the word "locality," being a geographical term, is restrictive. I think that my hon. Friend has raised a matter of importance.</p>

<p>I am more attracted by the words "affecting the locality," at all events so far as my own constituency is concerned, than is the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Mr. Turton), whose apprehensions I share as regards the lack of specification. I was very surprised with the hilarity when my hon. Friend was speaking, exhibited by the hon. Member for Sparkbrook (Mr. Shurmer). I should have thought that in this matter affecting the livelihood of so many, anything that makes for better distribution would have a more ready and better hearing from the hon. Member for Spark-brook. I see from his assent that he thinks better of it and will no doubt give a better hearing again. I represent a rural district in Scotland, where conditions are very different from those obtaining south of the Border. Over wide sparsely populated areas road transport plays an important part indeed. In Scotland there will be no executive body. In England and Wales there will be something like five or six executive bodies to assist the Commission&#x2014;</p>

<p>I apologise, Sir. I would merely say that in Scotland there will be no body such as in England and

Wales. The Commission will have a much more difficult task there in taking into consideration the special conditions which would obtain within a locality than it would in England and Wales. That is why I join with my right hon. and gallant Friend the Member for the Scottish Universities (Lt.-Colonel Elliot). If this Measure reaches the Statute Book&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS "It will."] It might not, but when that fatal day almost inevitably arrives, a direction may be given to the Commissioners at all events as to how they should receive special conditions obtaining in any locality which this Amendment, perhaps not too precisely worded, aids.</p>

<p>From this short discussion it is obvious that these words are extremely difficult to interpret. I find it difficult to interpret them, and I venture to put before the House what seem to me to be the difficulties. Then perhaps the hon. and learned Solicitor-General will favour us with his interpretation, because it really it not fair to expect the House to accept the Amendment when it is quite clear that nobody really knows what it means. The word which bothers me is "locality." I will leave aside for the moment the other points which I think are of some importance. The Commission is required to take into consideration the needs of the locality in which is situated the operating centre I should have thought that they would take into account the needs of the people just outside the fringe of the radius in which the operator would be allowed to operate if he did not have a permit. If one takes the word "locality" in its ordinary meaning, surely it means either a town or village, or a town with its suburbs if the suburbs are outside the municipal boundary. It means a comparatively small district.<br/>
I should have thought that, generally speaking, it would be difficult to apply the word "locality" to anything more than five or ten miles across That is my understanding of the meaning of the word "locality." "Local" means any local place. Strictly speaking, it means quite a small area. Taking a broader view of its meaning, I would say that it might be an area five or ten miles across But surely, what ought to be considered is whether the people outside the radius of 25 miles are going to get a proper service


if a permit is not given. I do not repeat the other point about the needs of the operators; I am thinking now of the needs of the public which will not be served if a permit is refused. These people to my mind, cannot possibly be understood to be in the locality in which the head office is situated.<br/>
There may be an easy explanation of this. I assume that the right hon. Gentleman has his mind directed in the first place to the public reed, and in the second place to the needs of the operators themselves, and that those are the two main considerations. I say nothing about the second one. On the first point, with regard to the public, I would like to be assured that in this phraseology the needs of the people outside the permitted area who could benefit from the permit are taken into account. I do not see that they are. It is true that they may be directed to take into consideration the needs. They may be directed to consider some other ground altogether if they want to. But after all, a direction of this sort is very limiting; such directions are generally taken in a limiting sense by those who are to carry them out, because they say that Parliament has directed specifically their attention to certain points and they ought not to go beyond those points, apart from exceptional cases. It is the point which tends generally to be the only one which receives consideration at all. In that case, half the object of this definition will fail altogether, while the other half will be left in a very sketchy position. For myself, I think I would almost prefer the Clause as it stood. But perhaps we can discover what the Government intends this to mean.</p>

<p>If I may have the permission of the House, I would like to say that, after having listened to the right hon. and learned Gentleman, I am wondering if I am doing the right thing in moving to agree with this Amendment. Throughout all the stages of this Bill I have had emphasised to me the need for at least an indication to the Commission that, in granting permits, which, in a general way, will be given on a practical basis, it is necessary to remember that there are coastal towns. Furthermore, hon. Members from Scottish constituencies will recall the way in

which the "town across the boundary" was spoken of some hours ago. There should be provision for special needs, and it is in the desire to meet that that the Government has put in this Amendment; but if it is not appreciated I am satisfied with the original wording, and I will withdraw it. After full consultation with another place, I felt that this was the best position which could be devised. I think it ought to go in, but I am not pressing it.</p>

<p>May I put one point? If the wording is to be reconsidered, the point I should like the hon. and learned Solicitor-General to consider is this: whether the difficulties felt in all quarters are not caused by the words, "provided that." It is customary, surely, in drafting for these words to give some limitation on what has gone before. What goes before here is that the Commission shall have full power in their discretion to grant or refuse. What should be made clear is that, in exercising their discretion, they shall take certain things into consideration, but it is not intended to be a proviso at all. The improvement which the Government seek to secure is really vitiated by the faulty opening words.</p>

<p>I do not feel that the Amendment limits the discretion. A full discretion is given by Subsection (2) of Clause 52. That gives the Commission power to consider everything&#x2014;the needs of what have been termed as the "immediate localities," and the areas outside those localities, and other needs. A completely unfettered discretion is given, and without the proviso, one would not have had to consider these things. But we now say that one will exercise one's discretion and at least consider those things in the proviso, together with anything in one's discretion.</p>

<p>I do not think so, because the words "provided that" are necessary, otherwise there is an apparent


contradiction.

<p>I understand it would suit the Opposition if I dealt with all these Amendments together. The first, in page 74, line 4, requires the Commission to obtain a carrier's licence in respect of all the short distance work and some of the excluded traffics mentioned in Clause 52 in respect of short and long distance work. It appears to us to be wholly inappropriate that the Commission should have to obtain a carrier's licence from the licensing authority. In order to do that they have to apply like ordinary applicants to the licensing authority set up under the Road and Rail Traffic Act, 1933, and prove that there is need for

the proposed haulage work; and they have to prove that that work cannot be done by other existing organisations. In view of the fact that this Bill imposes a duty on the Commission to carry out all long distance road haulage work, and to see that there are provided transport services, short distance and long distance, I suggest it would be wholly inappropriate if the Commission, whenever they considered a service was necessary, had to apply to the area licensing authority for permission to carry goods. For that reason I suggest that we disagree with this Lords Amendment.</p>

<p>I think the case requires a great deal more elaboration than the Parliamentary Secretary has given it. As I see the question, the case is far from being as simple as he made out. The Bill left this House with the Commission and the agents exempt by the provisions of Sections 72 to 76 of the Traffic Act of 1930. In other words, the Commission was not to be subject to the jurisdiction of the Traffic Commissioners. Now not only is the Commission to be exempt but also the agents of the Commission or anyone appointed to operate road services within the area of the scheme. As the Bill came back from another place, all operators both passenger road transport services and ordinary road transport, whether the Transport Commission, Executive or agents or workmen under contract, have to apply to the Traffic Commission for a licence, with the very important exception that the Traffic Commissioners are bound to give effect to any scheme made under Part IV of this Bill.<br/>
It does seem to me that this is in no way a wrecking Amendment. The situation is not half as simple, nor will it be during the next four or five years or even 10 years, as hon. Members may think. We must remember that quite apart from the services run by a body under the Part 4 scheme, the Commission is entitled under Clause 2 (1, <i>a</i>) to have a general power to carry passengers by road to places in Great Britain. Then further on, in Clause 2 (2, <i>e</i>) it has power to acquire by agreement any passenger road transport undertaking. In addition, by reason of the acquiring of such a combined road haulage undertaking consisting of lorries for the carriage of goods and buses for the carriage of its passengers the Commis-


sion and the Executive may find themselves at a very early date&#x2014;this is an important point for the immediate future&#x2014;running buses in various localities.<br/>
Under Clauses 2 (1, <i>a</i>) and 2 (3) the Commission is entitled to carry on the running of these buses. Under Section 72 of the Road Traffic Act of 1930 an operator before he can run road services must apply for a road service licence to the Commission. This is an important point. The Commission must hear applications at public sittings at which the public and the Press attend. Local and other operators have the right to get up and say what they think. Licences have to be renewed every one, two, or three years. Every member of the public has the right to get up at the public inquiry and object to the continuation of the services or fares&#x2014;and that does occur.<br/>
The Traffic Commissioners have to approve the fares charged and prevent excessive fares or uneconomic fares being charged. I believe there is a strong case for the Traffic Commission during the interregnum period being charged with the control over omnibus services. The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that he said on 29th April&#x2014;I have not a copy of HANSARD with me, so I cannot quote the exact words&#x2014;that it might be five years or more before company buses were taken over. During that time in the country we are going to have concerns some of which will be run by Road Executives and some by private bus companies and some possibly by individual owners. It seems to me that there will be a great injustice done if this Measure which has come down from another place is negatived because any operator of road services will have the right to representation in respect of any of the services of the Commission.<br/>
But the Commission, on the other hand, can contact the Traffic Commissioners, and make representations or objections to other operator services. I do not think that is fair to the operators. I do not believe that the right hon. Gentleman wishes to create that situation, although from a long-range point of view he may have an argument for not subjecting this great almighty Commission to any authority at all. The licensing authorities are responsible for the co-ordination of road services in the localities where they are

appointed, and I believe by and large most hon. Members will think that they have, and are doing a very good job. But the strength of the case in favour of the Amendment is not based in my opinion on the rights of the individual operator; but far more on the rights of the travelling public.<br/>
The travelling public are going to be deprived of their right of appeal to the Traffic Commissioners if this Amendment is removed. So, members of the public and the Press will lose all their right under Section 72 of the 1930 Act of appearing at the public inquiries and stating their views. There is no right of renewing in all these licences. If unsatisfactory services are being run, the public have the right to try to stop the licence being renewed. They are going to lose that right and I think it is unfortunate in view of the very difficult situation which is going to exist in the next five years or possibly more when the switch from the privately owned to buses owned by the Road Executive is taking place. This is not only a question of objecting generally regarding the operation of transport because the Traffic Commissioners are obliged to sanction the types of vehicles to be used and the views of the public have an important effect on the types being produced in this country and thus on those made available for export abroad. It opens up a vast field. The Traffic Commissioners have to sanction routes and the times the buses run, and this causes the greatest controversy. In my own constituency between Folkestone and Hythe people in the middle are never satisfied. This happens almost anywhere. There is also the vexed question of stopping places, and I know people appreciate and the House itself appreciates the right of appeal.<br/>
Apart from that I believe that a really vital issue is raised in this Amendment because not only is the right of appeal being removed but&#x2014;</p>

<p>This is not at all a simple case. It raises a matter of vital policy because a situation is going to arise eventually when the Commission will be able to appeal to nobody, but the individual will have to. If nationalised concerns are going to be treated differently from private concerns or corporate concerns owned by local authorities, it is going to produce an extraordinary situation in this country. I should like to point out to the hon. Gentleman that he should advise his right hon. Friend to "tip off" the co-operative societies because their interests will be vitally affected if this matter of principle goes through this morning without full discussion. I hope that the Amendment will prevail.<br/>
We must remember that in the eyes of the law all men in this country are equal. If we are going to change that view and if we are going to change the whole approach to the British legal system whereby there will be one law for the nationalised industries and another for anybody who is not nationalised, we are raising a peculiar principle in this country. I believe that the Amendment was reasonable and that it would have worked, particularly in view of the fact that no scheme under Part IV could be sabotaged by the Traffic Commissioners. Very wisely another place inserted this Amendment, and I do not think that it could be called a wrecking Amendment. I hope that the Government will reconsider their decision.</p>

<p>I should like briefly to support the thesis which has been so ably propounded by my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Hythe (Brigadier Mackeson). It is really a very short point which is before us, and it relates to the case where a nationalised undertaking has to come before the Traffic Commissioners or similar body. Even the hon. Gentleman the Parliamentary Secretary said at one stage that this had a <i>prima facie</i> attraction, and it is to that <i>prima facie</i> attraction that I wish to first direct attention. The cause of that attraction is that there should not

be any difference as far as any legal obligations are concerned between the private operator and the nationalised industry. The hon. Gentleman's answer to that is, "But the nationalised induKry has a duty to provide services and certain other matters that are laid down in the Act." There are two answers to that. The first is that if a nationalised industry is doing its job and providing services according to the obligations laid down in the Bill, then it will have nothing to fear from coming before a tribunal of this kind. There is the second point, and this directly touches what the hon. Gentleman has said, that since the Act of 1930, the Traffic Commissioners in the case of passenger services had expressly to direct their attention to the question of the provision of uneconomic services as being one of the matter which they have to take into account in performing their licencing duties.<br/>
My hon. and gallant Friend has stressed that there is no question here of doing anything which will take from the power or effectiveness of any schemes that are made with regard to passenger vehicles, and, as far as that is concerned, no difficulty will take place. I stress, as he has done, the great effect it would have on the confidence with which the public will greet this innovation if the new bodies are prepared to put forward their proposals before an unbiased and impartial tribunal. I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider that point. It is not enough that he should support, as I know he does with the highest intentions, the bodies he is helping to create. It is riot even enough that those running these bodies should themselves have these high intentions. It is essential that the public should be convinced that these high intentions are not merely initial feelings, but are continued in the day by day working. He will convince the public of that point only if the body is prepared to take the obligations and responsibilities which others were taking for the provision of a proper service of road transport. For that reason, I do not want to resist in any way the determination so clearly stated, but I implore the right hon. Gentleman from the point of view of the success of his own scheme, not to claim a preference for his new body but let that body demonstrate its excellence by its own work.</p>

<p>I would add some comments on the first Amendment. Most of what has been said applies in the main to the passenger side, but of course the goods traffic is equally affected. The point is quite simple. Nobody asked the Commission to go in front of the Commissioners and apply for a permit in that area of the Commission's work where they have a monopoly. That is common ground. They are doing their own co-ordination and nobody else need be consulted about it. We are concerned only with that area in which both the Commission and the private hauliers are operating in competition. The right hon. Gentleman shakes his head. I am explaining it, but I think it is perfectly plain in the Amendment. As the Parliamentary Secretary does not follow this point I shall have to explain it. Clause 58 says that the Road and Rail Traffic Act shall not apply to the Commission except in certain circumstances. The Amendment says Clause 58 shall not apply in the case of short distance vehicles. That is putting the thing shortly&#x2014;I will not go into details about the 80 miles and so forth.<br/>
The point I would commend to the Parliamentary Secretary is this. Somebody has to do something about co-ordinating&#x2014;the word the Government like so much and I am glad to use it from this side, although I do not like it very much&#x2014;the work of short distance haulage runs by the Commission and runs by the individual hauliers. Just contemplate for one moment the kind of position in which the individual private hauliers are going to find themselves. They are already confined within the 25 miles limit. They have already lost many of their customers, and are subject to the competition of their fellows and the competition of the short hauliers owned by the Transport Commission. They can be undercut by the Commission because the Commission can subsidise its lorries out of railway, hotels or docks, or anything else. The Commission can even buy their garages. The Commission can flood the area with as many vehicles as they like without the permission of the Commissioners. If a private haulier says to the Commissioners he wants to extend his business or add a few lorries to it, he has to apply to the Commissioners, and so far as I can understand&#x2014;the Parliamentary Secretary will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;the Commission

can actually appear at the hearing and object to it.<br/>
Moreover, whatever the Traffic Commissioners say, the Commission can increase the number of its vehicles in that area to any extent it wants to do. The Traffic Commissioners may have to turn to a haulier and say, "I know the traffic in this area has increased, I know you are a good haulier and can put up a good case, but these fellows have put on 10 more lorries." Surely that is grossly unfair. Is it not also silly? The Parliamentary Secretary told us they wanted to get some sort of co-ordination in this business. Is this the way to do it? It is not good enough for the Parliamentary Secretary to come to the House and say that this provision is wholly inappropriate to the Commission. Why? Why should they not apply like any ordinary applicant? Why should they be treated wholly differently? He said they would have to prove there was need for their vehicles. The small hauliers have had to do that for years now. Is there any reason why the Commission should not have to do so? The Government have not made a case for rejecting this Amendment. It seems to me a sensible and also a necessary Amendment.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Member is wrong in his interpretation of the Amendment. I am informed that it would require the Commission to obtain a carrier's licence for all its short-distance work and some of the excluded traffic over short distance and long distance.</p>

<p>Then we agree on that point. I maintain, and my right hon. Friend maintains, that it is wholly inappropriate for the Commission, which is charged to produce effective services throughout the country, to have to go on each occasion it wants to develop a service to an outside body which may say "You can do this service, or the other service, on certain conditions, or you may not run here at all." It cannot possibly discharge the obligations put upon it by Parliament if a third party is in a position to interfere, and to stop the Commission doing what Parliament has charged it to do. The same applies to the suggestion that the Commission should


have to obtain road service licences in respect of all its passenger transport services. A private enterprise concern has to go to the licensing authority to ask for licences, and may be granted them on certain conditions. The idea has been to bring a certain amount of order into the chaos of existing conditions. The licensing authority will say what the fares should be, the times of operation, and the number of vehicles and journeys, and all that sort of thing. Where Parliament charges a body such as the Commission with providing an effective passenger transport service, it is wrong that the scheme of operation which the Commission proposes to put into effect should be subject to the veto of an outside body.<br/>
7.30 a.m.<br/>
When Parliament set up the London Passenger Transport Board, it was realised that competition would entirely disappear in that area, and that as the Government were charging a public body with the duty of providing a public service, it was wrong that this public body should subject itself to the local licensing authority. The L.P.T.B. does not do so. The Commission will be in exactly the same position both in regard to road and passenger work. If it was logical to exclude the L.P.T.B., when it was set up, from the authority of the licensing authority, I suggest that the same logic applies to the Commission.</p>

<p>I was horrified to hear what the Parliamentary Secretary said. He suggested that it is inappropriate for this Commission to obey the law, and is taking steps to see that it does not have to. He has told us that in the case of the L.P.T.B. special arrangements were made. What was the position of the L.P.T.B.? A great monopoly was set up&#x2014;and I am not supporting a monopoly. There was no competition any more within its area. Here the case is absolutely different. Here the small haulier is still allowed to exist with this National Transport Board coming along to compete with him&#x2014;not on equal but unequal terms. They do not have to go to the licensing authorities, they can put as many vehicles on the road as they like and can drive the small man out of business. It is a proposition that is entirely intolerable. I hope that the House will

not do anything but agree with the Lords Amendment.</p>

<p>I have seldom been I astonished by the right hon. Gentleman, and I am certainly not astonished now. This gross unfairness has been typical of everything contained in all of his speeches I have had the honour to hear. He is proposing that vast powers should be given, which do not meet any of the usual licensing laws. On the other side is the ordinary citizen. Really and honestly there should be some licensing authority, but he refuses. He has laid it down that Parliament has given the Commission a duty to do. Equally, he says, Parliament has given the licensing authority a duty to issue licences. It is perfect humbug to say that Parliament has given this duty: it has not done so yet. I was frankly hoping that in a case of this sort we should have a free vote. The country should know that the right hon. Gentleman proposes to arm this Commission with such power that it absolutely does not fit in with the transport licensing laws&#x2014;that it operates with gross unfairness in the way of competition with the private citizen right through the Bill from beginning to end.<br/>
Here is the worst example. It is the deliberate wish of the whole of the Front Bench opposite to apply the law in such a way that they harass the small man as much as they possibly can. The whole object of the Bill is to try to kill the ordinary, decent little man. They have a free licence to do what they like. It is a completely monstrous position which the Government have laid down here, and I do hope that we shall have a chance to vote against it, and that the Press of the country will show the way in which the ordinary citizens of this country are being treated by the Government. We dislike monopolies and Government monopolies. We have heard a lot about monopolies from hon. Gentlemen opposite for a long time and the first thing that they do when they get into power is to set up monopolies.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
I do not know whether the House would like me briefly to give the reasons for disagreement with this Amendment, or whether they consider that it has all been

covered by a discussion which we had previously. Perhaps I ought to put the case briefly. This Amendment makes the road passenger fares of the Board subject to the licensing authorities under the Road Traffic Acts with a proviso that the licensing authorities should, as far as possible, have regard to the charges scheme under Part V of the Bill. We think this Amendment undesirable in that it would lead to inconsistencies in the charges schemes which have been laid down by the tribunal under the elaborate procedure which has to be gone through there, and would place one part of the activities of the Board under the further jurisdiction of an outside body. It would, we feel, introduce an inconsistent element into the whole machinery of charge making under the Bill. The licensing authorities might well place the fares in one area out of accord with the fares charged in another area, and we can see no reason at all why fares should be subject to the licensing authority in view of the machinery which has been laid down for charges schemes, and the public responsibility on the Commission to see that fares are levied according to those schemes, and that the finances of the Commission as a whole are made to pay.</p>

<p>I do not know that I find the explanation of the Parliamentary Secretary altogether satisfactory. It seems to me to be rather the same point as that which we discussed before. This is another matter of principle, because the Commission is to appear in the same field as private enterprise. Any suggestion that the two should be co-ordinated by the bodies set up by Parliament for the purpose has been rejected out of hand by the Parliamentary Secretary. It seems to me a senseless procedure, especially when Socialists talk so much about the importance of co-ordinated planning. We should oppose this proposal.</p>

<p>Once again I was hoping I might be able to deal with this Amendment in a fairly quiet way, but the Parliamentary Secretary, who can be very valuable when he wishes, obviously was so because he had so much to hide. We are beginning to understand his technique on these things. It is very simple. In this case, he quite clearly tried to put a fast one over, against the


smaller and poorer section of the community. He has tried to work himself into a position to shape affairs for the monstrous, overgrown organisation which i-; being set up by the Bill and which will dominate the lives of all of us. I have no wish to take the matter very far now, because I quite realise it will not be very long before this scheme will be wholly unpopular all through the country, nearly as unpopular as the Ministry of Health is today.</p>

<p>I should like an explanation of this Amendment. It seems to me that all it does is to substitute the word, "depreciation," for the word, "obsolescence." That may be an important change, but I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary could explain whether the position is as I have stated, or whether the matter is more complicated. If I am right, I cannot understand why the Amendment does not merely say, "leave out, 'obsolescence,' and insert, 'depreciation.'" Does the change widen the meaning of that Clause?</p>

<p>Can we have an answer? There is a very important point here, because in the Bill as printed the word "obsolescence" occurs, and, in this Amendment the word "depreciation."

<p>I had hoped that the Debate had continued sufficiently long for the Minister to ascertain the answer to the question he has been asked. It is a point of real substance. There must be a good reason why, at this late stage of our proceedings, the wording has been changed, and there should be a Minister on the Treasury Bench who can answer this question. I do not know whether the Minister is now able to reply, but if no answer can be given, I hope the Adjournment will be moved is order to give the Government time to find out the meaning of their own Bill. After all, this Bill has been before them for a number of months, and it is fantastic that they should not be able to give an interpretation of their own wording. I will give the Minister another chance, but if he cannot get an answer for us, we shall have to divide against this Amendment</p>

<p>If it would be for the convenience of the House I think it would be right to deal with all these Amendments at the same time, and also with the two Amendments which are down in the Minister's name. The first Amendment is in page 106, line 8, after "Service," insert:
<q>after consultation with the Lord Chancellor or, where the proceedings are to be held in Scotland, after consultation with the Secretary of State.</q>
The issue here is perfectly clear. It was between the finality of referees appointed by the Minister, on the one hand, and arbitration proceedings on the other, and the reason why we prefer the referee procedure is that it is simple, expeditious, and cheap, and by it everybody knows where he is. On the other hand, if this Amendment were allowed, it would involve frequent, expensive, complicated litigation, and there is no prospect how far that litigation would go. The problem which is to be faced here seems to us to be a simple problem, if it is properly met by being dealt with by a referee. When the Amendment was dealt with in another place something was said about endeavouring to meet the point which was put forward by the Opposition. We cannot go the whole way, but we are putting down in lieu of the Lords Amendments two Amendments to clarify the situation.<br/>
The first of our Amendments is an attempt to meet the point that was taken by the Opposition. That Amendment pro-

vides that where there is to be a referee or board of referees appointed by the Minister of Labour there must be consultation in England with the Lord Chancellor and in Scotland with the Secretary of State. That is to ensure that the referees, technical referees particularly, have sufficient knowledge to deal with the matter, which stresses the legal aspect.<br/>
Then there is another new Clause which is to be moved in the Minister's name&#x2014;(<i>Arbitration Acts not to apply to proceedings before referees or boards of referees</i>). That is to get rid of a technical difficulty which, I understand, exists under English law, and to make it clear beyond any doubt whether or not the Arbitration Acts, 1889 to 1934, would apply to a question of this sort.</p>

<p>I realise that to save time the Lord Advocate has not fully developed the case here, but I feel it cannot be allowed to rest where he has left it because this is an extremely important matter. It does not amount to a great deal in money so far as the Stale is concerned. But here we are dealing with pensions which affect men for the rest of their lives and it does seem wholly wrong when we are dealing with an important matter of that sort, that a man should not be allowed to be heard before a referee in the first place, and should not have the right to have legal rights determined by a court of law: because they are legal rights. They flow not from any <i>ex gratia</i> concession but from the terms of an Act of Parliament.<br/>
I thoroughly realise that when you got a matter of temporary concern such as unemployment benefit, it may be perfectly right to say there should be no appeal in law and it may be that you would be right to say&#x2014;here I have more doubt&#x2014;it should not even be heard. But that is a matter which lasts only six months and if another claim arises, it will arise in different circumstances and the first decision would not be binding. But here is a matter which affects a man for his whole life. I seem to remember that the last time a Government sought to simplify procedure in connection with pensions claims, it worked out so badly, that it was found necessary in a very short time to set up appeals tribunals, and even they have not worked too well


because in a number of cases final resort to courts of law has resulted in the overturning of the very basis on which the tribunals were working. Surely, that is an example we all ought to bear in mind? There was a case where the Government from the best motives sought to simplify procedure and exclude reference to a court of law. What happened? The simplified procedure was not capable of dealing properly with all the issues involved. There was a public outcry and the whole thing had to be remodelled. Surely, the Government are not going to say that because only comparatively few people are affected they need not trouble so much to do justice. The fact that there are comparatively few people involved, very much weakens their argument. Where there are hundreds of thousands of people it may be wrong to have a complicated procedure and embarrassing to the administrative machine. But where there are comparatively few people involved there cannot be that embarrassment to administration. Therefore, there can be no practical obstacle to the doing of justice.<br/>
What is the precedent? In 1921, there was the railways amalgamation. This system was not adopted. A proper system was adopted of allowing a man a full opportunity to get his pension settled. Are the Government really going to say that when a subject is dealing with the State he must expect a much lower level of justice than when he is dealing with a railway company? That is what they are saying and I hope they will realise before it is too late that that is what they are doing. There is an interesting background to this and I would like to refer to it for a moment, because in another place the Government spoke with two voices, and the one voice followed the other without any intervening speaker. I know it is not in order to refer to others than those speaking on behalf of the Government in another place, but the case was put forward with great particularity for an Amendment which it is now sought to delete. Then Lord Chorley read out the official brief which was almost exactly the same as that given today. By and large the arrangements in the Bill as it left this House were most satisfactory&#x2014;and all the phrases that the Lord Advocate has just given. But immediately following on Lord Chorley resuming his seat, Lord

Addison got up and said that he had been in conference with someone and he offered this suggestion. He said:
<q>We are greatly impressed with the case made out by the noble and learned Viscount (Lord Simon) and if we can agree that the Amendment should be accepted on the understanding that we may in another place, or in some other way, have to suggest perhaps some modification, I would suggest we should accept the Amendment now and cut short the discussion.</q>
"Perhaps some modification"&#x2014;what has happened to that? There has been complete reversal, not modification. We have gone back to what we had before with one tiny exception as far as I can see. The main point has been completely reversed, and, therefore, what has happened is that the official brief has prevailed against the Ministerial wish, as it so often does in this Government.<br/>
I am really surprised at the right hon. Gentleman. He has seen what has happened to the official brief in the other House. He saw the Leader of the other House throw over in a most astonishing way what had been said by the other noble Lord, and now the right hon. Gentleman comes back to the House of Commons and says, "I am going back to what Lord Addison threw over." Is that situation right? I do beg the Minister not to play with pensioners' rights in this way. I do not want to say more on this occasion&#x2014;though I would like to&#x2014;because perhaps if I did, it would prejudice the chance of the Minister changing his mind. But I do sincerely plead in the interests of those men whose whole future depends on whether or not they get a pension, and how much it is. Can they even appear before the man settling their fate? I think they are allowed to do that but cannot they then be allowed to go on to a court of law?<br/>
I should not think that there would be half a dozen cases&#x2014;there might be one or two test cases&#x2014;but even if there were half a dozen is it not worth while, in order that men may feel that they have gone to a court of law for a legal decision, and that, after all, justice has been done by His Majesty's judges, and that they had not been condemned by a lay tribunal who may not be so well fitted to deal with them as a legal tribunal. I ask the right hon. Gentleman to change his mind on this question.</p>

<p>I quite recognise the point put by the right hon. and learned Member for Hillhead (Mr. J. S. C. Reid), and I am anxious to reply to it. The question is merely one as to the time at which I should intervene. I had intended to deal with that point, and with the reservation of the noble Lord, when the Government Amendment was dealt with, and when replying also to any other observations which might call for a reply.</p>

<p>I was afraid that the matter was about to be determined by the vote of the House. I rose to prevent that from happening. I would be obliged if the Minister would now address himself to that point.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1529.3" hansard_membership_id="928" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/28712" speakername="Mr. Barnes" colnum="1529" time="">
<p>If I may, by leave of the House, I will deal with the point which has been submitted about the difference in the position today from what was deemed to be the position in view of the statement made in another place. I desire to deal with that point because to some extent I was associated with it, and as a difference has occurred, the best way to deal with it is to be perfectly frank, and explain exactly what the position is. The discussion in the other place proceeded primarily on legal lines, and the Government were only too anxious to be satisfied that no injustice to any class of pensioners would be perpetrated within the provisions of the Bill. All through the discussions we have been particularly careful to try to safeguard the pension rights of all classes in the different transport undertakings. This appeared to be primarily a point of law, and during the discussions in another place it appeared to have some substance, to the extent that I considered, with the Leader of the other House, that it ought to receive further examination.<br/>
In the time that has elapsed between the Bill leaving another place and our consideration of the Lords Amendments, the matter has been fully considered by the Government. The machinery, which is now fairly widespread and extensive, the machinery of the Ministry of Labour, has been considered, and the Government's decision is to the effect that we do not consider that that procedure should be substantially modified, or needs modification, to do complete justice in this case. Therefore, in the Amendment

which is being submitted, in view of our disagreement with the Lords Amendment, it will be observed that we seek to delete the Lords Amendment which would insert rights under the Arbitration Acts, 1889 to 1934, and, so that there can be no doubt about the position, we propose, in page III, line 5, after Clause 103, to insert the following new Clause:
<q>Nothing in the Arbitration Acts, 1889 to 1934, shall be construed as applying to any proceedings before a referee or board of referees appointed tinder this Part of this Act by the Minister of Labour and National Service after consultation with the Lord Chancellor or, where the proceedings are held in Scotland, after consultation with the Secretary of State.</q>
I quite agree that we do not want any doubt to exist on this matter. The extent to which the Government feel they can go is that the Minister of Labour and National Service, in appointing a referee, should do so after consultation with the Lord Chancellor. We feel that that will ensure that according to the type of case that has to be adjudicated upon, which requires a legal mind, the knowledge of the Lord Chancellor will secure that necessary protection. That being the case, the Government do not consider that the normal procedure which has been built up, and which, in the main, has the confidence of those bodies and organisations which speak for them, should be departed from on this occasion. The Government have given full and serious consideration to the matter, and this is our final conclusion.</p>

<p>May I, with the leave of the House speak again? I had forgotten, Major Milner, that I had put a question to the Minister. The Minister will recollect that in Committee my hon. Friends and I took very great interest in this question of the pension rights. It is clear from what the Minister has told us that, when this matter was dealt with in another place, the Leader of the House there gave them to understand that a substantial alteration would be made. We have now heard from the Minister a very


frank account of what took place, but I am bound to say, speaking for right hon. and hon. Members on this side of the House, that we are not at all satisfied with the situation as it is left.<br/>
I was very surprised to find the learned Lord Advocate coming down here to make this case for the Minister. Though we are very glad to have with us the Lord Advocate, who has had the advantage of having a good night's rest, as some of us have not&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I apologise I had not noticed him on the Bench opposite in the earlier stages of the Debate.

<p>I beg to move, "That this House doth disagree with the Lords in the said Amendment."<br/>
I do not think that the House will want me to elaborate this Amendment at this stage, but if it is discussed later on, I will make a further reply. The point, simply is this: in any local inquiry which is held under the Bill, the Lords Amendment provides that the person holding that inquiry shall not be a servant or officer of the Minister. The Amendment also provides that the report shall be published and that the Commission and any objector are to appear at the inquiry and be subject to cross-examination. We disagree with the Lords Amendment on what we consider good constitutional grounds. So far as I know every Department of State, when it holds public inquiries into

matters of importance, on which the Minister has to adjudicate, and where other parties are concerned, sometimes invites one of its senior officials to hold the inquiry and advise the Minister.<br/>
That is the procedure which Conservative ministers, as well as Labour ministers, have carried out, and it has been found to work exceedingly satisfactorily. These are inquiries into matters in which the Minister is not a party. He has to decide in this case between the Commission and an outside body. It is quite wrong to prevent the Minister choosing a senior servant in his Department to hold an inquiry, if he desires to do so. We also say it is wrong to force the publication of the report of the inquiry. The value of such an inquiry would be much less if it were known that that report was to be published. We also say that it is wrong that the Commission should be forced to give evidence. If it has evidence, and desires to give it, it will do so. But to force it to give evidence when the Commission think that undesirable would be wrong. For these reasons, we disagree with the Amendment, and ask the House to support us in this Motion.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary Secretary has made a rather abbreviated statement on these Amendments, to which we attach much importance. There are some rather special features about these Amendments. By no means the least is the fact that they are the last of the major Amendments we are to discuss today. This is the first time that the Eighth Schedule has been discussed by us. Therefore I do not think it unreasonable, at this rather extraordinary hour&#x2014;I do not know whether it is a late hour or an early hour&#x2014;that we should give some attention to these


matters. They were given careful attention in another place and it should be realised before we part with this stage of the Bill that these inquiries are of very great importance and affect very large numbers of people.<br/>
There are the schemes for passenger road transport. From time to time we have discussed the schemes the Government have in mind for passenger road transport and they have given very vague answers, because they state, quite frankly and fairly, that the schemes are not highly developed. Inquiries into the schemes are of very great importance and will affect every person who uses road transport for business or pleasure. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend the Member for Montrose Burghs (Mr. Maclay) will be saying something about docks and harbours. I have nothing to say on that, except that the schemes will affect an enormous number of people, from shipowners to stevedores, every type of person connected with the export trade. If we are to have inquiries of this sort we should be very careful to see how they are set up and conducted.<br/>
9.30 a.m.<br/>
It is not just a small point, but a question of an inquiry over the whole, broad field of these two matters. Though the Minister himself&#x2014;and this is the important thing&#x2014;will make the decision as a result of these inquiries, the action that he takes is purely administrative. That, I believe, is the whole argument of the Government. The inquiries are themselves of a quasi-judicial nature, and it is essential, if they are to be conducted properly, that witnesses who appear should be properly examined and, if necessary, cross-examined. Therefore, we take exception to the rather light way in which the Parliamentary Secretary dealt with the question of the Commission's giving evidence on these matters. I think I am right in saying that the precedent for this is the formation of the Clyde Port Trust, which is, I believe, conducted by Lord Cooper, and it is on the lines of that inquiry that we want these inquiries to take place. That inquiry was very carefully conducted, and at the end of it agreement was reached, and everybody was satisfied with what took place. I suggest that it is very important that not only should the Minister give a decision that is right, but that the people who

have to work with him should feel that they have had their say, and have played their parts in reaching the right decision. I know the right hon. Gentleman has that in mind, just as much as we have on this side; and so there is not a great deal between us on this Amendment. It is not a party matter, but a matter of technical administration<br/>
I should like, briefly, to submit the three points I want to make with regard to this matter. First, we feel that the man who holds the inquiry should be an independent person. I do not think that that can be considered by anybody in any part of the House as unreasonable. What the Parliamentary Secretary says, quite rightly, is that it is possible for the Minister to choose a civil servant, somebody capable of taking this inquiry; although that may be so, I think it would be wrong that somebody in the Minister's employ should be the person to take the inquiry. Fundamentally, it is wrong that the Minister should set up the court, be his own judge, and say what witnesses are to be admitted. Though he may get just as good a chairman from the Civil Service, it would be better for the whole conduct of the inquiry if the person who presides is an independent person.<br/>
Second, the case should be clearly stated. It is most important that the ca se should be put fairly and squarely, that either side should have the chance o cross-examine the other. Third, the report should be published; I cannot quite see why there should not be publication. I understand that the inquiries are to take place more or less in public, that anybody who wants to listen will be allowed to do so, and that the report will be published for the people concerned. I understand that the only objection to publication is that it might force the Minister's servants to render confidential reports to him that would have to be made public. That is not our intention. Our intention is that when the inquiry has taken place, and when the public have been allowed in&#x2014;and I understand there will be fairly wide circulation of the proceedings&#x2014;the proceedings should to generally available. If there is nothing to hide, I do not see why the Government should take exception to this Amendment. But if there is anything secrer, and the proceedings are not held in public, then suspicions will arise. These


three points are not matters of great and sweeping principle, but we attach great importance to them, and, in view of the somewhat narrow difference between the Government and ourselves, I would urge that they should be reconsidered.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1947-07-23a.1539.0" hansard_membership_id="8730" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/17725" speakername="Mr. Maclay" colnum="1539" time="">
<p>My hon. Friend the hon. Member for Oswestry (Mr. Poole) put with admirable clarity the main points which we would wish to cover in our case. I should like to deal more specifically with the ports and docks' side and the inquiries into the kind of scheme. The Minister, at another stage, produced an Amendment which meant that consultation between the Commission and the interested parties was very complete, and it might be argued that consultation was so good that it took away most of our worries. I do not think that that necessarily follows, because in making a scheme it is laid down that
<q>The Commission may, with a view to securing the efficient and economical development, maintenance or management of any trade harbour or group of trade harbours, prepare, in consultation with the persons theretofore carrying on harbour undertakings in or in connection with the harbour or group of harbours and with such bodies or persons as the Commission may consider to be properly representative of shipping and traders actually using, and of workers actually employed in, the harbour or group of harbours, and submit to the Minister a scheme providing for all or any of the following matters&#x2026;</q>
It may be said that that is extremely comprehensive in regard to consultation, and that if agreement is reached between all those parties there is chance of real substantial agreement. But we must remember that there are others who should be consulted, such as local authorities, whose property lies behind a port or harbour. Where there is objection which comes under special Parliamentary procedure, surely it is reasonable to suggest that the public inquiry should be one which would command the complete confidence of everybody who can possibly be concerned. I agree that on this matter there is not much between us and the Government. We are trying to get procedure to work smoothly, as far as possible, because if any ill-feeling is left it will do enormous harm. The Parliamentary Secretary made what seemed to me a very surprising remark when he said it had been common practice in the past for Ministers to appoint their own men to handle these inquiries. I must submit that in this kind of Bill there is a

new kind of scheme, and I do not think that before this Government came into power there were any schemes which went into such detail as we are now going into concerning all sorts of industries, ports, and other activities which had previously been handled, not by Governments, but under different circumstances altogether. If there was a case for that kind of inquiry in the past, there is no such case today for its continuance. We have got to satisfy all kinds of people if these schemes are going to work.<br/>
Another difficulty is the proposal to make all inquiries public inquiries. My remarks in this connection are directed not only to the Parliamentary Secretary, but also to the Home Secretary. I would remind him that when we were discussing another Bill of which he was in charge something like the same issue arose in regard to inquiries for which he was responsible. I asked a question as to what was the procedure in these local public inquiries, and I found that there was no set procedure at all, that it varied from place to place. I am not clear now whether the words, "public local inquiry," actually mean a definite procedure which is to be followed in every inquiry, when we use the words, "public local inquiry ' as distinct from an inquiry. It would be extremely valuable if we could be told just what procedure will be followed for a public inquiry, and whether it will follow the pattern which is adopted under other Bills. Only last night I attended an inquiry, which was conducted with admirable fairness. But it was not possible to ascertain, in advance, how it was to be handled, and, indeed, it was clear that there was no set procedure. It is highly desirable that, with all these Bills coming before us, which affect the trade and commerce of the country, and where there is provision for a local inquiry, there should be absolute certainty in regard to that provision. I submit that the suggestions incorporated in these Amendments are the only basic ones which would satisfy the needs of such an inquiry.</p>

<p>An argument advanced from the other side in favour of the nationalisation of road passenger transport has been that the Commission is to be able to provide excellent co-ordinated schemes. There is no doubt that these schemes will affect a very large number of people, because many people in this country use the buses.


I cannot understand why the Minister is so frightened about holding a full public inquiry, and having the details published. One of the effects of this Amendment will be to ensure that evidence is taken. Surely, the public have the right to see that such evidence is given, and to have the results of the inquiry published.<br/>
With regard to the question as to who is to conduct the inquiry, I do not think that, in a case like this, the Minister should send down one of his officials to conduct it. He is in a very special position owing to the stranglehold which he insists on keeping on the Commission in regard to the schemes under Part IV of this Bill. The Commission are the promoters of these schemes, and are responsible to the Minister for them. He can, in fact, direct them to prepare a scheme for a specified area, and, having done that, can then send down one of his officials to conduct an inquiry into it, the results of which will never be made known to the public. That is most unfair, and is a further indication of the nervousness of the Minister about the efficacy of his own schemes under this Bill.</p>

<p>There is only one point I wish to make in connection with what the Parliamentary Secretary said about a Conservative Administration having produced this particular form of appointment. We have objected, time after time, in previous Parliaments, to Ministers appointing their own officers to conduct inquiries. We have also objected, in like manner, to the results of such inquiries not being made public. I would refer the Parliamentary Secretary to the fact that there has not been a Conservative Administration in this country since 1929, and that under the National Government&#x2014;[HoN. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will say whether there has been a Conservative Government since 1929. Everyone knows that in a National Government there are 50 per cent. Socialists.</p>

<p>I cannot help approaching this question with a recollection of what took place at recent inquiries into town and country planning cases. Nor can I forget the elegant phraseology of one of the ornaments of the Front Bench opposite about "blowing off steam." I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman would

descend to the levels which were touched in those inquiries, but it is just possible that there might be a changeover of offices. It would be so much more satisfactory if any possibility of that kind of thing were excluded. I am not clear that it is excluded, even by the right hon. Gentleman's Amendment which is to be moved in lieu of the Lords Amendment. I hope it is, but I do not think so. I would like an assurance on that point.<br/>
I turn to the three points which were raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Oswestry (Mr. Poole), which are the essential three points. I would draw the attention of the right hon. Gentleman to the fact that for a long time past the Scottish Office have almost always employed outside people to be chairmen of even somewhat minor inquiries. I cannot remember in the last 15 years a single Scottish inquiry of first-class importance&#x2014;and I can scarcely remember any of second-class importance&#x2014;where the commissioner or chairman, or whoever was.1eputed, was not an outsider, generally a member of the Scottish legal profession. I should add that such jobs are not much sought after, because the fees do not much exceed the niggardly Treasury scale, so let it not be thought that I am putting in a plea for the legal profession. These matters are undertaken as public duties, not as lucrative jobs.<br/>
If the right hon. Gentleman were to try to appoint one of his own officials for such.an inquiry in Scotland, he would find it extremely badly received if the inquiry was one of any real moment. The right hon. Gentleman is not giving away very much here. These are inquiries of first-class importance. I do not see why the right hon. Gentleman cannot meet us on this point. I cannot imagine him ever really wanting to put one of his own officials, however highly qualified, in charge of one of these inquiries. I do not think he would, but if he did he would be extremely foolish. Even if the official were better at the job than an outsider, I still say that the right hon. Gentleman would be extremely foolish. It is certainly not so much the actual result of the inquiry that counts, as that people should feel that their case has been heard and considered by someone who is quite unprejudiced and who has no connections with the Minister.<br/>
Second, in the matter of cross-examination, I am sure that the rignt hon. Gentleman will agree, and, if he does not, any lawyer who sits behind him will tell him, that the truth of anything can never really be reached, unless the parties are allowed to cross-examine. I do not say that it is always reached then, that would be too much to hope, but it is the best way of going about the job. There is no excuse for having an inquiry where there is not the fullest right of mutual cross-examination, and cross-examination by those skilled in the law, because to ex-chide a skilled man in those circumstances is not sensible, and I do not think that the right hon. Gentleman would do that.<br/>
I come now to what is perhaps the biggest of these three questions. Whatever the right hon. Gentleman does in theory, he will, in practice, follow our suggestions on the first two points with which I have dealt. On the third, I am old-fashioned enough to refer, when opportunity occurs, to the Donoughmore Report. I know that it has been out of favour for a long time, but I would ask the right hon. Gentleman and those associated with him to read the findings in that Report. I do not think they have lost any of their importance. It is a good while since I looked at them, and I regret that I have not the passages here today, but I do not think they have lost any of their importance with the passage of time.<br/>
What is the objection? There is only one possible objection to the publication of a report. Perhaps there are two, but the one reasonable objection is that the report may contain confidential matter about the character or the behaviour of certain individuals which it would be quite improper to publish, and that if it was stated in advance that the report was to be published, that would not, and could not, be put in because the Minister would not get a full view of the situation. I know that applies where one is dealing with personal questions, but here we are dealing with enormous questions which far transcend any personal matter. I cannot conceive what kind of confidential information would be likely to be put in a report about, say, the Clyde Trust and the Clyde Harbour. I cannot imagine that if Lord Cooper's report had been a private report it would have been any more informative to the Minister; certainly

it would have lost half its importance, because the general public would not have had an opportunity of seeing and studying it. These reports form public opinion, and surely the Minister wants to nave public opinion on his side.<br/>
These enormous matters, like area road transport and the organisation of a particular group of harbours, have always been the subject of the most careful consideration in public&#x2014;generally by more than one reporter&#x2014;then there is a very carefully framed report, and then an interval&#x2014;sometimes too long an interval&#x2014;while the whole matter is being considered, and the public mind is being directed to the question in the report. The report will lose nothing, or practically nothing, if it is known from the beginning that it will be published immediately. But it will lose an enormous lot if it is known that it will not be published, because it will then be of no use for moulding public opinion. Surely, the Minister knows that if he tackles one of these big jobs without local public opinion having been adequately prepared there is no more thorny task that he can undertake? I should have thought that for his own protection he would have made a point of seeing that the report was published.<br/>
The only other reason why he would not publish a report would be because he did not agree with it. I have no means of knowing how often in this and past Governments that has been a reason for keeping back a report. It has often been thought to be a reason. A good deal of suspicion has been engendered because it has been thought that a Minister who reached a decision which was not ultimately very popular might suppress the report because it would not fit in with the Government line. I am sure the Minister would not like that sort of suspicion to get about. Whatever might be done in minor cases, I am sure no Minister would ever take the responsibility of suppressing a report of that kind, on a matter of such extreme public importance. If he did, it would be extremely difficult to catch up with misconceptions and rumours that he had suppressed a report, and I beg him, therefore, in order that the scheme may go through smoothly, not to regard these reports as confidential. I do not want to detain the House at this time, but if what I have said does not induce the Minister to alter


his mind at this moment, I hope it will keep him on the right path when he first has to do this job in practice.</p>

<p>I have felt, both in listening to the Debates in another place, and in digesting the views put forward this morning, that this subject is being unduly laboured. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Well, I really think there is a good deal in what the hon. Member for Oswestry (Mr. Poole) said, that the difference between those who are advocating different points of view is more apparent than real. On the public inquiry point, I am meeting the Amendment fully. Let me read to the House the Clause as it was, as it would be if the Amendment from another place were accepted, and as it would stand if the Amendment in lieu of the Amendment from another place were embodied in the Clause. In the Clause as it left this House, the Minister was only obliged to cause inquiries to be made. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I do not know whether hon. Members who put various points to me are interested in my reply. I am probably more anxious than anyone to bring an end to these proceedings, but I thought hon.

<p>If this House accepted the Amendment from another place the Clause would say that the Minister should cause:
<q>&#x2026; in the case of a scheme under Part IV of this Act, a public local inquiry, or, in any other case, an inquiry, to be held with respect thereto by a person who is not a servant or officer of the Minister.</q>
I have not stated in any of the provisions of the Bill that the person holding the inquiry will be an officer of the Ministry, and I am not quite sure why that should be imported into the discussion. Of course, if an Amendment of this kind is introduced and it is said that the person to hold the inquiry shall not be an officer of the Ministry, attention is centred on the point and there is controversy about the words; but it is not the intention of the Minister to appoint officers, and so on. Members know that on matters of this kind I have steadfastly refused to be tied down unnecessarily. I do not think there is much sense in trying to provide in the Bill for every contingency of this charac-

ter. One must take into consideration the matters covered by the part of the Bill which we are discussing&#x2014;area schemes to be considered for local passenger services, area schemes to be considered for the grouping of ports, harbours, and the bodies to administer those schemes. Procedure has been laid down in the Bill to ensure that there is the fullest possible examination of the problems locally, a ad the fullest possible consultation with the local opinion.<br/>
The Amendment which I ask the House to accept in lieu of the Lords Amendment, states:
<q>Where any such objection is made and is not withdrawn, the Minister shall cause in the case of a scheme under Part IV of this Act, a public local inquiry, or, in any other case, an inquiry, to be held with respect thereto.</q>
I fully accept there that it will be a public local inquiry.</p>

<p>There is no particular significance in the words. The words are in the Lords Amendment as well, and it is to cover the same contingency. Here, we are dealing primarily with the type of inquiry to determine the area to be covered, and that is to be a public local inquiry. If that is the case, it follows that it will be open to the Press. All interested bodies can submit their case and they will get the fullest possible publicity. I cannot conceive that there would be many cases where the Minister would object to publication.<br/>
When the hon. Member for Oswestry said that the person who holds the inquiry ought to be independent of the Minister, or otherwise the Minister would be a judge in his own cause, that indicated a complete misunderstanding of the functions of the Minister. The Minister will not inaugurate these schemes. It is the Commission which will initiate the proceedings which lead up to the consideration of the schemes. The Minister carries a detached responsibility to see that the schemes go through a certain procedure and are thoroughly examined, and that all local interested opinion has an oppor-


tunity of putting its case. The Minister must satisfy himself that that is done, before he is prepared to put it in the form of an Order. Finally, if there is any dissatisfaction it can be raised here because the schemes must pass through special Parliamentary procedure. Therefore, as the whole of the proceedings of these inquiries are held in public, it may not be necessary, in many cases, to publish voluminous reports, but if there is a demand obviously the Minister could do it. I do not really think that there is any conflict between myself and Members opposite. In the vast majority of cases I feel that the concern in their minds will disappear. It is almost inevitable that events will follow the course they, and we, have in mind in the case of an inquiry of this kind. There may be occasions when it may not be desirable, or necessary, to make it compulsory upon the Minister to publish the report. I hope that with this explanation, hon. Members will agree t o the course which I suggest. I feel I have fully safeguarded the re, quirements of a public inquiry, and I think it is wise to discourage attempts to tie the Minister down to something of this nature.</p>

<p>We have been sitting here tor nearly 20 hours, and I certainly do not propose to detain the House for more than a few minutes. I should like to take the opportunity, once again, of complaining about the great length of time during which the Government keep us up. Quite clearly, they have not given enough time to the consideration of the Lords Amendments and, as a consequence, we find ourselves, at 10 o'clock in the morning, dealing with an Amendment on a subject which this House has never discussed before on any stage of the Bill. That, in itself, is evidence of the fact that our discussions on this Bill have been grossly curtailed. I make no complaint of the way the Minister has treated the House. He has treated us extremely well. I make great complaint of the way in which the Government have treated the House. The Minister has been obliged to fall in with their decision.<br/>
I appreciate all the Minister has said, and I believe that he intends that these</p>

<p>inquiries should be conducted entirely fairly. We had expected that that would happen in the case of inquiries about town and country planning, but it has not worked out in that way. Therefore, we are rather suspicious. In view of the case which we on this side of the House have put forward, we shall have no alternative but to divide the House</p>

<p>Recently, several of my right hon. and hon. Friends and I have been helping to pilot the Agriculture Bill through the House, and we have been faced with the same problem as that with which we are trying to deal here. If there is one thing against which we feel deeply, it is the appointment as an arbitrator, of an officer or servant of the Minister. There should be an independent arbitrator appointed to deal with any questions which have anything to do with the subject concerned, and I wish to add my protest against the tendency for arbitrators to be appointed by the Minister. It is only fair to say that English justice is regarded as the fairest in the world, and I hope that the tendency to which I have referred will not lower the prestige of English justice. I protest against this system by which Ministers of the Crown arbitrate in their own cases.</p>

<p>I would like to say a few words about local inquiries, because they cause a great deal of upset in the countryside. We have recently had one in Devonshire, in connection with the Town and Country Planning Act, to decide how much land the Army should take. The local inhabitants thought that it would take place locally, but it took place some distance away. At the inquiry, the military were allowed to state their case very fully, whereas the local inhabitants had a very Lard time, and the discontent was so great that one of the hon. Members for Plymouth has been goaded into taking action. We should be very careful about these local inquiries.</p>

<p>As the House knows, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary always conscientiously supports his colleagues on the Front Bench, however late the business lasts, but I feel rather guilty at keeping him away from an important engagement, and I want to express my gratitude to him for his consideration. I would not detain him if there were not widespread public interest in this matter of the ban on mid-week dog racing and a feeling that an injustice has been done. I have sufficient confidence in the Home Secretary to know that he would be the first to agree that it is never too late to remove an injustice. It was he himself who said, on 21st March, that this was not a measure which dealt one way or the other with the problem of betting, and he went on to say:
<q>I am very anxious that it should not be thought that greyhound racing has been singled out in any particular way because of the feelings which some people may have in regard to it."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21st March, 1947; Vol. 435, c 810.]</q>
The basis of the action that was taken against this particular sport or recreation, whatever one calls it, was its alleged effect on production. As regards that we must look at the position of other sports, pastimes and recreations. There is speedway racing, and according to an answer given by the Home Secretary on 3rd July, the total average attendance at five speedway racing meetings in London is 140,000 weekly. At Sheffield the attendance is 17,000 on Thursdays at a speedway racing track where previously, when there was mid-week greyhound racing on Friday, the attendance was 5,300. At Wembley, speedway racing attracts 65,000 against 10,000 who attended greyhound racing on the same evening at that track. At Wombwell, in South Yorkshire, there was the opening of a new speedway track, which was attended by Joe Baksi and others, and attracted 10,000 miners and their friends.<br/>
Horse racing goes on during the week and there are proposals that it should be extended We recently read in the Press about a record crowd at Hamilton Park,

Glasgow, for a mid-week meeting. Lord Rosebery, the senior steward of the Jockey Club, suggested at Doncaster that horse race meetings might be considered in midweek if it would assist in encouraging local production. There is proof that that kind of thing would encourage and would not retard local production. We have seen recently in the Press suggestions for midweek football, and in the coming season we are to have mid-week matches for about the first two months of the season and the last two months. In other words, we are to have just as much mid-week football as we ever had. With regard to cricket the Home Secretary said, on 13th March:
<q>A four days' test match at Trent Bridge would probably concentrate into those four days a bigger attendance than would 10 days' racing at Nottingham."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPOLT, 13th March, 1947; Vol. 434, C. 1499.]</q>
With all these things going on, like ice hockey, boxing, tennis and other sports, I suggest there is no logical reason for discrimination against greyhound racing.<br/>
On 21st March the Home Secretary also said:
<q>If I find that the time has come when we need no longer ask those people who can rearrange their sports voluntarily to bring pressure to bear on their supporters to restrict their sports on Saturdays, then I think it would be incumbent upon me to make an order repealing the further administration of this Measure."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 21St March, 1947; Vol. 435, c. 810.]</q>
In view of the facts which I have jest stated, and which are within the knowledge of most hon. Members, I suggest that the time has come for a reconsideration, if not for a complete repeal, of this Act. The greyhound racing people did not oppose the introduction of the present Act on the distinct understanding that all other sports promoters were going to be placed on the same footing, and that their sports were to be restricted to Saturdays only. That has not been carried out, and, therefore, I suggest that the only fair thing to do is to put everybody on the same footing. The greyhound racing people acted very fairly and co-operatively in this matter. In fact, the Home Secretary paid a tribute in this House to their helpful attitude.<br/>
What is the alleged effect on production? The Home Secretary has indicated that certain regional boards of industry


have reported against an order being made for greyhound racing in their districts. I would like to ask my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary how many regional boards have reported in favour of it. I have information, which I think is correct, that at least two have reported in favour of orders being made, and that these orders have not been made for reasons which have been given to hon. Members in correspondence from my right hon. Friend.<br/>
To take a practical example, there is mid-week greyhound racing at Southampton, which, I think, can fairly be described as a busy industrial area. Can my right hon. Friend say whether production at Southampton has been retarded in consequence? I can tell him where production has been retarded. At Brighton and Southend he has allowed greyhound racing in mid-week, and my information is that many people travel from London to those places during the week in order to attend greyhound meetings there, and are thus losing far more time than they would do if they attended meetings in London. I could quote recommendations from Chambers of Commerce and others advocating an easement in regard to these orders. The Government's policy is to provide incentives to help production. I suggest that the allowing of mid-week greyhound racing would be such an incentive. I would like to quote what the Lord President of the Council, when Home Secretary, said in answer to a Question in this House during the war. He said:
<q>In the absence of evidence that afternoon greyhound race meetings have an adverse effect on production, there would appear to be no justification for the imposition of further restrictions on this form of entertainment.</q>
I particularly want the House to note his following words:
<q>I do not think that hon. Members ought to confuse their objection to a particular form of entertainment with their views on absenteeism."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 11th December 1941; Vol. 376, C. 1666&#x2013;7.]</q>
I think it is clear that there has been discrimination in this matter. Its effect has been very serious for some tracks, particularly that of Halifax, where midweek meetings used to be held on a ground that is required for cricket on Saturdays. It means that they cannot

hold meetings on Saturdays, and, therefore, cannot hold any meetings at all.<br/>
Whether hon. Members like it or not, greyhound racing is a widely supported form of entertainment. My case rests on the simple point of why there should be discrimination. In view of what I have said, I ask my right hon. Friend whether he is prepared to use the powers which he has under the Act to repeal it entirely, in view of the breakdown of the arrangements for other sports, or, at any rate, to be more generous in issuing orders for special areas.</p>

<p>I would like to support my distinguished constituent, the hon. Member for Central Hackney (Mr. H. Hynd) in the plea which he has made. I am afraid that I have never been to a greyhound race meeting in my life, and, in fact, I do not know what they do there, except that gullible dogs chase after prefabricated rabbits. I think that the case made out by the hon. Member is one which the Home Secretary must answer. I base my support of it merely on general principles. What reason is there for differentiation against one sport? It may be that a case can be made out for stopping all sports in mid-week. If that is so, then stop them, but when racing, football, cricket, speedways and all the rest are allowed, the Home Secretary has to make out a much better case than he has made out up to now for this ban on greyhound racing, before he can continue the ban. I hope that he will be able to take off the ban altogether. If not, if he is to say that it is interfering with production, he has to show why this particular sport interferes with production when other sports do not.</p>

<p>I do not want to pass any comment one way or the other on the case which my hon. Friend has made. I wish to refer to a point fundamental to Parliamentary democracy and the conduct of this House in connection with the method whereby the propaganda campaign in regard to this matter has been pursued. Hon. Members are familiar with the many ways in which constituents and others seek to represent


to them their views on certain issues, and the right of constituents to do this, and their habit of doing so, is a valuable part of our democratic system. I fear that in this matter that valuable part of our democratic system has been subjected to abuse. When one receives letters from constituents who feel so strongly about a point that they sit down of their own volition and dash off a letter to their Member, one must be gratified and impressed by such action.<br/>
When one gets handwritten letters which all follow the same form&#x2014;which has clearly been sent out&#x2014;one feels that constituents cannot feel quite so strongly when they cannot make up their own letters. But when one receives printed postcards, obviously prepared in advance, and distributed by some organisation interested in the matter, so that all the sender has to do is to write his own name and address on one side, and that of his Member on the other, and for this small expenditure of trouble he has the effrontery&#x2014;I say "effrontery" advisedly&#x2014;to say to his Member "I now call upon you to be present in the House to support this when it is raised," that trade association is treating its supporters as being possessed of that same gullibility as the hon. Gentleman the Member for Hornsey (Mr. Gammans) ascribed to the dogs in greyhound races. Without commenting upon the case of my hon. Friend, I protest at these methods of propaganda being used by interested parties to endeavour to affect the decisions of this House.</p>

<p>I trust that no attention will be paid by the House to such a protest as this being made in regard to the refusal to allow greyhound racing in the middle of the week. When I look round in the City of Liverpool at the recreation that can be given to men there, and the necessity for labour to be fully utilised at this critical time through which we are passing, the question of greyhound racing vanishes completely so far as I am concerned. When it is possible to get out on a Saturday afternoon, I think that is enough. Greyhound racing is a ramp of money-getting and plucking the public. I have only seen one meeting, but I notice

any number, which take the money away from the fools who go there. Recreation is the greatest game of bluff on the boards today. [<i>Interruption.</i>] I would put horse-racing, the whole lot, on the one basis, but I do not intend to advocate that special attention should be giver to one activity to divert workers from their job. If absenteeism is likely to come, it is likely to do so where there is a chance of something for nothing, where bookies are "playing the game," and men are putting their money on something in the hope of making a few pounds. We have had enough of this kind of business. In every corner I see men congregating instead of being at work, and this kind of thing is going on. If they were as anxious to go to work as they are to go to greyhound racing, it would be an admirable thing for the country. I am just about fed up with it, and I hope this House will have nothing whatever to do with it at all. It is the greatest ramp in the country today.</p>

<p>I shall be only a minute or two, as I know the Home Secretary wants to reply. I do not believe the House will heed the hon. Member for the Scotland Division (Mr. Logan), who made no case whatever in the argument he presented in regard to workers who want to bet in the daytime. That is a fact with regard to horse racing, and not only dog racing, and it is carried on by street-corner bookmakers or on the telephone. That has nothing at all to do with dog racing. An important point&#x2014;which was not elaborated by my hon. Friend the Member for Central Hackney (Mr. H. Hynd) because he had to be so brief&#x2014;is that the dog racing referred to is in the evenings. A number of letters which I have received&#x2014;granted, some of the type mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Reading (Mr. Mikardo), which are, nevertheless, genuine&#x2014;refer to the fact that there is no impingement whatever on the hours of work. In the summer, racing ended, I think, at about seven o'clock or half-past seven. I have not been to dog racing for many years. Many of those who go are, to use a colloquialism well known to themselves, "mugs." But that is as may be. If people want to go to see Hollywood films&#x2014;which I do not like very much&#x2014;


while we allow them to be imported, I do not think this House is in a position to discriminate between one sport and another. I want to add my word of support for this plea, and I hope the Home Secretary will accede to the request made by my hon. Friend.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Central Hackney (Mr. H. Hynd) told me that if the Debate which has just concluded went on till 12.30, he did not propose to raise this matter on the Adjournment.

<p>I hope my right hon. Friend does not say that seriously. We have been in consultation throughout the night and during the morning, and, in fact, I offered to withdraw only about an hour ago.</p>

<p>I am bound to say that I had no offer of withdrawal an hour ago. What my hon. Friend said an hour ago was that he was sorry that he was keeping me from a Cabinet meeting. Let us be quite clear as to what discrimination there has had to be against greyhound racing. There is discrimination, because it is the only pastime which was previously regulated by legislation, and if anything was to be done with it, it was necessary to amend that legislation. Under the old legislation the greyhound people had io8 meetings a year. I amended the legislation so that they still have 108 meetings a year. That is better than anyone else who has approached this matter has done on this restriction of mid-week sport. The football people met me very well. They extended their season right up to 14th June so that they could move their league fixtures from mid-week to the weekends. They have asked permission in the coming winter season, during the very limited periods at the beginning and end of the season, to have a limited number of midweek matches, so that they shall not be compelled to run over the season, and thus interfere with other sports in the summer

of 1948. That seemed to me to be a very reasonable compromise, and I have thanked them for the way in which they have endeavoured to meet me.<br/>
With regard to horse-racing, I never thought, as a native of Epsom, that I should be the first person who would arrange for the Derby to be run on a Saturday, but I saw the stewards of the Jockey Club and the members of the National Hunt Committee, and they agreed to shift the main racing fixtures from the middle of the week to the end of the week. We had the Grand National, the Chester Cup, the Manchester Cup, the Derby&#x2014;and we shall have the St. Leger&#x2014;on a Saturday. I was astonished when I got the figures for the mid-week attendances at the Chester Cup. One hundred and four thousand people attended the Chester Cup in 1946 in the middle of the week. I was at once met by the stewards of the Jockey Club and the members of the National Hunt Committee with every endeavour to meet the situation that I have described.<br/>
My hon. Friend asked me about the reports which I have received from the regional boards. On this question of greyhound racing, the Scottish Regional Board asked that there should be no exceptions to the rule that greyhound racing must be confined to Saturdays. The East and West Ridings said the same thing. The South-West Region made a general objection, and South Wales also made a general objection, adding, "No exceptions in colliery areas." When I have suggestions like that from the main industrial areas of the country, I do not think that I can afford to neglect them.<br/>
One of the reasons this legislation was passed, and why an endeavour has been made to secure elimination of mid-week sports generally, is the desire of the Government, which we are just managing to bring to a satisfactory position with regard to public opinion, to have staggered shifts during the week. My right hon. Friend the Minister of Labour came to the House only a day or two ago and announced the very severe action that the Government are going to take to ensure that that arrangement of industry shall be brought about. There is no doubt that greyhound racing in the evenings is a very considerable attraction to a large number of people who are engaged in productive industry. I was very careful when


I introduced the Measure to the House to say that I was not singling out miners for absenteeism. The only thing about the mining industry is that a careful check on absenteeism has been kept for some years and we know weekly the number of absentees from the mines. We have no similar statistics with regard to any other industry in the country, but the reports I have given from the various regional boards will indicate to the House the view that they take of the impact of this particular form of recreation on production.</p>

<p>Will the Home Secretary say a word on this point? Where he has stopped greyhound racing in mid-week, and the ground is now being used by some other organisation for speedway racing, in what way is he encouraging production when the resulting crowd is bigger?</p>

<p>I will deal with speedways in a moment. I have given the House the reports from the various production councils, and the Government feel that the need for production and for the staggering of shifts is greater now than was the case when this legislation was passed. Other sports have been mentioned, speedway racing in particular. My hon. Friend the Member for Central Hackney came to me the other day with a deputation of greyhound racing people so that he should hear my case before he presented his views to the House. The question of speedway racing was mentioned by one member of that deputation, and I said that the report made to me was that the speedway racing crowd was a very different one from the crowd that goes to the other sports which have been mentioned, and is in fact&#x2014;[<i>Interruption.</i>] Really, I listened quite attentively to hon. Members who have spoken and gave them as much time as I could, limiting my time so that they should have the fullest opportunity of putting their point of view. The speedway racing crowd is, in the main, a crowd of adolescents and of family parties, and when I said that to the deputation from the National Greyhound Racing Society who came to see me, accompanied by my hon. Friend and two other colleagues, they agreed. I do not say that the hon. Members agreed, but the members of the National Greyhound Racing Society said that it was so. They said the same criticism could not be applied to that crowd

from the point of view from which I have approached this matter as could be applied to the crowd that goes to greyhound racing. I also have the evidence of the police who have the job of watching the assembly and the dispersal of these various crowds. Their report with regard to speedway racing and greyhound racing is the same as that which I put before the deputation, and which I understood was accepted.</p>

<p>I am not clear whether the right hon. Gentleman, when dealing with this distinction between crowds, is referring to the case I put about Wembley, where mid-week there is greyhound racing and then it is tuned over to a speedway. Does the right hon. Gentleman say that the crowd is different?</p>

<p>Yes, Wembley is the place with which I am most concerned. I sent a member of my staff to see that crowd as recently as that very wet Wednesday evening we had about a fortnight or a week ago. The report I had was that on that evening there was a very large and excited crowd, mainly of young people. The distinction between the excitement of speedway racing and the excitement of greyhound racing is that, as far as we can discover, there is no betting on speedway racing.</p>

<p>No, I am not basing my case on betting, but it would not be fair of me to give other than the full information which I obtained. Let us he quite clear. Greyhound racing can take place every night in the week if there is no betting. If people want to see dog racing bat do not want to bet, they can have greyhound racing every night in the week. The dog race betting Act deals with that matter. It is entirely the question of betting which has brought it within the purview of legislation at all. I am assured by people who frequent greyhound racing tracks that hardly anybody goes there except to bet. The people who go 10 Epsom Downs to see the Derby, who do not bet but have a little family party on the Downs&#x2014;that type of person is entirely absent from greyhound racing. That does not affect me in this matter, but it ought to be stated, and stated publicly. I do, not desire to prevent any sport from


taking place all the while that it does not interfere with production and does not stand in the way of getting the necessary staggering of shifts, so that production can be stepped up as much as possible. Where I get a report from a production council and learn, after consultation with my colleagues who are engaged in the task of supervising production, that production will not be interfered with by the opening

of a dog racing track for racing mid-week, I issue a permit for it.</p>
