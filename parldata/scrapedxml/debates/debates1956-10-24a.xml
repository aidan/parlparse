By this petition, your petitioners,
<q>pray and beseech that the Copyright Bill, 1955, as reprinted on 31st July, 1956, be amended by the deletion from Clause 8 of the record manufacturers' licence-of-right and by the simplification of the procedure for the revision of the rate of royalty prescribed in subsection (3).</q>
<q>Secondly, that Clause 6 (7) be withdrawn as being inequitable in itself and in its consequences.</q>
And finally,
<q>that as the foundation and the fortress of copyright are to establish and secure composers and authors against abuse and exploitation by vested interests &#x2026; your petitioners look with faith and hope to Parliament itself for protection of liberties hardly won and vigilantly cherished.</q>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs by what authority a spokesman of the British Embassy in Damascus told newspaper correspondents in July, 1956, that the Foreign Office has empowered him to deny information to the effect that the Western Powers would start a campaign against the Arab States with a view to combating the Arab economic boycott against Israel.</p>

<p>In July certain Syrian newspapers reported allegations of a Western campaign to paralyse the Arab boycott of Israel and of the opening in London of an Israeli office which was supported by Foreign Office officials.<br/>

<p>Is the hon. Gentleman aware that the terms in which the


official issued the denial were regarded by the Arab peoples as being in condonation of the attitude of the Arab countries towards Israel and were in fact encouraging them in their boycott?

<p>I cannot accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but I shall, of course, look at the point.

<p>I stated on 24th July that we were working on possible ways in which a limitation of nuclear tests might be achieved. This study of complex technical questions is continuing.<br/>
While Her Majesty's Government would prefer to treat this subject in the context of a disarmament convention, they remain ready to discuss it separately if that meets with the approval of the other Powers concerned and appears to offer better prospects of agreement.</p>

<p>While realising that the limitation of these tests may be a step in the right direction, may I ask the Foreign Secretary if he would give an assurance that the Government would participate with the Governments of the United States and the Soviet Union in any agreement which might be reached on the total ban of hydrogen tests even though a comprehensive disarmament agreement has not been achieved?</p>

<p>asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs why, at the Conference of Plenipotentiaries held at Geneva to draw up a Supplementary Convention on Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices similar to Slavery, the United Kingdom delegate eventually voted for a compromise clause preventing the search of ships suspected of carrying slaves.</p>

<p>A copy of the Supplementary Convention, which has been adopted by 33 members of the Conference, was published as a White Paper yesterday (Cmd. 9870). While the Convention is not in every respect in the form we should have desired, Her Majesty's Government regard it as generally satisfactory.

<p>Is it not a fact that the British delegate did withdraw a clause or an article which insisted upon the possibility of searching ships which had slaves in them, and is it not a fact that the Convention as it now stands without that article is worse than the Convention of 1926? Should we not expose those peoples who are still dealing in slaves and who are refusing any investigation?</p>

<p>No, certain changes were made, of course, when the Convention was negotiated, but Article 3 does not, in our view, affect the existing rights of the Government, as a party to the Brussels Pact of 1890, to take measures for the prevention of the slave trade, including visit and search on the high seas.</p>

The major disorders were all suppressed by midnight on 11th October. There were minor incidents the next day&#x2014;chiefly cases of looting&#x2014;and on 13th October administrative services were resumed in the affected area.

<p>Yes, Sir. The Acting Governor of Northern Rhodesia proclaimed a State of Emergency in the Western Province, which includes the Copperbelt, because he was satisfied that this action was necessary to secure the peace, and prevent outbreaks of violence, loss of life and damage to property.<br/>
The threatening situation with which he was faced had its origins in a dispute involving the African Mineworkers' Trade Union and the mining companies

over the right of the mines African Staff Association to represent Africans in supervisory and staff grades. The dispute, which had resulted in a planned series of strikes, had engendered bitter feelings between the two groups of workers, and there had been violence and intimidation in the miners' compounds.<br/>
The announcement on 11th August that a Commission would be appointed to inquire into the causes of unrest in the Copperbelt did not effectively relieve the tension. The leaders of the mine-workers announced that they would not give evidence to the Commission. They were prepared neither for conciliation nor for negotiated settlement, and were evidently determined to keep the unrest alive.<br/>
Events came to a head when the Union called on the men at all the mines to present themselves for work without protective leggings or check discs, safety precautions without which it was known the management could not let the men go underground. By 11th September the atmosphere was such that a small incident among the crowds of miners congregating daily at the shaft heads would have created the risk of major riots and general violence. Great alarm was felt by all law-abiding persons throughout the area.<br/>
I fully support the action of the Acting Governor, which was taken neither before it was necessary nor too late to prevent serious and long lasting disorders. No life has been lost. The Acting Governor and many officers in the Service, and others, who have supported him deserve the gratitude of Northern Rhodesia and of this House.</p>

<p>May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether, in a situation in which the African Mineworkers' Union is now threatened with complete destruction, he will take action, in view of the fact that the Union has contributed so largely to the organisation of the African workers, to the lifting of their standards, to the opening of doors by which they can obtain higher posts in that industry, and whether he will exert his influence for immediate steps so that there may be a restoration of this organisation?</p>

<p>I could not accept what the hon. Gentleman has said. Mr. Katilungu, the African General President of the Union, has declared his opposition


to the unconstitutional methods of the leaders who have been detained, and he has successfully made efforts to get the men to go back to work. With regard to the latter part of the Question, the justification, so-called, of the troubles that have arisen was African advancement, and I am in favour of African advancement in giving to Africans in the Copperbelt opportunities to fill jobs that have hitherto been reserved for Europeans.</p>

<p>I am afraid, Mr. Speaker, that this is another long Answer.<br/>
I had hoped that development of the present liaison officer system in Mauritius into a Ministerial system could be carried through this autumn when the three-year tenure of office of existing Unofficial Members of Executive Council came to an end. A Ministerial system would give Unofficial Members of Executive Council an opportunity of demonstrating their ability to co-operate with their fellow Mauritians in shouldering the greater responsibilities which are now before them and would, at the same time, provide Mauritius with the administrative machinery necessary if the territory is to make a success of internal self-government, a most important practical consideration.<br/>
The Mauritius Labour Party, however, refused to take part in the election of new members of Executive Council on 25th September, and informed the Governor that they were not prepared to co-operate in the introduction of a Ministerial system on the basis proposed. The Governor has informed me of the views expressed by the leaders of the Labour Party and has communicated my views to them, but I have not yet received a report on the outcome of these talks.</p>

<p>I beg to move,
<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend subsection (7) of section fifty-three of the Gas Act, 1948, in order to permit discrimination in treatment of certain classes of persons designated from time to time by the Minister of Fuel and Power.</q>
The House may wonder why, at this late stage in the Session, I am seeking permission to introduce this small Bill under the Ten Minutes Rule. Quite apart from what I consider to be the merits of the Bill, this seemed to me the only possible way of drawing the attention of Parliament to a rather unprecedented action by the Northern Gas Board. The rules of the House make it impossible to question a Minister on the Board's action and I have, therefore, been forced to produce a Bill in order to question the position. In passing, I must say that unless there is a means of associating Parliament with the nationalised industries, it is only right to introduce a Bill of this kind to protect consumer interests ; and I can foresee a vista of Bills.<br/>
I want to give the House the background for my reasons for seeking to introduce the Bill. Earlier this year the Northern Gas Board, in a commendable search for economy, decided to impose a minimum charge, the minimum charge being related to the consumer having used five therms of gas per quarter. The Gas Consultative Council, which was made aware of this decision, decided to draw the attention of the Northern Gas Board to the fact that the Board's decision would impose hardship on old-age pensioners and people living on small fixed incomes who might not in the course of their ordinary household commitments use the appropriate number of therms.<br/>
Before any action could be taken and before the matter could be discussed by the Northern Gas Board with the Gas Consultative Council, the Minister of Fuel and Power informed the Board that under Section 53 (7) of the Gas Act, 1948, it would not be possible for the Board to take any steps to relieve old-age pensioners of the general charge. The Board decided, therefore, to proceed with the adoption of the minimum charge.<br/>
This has aroused tremendous opposition throughout the North of England from local authorities, etc. For instance, the chairman of the local welfare committee of the County Borough of Tynemouth, my local authority, expressed himself in very vehement terms against the Board's decision. The Press, Members of Parliament and the general public felt that it was an imposition on old-age pensioners and those living on small fixed incomes to ask them to pay for gas which they had not consumed.<br/>
We are always told that gas boards have complete autonomy in decisions about charges, but this difficulty arose from the intervention by the Ministry, that the Board could not take steps to cushion old-age pensioners from the imposition of the charge. When that position was made known, a large number of people who did not consume five therms of gas per quarter failed to pay their bills and a large number of other persons affected decided to ask the Board to remove their gas equipment.<br/>
That was done, although I must say that the Board took no arbitrary action when the bills were not paid. The matter was then taken to the area gas consumers' council, which also vehemently opposed the decision of the Board. After one or two meetings the Northern Gas Board decided to reduce the amount of the minimum charge from five to three therms and the matter is to be even further reconsidered.<br/>
That is the point which has now been reached. I have no means of knowing what is happening with gas boards in other areas, but if it is intended to seek economies&#x2014;and everybody supports that&#x2014;it is important that there should be power somewhere to ensure that the people on whom the economies are exercised are not those in the lowest income groups. After studying it, I came to the conclusion that there was a weakness in the Gas Act, 1948. The purpose of my Bill is to remedy that weakness.<br/>
That is the reason why the Northern Gas Board can take no action to protect the old-age pensioners and, as I say, the public in the North of England are seriously perturbed that we should ask old-age pensioners and people living on small fixed incomes to pay for gas which they have not consumed. I am sure that that


must seem to the House a very peculiar way of helping those old people to economise.<br/>
I came to the conclusion that the only remedy was to seek to amend the Gas Act to give power to the Minister, if he approved of any scheme put up by a gas board, to allow that board to eliminate from the operation of its charges any body of people, if they so desired, and particularly of course on the recommendation of the area consumers' councils. In my opinion, if we are to have any protection given to the public, it is important that recommendations made by the consumers' council in the various areas should be accepted and acted on by the industry concerned. Otherwise, there is no sense in having that machinery in operation at all.<br/>
I have examined the Gas Act, 1948, very closely to find how the procedure which I have outlined may be carried out. I found that Section 53 (7) reads as follows:
<q>An Area Board, in fixing tariffs and making agreements under this section, shall not show undue preference to any person or class of persons and shall not exercise any undue discrimination against any person or class of persons.</q>
In my Bill I seek to add the words:
<q>Except with the authority of the Minister.</q>
That, of course, would make it very much easier for the area gas boards to deal with their tariff problems; because it is fair to point out that so far as the boards are concerned there are a large number of industrial establishments who do not use the minimum number of therms and which could quite well help to pay the administrative charges incurred in the collection of accounts and the examination of meters. That would be a help to the general economical running of the gas industry.<br/>
Because I realise that this is perhaps rather a revolutionary proposal I sought to find whether, since the nationalisation Acts were put into operation, this House had agreed to any differentiation in the treatment of certain classes of persons under any of the nationalisation Acts. I felt that that would be an important point in making my case to the House this afternoon for permission to introduce this Bill.<br/>
I found that in 1955 the hon. Member for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Central (Mr. Short) was able to pass through this House, and, finally, to place on the Statute Book after the Royal Assent had been given, a Bill to enable local authorities&#x2014;who are very much in the same position as area boards&#x2014;to allow certain classes of persons to travel at reduced rates on municipal transport.<br/>
I found, therefore, that a precedent had been created in this House and so I do not find myself in any difficulty in suggesting that this Bill, which will protect old-age pensioners and, no doubt, the area gas boards, should be given permission to go through the normal machinery relevant to the introduction of a Bill under the Ten Minutes Rule.<br/>
In commending the Bill and asking permission to introduce it I wish to say, finally, that, of course, all Ministers of the Crown keep on saying how difficult it is to find ways and means to help those living on small fixed incomes. I feel that not only is this a practical Bill, in the sense that it will help the gas industry and old-age pensioners, but, also, that it is a way of helping those whom the Government themselves find it so very difficult to assist. It may well be that if this Bill is allowed to proceed and reaches the Statute Book, we shall be able, by putting our heads together and considering the matter wisely and without heat, to arrive at a further way of helping those whom the Government and hon. Members of this House would wish to help.<br/>
In passing, I would add that old-age pensioners already have to pay more for their coal delivered in bags than those who buy by the ton. I think that this is a very humane and sound Bill and I ask the permission of the House to introduce it today.</p>

<p>These Amendments are similar to an Amendment which I moved in Committee, except that that Amendment went a good deal further. It was supported on all sides of the Committee and I agreed to withdraw it with some reluctance only because of an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade. The assurance was rather more than the conventional promise that the Government would look into the matter. The Parliamentary Secretary said:
<q>I am hopeful of being able to evolve a suitable Amendment which will help the purpose which hon. Members have in mind and, at the same time, safeguard the other consideration which I think the Committee feels also to be of some importance."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT. <i>Standing Committee B,</i> 19th June. 1956 ; c. 41.]</q>
I was rather surprised and somewhat disappointed to find nothing in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary on the Notice Paper for this stage of the Bill to deal with this point.<br/>
I do not want to go at any length over the arguments I used in the Committee and I will summarise as briefly as I can what I then said. The first point is that few people outside the legal profession appreciate that a letter, even a business letter, is in law a literary work and that, as the law stands, copyright in a letter subsists indefinitely so long as that letter remains unpublished. Few

people appreciate that the copyright belongs to the person who wrote the letter and not to the person who owns and has physical possession of it.<br/>
These facts make matters extremely difficult for people who try to write biographies. It becomes almost impossible for them to do what they would wish to do and to observe the letter of the law. If they wish to reproduce letters written by or to the subject of their biographies they have to trace not only the owners of the letters, which is usually easy enough, but the heirs and assigns of the writers, which is usually difficult and often impossible.<br/>
A biographer is, therefore, faced with two alternatives. One is to comply with the law and so to produce a less interesting and attractive book than he might otherwise do, and the other is to do what he wants to do and to take a chance with the law. I think I am right in saying that, normally, a biographer does the latter and takes a chance, if he knows what the law is. Usually, he is quite ignorant of the provisions of the law, and goes to the owners of the letters and asks for permission to reproduce them. That permission is almost always generously given by the owners, who believe that they are in a position to give that permission. This law is completely misunderstood over a wide field by people most closely affected by it; it is a law which is broken every day of the week with impunity without any injury being done to anybody. That alone is a strong argument for amending the law.<br/>
I go further and say that there is very little logic behind the law as it stands. The purpose of copyright is to create and to protect a property right in a work of art or a literary work. People do not normally write letters to sell in the way that they write books, paint pictures or compose symphonies. By removing letters from the provisions of copyright we would deprive hardly anybody of a property right. My Amendment does not go nearly as far as that, because I am merely seeking to put a term to copyright in unpublished letters. My suggestion is that copyright should subsist for fifty years after the death of the writer of the letter. or for a hundred years after the writing of the letter, whichever is later.<br/>
In Committee, only one argument against my proposal was produced by the Parliamentary Secretary. It was that if we


freed letters from copyright fifty years after the death of the writers there was a serious risk of offending the susceptibilities of relatives of the writers or of third parties who might be mentioned in the letters. I can only repeat what I said then, that I do not think the susceptibilities of the third parties are a proper subject of copyright and that the law of copyright ought not to concern itself with such matters. In that view I was supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Edge Hill (Mr. A. J. Irvine) and other members of the Committee.<br/>
Nevertheless, I am prepared to accept the argument. I think the President of the Board of Trade will agree that I have gone as far as I can to meet it in the change I have made in the Amendments on the Paper. I have put in the second period of a hundred years from the writing of the letter. Except in the case of persons of extreme longevity, that should obviate the risk of any susceptibilities of living persons being touched when letters go out of copyright. The other advantage of the two alternative periods is that they bring the Amendments into line with Clause 7 (6), which does much the same with unpublished literary works in library and public archives.<br/>
By preserving the bare principle of the Amendment I moved in Committee I have done my very best to meet the objections that have been brought forward. I hope that on this occasion the Government, although they did not see fit to put their own Amendment on the Paper, will have no difficulty in supporting my Amendments.</p>

<p>I must declare a small interest in these Amendments. I have already declared it when the Bill was in Committee. It is the interest of a person who, from time to time, produces biographies about the famous and not so famous figures of the past. Like the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson), I was disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary had been unable to evolve a Government Amendment to satisfy the views which had been put forward by the hon. Member and which were held by those who supported him in Committee.<br/>
4.0 p.m.<br/>
I am sure my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Secretary sympathises with this Amendment, even though he has not been able to put forward an Amendment in the name of either the President of the Board of Trade or himself, because, if I may say so with respect, he is a distinguished biographer. I am sure the House will share with me regret that his present arduous duties prevent him from continuing to produce the biographies which have delighted us in the past.<br/>
The position of the biographer and research worker is difficult in the sense in which the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North indicated. The fact that copyright continues indefinitely in an unpublished letter as time goes on makes the position difficult, particularly where the letters, under the custom which is increasing today, have been deposited in libraries and other public institutions. The position is not satisfactory because the research worker may take a chance and the law is then broken. He may take a chance and decide to publish a letter after having failed to trace the owner of the copyright, or he may decide that the risk is too great and leave out of his book what might be quite an interesting document.<br/>
On the question of susceptibilities of third parties, there is something to be said for the fact that it is undesirable to give pain to living persons, but of course, the copyright extends only to the words in the letter. It does not extend to the information contained in the letter. Anyone into whose possession the letter may have come is quite at liberty to make use of the information it contains, provided that in his biography he does not embody the actual words which have been used by the writer of the letter.<br/>
In the evidence which was given before the Board of Trade committee which considered the whole question of copyright, such learned and important institutions as the British Museum, the Libraries' Association and the Bodleian Library at Oxford all expressed the view that there should be some limitation set upon the term of copyright in unpublished writing. It seems to me that the proposal put forward by the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North is a reasonable one. It is not so drastic as the proposal he put forward


in Committee. I hope it will commend itself to my hon. and learned Friend and to the House.</p>

<p>I hope very much indeed that the Government will accept this Amendment. I, too, was disappointed that after his kind words in Committee&#x2014;which were very helpful&#x2014;the Parliamentary Secretary did not put forward an Amendment in his name or the name of his right hon. Friend. I suppose that that was through inadvertence or pressure of work.<br/>
There can be very little objection to this proposal. I can see that in its original form there was a difficulty, but now that a hundred years is included as the shortest period between the writing of the letter and the publication thereof, I cannot see how susceptibilities are going to be affected to any degree which could be balanced in the scales against the value of an historical record. There is surely an obligation towards historic truth as well as towards susceptibilities of persons who could not have been living at the time when the letter was written. The argument on that side seems very slight.<br/>
I am in the position, with my brother, of being the owner of copyright in certain letters. Our great difficulty is that some of those letters have been destroyed without the consent of the copyright owner, because they have been in other hands. Letters written by my father to the late Marquess of Lothian have been destroyed. One is put into great difficulty over this whole matter of letters because of divided interests. The point with which we are dealing, which is strictly that of copyright, is, I should have thought, very adequately met by the Amendment.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) said, this Amendment would bring the Bill into line with provisions made, for which we are very grateful, about letters deposited in libraries and archives. This would bring into a similar position letters which, possibly quite fortuitously, remain in private hands. I cannot see that we would be doing injury to anybody by agreeing to this Amendment. On the contrary, I think that we should be taking a step towards the establishment of truth in historic writing. I hope that the Amendment will be accepted.</p>

<p>This Amendment has been moved moderately and attractively by the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson), as a similar Amendment was moved in Committee. It has been supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Hyde) and the hon. Lady the Member for Flint, East (Mrs. White). The common theme in their speeches was that of disappointment that there is no Government Amendment on the Notice Paper to meet this point. I certainly do not deviate from that common theme, as I share the disappointment that it has not been possible to put down an Amendment on behalf of the Government to meet this position.<br/>
This is a difficult problem and I regret that it has been found to be an intractable problem in seeking to achieve the balance which, as I indicated in Committee, is the governing consideration in this Bill. It is, of course, true, as the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North said, that I gave a very sympathetic undertaking to do what I could in this matter. That I have done, although, unhappily, unsuccessfully, but not from any lack of good will. As I said then, I was attracted to the idea.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, North has been kind enough to refer to my excursions into the biographical field&#x2014;necessarily less distinguished than his own&#x2014;which I think would acquit me of any prejudice against the subject matter of this Amendment. I am the more disappointed because the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North has shown good will by modifying the effect of his previous Amendment so as to lengthen the period by making it the later of two dates&#x2014;fifty years from the death of the author, or a hundred years from the date of the writing of the letter.<br/>
On the issue of pain and susceptibility to third parties and descendants, I do not think that I can add more to what was said at an earlier stage, except that, in my view, although the extension of the period does, of course, limit the danger, it does not altogether remove it.<br/>
I should like to refer to one or two other very practical difficulties which have occurred to us in the course of our sympathetic examination of this problem in the light of the undertaking I gave. In the first place, there are, of course, very


material difficulties of definition. For example, this Amendment deals with letters. Is a memorandum written by one person to another a letter for these purposes or not? I do not know. Again, is something enclosed in a letter part of that letter? Again, I do not know.<br/>
Take the case of someone who encloses the manuscript of a short play. Is that covered by the terms of this Amendment or not? Perhaps a better case would be if someone wrote to a friend and, within the text of the letter, embodied a poem, maybe a sonnet of 14 lines. That, clearly, would come within the definition of a letter within this Amendment, but I should think that, equally clearly, it could be regarded as a work in which copyright ought to exist.<br/>
In addition to these practical difficulties of definition, there is another consideration which is important and which has not been mentioned today, although I believe that it was in the mind of the hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher) when we previously discussed the matter It is the position of publishers. I think the House will agree that it is in the public interest that publishers should be able to arrange for appropriate publication of hitherto unpublished copyright material free from the risk that competitors could, under the provisions of an Amendment such as this, immediately copy the results of their work, publish cheap editions and thereby prevent them from getting the reasonable rewards of their labours.<br/>
Let me take a practical example to illustrate that. Let us take the example, to which reference was made in the earlier stage, of the Boswell Papers and the publications ensuing therefrom. Take the case of Boswell's London Journal. Had that been written not in the form of a journal but in the form, for example, of letters to Boswell's Edinburgh friends, Johnston and Temple, as it very well might have been, under the Amendment there would have been no copyright in those letters at the time when they were published, and the admirable edition which has given pleasure to so many might very well not have seen the light of day at all, because without that measure of protection it would not have been a commercial proposition.<br/>
Perhaps an even stronger example from the same field, which was not mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, was the case of the publication known as "Boswell in Holland." The House may record that the journal for Boswell's stay in Holland in the years 1763 to 1764 was lost. He-entrusted it to an army officer to take back to England, but it was never seen again. Therefore, the actual publication, instead of incorporating the missing journal, is made up of a most ingenious amalgamation of Boswell's daily memoranda, written as exhortations to himself for his conduct the following day, with all the letters which have been discovered.<br/>
Perhaps I might refer to what is said in the introduction to that admirable work by Professor Pottle:
<q>The volume that follows is for the greater part a substitute for the lost journal, made by fitting together in chronological sequence selections from these miscellaneous papers. As a sequel the reader is then given the entire correspondence between Boswell and the most remarkable person he met in Holland: Isabella van Tuyll. &#x2026; This correspondence, which began just as he was leaving Holland and continued intermittently for the next four years, may safely be called one of the oddest series of love letters ever written.</q>
On that point, it is quite impossible, the interweaving of the letters with the other material being such, to have two different laws of copyright in regard to them. The House must face the position that all such works as that would be in jeopardy from the point of view of commercial publication in the admirable form that they have, in fact, taken if there was no copyright protection. I cannot resist the conclusion that the practical effects of the Amendment might be to introduce confusion detrimental to publication of works of literary and historic interest.<br/>
We have, I think the House will acknowledge, done our best in the Bill to help this problem within the limits of what we conceive to be practicable. People in possession of ancient letters of interest can, if they think the contents unobjectionable and proper to be made public without giving offence, deposit them in public archives, and, in those circumstances, Clause 7, subsections (6) to (9), of the Bill would apply and those letters could be suitably copied and published.<br/>
4.15 p.m.<br/>
The hon. Lady the Member for Flint, East referred to the destruction of certain


letters written by her eminent father. I would ask her, however, to take account of the point that one would run the risk of much greater destruction of letters if one amended the law so as to withdraw the copyright protection altogether from them after a given period. We should, in fact, have less chance&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Why?"] It is for the obvious reason that if people think that letters, if preserved, will fall into the public domain willy-nilly after a certain specified period, they will in many cases take the advice that was given by Admiral Fisher in all his letters, and burn them on receipt.</p>

<p>The hon. Lady must bear in mind the fact that it is not the same to publish a paraphrase as to publish the document. A cynical reading public will never take the same account of an admitted paraphrase as it will of an authenticated original.</p>

<p>Does not the hon. and learned Gentleman appreciate that the main protection for non-publication of letters lies in the physical ownership of them? If the person who has physical possession of them does not let anybody else see them, they will not be published. That situation is not changed in any way by the Amendment. If somebody has a mind to destroy letters because he thinks they will be going to the public domain, equally he does not know into what hands they will get with the copyright law as it is at the moment, and he has no protection against their publication in the future even with the existing copyright law.</p>

<p>It is a matter of degree. Such a person is under some temptation to destroy them as it is. He would be under a greater temptation to destroy them in the circumstances of the Amendment.<br/>
Where there is a difficult and intracttable problem such as this in which there is such a pull of interest and sentiment in both directions, I think we must consider as our guiding light, the general

principle in the matter of copyright, which is, after all, that it is the copyright owner who should always have the right to decide if and at what time any work should be published. Many of the letters which are the subject-matter of the Amendment are documents which are, of their very nature, probably the least likely to have been intended by the author for publication.<br/>
In view of the very many and practical difficulties involved, it is not possible to recommend the House to deviate from that general principle and accept the Amendment. I say that with great and genuine regret&#x2014;I hope the hon. Member for St. Pancras, North will believe me&#x2014;because I started from a position of real sympathy with what he sought to do, and I tried very hard to ascertain whether it was possible to overcome the difficulties to which I have referred.</p>

<p>I hope that the House will forgive me for a few moments if I break into this magic circle of biographers and copyright owners to add my expression of disappointment to the expressions which have been voiced from both sides of the House.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary said he hoped we would acquit him of prejudice because he himself was a biographer. We gladly acquit him of prejudice. On the other hand, it may be that his own Ministerial future is so rosy that he is not likely to have very much time for biography writing in the future, in which case we shall all congratulate him; but, at the same time, it might make him a little less sensitive to the claims of biographers than would otherwise be the case.<br/>
We discussed the matter in Standing Committee for a considerable time. I should have thought that the change made by my hon. Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North (Mr. K. Robinson) in the present Amendment really went as far as one ought to go. My hon. Friend now proposes that copyright shall last for fifty years after the death of the writer or a hundred years after the end of the year in which the letter was written. That is a very considerable concession which my hon. Friend has made in the meantime, and I would have thought that the Parliamentary Secretary would have been able to accept it.<br/>
When we discussed this matter in Committee we were all impressed by the point&#x2014;and this was the main point that the Parliamentary Secretary made at that time&#x2014;that the publication of letters at an earlier date might cause a great deal of embarrassment and possibly pain to the relatives of the person who had written the letters or even the person who had received them. That is perhaps the main objection that still exists, but surely the greater part of that objection was removed by what the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Hyde) said a few minutes ago, namely, that anybody is entitled, if he has access to those letters, to make use of the information that is contained in them but is precluded from publishing them in the form in which they were written.<br/>
I do not think we ought to exaggerate the difficulties or the embarrassments which would be caused if this Amendment were accepted, as I hope it will be. After all, we are trying in this Bill to protect the rights of the public. The public has the right of access to knowledge of these documents, and I think that biographers have the right of access to letters and other documents of this kind.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary now tells us about the difficulties of definition. He is not sure whether a memorandum constitutes a letter or whether an enclosure does. He raised the point about cheap editions, which was touched on in Committee, but I think the Parliamentary Secretary has failed in his duty to the House, and, indeed, in the undertaking that he gave to the Standing Committee.</p>

Friend the Member for St. Pancras, North has reminded us of the words of the Parliamentary Secretary on that occasion, and I would have thought that it was not beyond the ingenuity of the Board of Trade and of Parliamentary draftsmen in the intervening four months to have been able to find a form of words which would have removed the objections which are apparent today in the Parliamentary Secretary's mind.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir; I think that my hon. Friend accepts that view.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary will remember that when this Bill was going through a previous stage, there was upon the Notice Paper an Amendment in my name which tended in this direction, and I was, owing to circumstances over which I had absolutely no control whatever, unable to move it. It was moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher) with great lucidity, if I may say so, although I will not comment on the results of his moving it.

Certainly, we did have a considerable discussion upstairs on the Amendment as it was then drafted.<br/>
I remember reading the OFFICIAL REPORT and finding therein that the hon. Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Bishop) made a contribution to that discussion. Although he opened with those rather cold words, "Although we have great sympathy with journalists, nevertheless I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will not go too far", he did make a very important contribution to the discussion in that he pointed out that, to take <i>The Times</i> newspaper, for example, the number of publications which <i>The Times</i> Printing and Publishing Company issued were of such a nature that the Amendment in its original form would result in producing a really unwieldy and unworkable organisation.<br/>
We were extremely reasonable about this, as we have been all the way through the progress of this Bill, and we decided that a revised Amendment should be introduced which accepts the argument of the hon. Member for Harrow, Central and, I think, goes far to allay the fears of the Parliamentary Secretary, in that we are now recognising the trustification and


wide ramifications and interests of the newspaper business of this country. We now say that the copyright in work produced by a staff writer, a staff journalist, shall be vested in the proprietor to publish in any other paper, periodical or journal owned or controlled by that proprietor.<br/>
To take the Kemsley Group as an example, that means to say that if a staff journalist were writing for one paper within the chain, the Kemsley management would be quite entitled to reprint that writer's articles in any other paper within the chain. As I have said, this meets to a very considerable extent the opposition which sprang from depth of the experience of the hon. Member for Harrow, Central and the fears of the Parliamentary Secretary.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary had, I believe, another fear. The grounds of that fear also have now been dispelled. He probably had a feeling that the Government was in a rather dangerous position and he could not afford to antagonise the few remaining newspapers in the country loyal to the Government and supporting it. That ground has now been cut from under his feet. The Beaverbrook Press has made it quite clear, if I may use a naval simile, that it is going to part brass rags with the Prime Minister over the question of a European free market ; so the Parliamentary Secretary need not fear he will be attacked on this particular score, for the big Beaverbrook guns are now to be trained on&#x2014;I hope he will not think I say this in any derogatory sense&#x2014;a bigger target than even the Parliamentary Secretary himself presents.<br/>
Journalists are the men who produce the newspapers of this country. Let us not have in this House any desire for revenge against those gentlemen. The fact that all of us bear on our backs the scars of the lashes inflicted by newspapermen of all political parties is no reason why we should deny them elementary justice, and elementary justice for newspapermen is what I am asking for.<br/>
Journalists are united in asking that this Amendment should be accepted by the Government. They know only too well what will be the effect of the Bill going through unamended in its present form. For a reason which is obscure,

because he has never yet made it clear, the Parliamentary Secretary has distinguished between what he calls the commission journalist, known in Fleet Street, I think, more familiarly as the free-lance journalist, and the staff journalist. My hon. Friend the Member for Salford, East (Mr. Allaun), in Committee, gave a very lucid explanation of the advantages which are enjoyed by both, the free-lance journalist enjoying freedom of movement and action, the staff journalist enjoying a regular salary and a reasonable degree of security.<br/>
These things cannot be weighed in the balance and a result produced to show that there should now be a discrimination against one section of newspapermen in favour of the other. But this is exactly what the Government have done. The Government have said they will now make the position of the free-lance journalist much better than it ever has been before, but they will not extend the same measure of protection to the ordinary staff man who is employed by a newspaper, periodical or journal.<br/>
The Government recognise that both have property rights in their work. In fact, only a little while ago, we heard the Parliamentary Secretary say that this Bill has been based on the principle that the copyright owner should have the right to say where and how his work should be published. Here, however, a section of copyright owners is being denied this particular protection.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary will answer that the staff man will have a great deal of additional privilege in that he is to have the book rights of his work. Why should not he have more than that? I think that it is because the Parliamentary Secretary has not appreciated what goes on in syndication today. Syndication is a big business. It is a not unimportant part of newspaper development and enterprise. The Parliamentary Secretary said in Committee that not many journalists have their work syndicated abroad. The words which the hon. and learned Gentleman used were these:
<q>There is the question of syndication overseas. I do not know how many working staff journalists normally get their work syndicated in papers overseas. Some do, as one knows, and there are such arrangements as with the <i>Mombassa Times,</i> which I mentioned. Those newspapers pick up material from newspapers


over here, but journalists who have their work syndicated, are, I should think, relatively few &#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 26th June, 1956 ; <i>Standing Committee B,</i> c. 127.]</q></p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman will find, if he will look back to the preceding paragraph, that it is relative to the numbers who have syndication in newspapers at home.</p>

<p>This is an illustration, if I may say so, of the lack of knowledge by the Parliamentary Secretary of what is going on. What is happening today is that the whole content of newspapers is being sold as a kind of package deal abroad; that is to say, a newspaper in this country sells the whole of its services to a newspaper abroad, literally from the first page to the imprint.<br/>
The work of every single one of the reporters, artists, sketch writers and feature writers&#x2014;the whole thing <i>en bloc</i>&#x2014;is a package deal, as I have said, to newspapers, periodicals, magazines and the like abroad. So a relatively large number of journalists have their work syndicated, but without their knowledge, without their consent and without their knowing where the stuff is going to appear. That may be good newspaper enterprise; it may be good commercial enterprise; it is certainly a very profitable enterprise for the publisher. All that we are asking is that there should be some discussion and agreement with the staff journalist as to the share he is to get out of this enterprise.<br/>
I happen to be a director of a newspaper which indulges in syndication and gives 80 per cent. of its receipts to its staff. That is because it is a well-run, liberal and progressive newspaper. [An HON. MEMBER: "Which newspaper?"] I do not think that it is proper for me here to give publicity to the <i>New Statesman and Nation</i>. Therefore, a progressive, well-run newspaper sees to it that it does not take advantage of the law in its present form, and safeguards the commercial and, as it were, the ethical interests of the outstanding people who write for it. I am suggesting that that is a practice which, if my Amendment is accepted, could be followed generally in Fleet Street.<br/>
There is another problem which, I think, faces the Parliamentary Secretary, but he does not appreciate it. He tries to

Draw a distinction between the free-lance or commissioned man and the ordinary staff reporter or artist. What happens if they are both employed side by side to report the same incident&#x2014;the Coronation, for example? What happens on a newspaper when a great event of that kind takes place is that every one of the executive staff, from the editor down to the news editor, gets into a panic and is convinced that the regular staff are not capable of doing the job.<br/>
So a number of people with names and some sort of reputation are employed to go in and work, sitting, perhaps, side by side in the same pew with the ordinary reporters. The proprietor, if the Bill goes through in its present form, can do nothing about syndicating the work of the commissioned man, but he can do what he likes in the syndication of the work of the reporters. This is unjust and is not in the proper interest of the staff man.<br/>
When the Institute of Journalists, which represents, on the whole, the editors and the higher editorial executives of the newspapers, bands together with the National Union of Journalists, which represents almost the whole of what I call the working newspapermen of this country, to say that in its present form the Bill is wrong&#x2014;unjust, as I suggest, to those people&#x2014;I think that the Parliamentary Secretary ought to deal with them with greater sympathy than he did in June.<br/>
In every newspaper that we pick up we see the phrase, "Copyright is reserved. Reproduction in whole or in part is forbidden." That, of course, is true. It means that reproduction in whole or in part of a single section of the work is prohibited. I say that, if we are to do justice to a body of men who, despite all their proprietors' influences, try to do a good job by British journalism, the House and the Parliamentary Secretary will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Sir L. Plummer) indicated, this was an Amendment which was put down in his name during the Committee stage and which, as he said, I moved in his unfortunate absence, but, I regret to say, with the result that it was defeated. Now


that we have had the advantage of hearing my hon. Friend so lucidly explain the Amendment, I hope that it will receive, as it deserves, a better fate on the Report stage.<br/>
We have had the advantage, since the Committee stage, of examining the arguments addressed to the Committee by the Parliamentary Secretary against the Amendment. I am sure that on any fair reading of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, the House will come to the conclusion that those arguments were very inadequate and unsubstantial. In the first place, the Parliamentary Secretary objected to the Amendment on the ground that it was ambiguous. I think that any possible ambiguity in the Amendment as presented to the Committee has now been removed. Incidentally, the ambiguity arose because the hon. and learned Member himself had previously proposed an earlier Amendment which complicated the whole text of the Clause. It is now abundantly clear what my hon. Friends and I are seeking to achieve by this Amendment. There is no question of ambiguity.<br/>
The Amendment seeks to provide that, if a staff journalist in the employment of a particular group of newspapers writes an article for a newspaper, magazine or similar periodical, then the copyright in such article belongs to the proprietor of the newspaper, magazine or similiar periodical, but, apart from that, the copyright belongs to the author of the article. Surely the House will agree that a provision of that kind corresponds both with equity and good sense and is essential for the protection of working journalists about whom my hon. Friend speaks with such expert knowledge.<br/>
Moreover, if there were any particular case in which any element of injustice would result, the whole subject matter of this Clause would be subject to the provision of subsection (5) and it would always be open to the parties to make any different agreement if they so desired. If there is any doubt whether the person writing the article for a particular group of newspapers should have, or has by implication, authorised the proprietor to grant syndication rights elsewhere&#x2014;if that is the intention of the parties&#x2014;then they can write that into a contract. There is complete freedom of contract in that respect.<br/>
What we want to achieve is, in the absence of any provision to the contrary, what seems to me to accord with common sense, namely, that the author, the writer of the article, writes it for the particular group by whom he is engaged. They have the full rights in the journals in the group. If, after that, some other newspaper, periodical or magazine, or any other literary work wants to reproduce the creative work of that author for their own purpose they should pay a copyright fee to that author and not to the proprietor.<br/>
My hon. Friend has explained how this practice of syndicating the works of journalists, package deals of newspapers, interchange arrangements between one group in this country and another group in another country, is growing&#x2014;and growing to the prejudice of journalists. It is that situation that we are seeking to correct. I believe that there can be no possible objection to this Amendment, that it is free from all ambiguity, that it is required in the interests of justice to journalists as a whole, and I hope that it will be accepted.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.672.0" hansard_membership_id="1308" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/12423" speakername="Mr. F. P. Bishop" colnum="672" time="">
<p>As the hon. Member for Deptford (Sir L. Plummer) was kind enough to refer to my small contribution on a similar Amendment that was moved in Committee, perhaps I might just say a word on the subject.<br/>
The hon. Member referred to one or two of the difficulties that I suggested an Amendment of this kind would create. He did not refer to all of them. For example, I pointed out that when a journalist is employed to do a particular job he does it in circumstances which make it very far from being his own individual creation. In other words, it is very often impossible to decide who is the author of a piece of work appearing in a newspaper.<br/>
As we were then sitting while a Test match was going on at Lords, I instanced the example of Press reporters who were then sitting at the Lords ground reporting the match. I said that they were not (here on their own account, but had tickets which had been provided by their employers and were there as representatives of the newspaper that had sent them. They could not have been in that position and have had those privileges otherwise.<br/>
The hon. Member mentioned the case of the reporting of such an event as a Coronation. I am sure that, from his practical experience, he knows as well as I do just what happens on such occasions. A number of staff reporters are sent out and posted at particular vantage points on the route of the procession, or in the Abbey or wherever the great event may be. They each contribute their portion to a long and probably vivid report which is, in fact, a composite production&#x2014;in part the work of all of them. It would be quite impossible in such cases, and in many other cases, to say who was the author of that particular work.<br/>
However, there is more in it than that. I understand about this business of syndication, but it surely is very desirable, from the national point of view, that articles written by journalists employed by newspapers in this country should be quoted&#x2014;quoted largely, and even reproduced in full in many cases&#x2014;in other newspapers all over the world.<br/>
That situation which exists today&#x2014;and I am thinking of such newspapers as <i>The Times,</i> the <i>Manchester Guardian</i> and others of the highest character&#x2014;that possibility of what they write being fully quoted in other newspapers all over the world, would be very seriously hampered if the proprietors of newspapers were not, in fact, the owners of the copyright and in a position to give the necessary direction for that to be done.<br/>
The hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher) suggested that the difficulty could be overcome by special contracts in each case. I see that I said something on that also during the Committee stage. I said:
<q>It would be most unreasonable and unsuitable to put a provision into an Act of Parliament which, for practical reasons, everybody concerned had to avoid by a specific term of contract."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee B</i> ; 26th June, 1956, c. 118.]</q>
The contract could work the other way, too, but it would really be impossible and impracticable to expect that an individual contract should be made in the case of every journalist employed by a newspaper in order to get out of the effects of this provision.</p>

<p>Surely the hon. Member knows from his experience that an

individual contract is provided for every member of the editorial staff as it is. He never employed a journalist on <i>The Times</i> without an individual contract. What is to prevent a clause being inserted into that contract to recompense the journalist if he signs away his rights in an article?</p>

<p>Where contracts are made I think they usually do make such a provision. I only say that it would be undesirable to throw the burden on an industry to evade the effect of an Act of Parliament by having to have a contract for each individual case. Again, I must say that I have every sympathy with the staff journalist. The staff journalist very often writes anonymously for a newspaper, and is proud to write anonymously and to be the voice of that newspaper on his own particular subject. He is paid, or ought to be paid, for the value of the work he does, taking into account the fact that it may be reproduced elsewhere. I think that it would be impracticable to do otherwise, and I hope, therefore, that my hon. and learned Friend will still not be prepared to accept this Amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Deptford (Sir L. Plummer) started by saying that I had never made clear what was the difference between the staff journalists and the commissioned journalists&#x2014;or free-lance journalists, as he calls them&#x2014;and why we have found it appropriate to make any differentiation between the way in which they are treated in copyright law.<br/>
If I did not make it clear during the Committee stage it was, of course, because the point was made with admirable clarity by the hon. and learned Member for Walsall, North (Mr. W. Wells) during the debate on the Second Reading of this Bill. He then said:
<q>As for the other class brought within the Clause&#x2014;the man who normally writes articles in the course of his employment, who has as part of the resources on which he draws to find his material all the advantages in obtaining from his employers information and in securing payment of his expenses in himself obtaining information, I feel that we are on very much less strong ground. &#x2026;"&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, 4th June. 1956 ; Vol. 553 ; col. 794.]</q></p>

<p>It is not so much that I have travelled from light into darkness or from darkness into light, but that I was then saying that I thought this was a less strong case than some of the others we were putting&#x2014;but I kept an entirely open mind as to its merits. I wanted to hear the arguments, and by the arguments I was convinced that the case was even stronger than I then thought it was.</p>

<p>I do not know that that really precisely indicates the position of the hon. and learned Gentleman who said earlier:
<q>Speaking for myself, I feel that a sharp distinction exists between (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>); that is to say, between the man who writes an article in the course of his employment and the man who writes an article because he is commissioned to do so."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT. 4th June. 1956 ; Vol. 553, c. 793.]</q>
It is quite true that after the hon. and learned Gentleman had given expression to what I would call that unequivocal statement of view his hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) came to his rescue, saying:
<q>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to what was said by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. W. Wells) &#x2026; but, of course, my hon. and learned Friend was expressing that point of view in the light of the situation as he saw it at that time."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee B,</i> 26th June, 1956 ; c. 128.]</q>
That was, no doubt, the pattern for words that became famous in a rather larger context about a month later. I do not want to dwell on that, save only perhaps to say this, that it shows that the unifying influences of a Balliol education are stronger even than the fissiparous tendencies of the Opposition Front Bench.<br/>
Anybody listening to the speech of the hon. Member for Deptford when moving this Amendment might have been pardoned for thinking we were actually

making the position of the journalist worse in copyright law by this Bill, whereas, of course, as he well knows, this Bill is, in fact, making the position of both the commissioned and staff journalist better.<br/>
I think the House must, in order to get this in perspective, bear in mind the background of this matter, that is, the law as it was before the Bill was introduced. Under the 1911 Act, it is true, the commissioned journalist&#x2014;because this differentiation dates right back over the forty-five years since the last Copyright Act&#x2014;had all the copyright in his work, including newspaper and periodical rights, but the staff journalist, with whom we are concerned in this Amendment, had only the negative right to restrain the employer from publishing his work in non-periodical publications, and, of course, the newspaper proprietor had unqualified right in regard to syndication. That is the position from which we start in the 1911 Act.<br/>
Under this Bill the staff journalist, instead of getting the somewhat negative right of veto in the use of his work in books and symposia and the like, is given full copyright in those publications, and this, I am sure the hon. Gentleman, at any rate in his fairer moments, will admit, is a very notable advance forward for the staff journalist.<br/>
The present Amendments are, it is true, less wide than the one moved in Committee upstairs, because by this Amendment the right to syndicate within the group at home would be reserved&#x2014;at least, I understand that is the intention&#x2014;to the newspaper proprietor ; but he would still not have the right, of course, to supply overseas newspapers with which he may have an agreement of the sort referred to by the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman the Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher) said all ambiguity had now been removed and it was quite clear what was the intention. I was just a little surprised to hear him say that because, of course, his Amendment now on the Notice Paper, in page 5, line 18, after "periodical" insert "belonging to the said proprietor", is in different terms from that of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Rossendale and the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Walsall, North.</p>

<p>I appreciate that. What I am seeking to show is that the hon. Gentleman himself selected a different form of words which would have a different effect from that of the Amendment which he has seconded. So like the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Walsall, North he has deviated from his path.<br/>
Why I make that point is this. If it is to be any newspaper owned or controlled by a newspaper proprietor, which is what I understand to be the present thinking of the hon. Gentleman, then these words, in my submission, are defective unless there is some definition of what is understood by control in these circumstances. It may be that the hon. Gentleman has in mind Section 154 of the Companies Act. He nods assent, but he will appreciate, as well as or better than I, that it does not expressly define what is meant by control. It defines merely the relationship between holding and subsidiary companies, and I am bound to tell the House that, in my view, if this Amendment were made in these terms it would be defective in that particular.<br/>
On the principle of the matter, though this Amendment is an improvement on the Amendment moved in Committee it still does not seem to me to be either a necessary or desirable change in the law, broadly for the reasons so admirably summarised by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, Central (Mr. Bishop). In Committee, we had two cases put to us, the home and overseas; the home case about the small journalist on the local newspaper who suddenly found his work published in a national newspaper solely to the advantage of his employer. I pointed out then that if he was as good as all that at his work he would either get more remuneraion or another job. That seems to have been effective, because the matter has been put today

solely on the overseas case. I will address myself to the hon. Gentleman's arguments on that.</p>

<p>It often happens that a local journalist, the young, struggling lad whom the Parliamentary Secretary has described, is the only man available in a place to get the story. Perhaps it is the report of a murder. He writes that story. He gives it to his news editor. It appears in the paper. It is then sent by that paper to a London paper, which accepts it. Over and over again the young journalist who has got his way to make in the world finds his stuff being lifted or sold without any discussion with him.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.678.1" hansard_membership_id="10123" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21833" speakername="Mr. Walker-Smith" colnum="678" time="">
<p>I am obliged to the hon. Gentleman. I was not really on that matter. What we discussed in Committee was, as it were, the original work, what, I think, would be known in Fleet Street as feature work, and not the reporting side. What the hon. Gentleman now refers to is what is called, I believe, "milking the copy." As to that I have nothing to add to what I said in Committee upstairs. If that is an unsatisfactory practice it must be one which ought to be sorted out among the newspapers and journalists themselves, because it does not fall within the ambit of the Copyright Act.<br/>
As to the overseas question, the hon. Gentleman has referred to these package deals, and if they are made in that way it seems to add reinforcement to what was my main contention before, that these matters fall to be dealt with better by contract than by any general presumption of the copyright law.<br/>
All these matters can be spelled out in contract. Every journalist who is working today is working under the system which has operated for forty-five years, that is to say in the absence of specific agreement the presumption is that the copyright for syndication belongs to the newspaper proprietor. I think that the hon. Member gave his case away in his intervention to my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, Central because he then put to him the point that there was, in fact, an express contract in most of these cases.<br/>
It will be seen that Clause 4 (5), with which we are now dealing, has effect
<q>subject, in any particular case, to any agreement excluding the operation thereof in that case.</q>


If, as the hon. Member said, there is nearly always an express agreement, it is open to the journalist to have a clause added to his agreement to deal with the question of the copyright in syndication overseas. Conversely, supposing the Amendment were passed and added to the Bill in spite of the drafting defects to which I have referred, we should have the position that the newspaper proprietors in their turn would be able to take advantage of subsection (5) and make agreements varying the general presumption. There is no doubt that in a large number of cases they would do so if they enjoyed the present copyright.<br/>
The net result of the whole operation would be that there would be no change in the practice, but there would be a general presumption written into the law which might not reflect the general practice because it would be modified by a myriad of individual agreements and all we would be doing would be adding to the complexity of these matters.<br/>
Therefore, neither from the point of practical utility nor from the point of view of principle, do I consider this case to be made out. But it does not mean at all that the Bill is in any way unmindful of the interests of the staff journalists or unfriendly in its approach to them because, as I have said, the changes made in the copyright law are considerably to their advantage over that which has prevailed during the last forty-five years.</p>

<p>I hope that it will not be unparliamentary for me to say that we have just had an example of Satan in the form of the Parliamentary Secretary rebuking the sin which he attributes to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. W. Wells). This is not a Bill on which any of us has been wholly consistent, and if the Parliamentary Secretary is going to make charges of that kind I can assure him that we shall be able to reply in kind. There are many aspects of the Bill on which a little more flexibility on his part would have been more acceptable to my hon. Friends and certainly to some hon. Members opposite.<br/>
As good democrats, we on this side have always supposed that the purpose of debate was to thrash out the merits of a case and to come to a conclusion on those

merits. We have been fortunate that in this case there has been no lack of advice tendered to us by the many bodies which have an interest in the subject under discussion. Perhaps the rather pleasant aspect of that is that almost invariably contrary advice has been tendered to us from the various bodies interested, and therefore we have been in the happy position of being able to weigh the merits and make up our minds on the case put to us.<br/>
I confess frankly to the House that, like my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Walsall, North I began by feeling that this provision should apply to the freelance journalist, but that there would be difficulties in applying it to the staff journalist. My hon. Friend the Member for Deptford (Sir L. Plummer) and I very nearly imperilled an old-standing friendship by our disagreement on this issue, but my hon. Friend has now convinced me of the Tightness of his point of view, and I hope that he will convince the House as well.<br/>
This is what we are striving to do in the Amendment. At present, if a staff man writes an article it may reappear in other papers with considerable profit to the employer, but with no additional profit to himself. We say that that should apply only if the journalist has expressly, in writing, agreed with the proprietor that that should be the case.<br/>
5.15 p.m.<br/>
We all agree with the Parliamentary Secretary that anything of this kind can be included in the agreement which is made between the staff journalist and his employer. That, I think, is one of the most convincing arguments against the point of view which the Parliamentary Secretary has expressed. Every staff journalist ought to be in the position to negotiate with the proprietor a reasonable condition of employment, and all we are saying is that, in the absence of agreement of that kind, there should be no automatic presumption in favour of the proprietor. Already in matters of this kind the balance is sufficiently far tipped in favour of the proprietor, and we think it wholly unfair to introduce a new factor of this kind in favour of the employer.<br/>
We have already discussed this matter at considerable length in Committee, but there is one further argument which I should like to bring to bear today. We all agree, now that we have put forward


the Amendment in this form, that, of course, the proprietor shall have the right to use within the group which he owns contributions made by staff journalists, but I ask the House to address itself to the difficulty of the staff journalist who is perfectly prepared to write for one group of newspapers, but who does not want to be associated with outside publications.<br/>
There are cases of hon. Members of this House, associated with political parties, who are nevertheless staff journalists, and who might find themselves gravely embarrassed, not only politically but in other ways, if they found to their dismay that an article written for their own newspaper was being used in a publication run to advance the aims, for instance, of Sir Oswald Mosley's Union movement. That might well be the case unless there was a specific provision in the agreement to the contrary. The presumption which the Parliamentary Secretary is seeking to introduce would make that perfectly possible. One could think of a</p>

<p>It is unfair of the Parliamentary Secretary to take this attitude to the Amendment. Since the Committee stage, we have gone into the matter very carefully indeed and we have now proposed that the Amendment should apply only to other periodicals owned by the proprietor. Therefore, we have narrowed its scope. We have gone a long way to meet the objections which were raised in Committee, and it is therefore necessary for us to press the Amendment to a Division and to vote against the Government on this issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.685.2" hansard_membership_id="11198" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30338" speakername="Mr. John Rankin" colnum="685" time="">
<p>I beg to move, in page 8, line 8, to leave out subsection (7).<br/>
The fact that the hon. Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Crouch) has been good enough to subscribe his name to this Amendment is not evidence of an unholy alliance, but is proof of the fact that there is a widespread desire on both sides of the House to amend this Clause.<br/>
I was inspired to move this Amendment because of the representations which I have received from persons residing in my own division who assure me that their incomes will be adversely affected by the insertion of this subsection. Some of them I have known for a long while. Not only will they be deprived of certain rights which they now possess, but, as they assure me, it will affect their standard of living. Because of that, I felt in duty bound to submit this Amendment to the House and to the Government for their consideration.<br/>
I am assured that this subsection is entirely new to copyright law and completely foreign to all the principles of copyright. I am told that it is a fundamental principle that the author shall have the sole right to control the copying or other reproduction of his work in any material form.<br/>
5.30 p.m.<br/>
It is interesting to note that that principle is already safeguarded in the Bill, because if we turn to subsection (5) of Clause 2 we find the words:
<q>(5) The acts restricted by the copyright in a literary, dramatic or musical work are&#x2014;</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>) reproducing the work in any material form.</q>
Therefore, the principle is already protected in the Bill. It seems to me that, having protected the principle in Clause 2,

the Government are now proceeding in the Bill as it stands to destroy that principle in the subsection of Clause 6 which I am asking should be deleted.<br/>
As far as broadcasting is concerned, the subsection virtually robs the author of his present right to control the copying of his work on records, and so deprives him, as I have already been assured, of a certain amount of the income which he presently earns from that source. Of course, as we are aware, at the present moment the B.B.C., the Independent Television Authority and the programme contractors who look after the Radio Luxembourg broadcasts, have been paying fees agreed between them and the authors for permission to record copyright music for the transmissions of these broadcasting associations.<br/>
If this subsection remains in the Bill, then the broadcasting companies will be able to record such music as they at present record for payment without the authors permission and without any payment to the author whatsoever. It is a complete reversal of the existing provision. However, we are assured that before they do that they must have obtained a licence to broadcast and that the records which they do broadcast are to be destroyed within twenty-eight days after they have been heard on the air.<br/>
The trouble about that is this. There is no obligation whatever on a broadcaster to give notice to the copyright owner of the fact that he is making such a record or of the fact that after the twenty-eight days he has destroyed that record. No obligation exists to inform the copyright owner of that fact, so that what would seem to be a safeguard of the author's rights and income is without any value whatever. The total effect of the subsection is to deprive him of any protection whatever.<br/>
There are people, with whom I have discussed the point, who say that the


author has tended to abuse his rights in the past, but, quite frankly, I have no evidence of the truth of that. Within my own&#x2014;I agree somewhat limited&#x2014;experience, I have been assured by those who know that no such abuse has ever been perpetrated by authors in the past ; that is, by seeking unreasonable fees or trying to impose impossible conditions. I am told that the present arrangement works very smoothly indeed and that the position is an amicable one where the broadcasting authorities and the authors are concerned.<br/>
I therefore urge the Government to take my advice that, in view of the fact that the present arrangement works well, they should leave well alone, and agree with me that this subsection ought to be deleted.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
I think I should make it clear how this came about, because some of my hon. Friends told me yesterday that they had no idea that I kept such company. A fortnight ago, I heard from one of my constituents&#x2014;I have heard from others since&#x2014;Mr. Roderick Fletcher, of Bryanston, near Blandford, who is without question a very able composer and writer of music. He pointed out to me what the effect would be on authors, writers and composers if this subsection remained in the Bill. It was not until I arrived here yesterday that I realised that I was not the sponsor of this Amendment, but found that my name was supporting the Amendment of the hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin). I think that rather strengthens the case for it. The hon. Member for Govan lives in Scotland and I live down in Dorset, and we have come together across very nearly the whole of the United Kingdom, representing people who have the same views on music.<br/>
Authors and composers of music do not often, until in advancing years, earn great sums of money, and I think that, in view of the hard life they have had to live before they eventually get to the top, there is no need for this particular subsection. It has already been pointed out that the arrangement up to now has worked very smoothly indeed, and I cannot see the point of this subsection. It provides that the records shall be destroyed, but what proof will there be that they have been destroyed? Provided

that they have been destroyed within the twenty-eight days of being made, there is no liability to pay royalty.<br/>
I appeal to my hon. and learned Friend representing the Government to accept the Amendment and to allow this amicable arrangement to go on. I know that on the Government side there are some hon. and right hon. Gentlemen who are interested in music, and I also appeal to them to support this Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.688.0" hansard_membership_id="12633" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21126" speakername="Dr. Barnett Stross" colnum="688" time="">
<p>When we considered this Bill in Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) spoke so convincingly and, I thought, with such great knowledge about this matter that we were disappointed that his views were not then accepted. It is true that the Committee did not divide on the matter, but I must say that I am entirely in agreement with the mover and seconder of this Amendment for reasons that have been made apparent by them. In Clause 2 the words are very clear when we attempt to safeguard the rights of the author. Subsection (5) puts it in this way:
<q>The acts restricted by the copyright in a literary, dramatic or musical work are&#x2014;</q>
<q>(<i>a</i>) reproducing the work in any material form;</q>
In that Clause, the author is safeguarded. In Clause 6, however, there is some diminution of those rights, but with no recompense. We shall be most interested to hear what the Assistant Postmaster-General has to say and how he explains this divergence. I am not sure whether at this stage we have evidence as to loss of remuneration in any particular way, but for the future we have no guarantee that there would not be any.<br/>
Mention has been made already of musicians and writers. Normally, as I said upstairs in Committee, they are not very good at looking after themselves and we should not be afraid even if we erred in our attempt to safeguard their interests as much as possible. Indeed, the whole purpose of the Bill, which we have considered with so much pleasure and profit upstairs, is to safeguard the author, the musician and the playright. Throughout all our discussions, both sides of the Committee obviously had that carefully and fully in mind.<br/>
With reference to this and to writers, authors, musicians and artists generally,


I noted that there was a letter to <i>The Times</i> on 16th October which, I am sure, has come to the attention of the Assistant Postmaster-General, who must be fully aware of it and of the names appended to that letter. They include names such as Arthur Bliss, Vaughan Williams, and so on. They say that for the first time something novel is being introduced into our legislation so far as copyright law is concerned. They then point out that there is a discrepancy between the safeguard in Clause 2 and this attempt to diminish or whittle away their safeguard. They say:
<q>Clause 6 (7) virtually robs the author of his right to control the copying of his works on records and deprives him of his income therefrom.</q>
It is that phrase of which I am not as yet sure, but I am sure they are quite right when they say:
<q>Under this subsection, the B.B.C. and other broadcasting authorities will be able to record such music without the author's permission and without any payment to him whatever, provided that they have obtained a licence to broadcast and that the records are destroyed within 28 days after going on the air, but since there is no obligation on the broadcaster to give notice to the copyright-owner of the making and destroying of such records, this proviso is valueless.</q>
That is their view and it is expressed very strongly. I am sure they have given it a great deal of thought.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale said much the same in Committee. He expressed similar fears. Now, I think, all parts of the House feel that he was probably right. There is still time to amend the neglect by the Assistant Postmaster-General in not putting it right at that time.<br/>
Two things are possible. If we removed subsection (7), we should have the original position. That, I think, would meet with the approval of the people most concerned whose interests we ought to consider carefully. If we do not revert to the original position, we should try to make some arrangement so that in respect of these so-called ephemeral recordings a payment of a reasonable nature should be made. I know it is late in the day, but I am sure it would be possible for the Assistant Postmaster-General to give the question further consideration and to let us, in this small matter, have our way on behalf of people whom we are all interested in supporting.</p>

<p>Some of my hon. Friends and I have a similar Amendment on the Order Paper&#x2014;in page 8, line 27, at end insert :
<q>(8) The person who makes a reproduction to which the last preceding subsection applies shall, as soon as practicable, give notice to the person who (in relation to the making of the reproduction) is the owner of the copyright of the date on which such reproduction was made and of the date on which it was destroyed.</q>
<q>(9) The person who makes a reproduction to which subsection (7) of this section applies shall pay to the person who (in relation to the making of the reproduction) is the owner of the copyright such sum by way of royalty as may be agreed between them or in default of agreement as may be fixed by arbitration.</q>
&#x2014;but I will, with permission, Mr. Speaker, raise the point I have in mind in discussing the present Amendment. My Amendment does not go quite as far, but I am happy to support the present Amendment, for the time being at any rate, until we have had an explanation from the Government as to why they consider it necessary to proceed on these lines.<br/>
I raised this point on Second Reading, but I have never been satisfied that the Government have met it. If they want the support of the House on it, they should give a fuller and better explanation as to why it is necessary to alter the existing law. I think that when altering an existing law, as the Government propose to do, the onus of proving the need to alter it must rest with them. I cannot see why it is necessary&#x2014;I remain quite unconvinced&#x2014;to change the existing law and practice on the subject.<br/>
For many years it has been the practice that the person who wishes to record a musical work on a record or tape must pay for it. That right has to be paid for. As the Bill stands, an entirely new principle has been introduced, namely, that the work can be reproduced for what is called an ephemeral recording for a period of twenty-eight days. There arises, first, a practical point. What safeguard does the composer have that the record will be destroyed at the end of twenty-eight days? After all, he is dealing with a vast corporation or, perhaps, a big company, and he has no means of knowing that the record has been destroyed at the end of twenty-eight days.<br/>
Is there something sacred about the period of twenty-eight days? By stipulating the twenty-eight days, the Govern-


ment admit that a composer has an absolute right over his own work, but why do they abrogate it for a period of twenty-eight days? Why do they say that anyone can copy it for that period? Why not twenty-seven days, or thirty days? There may be a perfectly good explanation, but I have not heard of it.<br/>
I hope that the Government will not fall back on the recommendations of the Brussels Convention, for I would remind them that if they use it to assist them there is nothing mandatory about it; it is purely optional. It is left to each Government to make what kind of regulations it chooses, and from the Brussels Convention there is no reason why the period should be twenty-eight days. It could be one day or it could be three months. There is nothing sacrosant about the twenty-eight days.<br/>
I hope that the Government can give us more convincing reasons than they have done up to now, although I should like to see the Clause abolished altogether. That is why I support the hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) and my hon. Friend the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Crouch). If the Government give some reason why it should be retained, the least they can do is to put upon the recording authority the obligation to inform the owner of the copyright that a recording has been made&#x2014;there is no such obligation at present&#x2014;and, secondly, to insist upon an obligation on the recording authority to inform the composer that the record has been destroyed at the end of the requisite period.</p>

<p>I should like to add my support to the Amendment. I have very great sympathy with composers of music in particular, and in these degenerate days precious little advantage is given to them. Anything which will encourage them to produce more should be done, but as it stands the Clause is a discouragement.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey (Sir D. Gammans) made a very good point when he asked what was sacrosanct about 28 days. If we are to take a man's livelihood from him, it does not matter whether the period is 28 days or 28 years; they are equally bad. Not having heard the Government's explanation, I do not see why, Clause 2 having

laid down one thing, Clause 6 should change it, certainly for music composers, in whom I am most interested. I should like to hear something more from the Minister to convince me that the Amendment is not highly desirable, as I think it to be at the moment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.692.0" hansard_membership_id="1121" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30743" speakername="Mr. Philip Bell" colnum="692" time="">
<p>I may be wrong, but surely very heavy weather is being made on this issue. We are being told that people's livelihoods will be taken away from them, but, as I understand it, this subsection is inserted as a business arrangement for the convenience of actors and actresses. The real position is that when actors and actresses are ready to come to the microphone there are occasions when nobody is ready to listen to them. Someone says, "We had better record you on Saturday, but we cannot hear you until Monday morning." The actors and actresses say, "Yes. Saturday morning will be all right, but we shall be out on Monday, at the House of Commons listening to a debate." So the programme is recorded and broadcast later.<br/>
The proviso says that it must be reproduced only in accordance with the assignment or licence. The author gives permission to broadcast the work. It may be decided to broadcast it twice and he is paid for that. The broadcasting authority says that it can have the actors for only one performance and so it takes a recording of the first and live broadcast and the second broadcast is recorded. Possibly the actors are available on only one occasion and then both broadcasts are recorded.<br/>
That is the bargain, it is business and for the convenience of everybody. It is not a new right. Hon. Members are making a mountain out of a molehill. There is no substance in this talk of authors not getting paid and of having things done behind their backs and losing their livelihoods. There may be something in the issue about destroying the record to prevent somebody from subsequently selling it to Peru. I do not really mean Peru, let us say Lilliput&#x2014;they would be rather stupid putting it out in Lilliput&#x2014;and to avoid that disaster we must put in an affidavit which, I hope, will be settled by a competent lawyer.</p>

<p>The rather unexpected union between my hon.


Friend the Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin) and the hon. Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Crouch) has been a happy one, and I hope that it will turn out to be fruitful as well. The hon. and learned Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Philip Bell) says that we are making rather heavy weather of this, but I can assure the House that it is the Government who are making very heavy weather of this matter.<br/>
The hon. and learned Member for Bolton, East said that this is an arrangement for the convenience of the performer or artist. We have never suggested that the practice of making these ephemeral recordings should be abolished. It is obviously a most satisfactory arrangement from everybody's point of view. However, we do object to the fact that the Government are now proposing to upset what has been, as my hon. Friend the Member for Govan said, a very amicable system by which both the B.B.C. and, I understand, the programme contractors have been prepared to pay the performer for the two rights which the broadcasting authority has been receiving.<br/>
Those two rights are the right to broadcast and the right to record. What the Government are now proposing is to give the broadcasting authorities two rights for the price of one. It is very difficult, particularly in a private enterprise economy, to justify an attitude of that kind. I am afraid that throughout the Parliamentary Secretary has not appeared to be wholly in control of the situation.<br/>
When we discussed this matter in Standing Committee, I ventured to read to the Parliamentary Secretary the criticism which the Performing Rights Society made of the Government's proposal. The Society said :
<q>It is in our submission the makers of commercial advertising films who may indirectly reap the benefit of this subsection. &#x2026; Admittedly they are not the licensees of the owners of the performing rights, but the Programme Contractors hold comprehensive licences to perform music and they own subsidiary companies which make advertising films. Under the existing law, the makers of these advertising films must obtain the permission of the copyright owner before recording a musical work in what may well be a most unsuitable connection. These films, because they are often repeated, must have a short life to avoid boring

the television viewer."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee B,</i> 28th June, 1956 ; c. 170&#x2013;1.]</q>
Although one might not think that that was a characteristic of advertising films, when we put this point to the Parliamentary Secretary he admitted that he did not know what the answer was to the point about advertising films, and he said that he did not know whether it was the Independent Television Authority or the programme contractors who would be affected by the subsection. I have waited anxiously for nearly four months to have some elucidation, either in writing or in the course of the debate, from the Parliamentary Secretary upon the point which my hon. Friends and I put to him in Standing Committee.<br/>
I have said that we accept the inevitability of the making of ephemeral recordings of this kind. In Standing Committee we proposed an Amendment which is identical with the one standing in the names of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke) and the hon. Member for Hornsey (Sir D. Gammans) and others. It would have had two effects. One would have been to ensure that the broadcasting authority would have to give the owner of the copyright notice of what was being done, and there were certain safeguards about the destruction of the recording and that there should be suitable remuneration by way of royalty.<br/>
I am glad that hon. Members opposite have tabled a similar Amendment, and we shall certainly support that, if it is necessary to do so, just as we shall support another one which my hon. Friends and I have put down. I want openly to say to the Government that we do not want to delete this subsection. Throughout our discussions we have tried to improve it so that it will not impose any hardship upon the people it is to affect. We are trying, even at this late stage, to improve the subsection, and I ask the Government whether they are not prepared to accept the Amendment standing in the name of the hon. Member for Twickenham as well as the Amendment standing in my own name.<br/>
If they are able to give us that assurance, it will remove any possibility of injustice being perpetrated and we shall not find it necessary to divide the House. If, on the other hand, they cannot assure us on these points, it will be necessary for


us to add our weight to the gesture that the hon. Member for Twickenham and others are to make by going into the Division Lobby in the event of their Amendment being resisted by the Government.<br/>
I should like to say how much we appreciated the words of the hon. and gallant Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Sir A. Gomme-Duncan) on the way we pay our composers. They are paid very little indeed; we treat them as meanly as we treat most other creative artists in this country. I would rather the House did not go on record as perpetrating an injustice which will operate meanly in the case of the fellow citizens to whom the hon. and gallant Gentleman referred.</p>

<p>I take the view which is taken by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Philip Bell). It seems to me that this is just a mechanical subsection, laying down how the business of reproducing shall be carried out where reproduction is more convenient than having a live broadcast. But I am bound to say that the fear expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the House that there is more in this subsection than the mere mechanics of the business and that perhaps it takes away a right which at present composers enjoy has communicated a certain amount of anxiety to me.<br/>
I should like my hon. Friends and those who have moved the Amendment to know whether the Government take the view that this relates purely to the mechanics, or whether it is the birth of some new right, or the whittling down of a right which composers at present enjoy.</p>

<p>I am obliged to the House for an exhaustive debate on what is, on the whole, a relatively small aspect of the general problem of the whole relationship between broadcasting and the world of composition and music. I think it right to say that my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Sir A. Gomme-Duncan) overestimated&#x2014;as was said by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Philip Bell)&#x2014;the effect of this upon musicians and composers.<br/>
Speeches from both sides of the House have shown that hon. Members are concerned to watch carefully and to safeguard the interests of the composers in a matter of this sort. The Government fully share that view. At the same time, I think it right to point out that the opportunities available to a composer at present are, as a result of the invention and increase of broadcasting, very much greater than they have ever been in the past; and the reason why in fact there has been no separation of the two rights under the 1911 Act, which was referred to by the hon. Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood), is because at the time the Act was passed there was no broadcasting. We are bringing the law into relation with the circumstances of the present day, and the existence of a highly powerful organisation of broadcasting, including both sound and television, which has brought great benefits to composers generally as a result of the increased use of their works.<br/>
The hon. Member for Rossendale asked me a particular question which he had raised with my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Secretary during the Committee stage discussions. It was whether it would be the programme companies or the I.T.A. which would enjoy the benefit of the provision in this case. In case the hon. Gentleman is still concerned about this matter, let me say that it would be the programme companies; but it is covered by the Clause as it stands at present.<br/>
Let me explain the reason for the Clause. It is, as I say, in principle to bring the legal situation into relation with existing circumstances which have changed very substantially, as the hon. Gentleman recognised fully, since the passing of the 1911 Act. It is perfectly true, as was said by my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Hornsey (Sir D. Gammans) that we are not under a mandatory injunction under 11 bis 3. But at the same time there is no doubt of the intention of that provision of the Brussels Convention.<br/>
Indeed, there is a further matter which is relevant, namely, the Report of the Copyright Committee which recommended a period of something like 28 days ; and that this particular provision should be included and the right of ephemeral recordings be given to the


I.T.A. and the other authority concerned. Therefore, were we to take out the whole of this subsection, we should in fact be going against the obvious intention of the Brussels Convention and also the recommendation of the Copyright Committee, whose authority in this matter I do not think the House has ever suggested that we should ignore. Indeed, we have not done so in the general approach to this Bill during its various stages.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.697.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Sir D. Gammaus" colnum="697" time="">
<p>My hon. Friend has brought in the Brussels Convention and suggested and that if it is not mandatory at any rate it is so suggested. If he would explain to the House how many countries have amended their copyright laws since that time to bring in something of the order of a 28-day period, it would strengthen his argument.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.697.1" hansard_membership_id="518" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11754" speakername="Mr. Alport" colnum="697" time="">
<p>No doubt that would be the case. On the other hand, there has always been a sense that in the legislation which we pass on this subject this country is the leader. Therefore, there is no doubt that what we do will be followed by other countries to a large extent when they face similar problems about bringing their own copyright law into relationship with present-day conditions.<br/>
As was pointed out by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton, East, it is a matter of convenience that a recording is taken in order to facilitate the presentation of a programme. The authority which the owner of the head copyright gives is given in respect of the use of his work in relation to the broadcast. It seems reasonable, and I suggest that it is reasonable, that the broadcasting authority should have the right at the same time to utilise, without paying a second fee, whatever method is convenient in order to put the work of the composer or other artist concerned on the air. We feel that to be the logical and proper approach. It is certainly the logic behind the Brussels Convention and the Report of the Copyright Committee.<br/>
I do not think that the emolument of the composer would be greatly affected by this, because the total emolument will be in respect of the full use of his work, whereas what has been suggested in other Amendments which have been put down

is that there should be a division between the recognition of the mechanical right on the one side, which is the recording, and the copyright on the other, which is in fact the broadcasting of the work.<br/>
Although there are always fears by the parties interested in this matter, I suggest that their apprehensions are not well-founded, because the total emolument, or the award, or the payment made, would clearly be affected by the fact that the B.B.C. or the I.T.A. would not have the full scope for the use of the work if the authority to broadcast did not include the full authority to use the work in whatever way was most convenient to ensure that a broadcast was made successfully and fully.</p>

<p>What guarantee, then, is to be given, say to the composer, with regard to the 28 days?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.698.1" hansard_membership_id="518" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11754" speakername="Mr. Alport" colnum="698" time="">
<p>The question of the 28 days was discussed&#x2014;or the notification at the end of the 28 days was discussed&#x2014;at some length during the Committee proceedings. My hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Secretary made reference to what he called, I think, "statutory scepticism" of the <i>bona fides</i> of these authorities&#x2014;the I.T.A., which is responsible for the programme companies, and the B.B.C.&#x2014;and whether they would carry out their obligations in this matter.<br/>
May I correct a point which has been made, I think, by the hon. Member for Govan (Mr. Rankin)? We shall shortly make an Amendment to this subsection to prevent the recordings being made for broadcasting out of the United Kingdom, or those Colonies, as in fact they are, to which this particular subsection is extended. That limits the use of this privilege to the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. The hon. Gentleman need not fear that there will be any abuse of this right by the despatch of recordings from this country for use overseas. I am merely anticipating an Amendment which is to come later in order to answer a point which was made by the hon. Member for Govan.</p>

<p>We are listening with interest to my hon. Friend's argument. Can he tell us at what time of day the first live musical broadcast is given? I know that at 7.30 a.m. or thereabouts there are no live broadcasts.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.699.0" hansard_membership_id="518" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11754" speakername="Mr. Alport" colnum="699" time="">
<p>My hon. Friend is a farmer and no doubt gets up considerably earlier in the morning than I do. I am unable to say when the first live broadcast takes place in the day. I presume that my hon. Friend is referring to broadcasts of music. I cannot give him the information straightway. I do not think that point affects the principle that we are trying to establish. It may be that my hon. Friend has in mind that it is not necessary to use these recording rights for broadcasting as much as the broadcasting authorities say, but I can assure him that there is no question of early rising for actors, actresses and musicians but of their having other engagements which preclude them from appearing on a particular feature. This makes recording a very convenient way of handling the presentation of certain programmes.<br/>
We have made provision in the Clause to prevent abuse of this facility&#x2014;it is no more than this&#x2014;which is being given to the broadcasting authorities to enable them to make proper and efficient use of the wares which the composer has to sell. I have drawn attention to an Amendment which is to be considered later, but I think we have made it clear that these recordings must not be copied and must be destroyed within 28 days.<br/>
I shall be surprised if any hon. Member on either side of the House does not accept the good faith of the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. for the carrying out of their obligations in this matter. I do not think that it will hamper or detract from the legitimate rights of composers but will, on the contrary, ensure that their works are efficiently and perhaps more effectively used by the broadcasting authorities. We have to recognise that what may appear superficially to be a conflict of interests is not really so. There is a community of interest between composers on the one side and the B.B.C. on the other that facilities should be as adequate as possible to enable the B.B.C. to extend its work. This can only be in the interests of composers.<br/>
Because of that, and because of the earlier arguments I put before the House about the Brussels Convention and the recommendations of the Copyright Committee, as well as the fact that we have taken full precautions to prevent any abuse of this facility, I hope the hon. Member for Govan and my hon. Friend

the Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Crouch) will not feel they must press the Amendment.</p>

<p>The Assistant Postmaster-General has advanced arguments which have been in our minds throughout these proceedings. We did not divide in Committee on the question of ephemeral recordings as such. I must now ask the Assistant Postmaster-General, who has raised the question that is implicit in the Amendments in the name of the President of the Board of Trade and of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher), whether he can give an assurance that he will meet the point of the Amendments in the names of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke), my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) and myself, in relation to arbitration. This was also the point of two Amendments which we put forward in Committee. If the hon. Gentleman can give that assurance we shall not divide the House on this Amendment. If he is unable to give it we shall have to ask my hon. and right hon. Friends to go into the Lobby.</p>

<p>With the permission of the House, perhaps I might say that the merits of the Amendment in the name of the hon. Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) and his hon. Friends will be considered later. I can give no undertaking on the matter. I think the hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. E.

<p>The Assistant Postmaster-General appealed to me to withdraw the Amendment which stands in my name and the name of the hon. Member for Dorset, North (Mr. Crouch), who has joined forces with me and my colleagues on this side of the House. Having put his hand to the plough, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will follow us to the bitter end, that is, if the end is to be bitter. There is still time for the Assistant Postmaster-General to recant.<br/>
I do not know whether he sought the advice of the Parliamentary Secretary to


the Board of Trade. I thought there was a little consultation going on. If it is not as helpful as I hoped, I am prepared to carry on saying a few more words to allow Ministers a chance of reconsidering the bitter end to which they are driving their hon. Friend the Member for Dorset. North and one or two other of their colleagues who have been good enough to support the Amendment.<br/>
If I followed the argument of the Assistant Postmaster-General properly, he admits defects in the present set-up. They will be remedied by the deletion of this subsection. He based a good deal of his argument on the Brussels Convention, and at the same time said that no other nation was yet implementing the Brussels Convention, but that we were going to set a lead which others would follow. We have not had many examples</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.702.0" colnum="702" time="">
<p>of followers for the lead that this Government has set in other spheres, and matters do not look very hopeful in this instance. It is not disputed that the subsection will deprive composers of certain rights which they now have and, by virtue of that, will deprive them of a certain amount of their income. The Assistant Postmaster-General has said nothing to show that that will not be the effect if this subsection goes through. I wonder if the two hon. Gentlemen have now had second thoughts on this matter. If not, I hope that we shall divide the House on the Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 8, line 9, at the end to insert:
<q>from a place in the United Kingdom, or in another country to which section two of this Act extends".</q>
Perhaps it might be convenient, Mr. Speaker, to consider, with this Amendment, that in page 8, line 14, at the end to insert "in the United Kingdom", standing in the name of the hon. Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher).<br/>
During the Committee stage, the hon. Member for Islington, East raised the question as to whether there might not be the danger of an abuse of the right to record for broadcasting purposes given under this subsection if it were possible for, say, a record to be made of a broadcast and for that record subsequently to be sent abroad and copied there. As I promised on that occasion, we have gone carefully into the desirability of making an Amendment along the lines which were suggested by the hon. Member. We have come to the conclusion that there was weight in his arguments and that, indeed, we would be going beyond the letter&#x2014;and possibly beyond the spirit&#x2014;of the Brussels Convention by not making such an Amendment as that which we now propose.<br/>
We suggest that, possibly from a purely drafting point of view, the wording of our Amendment is more appropriate than that which the hon. Gentleman has tabled. I say at once that that is merely because we have the advantage of the assistance of Parliamentary draftsmen. In these circumstances I hope that this Amendment will commend itself to the Committee, and that the hon. Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood), who made some rather ungenerous remarks about the failure of the Government to meet points raised by hon. Members on both sides of the House, will now feel that he has no longer substance for that accusation but that we have, wherever we possibly could, met the points put to us from hon. Members on either side.</p>

<p>The Assistant Postmaster-General has said that his Amendment is designed to meet a point with which I dealt in Standing Committee B, and reported in columns 161, 162 and 163, on 28th June, 1956.</p>

<p>That is a long speech.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.706.1" hansard_membership_id="4492" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/29294" speakername="Mr. Fletcher" colnum="706" time="">
<p>It may have been too long but, in his reply, the Assistant Postmaster-General expressed his gratitude to me for explaining so clearly the problem with which I was then attempting to deal. That is the only justification I have for going into it at that length, and it will probably not be necessary to repeat the speech on this occasion.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has also said that he has the benefit, which obviously I have not, of access to Parliamentary draftsmen. I am afraid, however, that I cannot accept his view that his Amendment adequately meets my point, and while I welcome it as far as it goes, I shall, unless I obtain a satisfactory reply from him, still feel it necessary, in addition to accepting his Amendment, to move mine which appears immediately after it on the Order Paper.<br/>
I do not want to enter into this delightful controversy as to how far, if at all, the Government have met the criticisms of this Clause which were made in Committee. I think that the whole House and the country were obviously very impressed by the letter, to which reference has already been made, which appeared in <i>The Times</i> on 16th October, over the distinguished signature of Sir Arthur Bliss and others.<br/>
The fact that the Government have resisted the last Amendment and have insisted on Clause 6 (7) remaining in the Bill makes it all the more necessary that we should look carefully at the safeguards, because the real gravamen of the charge made by Sir Arthur Bliss and others in their letter was that the provisions in the proviso were "valueless." We are, in this Clause, trying to strike a balance between, on the one hand, the business requirements of having a record made of a broadcast so that it can be repeated and, on the other, ensuring for the benefit of composers and others that there is no possibility of abuse creeping in.<br/>
The Assistant Postmaster-General's Amendment would mean that Clause 6 (7) would read as follows:
<q>Where by virtue of an assignment or licence a person is authorised to broadcast a literary, dramatic or musical work, from a place in the United Kingdom, or in another country to which section two of this Act extends but &#x2026; would not be entitled to make reproductions


of it in the form of a record or of a cinematograph film, the copyright in the work is not infringed by his making such a reproduction of the work solely for the purpose of broadcasting the work.</q>
I still think it necessary to make the end of that subsection read, "for the purpose of broadcasting the work in the United Kingdom."<br/>
The two points are quite different. I think the Clause should be limited to broadcasts from the United Kingdom or other territory to which Clause 2 extends, but equally it seems to me necessary that the reproduction from the record should be limited to reproduction in the United Kingdom. There could, otherwise, be this possible result. The record, although authorised for a broadcast in the United Kingdom, may itself be used for reproduction and use outside the United Kingdom. The Assistant Postmaster-General shakes his head, but that, I think, would be the result.<br/>
My object is, first, to limit the permission given by this Clause to broadcasts originating in the United Kingdom, and secondly, to limit the reproduction from the record to reproduction in the United Kingdom. What I think is feared by the composers and the others is that the record might be taken out of the country and there used for some purpose which obviously would not be fair to the composer, and would not be necessary for the protection of the B.B.C. or of the I.T.A. Therefore, before we part with this Amendment&#x2014;to which, I imagine, none of us takes any objection&#x2014;I very much hope that the Assistant Postmaster-General will also see the desirability of accepting the next Amendment in my name, on the Order Paper.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.707.0" hansard_membership_id="9979" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/31547" speakername="Mr. W. Wells" colnum="707" time="">
<p>I understand, Mr. Speaker, that we are discussing both these Amendments at the same time, and it appears to us that, while the Government's intentions here have been virtuous, their execution has not been perfect. My right hon. Friend says that is the opposite to usual, but I am not sure that that is quite correct, either. During the Committee proceedings the Assistant Postmaster-General, referring to the Amendment that then stood in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher) and which now stands in the names of my hon. Friend

the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) and myself, said:
<q>As I understand it, the hon. Member is attempting to remedy what he considers to be a loophole in the Bill. He will correct me if I have got the main problem wrong, but I think that he is putting forward the possibility that a film might be televised and recorded purely for television purposes; that the recording&#x2014;which is almost a retake of the film&#x2014;might then be copied, and the copy sent overseas and used, free of all copyright obligations, for the financial gain of the people concerned. It is certainly against the spirit of the provision which we are now considering that that should happen. If there is such a loophole in the Bill it would be the wish of my right hon. Friend to prevent it."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee B,</i> 28th June, 1956 ; c. 164.]</q>
I think my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, East has demonstrated that the purpose of his Amendment has not been achieved by the Amendment which the Postmaster-General has accepted and has put forward in the name of the President of the Board of Trade. I therefore formally move the Amendment which stands in the name of&#x2014;</p>

<p>I apologise, Mr. Speaker. I give notice that I intend formally to move the Amendment in line 14.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.708.2" hansard_membership_id="518" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11754" speakername="Mr. Alport" colnum="708" time="">
<p>I hope that I can reassure the hon. Member for Islington, East on this matter. It is a point of construction and drafting. Perhaps I should draw his attention to the following fact. If my Amendment is read in conjunction with subsection (7), the subsection will read:
<q>Where by virtue of an assignment or licence a person is authorised to broadcast a literary, dramatic or musical work from a place in the United Kingdom, or in another country to which section two of this Act extends &#x2026;</q>
In that we include the point which the hon. Gentleman has in mind because the assignment or licence is referred to again in paragraph (<i>a</i>), which says:
<q>Provided that this subsection shall not apply if the reproduction is used for making any further reproduction therefrom or for any other purpose except that of broadcasting in accordance with the assignment or licence. &#x2026;</q>
The assignment or licence is a licence to broadcast from a place in the United Kingdom and goes no further than that.


If it is used for any other purpose, then it is an infringement of the licence.<br/>
I hope I have made it clear that by our Amendment we are covering precisely the point which the hon. Gentleman wishes us to cover and intends should be covered in his Amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.709.0" hansard_membership_id="5126" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15503" speakername="Mr. Anthony Greenwood" colnum="709" time="">
<p>I think I detect on the faces of hon. Members opposite&#x2014;and, no doubt, it is present on the faces of my hon. Friends on this side of the House&#x2014;a look of slight bewilderment about the exact effect which this Amendment is going to have.<br/>
We may well be getting into a difficult situation. We had occasion during the Committee stage from time to time to suggest that the Assistant Postmaster-General did not make things as clear as, no doubt, he intended to do. We felt from lime to time the need for having one of the Law Officers of the Crown present to advise us on matters of drafting.<br/>
6.45 p.m.<br/>
The Assistant Postmaster-General has clearly put the Recess to good advantage; he must have been taking a correspondence course on clear exposition, but nevertheless on a matter of this kind, which is one of drafting, it would be a great convenience to the House if for the rest of the consideration of this Bill we had the benefit of the unusual powers of elucidation possessed by the Attorney-General or other Law Officers of the Crown.</p>

<p>The Amendments standing in the name of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke) in page 8, line 27, to add new subsections (8) and (9), and in the name of the hon.

<p>I beg to move, in page 8, line 27, at the end to insert:

<q>(8) Where a reproduction is made solely for the purposes of broadcasting in accordance with the provisions of the last preceding subsection, the owner of the copyright may apply to the Lord Chancellor who shall appoint an arbitrator in accordance with the Arbitration Act, 1950, to determine the remuneration to be paid to the owner in respect of such reproduction.</q>
This Amendment deals very much with the same point as is dealt with in the second part of the Amendment standing in the name of the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke), namely, the question of going to arbitration.<br/>
I felt that the Assistant Postmaster-General, in the remarks he made about the proposal to leave out subsection (7), went a bit too far in what he set out to prove. He was inclined then to dismiss the concern which had been expressed about the working of the subsection as being due to a misunderstanding and he adopted the argument put forward by the hon. and learned Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Philip Bell) that the whole matter could be settled because the terms under which this recording took place would be taken care of in the original licence. That being so, there was no need to hedge this power around with any precautions or protection for the owner of the copyright.<br/>
The Assistant Postmaster-General was inclined to say that we rely on those in charge of the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. as being decent chaps who would always play the game and that, therefore, there was no danger of this power being abused. If that is so, I cannot understand why we need to have the safeguards that are already provided in the subsection. If the whole matter could be covered without any risk of misunderstanding or error or abuse, by means of the original licence, we would not need to have the limit of the 28 days. We would not need to charge the B.B.C. with this duty of solemnly destroying this rather dangerous recording which they have in case it should be used in the wrong way. There would be no point in stipulating that duty if the whole question of the recording could be covered by the original licence.<br/>
In the same way all this complicated and extremely technical argument which has gone on between the Assistant Postmaster-General and my hon. Friend the


Member for Islington East about whether the use of these recordings outside the United Kingdom should be prevented would not be necessary if the whole matter were covered and if there were no danger of the recording being used in the wrong way.<br/>
We have already accepted the principle that we should have subsection (7). I do not want to go back on it but the fact that we agree that the B.B.C. should have the right to make a simultaneous recording of this sort does not of itself deal with the question of what remuneration should be paid for doing it. Provided that the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. have the power to make these recordings I cannot see why there is so much objection on the Government benches to having some provision in the Clause which would make certain that fair remuneration would be paid to the owner of the copyright. I cannot see that it can do any harm. I can see that in some cases it might do a great deal of good and might be a valuable protection to the copyright owner, and I am sure it is the object of everyone to make quite certain that composers, authors and others concerned are paid fairly.<br/>
What this Amendment does is to provide either that there shall be agreement on the amount to be paid, or, in default of agreement, there shall be recourse to arbitration. It seems to me to be a perfectly fair and sensible way of tackling the problem. In most cases, of course, one need hardly doubt that there will be agreement. As the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Bolton, East said, in most cases the original agreement or licence would be comprehensive and would take up all these points ; there would be no argument or friction between the parties.<br/>
In some cases, however, something may go wrong; there may be misunderstanding, a composer may not be very acute in looking forward and anticipating all the possible things which might happen, or it may be that some quite new situation will arise which is not envisaged at the time agreement is first reached. Therefore, it is important to be sure that there is machinery for arriving at a fair measure of what the recompense to the owner of the copyright should be.<br/>
There is a very little danger of this provision being abused ; there is very little danger of it being used as a means of exerting some kind of blackmail on the B.B.C., because, under the Arbitration Act, the arbitrator has power at his own discretion to award the costs of the proceedings. Quite obviously, if an arbitrator were of opinion that the proceedings were unnecessary, the point being already covered and the proceedings, in his view, being used for wrong purposes, that would be something which, with costs in his discretion, he could take into account.<br/>
I do, therefore, suggest that this is a reasonable compromise between the two views, the extreme view that subsection (7) should not be in the Bill at all, and the view which the Government have been taking, namely, allowing a considerable amount of freedom to the B.B.C. and I.T.A. to use these powers just as they will. Here is a reasonable compromise between the two views, whereby we say, "We accept the principle that, as part of the normal mechanics of reproduction, recordings and films of this sort are part of the process and therefore should be allowed, but at the same time we will put something in the Bill to make sure that there is a fair recompense being obtained by the owner of the copyright whose rights are affected." That seems to be an entirely sensible, workable and reasonable thing to do, and, that being so, those arguments ought&#x2014;though I am not at all sure that they always do&#x2014;to present themselves as entirely convincing.</p>

<p>I beg to second the Amendment.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Widnes (Mr. MacColl) has moved his Amendment with his usual persuasiveness and clarity. The House has shown quite clearly this afternoon that it desires to protect the interests of the creative artist, and it is concerned that reduplication of a broadcast should not endanger his fair reward. Indeed, the whole of subsection (7), as my hon. Friend the Member for Widnes has just pointed out, is devised to protect the artist against any such danger.<br/>
Neither the B.B.C. nor the I.T.A. can be accused of not having played fair with artists so far over the question of


what is a second broadcast or a repeat performance, but the difficulty may arise at some time in the future. Indeed, from what has been said this afternoon by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, East (Mr. E. Fletcher), it appears that there may be discussion and debate as to the effect on the artist of a repeat performance in an overseas broadcast. There may at some time be the difficulty of deciding the relative value of the fees given to an artist for the first performance and a repeat performance.<br/>
It is desirable that we should have written into this Bill, in order to deal with those cases, something which may not have to be used very often but something to which the artist might turn as a last resort if he fails to come to terms with these powerful corporations. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I wish to ask a question in connection with this Amendment. I see that a copyright owner who thinks he has been wronged
<q>may apply to the Lord Chancellor who shall appoint an arbitrator".</q>
In the case of a Scottish artist, to whom will he appeal for the appointment of an arbitrator?&#x2014;not to the Lord Chancellor, I presume. What is the proposal about that?</p>

<p>I would not intervene in this debate at this late stage were it not for the fact that there is in my constituency of Twickenham a great musical and literary tradition. We have associations with Alexander Pope, Horace Walpole, Sir John Hawkins, the writer of "A General History of the Science and Practice of Music", and, more recently, Walter de la Mare. I find it not surprising, in a constituency which has the Kneller Hall of Music, the Royal Military School of Music, that a number of composers should live in the neighbourhood, and they have voiced certain fears to me, which have been bruited about in the Press already but to which I think I must on their behalf refer again briefly.<br/>
It is a new principle, I think, brought forward in this Bill that a recording should not be paid for. The fear which has been expressed to me is that the composer has no means in the future of checking whether a recording is or is not

destroyed. Without imputing dishonesty to anybody, it may be that, by carelessness, recordings are kept by the B.B.C. or I.T.A. or any of these other organisations, not being paid for, and used in the future. Composers do feel, rather strongly I think, that the owner of the copyright should be informed if and when a record is destroyed.<br/>
Having heard what they have to say, I repeat that it seemed to me that in this Clause some further protection for the owners of copyright is required.</p>

<p>What puzzles me about the remarks of the hon. Gentleman the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke) is this. Why did he not come into the House and deliver that speech in support of the Amendment which I moved earlier, which he then opposed?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.714.1" hansard_membership_id="518" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/11754" speakername="Mr. Alport" colnum="714" time="">
<p>I have noticed that when the hon. Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) finds any arguments advanced by myself unpalatable, he immediately gets up and accuses me of confusing and misleading the House. While I regret that there should be any deficiency on my part in the clear exposition of what are complicated legal problems, I think it has been hard that he and his hon. and learned Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. W. Wells) should have decided not themselves to move the Amendment which the House is now considering, but should have left it to two of their hon. Friends on the back benches, and should have done so without explaining to them the meaning of the Amendment and the fact that it has no relevance whatever and is incapable of carrying out the purpose for which apparently it is intended.<br/>
By the terms of this Amendment, it is suggested that if a composer or head copyright owner is dissatisfied with the payment which he receives in respect of the reproduction or recording of his work by the B.B.C. or the I.T.A., he should then apply to the Lord Chancellor for the appointment of an arbitrator in order to ensure that his remuneration is correct. But we have made it clear that the whole purpose of the preceding subsection is to say that no separate fee should be paid. What, therefore, is the purpose of deciding to appoint an arbitrator to decide between two fees, when in fact the whole purpose of the previous provision is to


ensure that there should be one fee and one fee only?<br/>
7.0 p.m.<br/>
In these circumstances, I hope that the hon. Gentleman and his hon. and learned Friend will not press the Amendment, because not only does it not make sense in the context, but, in fact, it would not accomplish the object which they have in mind. Let me, as we shall shortly be departing from this Clause, say that we are just as concerned as my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham and his friends in safeguarding the proper and legitimate rights of composers in this matter; but, in this particular relationship, we must also consider the interests of what is for them a very lucrative field of employment, namely, the legitimate interests of the broadcasting authorities concerned.</p>

<p>I cannot resist the challenge of the Assistant Postmaster-General, and, in any event, I had intended to make a few remarks on hearing what the hon. Gentleman had to say in reply to the speeches from both sides of the House on the Amendment.<br/>
I do not argue for a moment that there are not technical defects in the way in which this Amendment is drafted. They are technical defects which, even at this stage of the Bill, the procedure of the House is quite adequate to rectify. The Parliamentary Secretary need not look so dubious. There are many ways in which a correction can be made, even at this late stage. There is the possibility of recommital, and it has even been known, I understand, for a comparatively minor Amendment of this sort, although it is, I believe, very unusual, to be embodied in the Third Reading of a Bill, and there are other possibilities. So it is really not quite fair for the Assistant Postmaster-General to say that the Amendment has no relation to what precedes it.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.716.0" colnum="716" time="">
<p>It is perfectly clear that the intention of the Amendment is to provide that where there is a case, such as that instanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Itchen (Dr. King), in which, in the light of all the circumstances, the fee paid for a repeat performance is found to be inadequate and unfair, the matter may be reopened in some way. It is precisely to meet that contingency that the Amendment is framed.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.716.1" colnum="716" time="">
<p>I am sorry that I am unable to answer the very pertinent question of the hon. and gallant Gentleman the Member for Perth and East Perthshire (Colonel Sir A. Gomme-Duncan). There again, that matter could be rectified. Whether it is the Lord President of the Court of Session or the Scottish Law Officer who is the requisite authority, I know not, but certainly the resources of the Government are equal to determining who is the right person in Scottish law to appoint an arbitrator to deal with a problem of this kind.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.716.2" colnum="716" time="">
<p>The point is quite a simple and short one. It is simply a matter of whether we are to introduce a safeguard into the very wide power that is given to the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. under the Clause as it stands. We have had support from both sides of the House for the view that safeguards should be written in. For that reason, and without any reference to the particular drafting drawbacks and defects that there may be in the Amendment, I shall now ask my right hon. and hon. Friends to vote for it, and I hope that hon. Members opposite who have paid vocal service to the principle of introducing safeguards into the Bill will now show that their words will be equalled by their acts.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.719.2" hansard_membership_id="10123" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21833" speakername="Mr. Walker-Smith" colnum="719" time="">
<p>I beg to move, in page 9, line 29, to leave out from the second "the" to the end of line 31 and insert:
<q>librarian knows the name and address of a person entitled to authorise the making of the copy, or could by reasonable inquiry ascertain the name and address of such a person.</q>
It might be convenient if we also considered the Amendment in page 10, line 1, to leave out from beginning to "and" in line 4 and insert:
<q>(<i>b</i>) at the time when the copy is made, the librarian by or on whose behalf it is supplied does not know the name and address of any person entitled to authorise the making of the copy, and could not by reasonable inquiry ascertain the name and address of such a person.</q>
These Amendments are designed to improve the effect of Clause 7, and they arise out of discussions which we had on the Clause in Committee. The general effect of Clause 7 is to make new provision to meet the position of librarians. It is occasioned by the demand for copies arising out of modern techniques of microfilming and the like. Clause 7 (2) defines the kind of libraries which may be empowered by Board of Trade regulations to supply copies and also defines the conditions on which they may do so.<br/>
Subsection (3) deals with the copying by the library staff of part of a literary, dramatic or musical work which is not an article in a periodical. Subsection (3) is intended to provide protection for the

librarian who copies for students. Under subsection (3) procedure, the conditions in subsection (2) prescribed by the regulations apply, but the proviso is also material, and under the proviso the librarian must satisfy himself that the identity of the copyright owner is not known and cannot be ascertained by reasonable inquiry.<br/>
We had some discussion in Committee as to whether that was a very happy condition. The hon. Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) there proposed that the librarian should be entitled to copy so long as he does not know not only the identity of the copyright owner but also his address. The hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, South (Mrs. L. Jeger) dissented from that proposition. I was anxious, as I always am, to reconcile the differences of the Opposition, and consequently I suggested that this principle should obtain&#x2014;that applications to copy should not be indefinitely held up if, although the identity of the author is known, there is no practicability of communication.<br/>
7.15 p.m.<br/>
I gave an undertaking to consider the matter in the light of that, and these Amendments give effect to that undertaking. The first Amendment relates to the copying of part of the book and the second relates to the copying of the whole book by one librarian for the purpose of another librarian within the statutory description. The effect is that the librarian will have cover in copying


unless he knows the name and address or unless he could by reasonable inquiry ascertain the same. The phrase
<q>&#x2026; a person entitled to authorise the making of the copy &#x2026;</q>
may appear to be a little cumbrous but it is deliberately used in preference to "author" or "copyright owner" so as to provide for the exclusive licensee.<br/>
The practical effect of the Amendment will be that the librarian will, in any event, know the name of the author and know presumably the address of the publisher of the edition in the library. Inquiry from both these sources should ascertain who can authorise the copying. If, however, after a reasonable inquiry, he is unable to trace anyone who could give permission he will, under the Amendment, be free to make a copy. I think that that meets the general concensus of view in Committee as to what would be appropriate, and I hope that it commends itself to the House.</p>

<p>There have been very few occasions in the course of our discussions when I have had the pleasure of being able to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for what he has done. In the course of debates in Committee I put forward and spoke on a number of Amendments based upon a memorandum supplied by the Standing Conference of National University Libraries, the Association of Special Libraries and the Library Association. On that occasion the Parliamentary Secretary made a number of pertinent observations on the proposals in my Amendments, the reasons for which I saw, and I therefore did not press the Amendments to a Division.<br/>
I am most grateful to the Parliamentary Secretary for the consideration which he has given to this matter between the Committee stage and today, and I hope that the House will accept the Amendment which he has tabled.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 11, line 10, after "public", to insert "or makes a record of it".<br/>
I have said that the previous two Amendments which I moved were a result of discussion introduced in the Committee upstairs by hon. Gentlemen opposite. This Amendment is designed to make an improvement in the Bill which was suggested to me by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Philip Bell), who has taken such a close and informed interest in this Bill. I am indeed grateful to him. It is to provide that when, after an unsuccessful attempt to find the copyright owner by an advertisement, an old, hitherto unpublished work has been published, it may be broadcast, relayed and performed in public.<br/>
This Amendment will permit, in addition, the making of records of the work in such circumstances. Of course the concession will apply mainly in the realm of music. I think it may be of some value, and it will be of some benefit to the British Broadcasting Corporation since, as the subsection already permits broadcasting, it is not unlikely that the broadcasting authorities may wish to make recordings for broadcasting purposes.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 11, line 36, to leave out subsection (1).<br/>
Thank you, Sir, for calling my Amendment. I agree, of course, that the other Amendments on the Amendment Paper standing in the name of myself and my hon. Friends are consequential.<br/>
As I understand the position, it has been the law since 1911 that once a company has made a record of a composer's work, any other company may also claim the right of making a similar record of the same work. What I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to explain to us when he winds up this debate is why should a composer have to give an automatic right to anyone to make a record of his work.<br/>
The position is rather different from that of 1911 when there were perhaps only a few reputable gramophone companies making records. Nowadays all sorts of people are using tapes and tape recordings, and the entire process of reproduction is very much easier and therefore rather different from what it was thirty or forty years ago. So I should like to know the answer to this question put to me by writers of songs and music: Why should they allow any Tom, Dick or Harry to make perhaps an unsatisfactory recording of a composer's work? It may be that the person claiming the right to make a record is in an unsatisfactory financial position from which the composer cannot perhaps get his royalties. Therefore, why should a composer be tied to such a person?<br/>
I have not heard it first-hand, but I am told there is a case, which the Board of Trade knows about, where a recording company purchased a nominal number of stamps and then proceeded to make a much larger number of records than was warranted by the number of stamps bought. Then they sold the records through the post to the public, and so there was no check on the composer's royalty, who, of course, was not paid the full amount of money to which he was entitled. That is the kind of thing which I am told is happening in practice. It is not just imaginary.<br/>
In France I believe there is no automatic right of reproduction of composers' works, and it does not seem to me that there is any difficulty there. Nor has it led to composers restricting the reproduction of their works or the setting up of any form of monopoly in reproduction.<br/>
I was not present during the Committee stage of this Bill, so I should like to hear the reasons why composers are expected to go on for all time&#x2014;because it will be for a long time after the passing of this Bill&#x2014;giving an automatic right of reproduction to any company that claims it.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House are not in love with the principle of the compulsory licence, and we well understand that this question arouses strong feelings on the part of those representing copyright owners. It also arouses strong feelings on the part of performers and those interested in performing rights. I think that the hon. Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke) has made some forceful points in connection with the practice in France and, in particular, about the change in the conditions in the gramophone industry of this country since this principle was first introduced in the Copyright Act, 1911.<br/>
Nevertheless, it would be wrong to ignore the serious consideration that has been given to his question, both during the Committee stage of this Bill and in the long and authoritative proceedings of the Copyright Committee. I would draw the attention of the House to the paragraphs in the Report of the Copyright Committee dealing with this question. They are to be found on page 31. Paragraph 80 reads:
<q>In order to understand how the present situation has arisen, it is necessary to refer to Article 13 of the Berlin Convention, 1908, which for the first time gave to authors the right to authorise the mechanical reproduction of their works. This Article was considered by the Copyright Committee of 1909, which recommended that the right should be recognised in our law. At the same time the Committee accepted the representations made by the gramophone companies that they themselves were entitled to copyright, which the Committee recommended should be restricted to a right to prevent the copying or pirating of a record so produced. Representations were made to the Copyright Committee on behalf of the gramophone companies that once a manufacturer had been licensed by the copyright owner to make records, any manufacturer who chose might thereafter also demand a licence from the copyright owner on payment of appropriate fees. The Committee did not agree with the representations made by the record manufacturers, and recommended that the author's right to authorise reproduction by mechanical means should remain his without qualification. Nevertheless, Subsection (2) of


Section 19 does provide that once 'contrivances' (e.g. records) have previously been made by or with the consent or acquiescence of the owner of the copyright in the work being produced, and subject both to compliance with certain formalities and to the payment of a prescribed royalty, any manufacturer may thereafter make records of that work.</q>
7.30 p.m.<br/>
Paragraph 81 says this:
<q>In view of the fact that this provision has been the law of the land for forty years, during which time interests have grown up, we do not feel that a sufficiently strong case has been made out for making a fundamental change now in the right given to the gramophone companies to prevent the copying or pirating of records made by them, or for altering substantially the conditions under which recordings subsequent to that first authorised by the composer may be made. We think that no one will question the justice of preventing trade competitors from copying a record made by a gramophone company. Our second recommendation, namely, that the right of the gramophone companies to record copyright material which the composer has already authorised for recording shall continue, may be more open to question, but the principle was clearly enunciated by the Legislature in the Copyright Act of 1911, and we see no sufficient grounds for recommending any substantial change in a practice which has a history of 40 years behind it.</q>
Therefore, I think it is pertinent to make two observations. First, that the right of the owner of the copyright to make any charge in respect of a recording is a creature of statute, and, second, that after all, although there may be changes in the conditions in the gramophone industry now, as compared with 1911, I do not think&#x2014;and I do not think it has been argued&#x2014;that these changes have come into being since 1951, which was the year of the Copyright Committee Report. It follows, therefore, that this very authoritative Committee, going into the matter in great detail in 1951, and being fully aware, as I think the two paragraphs which I have read show, of the various difficulties involved in the problem, nevertheless on the whole came down on the side of leaving the compulsory licence principle inscribed in our legislation dealing with copyright.<br/>
It is, I suppose, a good Conservative principle, though I cannot pretend to be an authority on good Conservative principles, not to interfere with the structure of an industry unless an overwhelmingly strong case, or at any rate a very clear case, has been presented that the present structure involves abuses. [HON. MEM-

BERS:"Hear, hear."] Unfortunately, the Government is a Conservative one, and the majority of the House of Commons is a Conservative one, and, therefore, if one's views are to be carried into law, one has to carry the Conservative majority with one, unless one can ensure that they are not there at the appointed time, which is sometimes difficult, owing to the vigilance of the Patronage Secretary.<br/>
Therefore, it is clear that while this is a matter of great difficulty and one on which, standing here in 1956, one might wish that different views had been taken in 1911 and that there had been more pre-vision of what might happen afterwards, nevertheless, forty-five years have gone by and the structure of the industry has been built up. We feel that a very great responsibility would rest on those who, in view of the evidence adduced before the Copyright Committee, and in view of the obvious fact that the industry has grown up around the rights established in the 1911 Act, wished to alter it without the clearest evidence that that alteration was necessary.<br/>
That was the line which we took in Committee, and it is the line that we take now, but, in Committee and again now, having as almost the forefront of our object in relation to this Bill the improvement of the conditions of creative artists and the increasing of the incentives, such as they are, to those who are gifted in musical and other artistic directions to use these talents, we are most anxious to write into the Bill such safeguards as we can to make sure that the artistic heritage of this country is not diminished, but is enhanced, strengthened and nourished as a result of the labours of the House on this Bill.<br/>
It was for that reason that, amongst other Amendments which we put down in Committee, was one by which we sought to exclude the operation of the Clause in respect of certain classes of records ; that is, the classes of record whose playing time exceeds four minutes. The hon. and learned Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Philip Bell), with his usual perspicacity, pointed out that a gramophone record generally has two sides. It is wonderful what experience of life a lifetime of service at the Chancery Bar will give, and we were certainly grateful to the hon. and


learned Gentleman for giving us that information, which, in some peculiar way, seems to have escaped our notice. Therefore, in order to meet that very pertinent criticism which the hon. and learned Gentleman made of our efforts upstairs, we are now seeking to write into the Bill, by our Amendment in page 12, line 12, the words
<q>Provided that this subsection shall not apply to a record of a work or works if the playing time of the record exceeds eight minutes.</q>
The hon. and learned Member for Bolton, East also pointed out, and it may well be the truth&#x2014;in fact, clearly, in some examples, it is the truth&#x2014;that the main object, as we have put it forward, of the Amendment which we have proposed in Committee was to ensure that compulsory licence should not apply to works of classical music, but should only apply to works of purely ephemeral value, such as jazz and "rock and roll" and all those other musical variations which cause a certain amount of excitement and disturbance in various quarters.<br/>
The hon. and learned Gentleman pointed out that there were long-playing records of jazz as well as of classical music. That may as a proposition be true, but it is perfectly clear, I should have thought, within the experience of all who listen to music, that the great majority of long-playing records are of rather good and serious music. Long-playing records, I believe, are much more costly to produce and they are certainly much more expensive to buy. Therefore, people who spend their money on these long-playing records will probably want to enjoy their use for a long period, and on the whole people who want to hear the same music very often, tend to want to hear good music.<br/>
Therefore, I believe, as I believed when we argued this matter upstairs, that in substance our object of removing the classical music from the scope of the Clause would be achieved by a rather simple form of words such us we have now put forward. We shall put forward at least one more set of Amendments related to this provision of the compulsory licence, but I hope that on reflection the Government, having heard the expressions of opinion on both sides of the House about the compulsory licence, will feel able to accept the Amendment which we are now putting forward in relation

to the length of the playing time. I shall move that formally. If the hon. and learned Gentleman or the President of the Board of Trade do not indicate their ability to accept that Amendment we shall in due course press it to a Division.</p>

<p>The hon. and learned Member for Walsall, North (Mr. W. Wells) referred to the views expressed by both sides on this point. I listened with the care with which I always listen to the observations of my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke) and my hon. Friend the Member for Wembley, South (Mr. Russell), and it will be within the recollection of the House that they moved their Amendment in what I might call an interrogatory or exploratory vein. They said, very properly, that they had received representations in regard to this matter, and they were anxious to know what we had to say about it from this Box.<br/>
I should perhaps start by making this observation about the Amendment moved by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham. In the course of the Committee stage upstairs, as the hon. and learned Member for Walsall, North will confirm, I was careful to say that I was certainly not taking any drafting points on this difficult and complex Measure; but the series of Amendments which are being moved by my hon. Friend do not, in fact, make a very cohesive or satisfactory pattern. That becomes a little more important the nearer we get to the end of the proceedings on a Bill.<br/>
The operative provision in all this mass of Amendments which are being taken together in the names of my hon. Friends is the omission of subsection (1) of the Clause. That would eliminate the licence of right altogether. The anomaly which would be left, however, is that the Amendments, having done away with the licence of right, would nevertheless retain a statutory rate of royalty and apply it to the first as well as to subsequent recordings. It is, of course, a novel concept that a statutory royalty is required in anything other than the licence of right procedure. The pattern of the Amendments in the names of my hon. Friends is not, therefore, very satisfactory, quite apart from the reasons which I propose to give why the case for the elimination of the licence of right is not well-founded.<br/>
7.45 p.m.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham asked why there should be a licence of right procedure to which composers are subject. The first and short answer is that there has never been anything else. Before the Berlin Convention of 1908, composers had no right either to authorise or to prevent the recording of their works. That was their position before 1908. They were unable, in any way, to control the recording of their works. It was only following upon the deliberations of that Convention that our Copyright Act of 1911 gave, for the first time, what we call mechanical rights to the composer.<br/>
Therefore, the point I should like to urge upon my hon. Friends in that context is this. It is only under a licence of right system such as prevails today that composers have ever been entitled to receive earnings from the recording of their works. That system, as the hon. and learned Member has reminded the House, has now been in force for 45 years, and some degree of prescription must, I think, attach to anything which has been in force for so long.<br/>
We perhaps differ on the two sides of the House as to the degree of authority that we would give to such a prescription, but nobody, I think, with the possible exception of the hon. Member for Edge Hill (Mr. A. J. Irvine), who likes to be <i>sui generis</i> in these matters, is likely to dissent altogether from that proposition.</p>

<p>I am coming to that. Perhaps I might finish this point first.<br/>
The Copyright Committee, which investigated this matter with great authority and to which the hon. and learned Gentleman has been good enough to refer, came to the conclusion at paragraph 81 of its Report that it saw
<q>no sufficient grounds for recommending any substantial change in a practice which has a history of 40 years behind it.</q>
The hon. and learned Gentleman gave a good definition of what should be a sound Conservative approach to these matters. It was put more tersely and, perhaps, happily by Lord Falkland when he said

that when it is not necessary to change it is necessary not to change. There is certainly no case made here for varying the practice of 45 years.<br/>
To deal with the point made by the hon. Member for Edge Hill about the advantages of the system, I would think they are these. First, the advantage to the public is that it gets free competition between record manufacturers in respect of copyright music. For the composers, they have the protection, in the licence of right procedure, of royalty rates fixed by a statutory procedure after the holding of a public inquiry.<br/>
They will get the further advantage beyond what they have had under the Copyright Act, 1911, that the rates, as hon. Members will know, can be fixed in relation to any one or more classes of records, and all this will enable a differentiation to be made in respect of long playing records which very properly exercise the minds of hon. Members.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham and other hon. Members adverted to the suggested disadvantages of this procedure, basically the disadvantage that may arise in respect of the reputation of the higher calibre composers. However, although I have no doubt that the apprehensions are sincerely felt, in practice they are exaggerated. The House will have in mind that the market for this type of music, the better and more serious type of music, is to some extent a specialist, limited and discriminating market, and on that market bad recording clearly will not sell.<br/>
Moreover, companies which are interested in serious music are no less jealous of their reputation as high-class commercial companies than composers are jealous of their reputation as high-class artists. Again, serious music is difficult to record without the co-operation of the music publisher, because it is normally necessary to hire orchestral parts ; and so control can be exercised by the music publisher, even under the license of right procedure, and nobody has so far suggested that the music publisher would be any less jealous of his reputation and efficiency in these matters than the composer. Therefore, in the vast majority of cases with which we are primarily concerned, with serious, higher-class music, the interests of the recording company,


composer and publisher are happily identical.<br/>
Another issue raised by my hon. Friend and the Performing Right Society, the growth of recording companies, some of which are thought to be not of high standing, is covered by the considerations to which I have just referred ; but I should like the House also to have in mind that these companies are companies which are ignoring their statutory obligations under the licence of right procedure. In doing that they are, of course, infringers, and being infringers under this law, they would be infringers, if they had the opportunity, under any other law. No system of law, however perfect, can provide against the person who is desirous of evading it. If one is negligent or evasive of one's obligation to pay a royalty fixed by statute, one is equally so if one negotiates a royalty by free agreement.<br/>
As we are discussing these Amendments together and as the hon. and learned Member for Walsall, North has given notice of certain action he proposes to take with his Amendment, I should like to address myself to the proposition put forward in the hon. and learned Member's Amendment. His attitude is that he agrees that the licence of right procedure should be retained, but he wishes to confine it to records not exceeding eight minutes playing time, four minutes on each side.<br/>
I need not remind the House what a very difficult thing it is in practice to draw an appropriate line of demarcation. It is not for want of trying. We have had a shot at it not only in this House, but in another place where this Bill started. It has occupied a good deal of time and ingenuity, but it has not proved possible to establish an appropriate line of demarcation. The original concept was to do what hon. Members might think appropriate in a general sense, to draw the line between serious and other music.<br/>
It is generally agreed, and it is not otherwise suggested in the hon. and learned Member's Amendment, that such a line of demarcation is impracticable to draw. What is put forward in his Amendment is an alternative designed as a rough approximation to such a line of demarcation. His line of demarcation

would not operate satisfactorily, because, as he will recall I said in Committee upstairs, a good deal of serious music takes less than four minutes and certainly less than eight minutes to perform and, conversely, many jazz records and the like last more than four minutes. I understand that some called "long players" actually last half-an-hour and some, like these "rock and rollers," no doubt sound as though they last for eternity. That being so, although the hon. and learned Member's intentions are good, he has failed&#x2014;and that is no criticism, because everybody has failed all along the line&#x2014;to establish this line of demarcation.<br/>
Perhaps I might be allowed to recall what <i>The Times</i> said in its leader on this point this morning. It says:
<q>But it is certainly beyond the wit even of a Parliamentary draftsman"&#x2014;</q>
and we have had the advantage of the most experienced and excellent Parliamentary draftsmen in this Bill&#x2014;
<q>to differentiate in an Act between musical compositions according to their quality ; and with the present speed of technical change it would not be satisfactory to make the distinction by reference to the type of recording.</q>
That of course is the second thing which the hon. and learned Member's Amendment proposes to do.<br/>
As <i>The Times</i> says, and I will endorse, it is the fact that no differentiation is practicable. We are faced with the choice between keeping the licence of right procedure for all records and dropping it altogether, because there is no difference in principle between one long playing record and six or a dozen playing for a shorter time. One of the reasons we must, if that be the choice, come down on the side of keeping the licence of right procedure is that it is in essence a move against monopoly practices. It is not appropriate to go back on that in the present political and economic climate. The <i>Economist</i> has described this as one of the anti-monopoly Clauses of the Bill. Having cited <i>The Times</i> in my favour, I must in all honesty tell the House that <i>The Times</i> also says :
<q>The fear of monopoly is rather farfetched.</q>
When there is this war on Olympus, mere mortals should play for safety and adhere to the anti-monopoly position which we have had for 45 years.<br/>
What is certain is that this Measure was conceived and designed as an anti-monopoly Measure in 1911. Clearly we cannot afford to be more tender to monopoly in the sharp competitive conditions of 1956 than were our predecessors who were still wrapped in the natural protection of generations of industrial and mercantile hegemony.<br/>
Faced with that clear choice, I hope that the House will think it right to keep the licence of right procedure. I hope that my hon. Friend is satisfied with the explanations which I have sought to give him and that he will not press his Amendment and that the hon. and learned Member will not press his, or, in that event, that the House will reject it.</p>

<p>I am sorry to speak after my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, but he will perhaps forgive me for doing so if I assure him that at least I rose before him. I have the misfortune to differ from him on this matter, and I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Mr. Gresham Cooke). I cannot understand the approach to this matter embodied in the Bill. It seems to me to be an ordinary, simple question of the duty of society to protect a man in the possession and enjoyment of his property, whether it be cabbages or artistic copyright. The man has created something. It is his. It is entirely his business what he does with it, and it is the duty of society to protect him in the possession and enjoyment of that property.<br/>
If a man writes a musical work, he is entitled to keep it to himself completely and not publish it at all; he is entitled to publish it to a few people, but not to others, or he is entitled to publish it broadcast. In any of those decisions he is entitled to the support and protection of organised society. If we start with that idea or on that basis, these other considerations of a more complicated kind of public interest never enter into the matter at all. The fact that for forty years society has executed that duty imperfectly, and before that it did not execute it at all in many cases, is really no excuse in 1956 for not improving the law and doing what it is our plain duty to do.<br/>
The argument for monopoly completely puzzles me. I have always assumed that the purpose of patent and copyright law was to create a legal monopoly in favour of the author or creator. He having brought the industrial property or the artistic property into existence is entitled to, and is given, a monopoly in its exploitation. Surely, therefore, it is contradictory to describe a Copyright Bill as in any sense an anti-monopoly Measure. Why should not a composer say, "I have composed this song or symphony. I am willing that a certain gramophone company should make records of it and sell them, but I am not willing that any other gramophone company, on any terms whatever, should make those records and sell them."? I do not think that questions like the reputation of the composer or the technical competence of the gramophone record maker enter into this in any way, except as explanatory of the motive which might be in the mind of the composer.<br/>
Of course, I agree with what was said by my hon. and learned Friend that to leave in the Stamp Duty is a little unfortunate, if we are proposing to omit subsection (1). Yet if we allow a licence of right to every other gramophone record maker on the statutory terms, are we not in fact imposing the statutory terms also on the first maker of the record? After all, why should he ever agree to give more than the statutory payment, if he knows that from the day he sells the first record, all his competitors can come in under the licence of right and make records of the same work for the statutory price? Quite obviously we are, in practice, in fact limiting the composer to the amount of the statutory stamp. For that reason also I say that the licence of right procedure is bad, as it presupposes the fixed statutory right of duty and that is bound to limit what the composer gets from the first record.<br/>
The only argument I have heard against this at all is that this has been done for forty years. After all, the Berlin Convention, on which this law was based, recommended there should be no licence of right. One does not know why the Legislature in 1911 ignored that advice and introduced this peculiar doctrine. All we know is that it has continued for forty years, and, therefore, it is suggested that


we should not change it. On that argument, I assume that if we have another Copyright Bill forty years from now, it will then be said that this has persisted for eighty years and therefore it is unthinkable that it should be altered. That is not an argument which has any influence with me, and I hope that my hon. and learned Friend, even at this late period of the Session, when the legislative complications are only too obvious, will at least reconsider this, to see whether the Amendment of my hon. Friend cannot be accepted.</p>

<p>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to realise that there is considerable disquiet on this point among hon. Members on both sides of the House. It is true that through the processes of history this licence of right has been established for forty-five years, but when that legislation was drawn up, the practice of recording sound, and so on, was far less widespread than today, and no one could be expected to foresee its ramifications. I cannot think that the arguments put forward by the Parliamentary Secretary on the merits of the history of the case were really adequate.<br/>
What moves me to reinforce what has been said by hon. Members on both sides of the House is that, clearly, the composers themselves are not happy. They made representations earlier in the year on this matter, and since then they have had the advantage of studying all the arguments put forward by, among others, the Parliamentary Secretary himself during the Committee discussion; and they have not been convinced. After all, they are the persons whose work we are considering. It is their "children" with which we are concerned. Plainly, they are not satisfied with the treatment they obtain at present.<br/>
I agree that we may have to strike some balance of convenience in this matter; that it would be very disrupting to go all the way and try to expunge the whole principle. But surely, some kind of compromise on this&#x2014;a matter which is disturbing so many of us&#x2014;is not unreasonable? Therefore I support the Amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) and my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Walsall, North (Mr. W. Wells), although I agree with what the Parliamentary Secretary has said, that it

is by no means a perfect method of distinguishing between one type of work and another. I also agree that it is impossible to find a perfect Amendment, but nevertheless, this seems to me a not unreasonable way of distinguishing between the more serious and the less serious work to this extent that the composers themselves are clearly of the opinion that these longer playing records, so far as they are concerned, would cover the works about which they are most keenly anxious.<br/>
I know quite well that it would also include a number of other lighter things. But the point is that we are including the longer works, concertos and symphonies and so on, the ones about which the composers are most concerned, rather than their shorter pieces. Therefore this is not an unreasonable compromise in a situation in which it is perfectly clear that no perfect compromise can be arrived at.<br/>
<i>The Times</i> this morning, in a leading article which has already been quoted by the Parliamentary Secretary, suggested that because of mechanical invention and improvement, any distinction based on, say, the time taken to play a record, or something of that sort, might become out-of-date. If that is considered an objection, there is still time to recommit the Bill and put in something by Order&#x2014;we are proposing to do something by Order a little later&#x2014;if we want a greater degree of flexibility. I think that disposes of <i>The Times</i> argument.<br/>
It would be a great pity if we passed this Clause as it now stands without making any effort to meet the serious objections which have been raised. We have to recognise that we cannot turn the clock right back. Those of us who support the Amendment are not asking for that. But let us at least do something to meet what seems to be the serious and deep-felt opinion of our most distinguished composers. The names in the published list I think include all the most illustrous names in British music.</p>

<p>Let us see whether the arguments put forward in favour of the Amendment are adequate. We are told that composers are not very happy, and that is a depressing thought. Do composers really think that if they were restricted to one gramophone company for the publication of their work they


would make more money? On the other hand, some people seem to think that if something is altered it must be bad. What basis have they for thinking that if composers restrict their work, particularly a long-playing work, to one company it will be bad for the composers?</p>

<p>There is no suggestion that publication should be restricted to one company, but that the composers themselves might have some control over the quality of the reproduction of their work, which at present they have not.</p>

<p>I am talking about the licence. The idea is a speculative one whether under a system by which one gramophone record company only reproduces their work they would benefit.<br/>
I am torn between two conservatives, the party opposite on the one hand, and my hon. Friend and namesake supporting this Amendment on the other, who wants, not a lifelong copyright, but one for ever and ever. There may be a theological reason for that view. If there is private property, it should not be taken away. Hon. Gentlemen opposite say, "No" and that after a period of about forty-five years when the absolute right has been cut down, we should accept the cut.<br/>
The truth of the matter is that copyright property is a difficult thing. It is something which the world feels must be shared, whether it is in a poem or a piece of music. In respect of this type of property the State must hold the balance between the author, the publishing company, and the public. If there is no compulsory licence system it tends to take</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.738.0" colnum="738" time="">
<p>reproductions of works off the market. To limit the right of reproduction under compulsory licence to small records will mean that the trade will make no small records at all : people who cannot afford large records will not be able to get any records. It will be possible, by using this procedure, to prevent poorer persons from getting either small or long-playing records. Everything will be put upon long-playing records, so that there can be a monopoly, and there will be neither variety nor competition. Hon. Gentlemen opposite often proudly assert their interest in the lower income groups. They therefore should not support the Amendment.</p>

<p>The debate has revealed a measure of disquiet on the question of composers' fees but I was impressed by what the Parliamentary Secretary said about my Amendment and the difficulty of taking away the licence of right and the statutory fee. I was impressed by some of his arguments for maintaining the licence of right and although some feeling has been expressed against it, I beg to ask leave to withdraw my Amendment, in view of what he said.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 12, line 25, to leave out "Board of Trade" and insert "owner of the copyright".<br/>
This Amendment in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale (Mr. Anthony Greenwood) and myself is yet another attempt on our part to improve the machinery of Clause 8 and to introduce further safeguards in the interests of composers and those associated with composers in these activities. This Amendment and the following Amendment proposed in line 30, to leave out from "records" to the end of line 45 and insert:
<q>the owner of the copyright or any organisation representative of owners of copyright may apply to the Lord Chancellor who shall appoint an arbitrator pursuant to the Arbitration Act, 1950, to determine the rate or amount of royalty to be paid either generally or in relation to any one or more classes of records</q>
are designed to have the broad effect of substituting for the existing, rather cumbrous machinery of the Bill the short and simple remedy of allowing an author to go to arbitration if he feels himself aggrieved by the fees being fixed under the Clause being inadequate.<br/>
The Clause as it stands provides in subsection (3) that
<q>If after the end of the &#x2026; year beginning with the coming into operation of this section it appears to the Board of Trade that the"&#x2014;</q>
prescribed rate of fees which are fixed by Clause 8 (2) are inadequate&#x2014;
<q>either generally or in relation to a particular class of records the Board may hold a public inquiry.</q>
The object of the Amendment is to substitute for the Board of Trade the owner

of the copyright and to substitute for the procedure of the public inquiry the procedure of an arbitration.<br/>
There are two fundamental arguments in favour of the Amendments which we propose. The first is the very simple argument of equity that as we are interfering in this Clause with the rights of the composer it is really not a very just solution to leave it to a Government Department to decide whether, that interference having taken place, it is operating in an inequitable or unsatisfactory manner. The person who suffers the injustice is the owner of the copyright, not the Board of Trade, and it is in the hands of the owner of the copyright that, in our view, the remedy ought to rest.<br/>
That is the argument of simple equity, but there is also an argument of a machinery kind against the procedure established by the Bill as it stands and in favour of the procedure we suggest, namely, a resort to arbitration. If the Bill remained as now drafted the Board would hold its public inquiry, and after the inquiry it would come to its conclusion on the matter reported to it as a result of the inquiry. Finally there would be yet a third stage before any change would take place&#x2014;any increase over the minimum rates fixed by subsection (2) of the Clause ; this House would have to intervene and an order would have to be made under this subsection.<br/>
8.30 p.m.<br/>
When we come, as we do here, to the question of the livelihood of authors, and whether a just kind of bargain is being reached in relation to records involving the use of the copyright of an author for the profit of the makers of the record,


to have this complicated procedure of a public inquiry, no doubt a thorough examination of the results of that inquiry in the Board of Trade, and finally the matter having to come to be decided by a Resolution of this House, that, in our view, is such a cumbrous procedure as, in itself, to defeat the ends of justice.<br/>
In our view, the case for an Amendment of this kind is an overwhelming one, and we hope that the Government will feel able to accept it. But in any event we feel that the principles of justice so plainly demand in this Clause an alteration of this character that we shall feel bound, if the Parliamentary Secretary is not able to meet us, to press the matter to a Division.</p>

<p>The Amendment which the hon. and learned Member for Walsall, North (Mr. W. Wells) has just moved seeks to replace the Board of Trade inquiry, and the consequential fixing of royalty rates after an affirmative Resolution of Parliament, by some arbitration proceedings. That is a principle, I may say, with which I have considerable instinctive sympathy, but I should, perhaps, just indicate certain defects in the formulation of the Amendment. I think this matters, because if Parliament were to give effect to this Amendment at this late stage, then, as I said on the previous Amendment, the nearer one gets to the end of the Bill the more important do these things become. I think I may say that in Standing Committee I was careful not to make merely drafting points on this complicated Measure. Nevertheless, for the sake of clarity I think that I should indicate what these defects are.<br/>
In the first place, the Amendment provides for applications for arbitration only by the copyright owner. It does not make provision for the time for which the determination would be valid. It makes no provision to prevent an overlap between different references to arbitration. Finally, line 28, in page 12 presupposes "an order under this subsection" but if, in point of fact, the amended subsection were given effect to there would not be an order at all. I mention those points because they would, of course, mean that the Amendment would not be very satisfactory, even if the principle were acceptable.<br/>
As I indicated a moment or two ago, I certainly feel a good deal of sympathy with the purpose of this Amendment, and I should be very happy indeed to be able conscientiously to relieve the Board of Trade of what is a burdensome, and normally, I would think, an invidious task. As the House will appreciate, that Department already has a good deal to do. Unfortunately, after giving a good deal of consideration to this matter, we have reluctantly come to the conclusion that it is not practical&#x2014;and it would not be strictly constitutional&#x2014;to take the course so persuasively commended by the hon. and learned Gentleman.<br/>
The House will appreciate that the royalty fixed is a statutory royalty. That being so, it follows that any variation of it is a legislative function, because to vary that which is laid down by Parliament is itself a legislative function. That is why the Board of Trade prepares the order only, but can make it only with the approval of Parliament. That is why there is this provision for the affirmative Resolution of Parliament. Therefore, it is not quite correct for the hon. and learned Gentleman to say that it is not right that the solution should be left with the Board of Trade. That would not be right, but, of course, that is not what the Bill provides for, because the Board's order only becomes effective on the approval of Parliament.<br/>
The basic and simple difficulty with the hon. and learned Gentleman's otherwise attractive solution is that it is not constitutionally appropriate in this country, with our Parliamentary system, for an arbitrator, however independent, expert and distinguished, to vary what Parliament has done in its legislative function.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. and learned Gentleman to clear up one point? He says that with the Bill as drafted, it is not for the Board of Trade to decide, but that it is for Parliament to decide. Surely, unless the Board of Trade decides that there is a case for making an order, the matter does not come within the purview of Parliament at all?</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.744.1" hansard_membership_id="10123" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21833" speakername="Mr. Walker-Smith" colnum="744" time="">
<p>That, of course, is true. The initiating act has to be taken by the Board of Trade, but the executive or legislative act which brings about the order varying the royalty is one which


can only be taken with the sanction and approval of Parliament.<br/>
I think I am entitled to remind the House&#x2014;some hon. Members who participated in the proceedings will not need to be reminded&#x2014;that when we were engaged in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act earlier in the Session, there were speeches from hon. Members opposite indicating the impropriety, in their view, of letting the legislative function of Parliament in any way be given to any form of judicial proceedings. The practical difficulty, as I see it, is this. Arbitration is a procedure for settling disputes of law or fact, or mixed law and fact, which arise between known parties who go to arbitration. It can only operate satisfactorily on that basis and within that framework.<br/>
But the fixing of statutory royalties and the licensing right procedure is not a matter of dispute, either of law or of fact. Not only that, but the award is bound to affect a great many people. Those people who are affected by an order fixing royalty rates can, under our procedure, appear and put their point of view at a public inquiry, but they would not, of course, have any status at an arbitration <i>inter partes</i> so to do.<br/>
There is the further point, that I can see a danger in this arbitration procedure in that one unrepresentative composer, possibly a man of straw, could be put up and his case would prejudice a great many other composers who would not have had an opportunity to put their case in the arbitration.<br/>
I have, of course, on seeing this Amendment, made such search as I have been able, with the assistance that I have, to see if there are any valid precedents for taking the course suggested by the hon. and learned Gentleman, which, as I say, appeals to me. I have not, unfortunately, been able to find any valid precedent. The nearest one, which is an unsatisfactory one, is Section 5 of the Prices of Goods Act, 1939. That suffers from a triple disadvantage. In the first place, it was emergency legislation, which is a bad guide to normal legislation. Secondly, it had to contain very elaborate provisions to make the scheme workable at all, and, thirdly, and not least, even with that, it was never put into practice. That is not a very encouraging precedent.<br/>
The next nearest precedent which I could find is one which will be familiar to the hon. and learned Gentleman, namely the Transport Tribunal. But that is not a very good precedent for the arbitration side of the matter because the Transport Tribunal operates by means of a public inquiry, as we propose to do here. It follows from that that it is not possible to remove this duty from the Board of Trade and pass it to the arbitrator, as I personally would be glad to do if it were constitutionally proper and practical.<br/>
Nevertheless, although we must ask the House for the retention by the Board of this jurisdiction, I can reassure the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Walsall, North to this extent, since he did raise this point, which I accept, about nothing being initiated except by the action of the Board of Trade, that the Board of Trade will always be ready to hold a public inquiry within the appropriate statutory time limits if there is a reasonable <i>prima facie</i> case made out by applicants for such an inquiry to be held with a view to refixing of rates.<br/>
In regard to the conduct of the inquiries, we are certainly very much open to any suggestions for improving their procedure. In that, as in all these sorts of public inquiries and administrative proceedings, we are hoping to benefit by the Report and recommendations of the Oliver Franks Committee on Administrative Tribunals and Inquiries, when that appears.<br/>
In the circumstances, I hope that the House will think that that is the best we can do to meet the point raised, and that it will not be necessary for this Amendment to be pressed to a Division.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.746.0" speakerid="unknown" speakername="Mr. M. Tamer-Samuels" colnum="746" time="">
<p>I do not for the life of me know why the Parliamentary Secretary is adopting such a rigid attitude about this matter. Here we have a contest about the method or medium through which, when it appears that the rate of royalty has become inequitable, it may be determined whether that is correct or not. The dispute is as to whether the right machinery is a public inquiry or the determination by an arbitrator appointed by the Lord Chancellor.<br/>
I listened to the argument of the Parliamentary Secretary with great care


and great interest. It seemed to me&#x2014;and this is why I used the expression "rigid attitude"&#x2014;that he was wedded to the idea that since a certain type of machinery had been used hitherto or is used in other connections, it was therefore appropriate that it should be slavishly followed on this occasion when an alteration in the procedure might be very desirable and publicly profitable. In my view, the proposals of my hon. and learned Friend are much to be preferred to the contentions advanced by the Parliamentary Secretary in favour of the public inquiry.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary has said that, in the circumstances, it might be possible before an arbitrator to present to the tribunal a man of straw. I cannot see why the same attempt could not be made at a public inquiry. Indeed, my experience of public inquiries leads me to think that one might with much greater facility attempt to present a man of straw before such tribunals than before judicial arbitrators, experienced in mode of procedure, appointed by the Lord Chancellor.</p>

<p>Perhaps it might save time if I were just to tell the hon. and learned Gentleman the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Turner-Samuels) what I think is the answer to that. A public inquiry is public in the sense that all interested parties attend, so if one man of straw attended it would not commit the others. Before an arbitrator, the man of straw might be the only applicant, and what was decided in the absence of the others would constitute an adverse precedent in their case.</p>

<p>If a man of straw was to be the central figure in this <i>dramatis person&#x0153;</i> which was to come before this public inquiry, I think that he would be the first person to be presented under whatever guise this inquiry, judicial or public, took place. Really all that the intervention of the Parliamentary Secretary does is to accentuate the weakness of the case which he is endeavouring to put forward.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary said, again trying to draw away from the weakness of his position, that here we did not have a question of law. It may be, of

course, true that in the strict sense there is no question of legal definition to be decided here, but where we have an issue in which it is a question of whether a state of things is equitable or not, the Parliamentary Secretary, who is no undistinguished lawyer himself, knows very well that we get involved at once in legal principles of the highest order. Therefore, it is ploughing the sands for the Parliamentary Secretary to submit an argument of that kind not merely to other lawyers on this side of the House but to all Members of Parliament of common sense who are sitting here and who are not lawyers.<br/>
What is more important in this matter is that the mind which is concentrating on the inquiry should be a judicial mind. This is, as I have said before, a consideration of whether a royalty is equitable or not. It is a matter which concerns not only the author but the public. It is a matter which has to be weighed in the balance very carefully and thoroughly because, although it is quite true that the property which comes from the brain of the author is of the greatest value to the author, nevertheless, the balance has to be held in regard to the public ; because, first, if it were not for the public the production of the author would not be worth anything at all, and, secondly, the production of the author, if it is worth anything at all, is worth something because of its <i>divertissement</i> or its educational value or whatever other value it may have. Therefore, it is right that it should be shared by the public. We then get an issue of a very important character to which there should be applied a judicial mind in order to see that justice is thoroughly done and in order to bring about this equitable situation which is contended not to exist in regard to the particular royalty in question.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary, in his wisdom, has also said that the arbitrator before whom the person would come would have no status. Really that is cutting it very fine. It seemed to me, as I listened to that, that it was not a question of a man of straw but of the last straw. There was a case here, or perhaps no case here, that was so devoid of argument that the hon. and learned Gentleman, who is not unresourceful, found himself in the deepest and most profound difficulty to try to make sense out of it. Therefore, to say that the person who


comes before an arbitrator appointed by the Lord Chancellor has no status is, to put it kindly, for the Parliamentary Secretary to speak with his tongue in his cheek.</p>

<p>What I actually said was that the people who did not come before the arbitrator might be affected by a decision taken in their absence.</p>
</speech>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.749.1" hansard_membership_id="10700" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/21585" speakername="Mr. Turner-Samuels" colnum="749" time="">
<p>This is a two-way traffic, and the Parliamentary Secretary can have it either way. We are not concerned with the people who do not come before the arbitrator; we are concerned with the people who want to come before the arbitrator, who feel that they have a case and a cause and some just reason for coming before him. Such people would have just as much status if they came before an arbitrator as they would if they came before a public inquiry, and. equally, as little status if they did not come before the arbitrator as they would have if they did not come before the public inquiry. The thing as put by the Parliamentary Secretary adds up to absolute nonsense, and nobody knows it better than the Parliamentary Secretary. I can almost hear him whispering that to himself.<br/>
The House is now called upon to decide what ought to be done in the matter. It is presented with the choice of what is in the Bill&#x2014;that there should be a public inquiry&#x2014;or of what is in the Amendment of my hon. Friends, which is that there should be an arbitrator appointed by the Lord Chancellor. It is not a matter of little importance whether there is a public inquiry or an arbitrator. I concede, of course, at once that which, ever method is adopted the matter certainly going to be considered, but that is not the question. The question is which is the best method in the interests of the public as well as of the author.<br/>
On the one hand, we have a public inquiry which, of course, is very suitable for matters such as concern local government. On the other hand, we have a plain issue between an individual and the public. Ordinarily, the public has the advantage of dealing with similar matters in the courts by the appropriate procedure which, of course, is very well known to the Parliamentary Secretary.<br/>
The procedure suggested by the Amendment is cheaper, quicker and easier than that of going to the courts or to a public inquiry. The effect of the Amendment would be to get an arbitrator appointed without delay who will be solely concerned with a specific issue of the royalties of a particular author in relation to the amount of those royalties and the interests of the community. In these circumstances, I ask the House not to allow itself to be pushed into the situation into which the Parliamentary Secretary is trying to push it, but to say without any doubt what is almost too obvious for words that there is no comparison between what is proposed in the Bill and what the Amendment says should be in it, and what I hope, will be in it if my hon. Friend's Amendment is accepted.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1956-10-24a.750.0" hansard_membership_id="5126" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/15503" speakername="Mr. Anthony Greenwood" colnum="750" time="">
<p>I am greatly reassured to have had the support of two of my hon. and learned Friends for the Amendment which stands in my name. What my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Turner-Samuels) has said has confirmed my own impression that perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary is ill-advised upon this issue.<br/>
I agree with the first part of what the Parliamentary Secretary said when he analysed the purpose of our Amendment. We are proposing to substitute for the Board of Trade inquiry a system of arbitration. He expressed great sympathy with the principle of arbitration and then said that at this stage it was very difficult to make an Amendment. I am sorry that when we have had so much time to consider this, the Parliamentary Secretary, with the great sympathy he felt for the principle, did not find it possible in Committee to lay the matter before us for our consideration. It is because we have become increasingly uneasy about the operation of the Clause that we have tabled, on Report, the Amendment in my name.<br/>
We think that arbitration is preferable to the Board of Trade inquiry, because we believe in the first place that the Board of Trade inquiry will be extremely slow. First, the Board of Trade has to decide to order that an inquiry shall be held. It orders an inquiry. The next stage is that the inquiry is held. The third is that


the President of the Board of Trade considers the report of the inquiry, and the fourth is that, in the light of that report, the President will lay an Affirmative Resolution before the House. That will be an extremely long and cumbersome process.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary said that the royalty which is to be fixed will be a statutory royalty which can be altered only by Parliament. I think that the hon. and learned Member is missing some of the finer points involved. In the first place, what will happen if the Board of Trade refuses to hold an inquiry? It is surely most desirable that if anybody is feeling a sense of injustice there should be some course of action open to him, even if the Board of Trade does not feel that that is the proper course at any particular time.<br/>
In how many cases will we in the House be able to judge whether the President has come to the right conclusion? If we had some arbitration machinery which would enable all the relevant interests to be represented and to make representations to the President of the Board of Trade, it would make things much easier for the House in coming to a conclusion. I think that the Parliamentary Secretary is wrong in saying that the arbitration machinery would be dealing only with the question of royalty. Although that is its fundamental purpose there might well be a dispute whether a record or a class of records came within a category of records for royalty purposes or not. I should have thought that some specialist arbitration machinery would have been extremely valuable in those circumstances.<br/>
The Parliamentary Secretary said that one of the difficulties about our proposal would be that one person appearing before the arbitrator might well prejudice the case of other people in the same class. It is very solicitous of the Parliamentary Secretary to feel that on behalf of copyright owners, but I think that he would be the first to agree that copyright owners as a whole are not badly organised and that they tend to know what various members of their community are doing. I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary need be too apprehensive about what would happen. Most of them would be prepared to act through the extremely efficient organisation that they have. I do not think that there would be a serious danger of the claims of one prejudicing

the claims of another, and it would be perfectly open to the President of the Board of Trade, when a request for arbitration was made, to acquaint the various organisations representing the copyright owners.<br/>
All of us want to make progress with the Bill. There is, especially among composers, a great deal of unhappiness about the effect of the Clause. What we are really doing is saying that Parliament shall have the right to fix a minimum remuneration for a whole class of our fellow-citizens. When we are doing that, it is desirable that we should introduce any safeguard which it is open to us to introduce; and if we could provide for this system of arbitration I think that it would greatly reassure composers. Although the Government have not done very much to meet the wishes of this side of the House in the course of the progress of the Bill through the House and in Committee, I hope that they will be able to say that they will consider the issue of arbitration; otherwise, on this issue too, we shall find it necessary to divide the House.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, Sir, I will respond shortly to that invitation. I cannot, I think, serve any useful purpose by spelling out again the difficulties and obstacles standing in the way of accepting a solution by arbitration. I have said already that, were it possible, I would find it an attractive solution for many reasons, but both constitutionally and in practice I am satisfied that it could not be incorporated into this procedure.<br/>
At the same time I should not like the composers to feel that there is any inherent disadvantage to which they would be exposed under this provision. I am sure that under the sanctions of Parliament it will work equitably. It may not work very quickly, but neither would arbitration procedure, because one of the difficulties about hearing the whole of this matter is that it takes a considerable amount of time.<br/>
Nor would I like it to be thought that there would be any reluctance on the part of the Board of Trade, if there is any <i>prima facie</i> case for an inquiry, to institute such an inquiry and to hold it as expeditiously, as fully and as fairly as possible.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 16, line 43. to leave out from beginning to "by" in line 7 on page 17 and insert:
<q>the following provisions of this section shall apply.</q>
<q>(3) Subject to the next following subsection&#x2014;
<ol>
<li>(<i>a</i>) during the relevant period of fifteen years, it shall not be an infringement of the copyright in the work to do anything which, at the time when it is done, would have been within the scope of the copyright in the design if the design had, immediately before that time, been registered in respect of all relevant articles; and</li>


<li>(<i>b</i>) after the end of the relevant period of fifteen years, it shall not be an infringement of the copyright in the work to do anything which, at the time when it is done, would, if the design had been registered immediately before that time, have been within the scope of the copyright in the design as extended to all associated designs and articles.</li>
</ol></q>
<q>In this subsection 'the relevant period of fifteen years' means the period of fifteen years beginning with the date on which articles, such as are mentioned in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the last preceding subsection, were first sold, let for hire, or offered for sale or hire in the circumstances mentioned in paragraph (<i>c</i>) of that subsection ; and 'all relevant articles', in relation to any time within that period, means all articles falling within the said paragraph (<i>b</i>) which had before that time been sold, let for hire, or offered for sale or hire in those circumstances.</q>
<q>(4) For the purposes of subsections (2) and (3) of this section, no account shall be taken of any articles in respect of which, at the time when they were sold, let for hire, or offered for sale or hire, the design in question was excluded from registration under the Act of 1949.</q>
Clause 10 is the rather difficult Clause dealing with registered designs. The effect of subsection (2) as drafted is that if the owner of the copyright in an artistic work applies that work as an industrial design, without previously registering it, and markets the articles to which it has been applied, he loses his copyright protection, not only in respect of the articles which he has marketed, but throughout the whole industrial field. For example, if a design is applied to a cup, it falls into the public domain, not only as applied to cups but also as applied industrially to any other article of manufacture.<br/>
This penalty falls particularly severely on designs such as cartoon figures. There is a considerable demand for their use as designs to be applied to a large number of different articles. It is true that a copyright owner can protect himself by registration, but should he by inadvertence fail to do so he loses protection, not only in the sphere in which he has used his design, but in all the rest of the industrial sphere.<br/>
The Amendment is designed to make that penalty less severe. Its effect is to limit the field in which protection is lost to those articles to which at any given time the copyright owner has himself, without prior registration, applied the design and which he has marketed. The design goes into the public domain to the extent that its proprietor would have

received protection had he first registered it.<br/>
I should, however, add this. It is a fundamental principle of the Clause that an artistic work which is applied industrially shall not enjoy an industrial design protection for longer than the maximum period&#x2014;fifteen years&#x2014;obtainable by registration under the 1949 Act, and that thereafter the design as industrially applied becomes public property. The Amendment, therefore, also provides that fifteen years after the first occasion on which the design is used industrially, copyright protection is lost throughout the whole industrial field. This corresponds with subsection (1) of the Clause, in which, at the expiry of the period of registration, the same thing happens.</p>

<p>I put forward an Amendment on this matter in Committee, which by mutual consent we thought was too complicated to deal with at that late stage. I put down the same Amendment on the Order Paper, but by some misunderstanding to which I need not refer it was eliminated from the Order Paper. I discovered that only this evening, or I should have been imposing upon the House a full explanation of my Amendment.<br/>
The Amendment which I had in mind was to provide a comprehensive register, that is to say, one in which industrial persons could register a design not only for a particular article, but for a number of articles, in one registration, and could register an associated design, that is not just one particular design, but a group of designs on the one register. The idea was in that way they would be saved from having to get protection which they were entitled to get by individual registration but would do it all in one.<br/>
I am bound to confess that that would have meant altering the Registered Designs Act, 1949, and perhaps this is not the occasion to embark upon that complicated man&#x0153;uvre. However, the Amendment which my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Secretary has moved has gone some way to remove what the owners and proprietors of registered designs felt might be a grievance, because, as the Bill was originally drafted, a mistake in not registering could have been very


expensive. Failure to register some article might have meant a big penalty ; that is to say, the owners lost the copyright not only of that article, but of associated articles, and not only of associated articles, but of associated designs, even whether there had or had not been sales of what would have been the offending articles. It is now proposed that failure to register a design means that one forfeits only the right to protest against associated designs which are in fact sold and which, therefore, are free of any restriction of the owner of the one registered design. In those circumstances, although I had hoped to go a little further on this matter, I am satisfied with the Government's Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 18, line 31, at the end to insert:
<q>Provided that where a parson commissions the making of a sound recording, and pays or agrees to pay for it in money or money's worth, and the recording is made in pursuance of that commission, that person, in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, shall, subject to the provisions of Part VI of this Act, be entitled to any copyright subsisting in the recording by virtue of this section.</q>
The effect of Clause 12 (3) is that the ownership of copyright in a recording vests in the maker unless expressly varied by contract. My hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page), who made many valuable suggestions in the course of the Committee stage upstairs, argued there that in cases where recordings were specifically commissioned either for private messages or advertisement purposes copyright should go to the commissioner. The effect of this Amendment is to follow that suggestion and vest the ownership of the commissioned recordings in the commissioner instead of the maker.<br/>
That is logical because it puts gramophone records on the same footing in this respect as photographs where copyright already vests in the commissioner in similar circumstances under Clause 4 (3). I hope that the Amendment will therefore commend itself to the House. It implements an undertaking which I gave in Committee, and I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his suggestion.</p>

<p>I had expected to have the opportunity of expressing my gratitude to my hon. and learned Friend earlier on an Amendment on page 12, line 42, but as in moving that Amendment he made his speech on the Amendment in page 14, line 26, I was deprived of the opportunity. However, I am very glad to have the opportunity of expressing my gratitude now for the introduction of this Amendment. I need not enlarge upon it. I put my arguments during the Committee stage discussions and my hon. and learned Friend has explained them here.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 19, line 1, to leave out, "they did not bear" and insert:
<q>neither the records nor the containers in which they were so issued bore.</q>
Perhaps it might be convenient if this Amendment and the two following Amendments on the same page in lines 9 and 10 were discussed together. They arise out of subsection (6) of the Clause which provides that there shall be no infringement of copyright if at the time of the issue to the public in the United Kingdom the records did not bear a label or mark indicating the year of first publication. We have been considering that in the light of certain further considerations which appear to arise and be material in this regard. They are, first, that again this matter is affected by the impact of the advent of long playing records which may of course comprise several recordings already issued as shorter records. That being so, several dates might have to be put on the one record.<br/>
The next consideration is that modern devices like magnetic tapes and wires are not physically capable of bearing labels in the same way as conventional discs. There is a third consideration which is legislative rather than mechanical. It is, of course, that during the Committee stage discussions we lengthened the copyright period for gramophone records from 25 to 50 years which minimises the importance of this date stamping provision in regard to records. Therefore we put down these Amendments.<br/>
The first Amendment makes it possible to have copyright protection for the records if the date is put on the container


instead of the records. For example, in the case of long playing records it would normally be, presumably, on the sleeve of the long playing record. I feel that this gives reasonable protection to the user. The other two Amendments are consequential on the first Amendment.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 19, line 17, to leave out from "are" to the end of line 19 and insert:
<q>directly or indirectly to relieve the poverty or to advance the religion or education of its members or are purposes beneficial to the public".</q>
Hon. Members will appreciate that the purpose of the Clause is to protect certain societies from paying an additional fee for a gramophone record played on their premises. This exemption was recommended very strongly by the Report of the Copyright Committee in paragraph 194. Perhaps I may be permitted to remind the House that the paragraph stated:
<q>We are strongly of opinion that most, if not all, of the activities of the branches of the kind of organisation represented by the National Council of Social Service, admission to which is restricted to members, ought not to attract a fee for the ancillary rights we are now considering, at least in respect of the use of records and sound broadcasts. The Societies are not conducted for profit, but are bodies with objects of a religious, social or educational kind; their aim is not to provide entertainment but to contribute to the well-being of society, and the members are joined by this common bond.</q>
The Report went on to make recommendations as to how that should be done. It was suggested:
<q>That statutory power should be given to a rule-making Authority&#x2014;we suggest the Ministry of Education or the Ministry of Housing and Local Government&#x2014;to make rules under which societies of a religious, social or educational character, not established or, conducted for profit nor conducted primarily for giving performances, should be entitled to apply for a certificate.</q>
That would be the authority for these societies not to have to pay a fee. In an attempt to avoid extra expense and trouble for the Government, the Bill

attempted to give effect to that object. The point of my Amendment is to test whether the drafting of the Clause as it stands has given effect to that object.<br/>
The House will appreciate that it is desired to exempt not only charities but some sort of auxiliary bodies not necessarily charities. The Clause originally said:
<q>Where a sound recording is caused to be heard in public &#x2026;</q>
<q>(<i>b</i>) as part of the activities of, or for the benefit of, a club, society or other organisation which is not established or conducted for profit and whose main objects are charitable.</q>
That gives rise to difficulty, because the expression "charitable objects", if used strictly within the meaning of the law, involves the members of the society not being the objects of the charity. However worthy the objects of a society are, if they are devoted entirely to the benefit of the members, the society is not a charity. It might be said that the main objects in this case are to promote education, but if they are merely to promote the education of the members the society is not a charity in the legal sense of the word.</p>

<p>Surely the criticism which the hon. and learned Gentleman is making is invalidated by the fact that the original Clause referred to organisations
<q>concerned with &#x2026; social welfare</q>

<p>Yes, I appreciate that point, but I was dealing with the first point about the main objects being charitable and was expressing doubt whether an organisation which, on the face of it, stood for charity or education could be regarded as an organisation for charitable objects if these were only for the benefit of the members.<br/>
Let me go on to the second point. The Clause proceeded:
<q>or are otherwise concerned with the advancement of religion, education or social welfare.</q>
We have to imagine a society with objects which are not charitable but are concerned with the advancement of religion or education or social welfare. In the opinion of the courts advancement of religion has been held to be something


direct and not merely assisting or helping or doing it indirectly. Therefore, any society which only indirectly helps the advancement of religion or education might not go far enough to come within this part of the Bill.<br/>
9.30 p.m.<br/>
On the question of the advancement of social welfare, we are in the difficulty of not knowing whether that means the social welfare of the members of the society or social welfare at large. One can conceive of a society&#x2014;indeed there are many&#x2014;which, although its objects are stated to be the relief of poverty in general, may really be for the relief of its own members. Does the Clause as drafted mean a society whose objects are to help its own members or must it be a society which helps those outside its subscribing members?<br/>
Those are the reasons which have impelled me to put forward this Amendment. I am not saying that this Amendment carries the matter much further, but in an attempt to carry it further I put first the inclusion of organisations in which the charity is directed towards themselves and therefore suggest that the exemption should apply to clubs and societies whose objects are
<q>to relieve the poverty or to advance the religion or education of its members. &#x2026;</q>
That includes what might not be strictly a charity, and then I seek to put in the general words:
<q>or are purposes beneficial to the public.</q>
That would include all the charitable organisations, and would also include social welfare and charities at large&#x2014;any organisation which in conferring benefits on its members also benefits a substantial portion of the public. The difficulty I had is that I wanted to be satisfied that as far as possible this Clause would be wide enough to include what the House and certainly the Committee and the Report wanted&#x2014;not merely societies which help people outside their membership, but also those which confer some benefit on themselves.<br/>
It is interesting to see the sort of societies which might not be caught by the present provision. A society for the repatriation of Jews probably would not be caught, that is to say, would not get the benefit of the exemption. There was an example recently of a Welsh centre

being formed for holding jolly Welsh festivals in London. It may be a good thing to have Welsh music on the gramophone, but such a society would have to pay for use of records. I am not sure that, as the Clause is drafted, it would get any benefit from the exemption. I am not even sure that Women's Institutes would get any benefit, because it might be said that they are not doing anything for social welfare except for themselves. Clearly this is not intended to benefit any froth-blowers' club or supporters of a football team. I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary might be able to help us by saying whether he is really satisfied that these words cover the sort of organisation which we want covered.<br/>
It is interesting to notice that the Copyright Committee appreciated the difficulty by not attempting to draft the wording because the exemption was to include charities and something else. That is why it suggested that statutory powers should be given to a rule-making authority which could give a certificate and, subject to approval by this House, could specify the sort of organisation which should have the benefit of this exemption. For myself, I must say that where it is difficult to make a definition I would have thought that this was one of the cases which might properly be given to the rule-making authority.</p>

<p>The House will be obliged to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Philip Bell) for moving this Amendment with his characteristic clarity and conciseness. The Amendment deals with an important subsection, because under subsection (7) the exemptions are granted from the operation of the performing right in respect of these gramophone records. There are two heads of exemption under the two paragraphs of the subsection, one being certain types of residential premises&#x2014;private hotels and the like, with which we are not here concerned, and the other, under paragraph (<i>b</i>) being these, broadly speaking, charitable, philanthropic and other organisations.<br/>
My hon. and learned friend has queried the language in which we have sought to spell out the type of organisations which will have the benefit of this


exemption and proposes&#x2014;or tentatively proposes, I think I may say, if I interpret his approach correctly&#x2014;another form of words. Naturally, I feel somewhat diffident in canvassing matters concerning the interpretation of the law of charities and so on with my hon. and learned Friend, who practices in the Division in which these matters are dealt with, but perhaps I might first of all take his point in regard to the limitation of the word "charitable" in our definition.<br/>
Our definition reads:
<q>&#x2026; whose main objects are charitable or are otherwise concerned with the advancement of religion, education or social welfare.</q>
With respect, I am at one with my hon. and learned Friend in what he has said about the limitation which the courts have placed upon the meaning of the word "charitable", in this sense, that it excludes organisations, clubs or societies which are devoted to the relief of their own members. If our definition stopped there, there would. I think, be substance in his apprehension that our definition might exclude from the benefit of the exemption of this subsection certain philanthropic or voluntary organisations on the ground that their work was primarily directed to the benefit of their own members.<br/>
But of course&#x2014;as was pointed out in what was, if I may say so, a characteristically helpful intervention by the hon. Member for Itchen (Dr. King)&#x2014;our definition does not stop at the word "charitable"; it continues:
<q>&#x2026; or are otherwise concerned with the advancement of religion, education or social welfare.</q>
Those words do spread very widely the net of our definition and, therefore, the benefit of our exemption under this subsection. I would venture to suggest that it is quite clear that if, in this time and age, an organisation is devoted to the relief of poverty, albeit it may be the relief of poverty of its own members&#x2014;although that might not technically be "charitable" under the construction of that word in the courts&#x2014;it would clearly fall within the wording "or otherwise" for "social welfare." I cannot see that it could fail to come under that limb of our definition.<br/>
That, I think, removes the main apprehension of my hon. and learned Friend. I do not think I will follow him in discussing all the examples which he gave,

because I think that the line of demarcation is clear and practical in the definition as we have it and that the Amendment which he suggests is unnecessary for the reason I have given.<br/>
I think also that the wording which my hon. and learned Friend suggests would be in some ways less satisfactory than the wording in the Bill. The Amendment proposed contains the words:
<q>&#x2026; to advance the religion or education of ils members &#x2026;</q>
In the Bill we say:
<q>&#x2026; the advancement of religion, education or social welfare.</q>
That leaves the concluding words of the Amendment:
<q>&#x2026; or are purposes beneficial to the public</q>
to cover the charitable and social welfare referred to in our definition. In other words, my hon. and learned Friend's broad paraphrase has got to support the more specific things under those two heads in our definition.<br/>
I would suggest for the consideration of the House that the words which my hon. and learned Friend proposes in that respect are too vague to be satisfactorily written on the Statute Book. The terms that we have got have these advantages. The word "charitable," although not entirely comprehensive, as I have indicated, is a useful term because what it covers is pretty well clearly understood owing to the decisions of the courts in the past. The term "social welfare" is also a useful term as defining more precisely than my hon. and learned Friend's proposed terminology the sort of cases which one has in mind. It also has the added advantage that it has been written into a Statute as recently as in the last Session of Parliament. My hon. and learned Friend will appreciate that it is a test prescribed in the Rating and Valuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1955. It is there used in a context dealing with the rating concessions to charitable and other bodies, which is rather analogous to the use here. The use of that phrase in the Rating and Valuation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act will mean that there will be built up a body of interpretation and practice which will assist in the context of this Measure.<br/>
I hope that what I have said has brought reassurance to my hon. and


learned Friend that the form of words which appears in the Bill will meet the very proper anxieties which he has in mind, and perhaps he will be content with that and will not wish to proceed with his Amendment.</p>

<p>Before we part with this Amendment I would like to ask my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade if he is quite satisfied about this wording. He has told us that the effect of his wording is to go rather beyond the definition of "charity," and although he claims that it is not so vague as the wording of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton, East (Mr. Philip Bell), he has not really told us where it goes to.<br/>
I think we ought to be a little careful about this matter, because we are not merely enacting a new Act of Parliament. We may also be creating a precedent. The Parliamentary Secretary has told us that everybody knows what a charity is. I am sure he is well aware that in recent months there has been a little more uncertainty about it. There was a great controversy, for example, as to whether it was charitable to set up a bridge for the exclusive use of indigent Methodists, and other interesting discussions have taken place.<br/>
I cannot help thinking that it may be a little difficult if, at a time when we are all rather uncertain about what a charity is, we are going to make an exemption in a Bill of this kind in favour of something more than a charity but we do not know quite how much more. I hope this matter will receive careful consideration, because it is important that when we make provisions of this kind and of a rather new character we should be as precise as possible. Certainly it is not very satisfactory to say, "This is not a charity; we do not quite know what that is, but it is something more than a charity, and we do not quite know how much that is ". I cannot say that I think the Amendment of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton, East would make matters very much better, but I think that, whatever the difficulty is, we should like to have an assurance from my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Secretary that he is really aware of what is being done in this Clause.</p>

<p>I can give my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Chertsey (Sir L. Heald) that assurance, though to give an assurance that one is aware of the intention of a Clause is not, as I am sure my right hon. and learned Friend will appreciate more readily than anybody, to give an assurance that the wording which is proposed in the Clause, or in any other Clause of this Bill or in any other Clause or any Act of Parliament at all, will never fall to be interpreted by the courts. Of course, there is a long history of litigation in regard to the construction of what are charities and what are not ; but that does not mean that it is not better to use terminology which has had the benefit of construction in the courts or has the benefit of other use in an Act of Parliament.<br/>
Here we use the expression "charitable", which is at least a well known term, and I do not think my right hon. and learned Friend suggested we should not use it at all. The main point of difference here is as to whether it is better to use my hon. and learned Friend's phrase "purposes beneficial to the public" which has the benefit neither of precedent in an Act of Parliament nor of judicial construction, or our phrase "social welfare" which at any rate has the benefit of having been written into an Act of Parliament as recently as in the last Session. I think my right hon. and learned Friend will agree with me on that. Although I do not suggest that any course is going to be immune from the risks of litigation&#x2014;I carry my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Bolton, East with me in that, I am sure&#x2014;I do think that this is the best form of words which, having regard to human fallibility, we are able to achieve.</p>

<p>Before we leave this Amendment, I should like, if I may, to repeat a protest I made earlier in our proceedings today. This is a highly technical Bill. It is a Bill in regard to which those of us who are ordinary layman feel at something of a disadvantage, and I think the Government might have treated the House with rather more courtesy and arranged for one of the Law Officers of the Crown to be present. We have had the Government's wording


criticised by a very distinguished Chancery Silk, and a former Attorney-General has expressed doubts as to whether the Government have chosen the right wording. I think the least the Government could have done would have been to arrange for at any rate the Solicitor-General, if not the Attorney-General, to help us in our deliberations.</p>

This Amendment is intended to meet a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mr. Page) during the Committee stage. The proviso as it is at present drafted assumes that the maker of the goods is the man who makes the contract with the maker of the film where that film is required for advertising the goods of the first person I have mentioned. My hon. Friend the Member for Crosby, however, pointed out that it was normal commercial practice for these contracts to be made not between the maker of the goods and the maker of the film direct but usually between the advertising agent representing the maker of the goods and the maker of the film.<br/>
In these circumstances, as my hon. and learned Friend the Parliamentary Secretary said during the Committee stage:
<q>Obviously, we do not want to spell out a proviso which does not govern what normally happens in the commercial sphere. I quite

appreciate that there is a case for looking at this proviso again."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committtee B,</i> 10th July, 1956 ; c. 306.]</q>
As I have said, we have done so and we have come to the conclusion that my hon. Friend's criticism is well-founded and that it would be far batter for us to leave the position with regard to the ownership of the copyright of the film to be a matter to be decided in a contract made between the two main parties in this matter, that is the maker of the goods and the advertising agent concerned. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend will feel that we have gone quite a long way, indeed fully, to meet his point by moving this Amendment, and that it will commend itself to the House.</p>

When my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby originally moved his Amendment it took the form of the Amendment which he is now not proposing to move and which we are considering in conjunction with the Amendment which I am moving. It was wider in scope and dealt with matters of research as well as with copyright for judicial proceedings. We felt that, in certain circumstances, that might lead to abuse. The reason was that there might be occasions when the interpretation of research went far beyond what is normally considered to be research, that is research for purposes of study other than commercial purposes.</p>

<p>I am very grateful, Mr. Speaker. I was merely trying, in view of the cogency of my hon. Friend and the interest which the House showed during the Committee stage, to explain some of the reasons which brought us to the modified Amendment which we are now considering. Earlier on we were doubtful whether this Amendment would

have any practical effect, but we now realise that it may have some effect. We certainly do not wish that there should be any charge for cinematograph films or, indeed, any charge in respect of copyright where a work is used in connection with a judicial proceeding. In those circumstances, I hope that this Amendment will commend itself to the House and will be accepted by it.</p>

<p>A very real point arises out of this Amendment, mainly in connection with television commercial films. It is a practice for one advertiser to monitor, as it were, the films of other advertisers in order to check for any passing off of goods, any breach of the Merchandise Marks Act, any trade marks breaches, and so on. Of course, the same sort of thing is done with newspaper advertisements, but, in that case, one has the newspaper and can cut out the advertisement and thus have the evidence of it. In the case of commercial television broadcasts the evidence is ephemeral, except that it is likely to be repeated.<br/>
This Amendment would give the person who believes that there has been some breach of a trade mark, or something of that sort, an opportunity of taking a photograph of the film so as to have the evidence for the purpose of judicial proceedings, but only, as the Amendment now stands, for that purpose. If the Amendment were not introduced there might be some grave injustice in that the person who suffered was unable to preserve and provide the evidence.</p>

<p>I beg to move, in page 21, line 28, to leave out "production" and insert "sequence of visual images."<br/>
This Amendment is moved in response to a point raised by the right hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Glenvil Hall) during the Committee stage. It deals with a fairly technical point and I will try to explain it briefly. The present reading of the subsection refers to production. The right hon. Member for Colne Valley suggested that the word "production" might be confused with the actual production of the film as opposed to the film itself. By the film I mean the negative, that is, the film strip itself.<br/>
Having further considered the matter, we came to the conclusion that there


might be another source of confusion in that "production" might be considered as referring to something made up, that is, to a film which was made up as opposed to a film which was a record of actual facts such as a nature film or a news film. In those circumstances, it seemed to us entirely right that an Amendment should be made and it will, I think, meet the point raised by the right hon. Gentleman by substituting for the word "production" the words "sequence of visual images."</p>

This Amendment again is in response to a point raised by the right hon. Member for Colne Valley (Mr. Glenvil Hall), and it is a highly technical one. There are two steps in the process of making a film. The first is the creation of the negative and the second is the production of the positive film record from the negative. The right hon. Member was apprehensive that there was a danger, on the present wording, of the restriction on the use of copyright applying only after the point when the negative has been transferred to the positive. He was concerned to ensure that the sequence of images should be protected as a film from the moment that it is fixed on the negative itself, irrespective of any steps still to be taken in order to make it available for actual showing from the film projector on to the screen. Our Amendment is designed to meet this important and highly technical point and I hope that it will have the approval of the House.</p>

<q>Provided that this subsection shall not affect the granting of an interlocutory injunction on the application of either of them.</q>
It might be convenient, Mr. Speaker, with your approval, to take with this Amendment and the three other Amendments in the name of my right hon. Friend to page 29, line 3, line 6 and line 32. The purpose of these Amendments is to remove doubts about the operation of Clause 19 as drafted. That Clause deals with the position of its exclusive licensees.<br/>
These Amendments, which I am afraid take up rather a lot of space on the Order Paper, do not represent any change in the Government's intentions in this matter. The main features of the scheme in Clause 19 remain unchanged, though I hope clarified. These features are, first, that the exclusive licensee is empowered to sue in his own right under Clause 17 in actions for infringement, and, secondly, he can sue in his own right under Clause 18 in actions for detinue and conversion. Coming to the copyright owner, he can sue in his own name under Clause 17 for infringement, but he cannot sue under Clause 18 for detinue and conversion because this right is reserved to the exclusive licensee, who is, of course, the only person, where he holds the exclusive licence, who is entitled to exercise the copyright.<br/>
Coming to the Amendments in a little more detail, the Amendments to subsection (2) are merely drafting, and the new subsection (3), which I am now moving, maintains the provision that the exclusive licensee must join the copyright owner in the action either as plaintiff or defendant. That seems to us a reasonable provision, because it is desirable that in these matters the copyright owner and the exclusive licensee should co-operate together so far as is possible.<br/>
Hon. Members who were on the Standing Committee will recall that the main difficulty which we envisaged in


the provisions which we were making for defining the respective rights of the copyright owner and the exclusive license; was to avoid any danger of a duplication of damages in this context arising from the possibility of successive actions by the copyright owner and the licensee respectively. We have avoided this, I think successfully, in the case of actions for detinue and conversion by the provision to which I have already referred, whereby the copyright owner cannot sue for detinue and conversion but only the exclusive licensee, but two possible difficulties have arisen out of the consideration which we have given to this matter since the Committee stage.<br/>
The first is an action for infringement under Clause 17, in which, as the House will appreciate, both the copyright owner and the exclusive licensee have the right to sue. Our intention is and always has been that the owner should recover damages only for his loss, and the exclusive licensee only for the loss that he suffered. Consequently, there would in principle be no duplication of damages. The difficulty that arises is when the actions are individually brought and the court may feel bound to disregard the contractual rights of the licensee in an action brought by him and award him damages on the basis of the full loss suffered by the copyright owner, and, conversely, the same thing might happen in respect of the copyright owner.<br/>
To meet that difficulty, we propose this new subsection (5), which, in effect, directs the court to have regard to the fact that the copyright owner and the exclusive licensee have each got distinct and limited interests in the copyright and in the remedies in respect thereof.<br/>
10.15 p.m.<br/>
The other difficulty which has suggested itself to us is that the remedy of an account of profits was likely to cause difficulty under the old drafting. It is as a solution for this possibility that we propose the new subsections (6) and (7). Under subsection (6) the Court is to apportion the profits between the copyright owner and the exclusive licensee and the new subsection (7) will save the infringer from the duplication of proceedings and thereby save him consequentially from the danger of a

duplication of damages awarded against him.</p>

It might be convenient of we could take with this Amendment a number of other Amendments in the name of my right hon. Friend. In Clause 26, page 38, lines 7 and 18, and in Clause 27, page 39, lines 15, 16, 17 and 27.<br/>
In page 39, line 17, after "question", insert:
<q>and to every other party (if any) to the application.</q>
These Amendments all deal with the functioning of the Performing Right Tribunal whose jurisdiction is defined in Clauses 25, 26 and 27. Those Clauses give the basic jurisdiction of the Tribunal in licensing schemes and the further consideration of those licensing schemes and also individual applications under Clause 27 by applicants who seek to show that they are within a licensing scheme.<br/>
The question arose during Committee whether in addition to what might be termed the basic parties to the dispute before the Tribunal under these various Clauses there should also be a right of audience to other interested parties. In Committee the Opposition moved an Amendment which would have given an unqualified right of audience to organisations claiming to be representative of interested persons. On behalf of the Government I said at that time that while I could not accept an Amendment in terms as broad as that, I would undertake to study the possibility of the rules providing the appropriate result within specific cases, without writing a general right into the Bill.<br/>
In this case, though in some cases I may have disappointed hon. Members opposite in the result of the consideration which has been given to these matters, I can say that I have done a bit better


than I thought would be possible at the time of that undertaking, because what we have now done is to write these provisions into the Bill. We came to the conclusion that the right course was to write into the Bill, and not leave as a matter for the rules, a discretion for the Tribunal to make any organisation or person a party to a reference on application, if the Tribunal was satisfied that that organisation or person had a substantial interest in the dispute.<br/>
The result of the Amendments will be that the position is maintained that only the parties to the actual dispute have an unconditional right to be heard, for the reasons I sought to give in Committee. Secondly, although that is so, nonetheless organisations of persons having a substantial interest in the dispute may ask to be heard and at the discretion of the Tribunal may be joined as parties.<br/>
It follows, of course, that being joined as parties, they will have all the rights and liabilities of the other parties, for example, the right to appeal on a point of law, which is a right and liability to be condemned in costs, which is a liability. That is the position in short which these Amendments will provide. That is the right approach, because the functions of the Tribunal being what they are, a determination of disputes between parties, the Tribunal ought not to be required in mandatory terms to hear all those representations which, while no doubt of interest and importance socially, are not directed to those issues with which the Tribunal is being established to deal.<br/>
If we give an automatic right of audience, we might frustrate the essential purpose of the Tribunal and lay it open to all sorts of pressures. I think that that is appreciated by hon. Members opposite, because, although their original Amendment would have given an unqualified right of audience, their present Amendment of the Order Paper leaves it to the discretion of the Tribunal. So I am glad to say that there is a general consensus between us on this matter, and therefore we have these Amendments to give a discretionary right to the tribunal to join these persons interested as parties.</p>

<p>I am very glad that what I hope will be my last contribution tonight can be one of congratulation to the Parliamentary Secretary on the wisdom he has shown in moving

this Amendment. As hon. Members who were on the Standing Committee will know, the Tribunal is one of the most interesting and in some ways one of the most controversial aspects of the Bill. Many people outside this House made representations to us that the Tribunal was unnecessary and the rights which were created in other parts of the Bill should be subject only to the limitations specified in the Clauses which conferred those rights.<br/>
We on this side of the House rejected that view, and I stated our views during the Committee stage discussions as follows:
<q>In the first place, we consider it most important that the Tribunal should have full power to prevent abuses and to protect the legitimate interests of the parties concerned and of the public as a whole. Secondly, we believe that it is equally important that all the interests affected should have full and unfettered access to the machinery of the Tribunal."&#x2014;[OFFICIAL REPORT, <i>Standing Committee B,</i> 19th July, 1956 ; c. 414.]</q>
I agree that in the light of subsequent discussions that was perhaps an overstatement of the case, and that was why my hon. and learned Friend and I tabled our Amendment. We did make our appeal to the Tribunal a qualified and not an absolute right, as the Parliamentary Secretary said. Unfortunately, in our discussions in the Standing Committee the Parliamentary Secretary held the view at that time that normally the only parties to the dispute before the Tribunal would be the copyright owners and the users, and that, so far as he could see, the organisations representing professional or trade interests would have no interest in any dispute before the Tribunal. He persisted in that view in spite of a most powerful contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, West (Mr. Randall) who has great experience of industrial and trade union matters.<br/>
On our side of the Committee we argued that a trade union like, for example, the Musicians' Union, although not directly a party to the granting of a licence, would have a substantial interest in whether or not a licence was granted, either because it would affect many members of the union, or because it might create a precedent detrimental to the members of the union as a whole. We took the view, which we expressed forcefully at the time, that an important principle was involved in this point and it


was one of the few occasions when some acrimony entered into what was otherwise an extremely good-natured and harmonious discussion. We on this side of the House rejoice that the Parliamentary Secretary has, somewhat belatedly, recognised the justice of the case we put forward. We rejoice at his change of heart and hone that the House will accept the Amendment.</p>

<p>I have two points to put to the Under-Secretary of State for Air, who has had notice of them. I am sure that he will be here in a minute. The first point is about the procedure of inquiry into accidents, and the second is the shortage of transport aircraft, shown by the Suez mobilisation.<br/>
The present procedure does great harm to the Royal Air Force. No one suggests that security should be ignored, but the present policy of secrecy is not suited to conditions in which the public are concerned. Crashes affect not only the public directly, in the case of loss of life to civilians on the ground, but, as in the case of the recent Vulcan crash at London, where the facilities used by the Service aircraft are civilian.<br/>
The object of the Air Ministry should be to show to the public that the Royal Air Force is a Fighting Service caring for the people of the country it serves. I regret to say that there is increasing hostility among the people towards the Air Ministry because the Royal Air Force is made out to be a self-satisfied Service indifferent to the feelings of the people outside the Service. I know that the Royal Air Force is in no way self-satisfied ; it is the duty of the Air Ministry to see that the public knows that also.<br/>
I recently had the task of going through the papers of the case of one of the 15 young officers killed when a Valetta crashed in January, 1954, that of Pilot Officer Purcell. Everything that could have been done to sadden the parents of that young man was done. The telegram giving information of the death was sent to the wrong address, and so was the telegram as to the funeral. The parents were told that their son had been killed instantly, whereas in fact he died in hospital. Even at the funeral the wrong initials were on the coffin. It appeared to the parents and to their friends that they were being treated as intruders into a matter which concerned the Service only. The result is that the parents and their friends have become anti-Air Force. I am certain that no other member of

that family will choose to serve in the Royal Air Force. These were defects in administration, but how much would have been avoided if the Air Ministry had set out to show how much it cared, and if subsequently the inquiry had been public so that parents and friends could have heard everything that happened.<br/>
Another and more recent case of what can be crudely termed bad public relations was the handling of the Vulcan crash at London Airport, in which so many fine men lost their lives. The whole country felt for them and their families. The aircraft, which was using a civil airport, was using the ordinary civil ground control system. Naturally, there has been disquiet at the veil of Service secrecy which has been thrown over the operations of this civil ground control system. Once more it appears as if the Air Ministry regards the public as a nuisance, as intruders to be pushed off.<br/>
I believe the root cause of all this is the system of closed inquiries which makes the public believe that a group of professionals are getting together to cover up something. I ask the Under-Secretary, and through him the Secretary of State, in fairness to the Royal Air Force, to examine carefully the present procedure to see if in the interests of the Service there should be so much secrecy on matters which cannot possibly have any problem of security.<br/>
My second point is an entirely different one. For several years now we have been pointing to the neglect by the Air Ministry of Transport Command. Tonight I ask the Under-Secretary not only to tell us how Transport Command and the transport services have operated in the Suez mobilisation, but what changes the Government are making in their policy towards Transport Command. The Minister of Defence told me today in a Written Answer:
<q>we still have a long way to go in formulating a long term policy for the transportation by air of men and materials.</q>
That is indeed true. Recently in <i>The Times,</i> Sir John Slessor and Sir George Pirie, writing in his capacity as Chairman of the Air League, have referred to Transport Command as the Cinderella of the Royal Air Force. If this is the Cinderella, when can we expect to have the transformation scene, when can we expect


that Transport Command will be allowed and equipped to play its true part?<br/>
The Air Council should begin by studying what the United States Military Air Transport Service does. I have been impressed with that service ever since 1948, when, as Under-Secretary, I saw some of the operations of the Berlin Airlift. Let the Air Council notice not only the size of M.A.T.S. but its policy. Of course, we cannot compete with the size of the gigantic United States force with its 450 four-engined aircraft and 100 twin-engined aircraft, not counting the Navy's 100 four-engined aircraft and about 50 twin-engined aircraft. But let us look at their policy. The policy of the United States services is that all of them adopt trooping by air whenever possible because it is cheaper. Compare that with the Answer I got just before the Recess from the Minister of Defence&#x2014;that the percentage of trooping by air is still only, I think, 54 per cent. It has gone up by about 1 per cent. since last year&#x2014;it is very small indeed.<br/>
Secondly, the United States policy is to cut the overheads on their material by using air freight for all such equipment as aero engines&#x2014;</p>

<p>Yes, that is the point. The policy of trooping by air is not accepted generally in our Services as it is in the American Services. Again, on the carrying of freight they cut their overheads by always taking aero engines by air. This reduces the number in the lines of communication, storage and so on, because the time is cut to one-ninth or one-tenth.<br/>
Most important of all is that United States military thinking recognises the importance of air transport. I shall quote

this extract from the House of Representatives Defence Appropriations Committee:
<q>The mission assigned to M.A.T.S. is of major strategic importance. It is more than just a convenient air transport system; it is a significant portion of our over-all Air Defence Forces.</q>
I ask the Government to consider setting up a military transport service, trained and operated by the Royal Air Force and borne&#x2014;and I think this is fair&#x2014;on a Ministry of Defence Vote, because, after all, it would work for the three Services. If the Army developed its Mobile Strategic Reserve, what would move it at this moment? If the Navy developed its fleet trains in far-off parts of the world, what would move its supplies? And I emphasise again that, of course, I am here referring not only to men but to equipment. I know that the Hermes can carry a 25-pounder, but how many Hermes are there?<br/>
It has been the Government's policy to look for reserves among the independent civil operators. They look to them for aircraft and for aircrews at short notice, but it has proved impossible to rely on them for many reasons. The first is shortage of aircraft. I think it is right to say that there were only 13 long-range aircraft available at the time of the Suez mobilisation. So we found civilian Dakotas taking twice as long to transport the men, and transporting only, say, one-third of what could be transported in a Britannia&#x2014;and using two pilots.<br/>
That brings me to the second point. There is a shortage not only of aircraft but of aircrew. There were aircraft ready and waiting on the ground&#x2014;and that with an important line like Skyways&#x2014;because there were not enough pilots. The basic problem is shortage of money to buy the aircraft. That is the problem everywhere. It is the problem in the United States, too. I know that the independent airline firms claim that they could provide the aircraft if they got, as do the shipping firms, long-term contracts for trooping&#x2014;seven to ten years. Unfortunately I have not time to develop or argue that point.<br/>
Looking ahead, must we not recognise that there will be no future for us in military or civil transport unless we are prepared to find a really large sum of money for the design and development of a supersonic bomber and transport, for civil and


military use? Therefore, I ask the Under-Secretary to ask his colleagues in the Government for an urgent inquiry into the supply of aircraft and aircrews for the transport of men and equipment of all three Services.</p>

<p>May I first say how glad we are to see the hon. Member for Lincoln (Mr. de Freitas) none the worse off for being in the unpleasant incident which we all regret so much?<br/>
The hon. Member suggested first that we should hold public inquiries into accidents to R.A.F. aircraft. Of course, he knows quite well that the Air Ministry does not in any way under-rate the natural and considerable concern felt by the House and the public about aircraft accidents. But we feel that the public inquiry is not the right way to satisfy it. In the first place, the full investigation of an accident to a Service aircraft will generally involve constant reference to secret information&#x2014;such as the performance of the aircraft and what it was doing at the time.<br/>
Secondly, we feel that both witnesses and the court itself will give their views much more freely in private than in public. This point was explained by my predecessor in the full statement he made to the House on the accident at Tom's Hill, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, in January, 1954. I was deeply sorry to hear about the sadness then caused to the parents of one of the victims, but the story as recounted by the hon. Gentleman seems to reflect on administration rather than on the form which the inquiry took.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman himself, when he occupied the office which I now hold, was no doubt swayed himself by the same arguments. Of course, the outside observer's point of view naturally differs a little, but I am sure that anyone actually concerned with the running of the Service would feel as I do. There is no question of any desire to cover up. The basis of our view is that we get a franker, speedier and more effective investigation from a private inquiry than from a public one. We appreciate that this in no way detracts from the right of the House to be kept informed, and my right hon. Friend will continue, as he has done in the past,

to report to the House his conclusions about accidents of special public concern.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman particularly mentioned the Vulcan. My right hon. Friend answered a question on that today, to the effect that there are still inquiries going on and it is too early to give any additional information, but he will do so as soon as possible in the House.<br/>
I come now to the main topic&#x2014;the question of transport aircraft. I believe there is a widespread misapprehension on what is the primary r&#x00F4;le of Transport Command. The primary r&#x00F4;le is to provide a military air transport force available to all three Services, which can transport men and material into a theatre of active operations and provide them with logistic support on active service. It follows from that that the further we are from the danger of war, the more we are able to use Transport Command on day-to-day tasks. Conversely, the greater a threat becomes, the more we must collect, concentrate and conserve the force lest the risk become a reality and it be necessary to commit it to its primary r&#x00F4;le.<br/>
It is essential to bear this overall strategic concept in mind when examining the use which has been made of Transport Command during the Suez emergency. In fact, all the troop movement that has been done by air in this connection could have been carried out by Transport Command alone without recourse to civil charter aircraft had we wished to use the Command in this fashion. But how wrong we would have been to have done so.<br/>
We have never made any secret of the military value we place on the existence of a thriving civil air charter industry. In undisturbed times, they do our routine air trooping for us. As I said in the Air Estimates debate, in the year 1954&#x2013;55, 172,000 troops were carried by air, and 92 per cent. of them were moved by civil aircraft. Meanwhile, the aircraft of Transport Command&#x2014;again in undisturbed times&#x2014;are performing numerous functions which, for security or other reasons, are more suitable for military aircraft. But we do not like to commit too large a proportion of Transport Command to routine tasks. I would liken Transport Command in some ways to a fire service. There are certain functions


which a fire service is prepared to perform on a day-to-day basis, and it must, of course, be kept in constant training, but it is not part of its duty to use its fire engines, so to speak, as Green Line buses on routine scheduled services.<br/>
So it is with Transport Command. Both men and machines are kept in a constant state of readiness in case an emergency arises which cannot be met by civil aircraft, such as dropping parachutists and flying men and materials into an active theatre of operations. They perform many valuable day-to-day transport tasks, but one cannot expect a number of aircraft to fulfil two different tasks at one and the same time. They cannot be scattered all over the world on routine flights and at the same time provide a reserve of mobility for all three Services in case of urgent need.<br/>
It is the latter which we regard as the main task of Transport Command, and we must not lose sight of it. In other words, the greater and more imminent the danger the more necessary does it become to preserve the power of Transport Command, and the greater use do we make of the civil fleet.<br/>
This is what happened when the Suez crisis burst upon us. We have been able to provide the aircraft we needed by diverting civil aircraft which were already on charter to us, and by taking on other aircraft as and when they became available in the charter market. The efficiency and scale of effort of the independent operators and of B.O.A.C. did the greatest credit to civil aviation. With their cooperation we have been able to fulfil all the calls made on us without having to resort to any compulsory direction or requisition of aircraft.<br/>
Meanwhile Transport Command has been relieved of as many of its day-to-day duties as possible, and brought up to a peak of operational readiness lest the crisis should develop into war. Then, and only then, would be the moment to bring its full force to bear. That would be the testing time for which its strength must be conserved.<br/>
So much for the military r&#x00F4;le of transport aircraft. It would appear that there are many misconceptions on what can be asked of an air transport force. It should

be able to move troops and parachutists to a trouble spot with their personal equipment, close support weapons and such vehicles as they need for their immediate tactical support. But there are severe limitations on the type of operations which air lift can support. One cannot, for example, lift a Centurion tank in an aeroplane. There is no aircraft in the world that can carry one. It follows then that one cannot rely on an air transport force to mount an operation which requires the use of modern armour. It would also be unrealistic to suppose that we could keep an air transport force capable of committing to battle an infantry division which requires for its support vehicles numbered in thousands rather than in hundreds. We must rely on sea transport for movements on this scale.<br/>
So the sort of operation which can be mounted and supported solely by airlift is in the nature of things limited&#x2014;what might be described as a military policing operation most certainly, but not an operation which requires a large number of troops to be committed in the early stages together with their armour, heavy artillery and impedimenta.<br/>
I reject completely the allegation that the Suez crisis found either Transport Command or the civil air fleet wanting. The build-up of forces which the emergency required could never in our wildest dreams have been undertaken by air alone, and Transport Command was in no way a limiting factor in our precautionary preparations.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman has urged us to speed up the re-equipment of Transport Command with the most modern aircraft. We will never of course have all that we should like. I fully agree with him that Transport Command is becoming more and more a vital force in our strategic military thought, and I can assure him that nowhere is the importance of Transport Command in the general defence picture more appreciated than in the Air Ministry.<br/>
I told the House last March of our plans for re-equipment. Since then Comets and Beverleys have joined the force. More will come in next year, and in 1958 we shall be getting Britannias. We plan by March, 1959, to treble the airlift capacity compared with March, 1956, and, of course, speeds will be ever


so much higher. That is a very big improvement, and things are going along well.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman asked if we had learned lessons from the use of civil aircraft in the Suez emergency. Certainly we have learned lessons. I do not believe that we shall ever get a Secretary of State for Air or a Minister of Defence who is happy that he has enough at his disposal. But, broadly speaking, the machinery has worked extremely well. There are one or two minor improvements which we feel can be made, but there was no important factor which seemed to weigh against efficient operations in the field of air transport.<br/>
Finally, the hon. Gentleman suggested that Transport Command might be taken away from the Air Ministry and set up as an entity on its own after the fashion of the American M.A.T.S. He believed that that would render it more capable of providing the needs of all three Services and place it more directly under the control of the Minister of Defence.<br/>
At first blush that may seem to have certain attractions, but it would certainly also have many disadvantages. In fact, under present arrangements Transport Command is available to all three Services, and as a weapon it is in the hands of the Minister of Defence. Whenever there are conflicting demands for air transport it is the Chiefs of Staff and not the Air Ministry who advise the Minister of Defence what the priorities should be.<br/>
The difficulties of the hon. Gentleman's suggestions speak for themselves. If the transport force were to be removed from

the Air Ministry it would have to take with it to the Ministry of Defence all facilities for the formulation of operational requirements, for planning, manning, training and operational control. All these facilities exist anyway in the Air Ministry, and to set up this extra machinery would involve prohibitive overhead costs to administer a single Command. The hon. Gentleman asked&#x2014;</p>
