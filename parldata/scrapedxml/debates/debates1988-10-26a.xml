<p>I congratulate the Chancellor on his appointment, if not on that reply.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman will know that I have written to him about the employment effects of urban development corporations, as evidenced in the third report of the Select Committee on Employment. Will he have urgent consultations with Ministers in other Departments to reverse the pattern of job losses for local people under the London Docklands Development Corporation? Will he take specific interest in the planning application for Bombay wharf and surrounding area, which now threatens 70 traditional jobs for local people? Will he give some sign that we will get jobs for locals, not just for people coming in from outside?</p>

<p>I recall my correspondence with the hon. Gentleman, in which he will remember I made two points. First, I am responsible for the programmes and keep closely in touch with my Government colleagues who are concerned with them, but, secondly, the specific issues the hon. Gentleman raised about the Select Committee's report are really matters for the reply of the Department of the Environment to that report. He will understand that I would not want to pre-empt that.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman somewhat overplays his hand on local jobs. I understand that it is thought that among the projects that the LDDC has promoted since 1981 a total of 1,560 local jobs have been preserved and 2,120 created by LDDC grants to 200 firms. That is part of a much wider job creation which everyone would agree has occurred as a result of the LDDC's activity.<br/>
As for the hon. Gentleman's specific planning point, he will understand that I have no information about it this afternoon, but I shall look into what he said.</p>

<p>Can the Minister be satisfied with the levels of unemployment in most inner cities?

<p>No, I am not satisfied with the level of unemployment in inner city areas. The purpose of a large number of our programmes is to reduce it. I am happy to say that they are doing so with increasing success against the background of general economic resurgence. I shall not weary the hon.

<p>Is my right hon. Friend aware of the enormous investment going into the city of Birmingham, almost all of it from private enterprise?

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend and would also put the point the other way around.

<p>My hon. Friend will be aware that the enterprise initiative includes assistance with consultancy projects in key management skills essential for a competitive business. Those skills are marketing, design, quality, manufacturing technology, business planning and financial and information systems. In the nine months since we launched the enterprise initiative my Department has received over 12,500 applications for assisted consultancy, demonstrating strong business support for the service.</p>

<p>In welcoming my hon. Friend to his new job, may I ask him to note that there are more Scots on the Tory Benches at the moment than on the Labour Benches? They are clearly worried about Govan. I should like to ask my hon. Friend about the effect of the enterprise initiative.

<p>The general response shows that we are meeting the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. Over 90 per cent. of the applications for assisted consultancies have been from firms with fewer than 100 employees. We are on target to fulfil the promise in the White Paper of supporting 1,000 consultancies every month. I hope my hon. Friend accepts that that is good news and will carry that message back to his constituency and encourage as many companies as possible there to make applications.</p>

<p>Has my right hon. Friend noticed&#x2014;sorry, I am jumping the gun slightly. Has my hon. Friend noticed that his enterprise initiative is being emulated as far away as on the other side of the world by the Socialist Government of New Zealand, who are proposing to privatise their state airline? Has my hon. Friend had any representations on that specific subject from anyone on the Opposition Front Bench?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend will not be surprised to hear that representations from the Opposition on such matters are few and far between. I think he will agree that their ideas on these matters, if they ever existed, have long since run out and they have come to accept that the initiatives that we are taking under the enterprise initiative have been, and continue to be, a resounding success.</p>

<p>In August 1988 manufacturing output was at a level of 116&#x00B7;9, based on 1985 equal to 100. This is 5 per cent. more than the level of 111&#x00B7;1 for August 1973, but my hon. Friends will appreciate that monthly data can be erratic. A firmer based comparison would be that in the three months to August 1988 manufacturing output was 3&#x00B7;5 per cent. higher than in the same period in 1973. It was also 7 per cent. higher than in the three months to August 1987. Manufacturing output is at its highest ever level.</p>

<p>The record shows that, for example, between 1973 and 1979 manufacturing output fell by 4 per cent. However, having gone through a world recession, having restructured British industry and having achieved unprecedented levels of productivity and profitability, we are now well on the way to having an outstandingly successful manufacturing sector.</p>

<p>Yes, my hon. Friend has characteristically put his finger on an important problem, which is that whereas the Government accept full responsibility for keeping inflation as low as possible, and are doing so now, the private sector must bear the primary responsibility for wage restraint. Any increases in productivity may be prejudiced by excessively high wage settlements, which are causing much concern.</p>

<p>The Minister correctly warns about the erratic nature of some of the comparisons on manufacturing output. However, we should not be blind to the errors that occurred between 1979 and 1981, when two massive deflationary Budgets did so much damage and caused so much destruction in the manufacturing base. Is it not significant that many of the Government's figures, as shown by the Minister's response, are based on events since 1981 and not on events since 1979, when the Tory Government came to power?</p>

<p>I agree that the basis of comparison is of the essence, but I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider both the position that we found when we inherited Government in 1979, and the background of world recession. I hope he will agree that the progress that we have made since then has been remarkable, and the figures on manufacturing output, productivity and profitability show that we are on a long trend of success that will continue, even according to the Confederation of British Industry, into the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Is it not a pathetic reflection on the Government that manufacturing output is only now back to the level that it was when the Government came into power? Is the Minister proud of the Government's three records in manufacturing industry, which have produced


the first manufacturing deficit in our trade, the worst in one single month and, this year, the worst in one year? Will not the privatisation of industries such as steel make things even worse, by allowing firms to go for short-term profit, private closures and more steel imports?</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman seems to forget that the world continues to change and progress and that if we do not change and progress with it we have little or no chance of surviving.

<p>My hon. Friend is right to say that there are still a good many restrictive practices in the professions. The purpose of the new system of control that we proposed in the Green Paper earlier this year is to ensure that there is proper scrutiny of those restrictions so that the overall public interest can be established.

I believe that there is aid and trade provision agreement funding to be obtained for that ferry. Both these questions are of critical importance to my constituents who work in Kincaid and Ferguson.

<p>Part of the answer to the hon. Gentleman is precisely that which I have just given to the hon. Member for Sunderland, North (Mr. Clay). One must judge the position against the background of the likelihood that the ships will be built so that a profit and real jobs are provided. One must also look at the longer-term prospects, not just at the reports that the hon. Member for Dagenham (Mr. Gould) mentioned.<br/>
Perhaps it will be helpful if I say clearly to the House that British Shipbuilders received a number of bids for North-East Shipbuilders Ltd. by the deadline of 30 September, which are still being evaluated. Further additional information has also been submitted by some of the bidders, including a recent amendment to one of the bids. The Government are, of course, concerned&#x2014;I assure the hon.

Thereafter, I shall make a full statement to the House as soon as the evaluation is complete.</p>

<p>When the right hon.

<p>I cannot agree with the hon.

<p>DTI technology transfer activities include promotion of understanding and take-up of modern technologies and best practice techniques, various programmes of technology transfer from overseas and the establishment of the regional technology centres jointly with DES and the training agency. RTCs have now been established in most parts of the country. Subject to demonstration of industrial support, it is expected that further RTCs will be set up in early 1989. It is hoped that they will all be linked by a national network over the next year. A review of a number of DTI technology transfer activities has recently taken place and detailed announcements will be made later in the year. The new programmes will include a &#x00A3;12 million three-year programme to promote greater awareness in industry and commerce of the importance of open systems standards and the benefits that this can bring through the greater inter-working of IT systems.</p>

<p>I would rather look to the future than to the past, which is what the hon. Gentleman is in the habit of doing. I draw his attention to the fact that the recent Confederation of British Industry quarterly industrial trends survey shows that of 1,200 manufacturing companies, 40 per cent. plan to increase spending on plant and machinery over the next 12 months. That does not suggest to me that there is a problem. It is clear to all that, given the record levels of profitability of United Kingdom industry, the levels of investment are not only at record levels, but are likely to remain so. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will concede that we have liberated regional policy from the groove of automaticity where it has been stuck&#x2014;to which Opposition Members are so devoted&#x2014;by giving it a new impetus through our consultancy initiatives, which are spread throughout the regions.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon.

<p>I beg to ask leave to move the Adjournment of the House, under Standing Order No. 20, for the purpose of discussing a specific and important matter that should have urgent consideration, namely,<br/>
<q>an accident caused by the illegal dumping of a hazardous substance.</q>
Yesterday evening I was notified of a horrific accident involving five children of constituents of mine living in the Marus bridge area of Wigan. Jamie and Carmelle Anderson, aged 14 and 7, Darren Cook and Andrew James, aged 14, and Simon Young, aged 13, were engulfed in a fireball after a metal drum containing a lethal cocktail of toluene, xylene and menthanol exploded. Jamie, Carmelle and Darren are currently gravely ill in the burns unit of Booth Hall hospital near Manchester with up to 80 per cent. burns to their bodies. Andrew and Simon received burns to their hands and arms and, thankfully, they are comfortable. I am sure that the whole House will join with me in sending a message to those children and their parents, with its best wishes for the fullest possible recovery from their horrific injuries. [HON. MEMBERS: "Hear, hear."]<br/>
I have held preliminary discussions with Mr. John Wade, deputy director of the Health and Safety Executive. His initial response to the accident was immediate and his advisers attended the site of the incident, which occurred on scrubland near the children's homes. The initial investigation report indicates that the mixture of highly inflammable industrial waste had been dumped illegally. It is likely that the materials were used in the garage trade. The remains of a drum were found close to a "No tipping" sign erected on the land by Wigan metropolitan borough council.<br/>
The House must be concerned as to how many more such drums exist and where they have been dumped. It beggars belief that such an inflammable time bomb is ticking away, and that those five children may be the first in a series of innocent victims, either in Wigan or in the north-west in general. I ask the person or persons who dumped that toxic bomb to come forward and help the police and the Health and Safety Executive with their inquiries, and to advise them if any further waste has been dumped illegally and where it is before other innocent people are maimed or killed.<br/>
This horrific accident has again placed sharply in focus the need for tougher Government action to prevent illegal dumping of highly dangerous and toxic substances in this country.<br/>
I thank you, Mr. Speaker, and the House for listening with such courtesy and patience. I have personally found the circumstances of this tragedy distressing. My words are in no way adequate in voicing my feelings and those of the families concerned about the condition of the children affected and the horrific circumstances surrounding them, and the feelings of their parents about what has happened to their children as a result of disgraceful and inexcusable action by the person or persons concerned, who have flouted the law and have allowed such a disgraceful thing to happen.</p>

<q>That leave be given to bring in a Bill to permit the conclusion of agreements between solicitors or barristers and their clients in civil cases under which the latter may be represented on a contingency fee basis, and to remove all restrictions inhibiting such practice.</q>
Many of us are very proud of our system of justice, and we are right to be proud of most aspects of the system. However, there is one aspect of our civil justice system that rightly calls for the concern of this House. Quite simply, the problem is that too few people have access to it.<br/>
If one is a multi-millionaire there can be little difficulty in commissioning all the legal services required. If one is poor enough to qualify for legal aid, that assures representation&#x2014;although not necessarily exactly the sort of representation that would be chosen if one could pay for it. However, for the broad mass of the population who fall between those two categories a decision to seek justice by going to law is, in effect, a decision to toy with the risk of financial catastrophe for both that person and his family. The cost of litigation has become so high that a few days in court can wipe out&#x2014;or even more than wipe out&#x2014;all that a hard-working man or woman may have accumulated throughout a lifetime.<br/>
That position is most unsatisfactory and we should do something about it. It is unsatisfactory for two reasons &#x2014;first, for those who lose because they cannot go to justice when they are entitled to do so and are therefore denied the justice that they would otherwise have.

<p>One thinks of libel, the victims of professional negligence, the victims of medical negligence, and the victims of flawed pharmaceutical products. All such people, if they fall within the broad mass category of the population, would find it exceedingly difficult and risky to go to law.<br/>
Some hon. Members may already be afraid, and some hon. Members may hope, that I am about to propose some measure arbitrarily to reduce the cost of litigation and to reduce legal fees by legislative fiat. I reassure hon. and learned Members who may be concerned about my intentions that they are certainly not of a nefarious and villainous kind. My proposed solution is far better. It is simply that, when they wish and when their clients so choose, lawyers should be allowed to come to an arrangement to represent their clients, whether as solicitors or barristers, on the basis of contingency fees. That is to say that a solicitor or barrister would agree to take a pre-arranged share of any damages that his client might be awarded in the event of his suit being successful. In the event of failure, he would take nothing&#x2014;no win, no fee.<br/>
I emphasise that what I am proposing is a purely permissive measure. It is not prescriptive in any way. It would be open to lawyers and their clients to continue to come to an arrangement on the basis of their conventional time-based fees and other fees that operate at present. But let us make no mistake about it: my Bill would outlaw


&#x2014;perhaps I should say disbar&#x2014;the restrictive practices currently operated by the Law Society and by the Bar Council that prevent their members from coming to that arrangement even when they might wish to do so.<br/>
I shall deal briefly with the objections that are sometimes raised in respect of contingency fees. The first is that it would undermine lawyers' objectivity. That is a strange objection. Our whole system of adversarial justice is based on the recognition that lawyers are not objective &#x2014;they are on the side of their clients, and quite properly so&#x2014;and that it is their obligation to pursue their clients' interests with all the energies and skills at their disposal as far as they can within the law. That is an important qualification.<br/>
The obligations of lawyers to the law and the formal responsibility of barristers to a court would not be changed in any way by the proposals in my Bill. I would regard it as an extreme and unacceptable slur on the legal profession to assume that, because lawyers are materially indifferent to the results of their actions on behalf of their clients, they are less loyal to their clients than they would be under a contingency fee system.<br/>
The second objection is that contingency fees would bring forth an escalation of damages awarded in civil cases. That objection is based on a false analogy with the system in the United States and the confusion between two quite separate and distinct features of the United States legal system. They have contingency fees in the United States, but they have something else which we do not have and which I would not seek to introduce, and that is juries fixing damages. Juries fixing damages, not contingency fees, have led to the great inflation of damages in the United States.<br/>
Under my proposals, arrangements for lawyers' remuneration and the formula used by a lawyer to arrange his remuneration with his client would remain as it should be&#x2014;entirely irrelevant to the principles on which a jury fixes damages.<br/>
A third objection to contingency fees is that they would bring forth a great deal of unnecessary and purely vexacious litigation. That objection rests on the most pessimistic assumptions about either the level of competence or the rationality of the legal profession.

Surely, unless one makes the most perverse assumptions about lawyers&#x2014;I have the highest regard for their professional competence and rationality&#x2014;the effect of my Bill would be exactly the reverse. No lawyer in his right mind would take on a contingency fee basis a case which was purely frivolous or any case other than one which he had a good chance of winning, and so was, in his professional judgment, a good case.<br/>
My Bill would abolish the conflict of interests between lawyers and their clients that exists under our present system. It is without a doubt a purely theoretical conflict, but under the present system a lawyer being indifferent to the result of a case might be considered to have an incentive to push his client to pursue a frivolous or hopeless action because he would nevertheless receive a fee. That is a purely theoretical danger, and I do not suppose for a moment that any lawyer has ever fallen victim to that temptation. The integrity of the legal profession has been and undoubtedly will continue to be more than proof against such temptation. Nevertheless, it is better to abolish a temptation than to resist it. That is the principle which we as legislators should adopt in this case.<br/>
My Bill would promote the interests of justice and the confidence of the British people that they will have access to civil justice if ever they need it. It would be in the interests of lawyers and their clients, and I have great pleasure in commending it to the House.</p>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I tried to catch your eye earlier on this matter. You will agree that Question Time is precious to Back Benchers because it is our one opportunity to question Ministers on specific subjects. You will notice that the last question we reached today, No. 21, was on the important topic of the Scotch whisky industry. That question cannot be put to a Scottish Minister and must be answered by the United Kingdom Department that deals with these matters. You will also be aware that during Question Time Members were not given an opportunity to ask questions because of the many interruptions. That reduced the time available. Otherwise&#x2014;</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
Section 71 of the Race Relations Act 1976 places local authorities under a statutory obligation to carry out their duties with regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups. The Government and, I hope, the House, agree wholeheartedly with the terms of that section and consider that the new housing agency, Scottish Homes, should be subject to the same provisions. I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

<p>We welcome the fact that the Race Relations Act 1976 will apply to Scottish Homes. I wonder whether the principle could he extended to the composition of the agency? It seems unfortunate that representative Scots seem to be excluded and discriminated against in that composition. The Government have had to go to New York to find a chairman for it, and to England to find a chief executive, and another member of Scottish Homes, our old friend the Earl of Ancram, was last seen carrying a carpet bag around Epping Forest. It would be useful if the members of Scottish Homes could have some rights&#x2014;if there could be discrimination in favour of people who are resident in Scotland, who intend to continue to reside there and who are representative of its people.<br/>
This said, we obviously support the extension of the provisions of the Race Relations Act to Scottish Homes.</p>

<p>The amendments have been tabled to correct an omission that is principally of a technical nature.

But the corporation also has certain obligations in relation to land held by unregistered housing associations and those obligations should also be transferred to Scottish Homes in cases in which the land is in Scotland.

<p>Amendment No. 4 made in another place, amended clause 16(1) of the Bill. That clause defines the circumstances in which a statutory assured tenancy arises, and amendment No. 4 added to the list the right of succession for the spouse of an assured tenant which Lords Amendment No. 18 introduces.<br/>
However, the provision needs to be amended further because of the recasting of clause 43 and schedule 6 of the Bill with which Lords Amendments No. 38, 39 and 76 are concerned. This amendment does this.<br/>
The Government amendment is a technical one to take account of changes to the provisions in succession made on succession to regulated tenancies in another place.</p>

<p>When the Minister disagrees with a Lords amendment it brings a whole new flavour to the concept of relationships between the two Houses, because his brother is the Duke of Hamilton. Therefore, this is something of a family dispute.<br/>
The amendment deals with the right of a widow to succeed, and it has been portrayed by the Government as a concession. It shows how many concessions have been made to landlords against the interests of tenants in Scotland when the re-establishment of the right of a widow to succeed to the tenancy is presented by the Government as an important concession.<br/>
The Government's concession is little more than a fig leaf and greatly qualified because it applies only to the initial tenant's widow. Under subsection (2), the widow of a successor tenant will have no rights whatever. If a tenant dies and his widow succeeds to the tenancy and then remarries, the second spouse will have no rights and on another death the landlord would be able to repossess the house. That means that by no means all widows or widowers will be protected by the provision.<br/>
I draw to the attention of the House the representations made by, among others, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations Ltd., expressing grave concern about the erosion of spouses' rights under the legislation. The amendment falls far short of what the federation called for and it is worried about the impact on future relationships between housing associations and tenants.<br/>
The Lords amendment is a slight improvement, but the new legislation still represents a serious erosion of tenants' rights and security, and many widows will face summary eviction in Scotland under the new assured tenancy system. I commend my amendments (a) and (b) to Lords amendment No. 18 because at least they would lift that threat. I should like to hear the Government's opinion of those amendments.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy us on the points made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). I should like to ask the Minister about the position of a widow or widower of a tenant who had died. If I understand the Government's intentions correctly, the new spouse of that widow or widower would not be allowed to continue the tenancy of the house when his or her spouse died. I cannot understand the logic of that, because it would mean that the spouse had not only lost his or her partner but had lost the home as well. Is that what the Government intend to do to people? Do they not realise that in many cases the people involved will be elderly, because of the late marriage of a widow and a widower which often occurs?<br/>
I can understand a lack of appreciation of these difficulties by people who live in several houses, none of which is let and all of which they own. Will the Government come into the real world and try to concern themselves with ordinary people for whom such a problem would be extremely serious?</p>

<p>Will the Minister explain what is the present position in law? Is it the case that the succession of spouses is not affected by whether the person who has died succeeded to the tenancy from his previous spouse? There is a serious weakening of the statutory position under the Bill. At the moment there is no discrimination if one is the spouse of the tenant who died and one succeeds to that tenancy. However, that simple position is being eroded by the Government's amendment.<br/>
I should like the Minister to clarify another point. If, for example, a tenant dies, the spouse remarries and there are children from that remarriage, is it the case, under what the Minister has suggested, that both the spouse who succeeds and the children of that second marriage will have no security of tenure and could be required by the

landlord to surrender the tenancy because of this amendment? I am worried that that may happen. In the guise of introducing technical amendments&#x2014;the Minister actually said that it was a technical amendment&#x2014;the Government are seriously undermining the position of tenants.<br/>
I know that Lord Sanderson of Bowden, who has responsibility in the other place for Scottish housing, said that the purpose of the Bill was to build on the rights given to tenants in the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Amendment Act 1984 and not to take away tenants' rights. However, Labour Members do not believe that that will happen, and neither does the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, which said that the Government are giving only basic minimum rights to tenants under the new assured tenancies and short assured tenancies. What the Minister said seemed to confirm the SFHA's worries. I do not see how we can add to a tenant's rights, or secure tenant's rights by taking away rights that they already have in existing statutes, but that is what the Minister appears to be doing.<br/>
In Scotland, widows and widowers who are left to pick up tenancies already have serious problems with which to deal. In my surgery last Friday night, I had two different cases. One lady came in and said that her husband had died, her grown-up family had left and she did not know how she could afford to heat the house, but if she went back on the waiting list she would be given a house in a part of a town to which she did not wish to move because of the neglect there resulting from lack of Government funds to local councils. She felt trapped in her house and unable to meet the heating bills and unsure whether she could heat her home over the winter. Another case was of a widow who had been left in a house with a huge garden which she did not know how she could cope with, but she did not want to move on to the waiting list because she could not be assured that she would get the kind of housing that she would want.<br/>
The Minister is suggesting that in a number of cases, certainly in the private sector, people will not be able to stay in their houses and, as well as coping with the death of their spouses, they will have to cope with the problem of finding new accommodation for themselves, and perhaps for their families, because the Minister has taken away from them the right to succeed to the tenancy that their dead spouse had enjoyed.<br/>
The Minister will have to explain why he can leave somebody in the position of having to cope not only with a family bereavement but with the problem of finding new accommodation for themselves and their families. The Minister is suggesting that we should agree to that, but I do not believe that any hon. Member would accept that diminution of the rights of tenants. That is particularly so in the private sector, of which Conservative Members claim to be in favour and which they want to encourage. Here, they are attacking private sector tenants and taking away their rights, which are taken for granted in the public sector. I should like to see the day when the Minister and the Tory Members start to give private sector tenants the same rights as those enjoyed by the public sector tenants.</p>

<p>I listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said, and I find myself in sympathy with much of what he said about the problems of individuals who find themselves in houses that are unsuitable for their


requirements. That often happens if one is locked into the cycle of council accommodation. Frequently, children grow up and leave home&#x2014;the normal events of life&#x2014;parents are left, one dies, and the remaining parent is left with a property that contains more bedrooms and other rooms than are required.<br/>
Quite often&#x2014;the hon. Member for Dundee, East drew attention to this&#x2014;people are left with large gardens with which they cannot cope. It would be marvellous if one could say that local authorities respond quickly to such situations, but, sad to say, the experience of most hon. Members is that local authorities often leave individuals in these circumstances for long periods, sometimes years, before transferring them to more suitable accommodation.<br/>
I can speak from some experience of private letting. I grew up, in the early stages of my life, in a privately let house in Dundee. In those days, private landlords could get adequate returns on their lettings. My experience, and that of my family, was that the private landlord system worked sympathetically to the kind of problem to which the hon. Member for Dundee, East has drawn attention. However, much has happened since then. I see that the hon. Gentleman is shaking his head. I do not know whether he ever lived in such circumstances before the 1939 war, because if he did, he would know that I am talking about the period before the legislative changes that wrought havoc with private letting, certainly in Dundee.<br/>
Interestingly, the legislation was intended to do good, but it had the opposite effect. It removed from the market place altogether private sector letting, which had successfully provided homes for the majority of tenanted premises, certainly in Dundee. I cannot talk about elsewhere, but in that city, which I know well, it worked. I hope&#x2014;I would not go any higher than that&#x2014;that the legislative changes in the Bill will do something to remove some of the imbalances that have occurred, and release more property for letting.<br/>
I should like to think that, in doing so, we are taking on board the problems that were highlighted by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. I hope that the Lords amendment that we are rejecting and the amendment that we are putting in its place will provide a much more sympathetic regime for the kind of problems that the hon. Member for Dundee, East has highlighted. If that is not so, I shall be distressed because we must find a way to improve the lot of people who have to live in rented premises. We must ensure that the private sector, as well as the public sector, provides the right kind of accommodation in the right places and at the prices that people can afford.<br/>
If all that happens, the Bill will be a success. If it does not and we do not leave a better position than we found, I shall he saddened. However, I am optimistic, because, having sat through the Standing Committee on the Bill and worked carefully through the Bill, I believe that much of what is in it is progressive. It is intended to improve the lot of people who have to live in the circumstances that we have been discussing. I am not interested in political rhetoric. It is easy to indulge in that, but I am much more concerned about the lot of those who will require sympathy, understanding and the opportunity, if it can be arranged, for a transfer to more suitable accommodation.</p>

<p>Like the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), I started life in a rented house&#x2014;a council one built in the 1920s&#x2014;but the conclusions that I reached about the necessity for public

housing are very different from his. In Committee, every time a tenant's right was removed, I referred to it. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) rightly made the distinction between the Government's attitude to tenants in the private sector and their attitude to those in the public sector. It seems that, while the latter are to be given rights, the main one being the right to buy their houses, when, under this Bill, they are forced into the private sector, such rights are removed. I do not understand that motivation. I do not see how it can be seen as an improvement of the rights of the individual in Scotland to remove rights when tenants are forced to transfer.<br/>
The hon. Member for Tayside, North said that he did not want to indulge in rhetoric; he wanted to consider the facts. We must ask the Minister to give us some facts. In view of the Government's opposition to what appears to be a sensitive and apt Lords amendment, which more or less deals with the present position and gives some right of protection to spouses in rented accommodation, I am most concerned about the practical implications if the proposal is defeated. I want the Minister to tell us what the implications are for individuals and local authorities.<br/>
The Government are encouraging the removal of housing stock from the public sector. We heard earlier this week&#x2014;I am sure the matter will be raised later today&#x2014;about the transfer of large numbers of Scottish Special Housing Association houses in the Borders to a new trust. That appears to be the future trend. We must consider the implications of the transfer of large numbers of houses to the private sector. The local authorities will have no houses left. It appears that they will not be given nomination rights in those transfers, but, as I understand it, they will still retain the obligation to house the homeless.<br/>
If the Government have their way, we shall have a device that will create homelessness. It appears that the landlord will be entitled to remove a tenant, not because of the actions of that tenant&#x2014;for example, in failing to pay the rent or because he is a bad or anti-social tenant&#x2014;but for the simple reason that the person who was the formal tenant, in the sense that he or she held the lease, has died. That will be the sole reason for removing that person. He will not be entitled to stay in the house. The landlord may remove him for whatever purpose&#x2014;for example, to sell the house or to let it to another tenant at a higher rent or on different leasing terms. Obviously, therefore, there will be an incentive for the landlord.<br/>
The local authority will not have the necessary housing stock to rehouse that person. Even if the local authority has housing stock, what will be its obligaton to the tenant? Will he be given priority in terms of housing need? Under the present homeless persons legislation, a test of vulnerability is applied. Will that tenant be a vulnerable tenant, or will he be classified as intentionally homeless? What will be the tenant's situation under this newly created right to evict? The Government are giving landlords the right to evict tenants from their homes for the simple reason that the existing leaseholder has died.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Minister will help me and explain whether, in the case of a family where a spouse or parents have died, a remaining member of the family will be allowed to succeed to the tenancy. Contrary to what the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said, it is not always necessary to


rehouse someone because the rooms or the garden have become too large for them to maintain. Many families have lived and grown up in a public sector house and are sad and reluctant to leave it because it is their home.<br/>
I am concerned that, for example, a 50-year-old son or daughter, who has been living with his or parents in that house, would be removed. It seems harsh that somebody who has lived in a house and loved his home all his life should suddenly find himself being put out. I should have thought that it was a great worry for many parents if they thought that, when they died, their child, of whatever adult age, was not able to succeed to the tenancy.</p>

<p>The vast expanses on the Government Benches as we discuss the Bill are a visible, if silent, testimony to the ridiculousness of the Bill. I was ill-fated enough to be a member of the Committee that considered the Bill and similar circumstances prevailed then, with Conservative Members writing out their Christmas cards, sending letters to their constituents and disappearing down the Corridor. However, when the Division bell rang, they thundered back in their artificial majority, buttressed by London barristers who knew nothing about Scottish housing and cared even less about it. Four Conservative Members are present, yet, if a Division is called on this vital amendment, hundreds of Conservative Members who know nothing about this legislation will arrive to ram through in the Lobby the Government's proposals to attack Scottish housing.</p>

<p>Let me take up the hon. Gentleman's comments about the Committee and what I took to be his views on the conduct of Conservative Members in Committee. I trust that he will not suggest that I and my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), who is here today, were not active in Committee. If that is what he is suggesting, I suggest that he reads <i>Hansard.</i> He will find that, as I have endeavoured to do in every Committee of which I have been a member, I tried to participate constructively and to be helpful to Ministers and to the people who sent me to Parliament. I view that as a serious commitment, so I take the hon. Gentleman's comments as being out of place.</p>

<p>My comments are not at all out of place as I readily concede the omnipresence of the hon. Gentleman in Committee. He was so active and rabid in his contributions in Committee that we were contemplating bringing a straitjacket to restrain him from making attacks on tenants, local authorities and even on the berry pickers of Blairgowrie who felt the rough end of his tongue.<br/>
For that reason, I wanted to follow the remarks made by the hon. Gentleman a few moments ago. I have heard him before on his trip down memory lane about the halcyon days of the private landlord. I too am from Dundee and used to deliver milk to the hon. Gentleman's house in Dundee.</p>

<p>That is why I did not doctor the milk, as I might otherwise have done. However, it was not the milk

of human kindness that I was delivering or that the hon. Gentleman has been delivering on the issue of Scottish housing, both in Committee and here today.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman is taking a trip down a memory lane that does not exist. His memory is playing tricks on him. There never was a time when private landlordism provided the kind of services that he, in Committee and again today, has said it has. There never was a time when private landlords were in it for any other reason than to squeeze every last penny out of the poor people in their clutches who could not get out of their clutches. The private landlords in Dundee and throughout Scotland were bloodsuckers.<br/>
The mask slips when we hear the hon. Member for Tayside, North. He revealed the real purpose of the Bill, which is to turn the clock back to the so-called halycon days when the private landlord was king. The Bill has nothing to do with liberating Scottish tenants or increasing the Scottish housing supply. Instead, it is all about giving some fast bucks to private landlords by resurrecting the housing system which existed, as the hon. Member for Tayside, North said, before the 1939 war. That was a revealing phrase. The Government are returning the pattern of housing tenure in Scotland to that which existed before the second world war.<br/>
I was born in an attic in Atholl street, in the Irish quarter of Dundee, which is known as Tipperary. The address was No. 12A Athol] street. My mother and father and I spent the first part of my life in an attic in a slum tenement. My experience, therefore, is far more common than the mythical memory-lane experience of the hon. Member for Tayside. North. I have heard him in Committee set out the trip up The Hawkie and doon The Blackie, as we say in Dundee. It is true that there were tiled closes up The Hawkie and especially down The Blackie. The majority of tenants, however&#x2014;hundreds of thousands in the private sector in Dundee and other cities&#x2014;were not living in tiled closes in either The Hawkie or The Blackie. Instead, they were living in the rabbit warrens of the Overgate and the teeming slums of Hilltown, Hullgate and Lochee. It is to that pattern of housing, but in a sanitised form&#x2014;literally, I hope, as well as metaphorically&#x2014;that Conservative Members wish to take us.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. Gentleman will confirm that he was born after the legislation to which I referred was enacted. That is the legislation that was put on the statute book immediately after the 1945 war. That changes substantially the circumstances that I was talking about and the ones from which he suffered. I accept that he suffered.</p>

<p>I was born in 1954, an auspicious year in many ways. It is true that the legislation that was enacted by the Labour Government from 1945 to 1951 began to change the pattern of housing tenure in Scotland. It could not wipe out at a stroke the sort of slums that I am describing, but the Labour Government made efforts to get rid of them. The difference between that Government and this one is that the present Government seek to return us to the so-called halcyon days that existed before the 1939 war, to use the revealing phrase of the hon. Member for Tayside, North.<br/>
The Government should be aware&#x2014;I have written to them, and I am certain that other hon. Members have done so&#x2014;that there is a great deal of anxiety in Scotland among


those who have heard rumours, perhaps misleading ones, about reduced rights of succession. I know that the Minister is a decent cove and will be concerned to set people's minds at rest. There is a specific problem for the spouse who succeeds on the death of her husband or of his wife. Such people are anxious and will be listening to the debate. They will he waiting for the Minister to give them the appropriate information. They will be anxious to know what their rights of succession will be, and the rights of their families, if they remarry.<br/>
The Conservative party claims to be the party of marriage, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer introduced a marriage Budget earlier in the year. Are we to place barriers in the way of widows and widowers that will stop them marrying because of their fears that by so doing they will adversely affect their rights of succession? Are we to encourage widows and widowers to live outside marriage but with partners so as to safeguard their rights of succession?<br/>
Surely the Minister is not that sort of person. When he responds, I hope that he will not say that he can meet the problem half way. I hope that he will send to those in Scotland who are anxious about this issue the message that the rights of succession of spouses who remarry will not be adversely affected and that the Government accept the amendments that seek to protect those rights.</p>

<p>I am not clear what the main burden of the speech of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) was all about. He should realise that there have been housing difficulties in Scotland for a very long time, and certainly since the war.<br/>
It is no use blaming one Government or another. Whatever Government have been in power, those of us who have held constituency surgeries over many years have found that about 50 per cent. of those seeking advice have been raising housing issues, ranging from dampness to the lack of a house, and including the problems that result from having bad neighbours.<br/>
It has been the prime worry of all hon. Members, local councils and Ministers that the housing stock in Scotland has been inadequate. It has not been of sufficient quality and there must be ways of improving it.<br/>
When we seek ways of improving the housing stock, we end up with a Bill of this sort. It is disappointing that the Opposition have attacked a genuine attempt to improve the condition of the housing stock, thus adversely affecting the opportunities of those who wish to be tenants in Scotland under one guise or another. When we have an opportunity to improve matters through local authorities, various forms of private housing and Scottish Homes, for example, we should try to proceed constructively and not look on the black side of every proposal that is made. Most of the Government's proposals are the result of detailed consultation.<br/>
Everyone who has participated in the debate seems to have claimed some connection with Dundee. I suppose that I must throw in my claim, for I was educated at Dundee. I attended a distinguished Dundee school of economics under the redoubtable Dr. Bowie. From time to time, the local council has had under its control hundreds of houses of poor quality which have been unoccupied, and that is the sort of thing that we want to try to avoid.<br/>
The Minister is right to bring forward a Bill that is full of constructive ideas. It is wrong for the Opposition to spend the debate&#x2014;this is what they did in Committee&#x2014;

trying to shoot down every good idea, however advantageous each one may he to the people of Scotland, who must have the opportunity to live in better homes. The Bill's objective is to provide those homes for them, and that is why I support it.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, I shall respond to the contribution of the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), who has temporarily left the Chamber. The Government are proposing disagreement with Lords amendment No. 4, which is essentially technical. We fully support Lords amendment No. 18, which gives the spouse of an assured tenant a statutory right to succeed for the tenancy.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked me to clarify the current position. The amendment applies only to assured tenants, and only the spouse of the first tenant succeeds. That is relevant also to the questions of the hon. Members for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) and for Argyll and Bute ( Mrs. Michie).</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman is correct that the Bill will narrow succession rights. That I am prepared to admit.<br/>
The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) stated that the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations is expressing concern. Housing associations have every right to grant greater succession rights than exist in statutes if they wish, and I should expect them to do so. They are preparing a model tenancy agreement, which will be extremely important.<br/>
4.30 pm<br/>
During consideration of the Bill, we were ready to consider improvements at all stages, but the keynote of our policy was the revitalisation of the private rented sector, which now stands at approximately 6 per cent. Many organisations in Scotland were concerned about succession and how to get the balance right. The Government originally took the view that succession rights, like other tenancy terms, should be left for negotiation between tenant and landlord. I remain convinced that many landlords letting on assured tenancies will be happy to include such terms in their leases.<br/>
However, we have accepted that when a tenant dies, his or her spouse is in a particularly vulnerable position and with that in mind we introduced Lords amendment No. 18, which allows a limited right of succession to a spouse of an original tenant who, immediately before the tenant's death, stayed with the tenant in a home that was their only or main home.<br/>
I should like to answer the point made by the hon. Member for Dundee, East. We propose a limitation on the right of succession not because we do not recognise that the spouse of a tenant will also be in a vulnerable position on the tenant's death, but because excessive succession rights of the type proposed by the Opposition would hinder the expansion of the private rented sector. We have very much in mind the fact that almost 130,000 houses in Scotland are vacant, the majority being in the private sector. We want a considerable proportion of them to be brought back into use.</p>

<p>We know that the Minister is seeking to bend over backwards to encourage private landlords to rent so that they can profiteer and do more or less what they like. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged the vulnerability of a widow or widower at the time of bereavement. Will he confirm that the Government amendment would mean that the widow of a successor tenant could simply be summarily evicted?</p>

<p>That is the position and the answer is yes, but it is important that a tenant entering a tenancy agreement should negotiate the best possible arrangements, taking the circumstances into account.<br/>
What is wrong with the Opposition amendments to Lords amendment No. 18 is that they would give a tenant's spouse a right of succession even though she or he was not living in the house concerned, or used it as a second home. I do not see how that can be regarded as reasonable. The amendments of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) would open the door to the possibility of an unlimited series of statutory successions to the same assured tenancy. For that reason, the Government cannot accept the amendments.<br/>
I listened carefully to the views expressed by Opposition Members and I recognise that they feel strongly about the issue, but we disagree with their amendments. As my hon. Friends the Members for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) and for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said, it is important to bring empty houses back into use and to revitalise the private rented sector. We believe that the greatest benefit to all those who are seeking homes of their own will derive from encouraging private landlords to let vacant property. That encouragement will not come about if we open the door to unlimited successions in the way that the Opposition propose.</p>

<p>In the year and a bit since I have been in the House, I have not heard such a pathetic justification for a measure that will attack people who are faced with bereavement and give them the unenviable choice of trying to seek alternative accommodation, in the knowledge that if, having remarried, they pass on, their new husband or wife could not succeed to the house.<br/>
It is an outrage that somebody who suffers bereavement and falls in love in later life&#x2014;although it may not necessarily be in later life&#x2014;will be affected in that way. We all have constituents&#x2014;I see my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) nodding&#x2014;who have suffered bereavement. In Dundee and Aberdeen there have been tremendous catastrophes, which have left many young women widowed.<br/>
If the widows of men who lost their lives in the Piper Alpha disaster lived in such tenancies, remarried at the age of 22, 23 or 24 and themselves suffered a catastrophe, their new husbands and any young children they had could be thrown out onto the streets by caring landlords such as those described by the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and the Minister.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend seems to me to be putting his thumb on the nub of the issue. I appeal to the Minister to do better than the pitiful explanation that he gave. As Nye Bevan said&#x2014;and it is a truism in politics &#x2014;"Where there is death, there is hope."<br/>
The Government seem to be saying that excessive succession rights&#x2014;as the Minister called them&#x2014;will be a

disincentive to the burgeoning of the private rented sector. That implies not only that people may remarry for the sake of securing rights of succession to a house but that they might do in a spouse to get their grubby hands on the tenancy.</p>

<p>I thank my hon. Friend for that most helpful intervention.<br/>
We see in front of us a Minister who has been praised &#x2014;wrongly, it seems&#x2014;for being a compassionate man, but who, after 70 or 80 hours of debate in Committee and after more debate in the other place, comes to the House and tells us that widows and widowers who remarry while living in such statutorily assured tenancies and then die cannot pass on the tenancy to their husband or wife.

<p>Although it embarrasses me somewhat to mention it, I think that I should relate some of my own experience, which my hon. Friend may find helpful. I am a widow and when I suffered the loss of my husband, at least the security of my home was beyond question. If, in addition to that sorrow, I had had to be thrown out of my home, I think that I would have lost my mind.<br/>
It is horrendous that Conservative Members could do this to secure the rights of private sector landlords. It is an outrage and I hope that the whole of Britain will notice it. It is unbelievable. However, the Minister has yet to explain in what way the private landlord benefits from having one tenant rather than another. He is saying clearly that private sector landlords matter more than people who are bereaved and are suffering.</p>

<p>I shall give way&#x2014;The truth of what I have said is acknowledged by the fact that the hon. Gentleman makes no intervention.<br/>
Landlords now are no different from those whom successive Governments, up to this one, have done so much to try to drive out of business.<br/>
It is rather ironic that I should be speaking today, as this is the closing date for landlords to take advantage &#x2014;under the Government's business expansion scheme&#x2014;of 60 per cent. tax relief and all the capital gains on that to foster private landlordism. The tragedy is that the clause works hand in hand with the private landlord&#x2014;for the sake of private profit&#x2014;to ensure that a minimum of obstacles are placed in the way of his letting a property for


the maximum and ensuring that people are moved out, or at least do not have absolute security in a variety of circumstances in which they have it now.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman obviously was not listening when I talked about the two-year-old milkman delivering milk to me when I lived in Linlathen. I said that legislation had changed circumstances and that private housing which used to be plentiful had disappeared. There are many empty houses which we want to bring on to the market, and the legislation is designed to do precisely that. It is not intended to be a replacement or an alternative to existing legislation; it is intended to add to it.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman should come with me to my constituency, which might be called a typical Conservative constituency in that it has probably one of the highest densities of private landlordism combined with home ownership. He should see the people, too old and frail to come to my ward interviews or surgeries, whom I visit in Morningside and Marchmont. They are living in the houses&#x2014;with window frames painted the standard green, like the leather benches in the Chamber&#x2014;owned by the big private landlords in Edinburgh. They find it difficult to get repairs done by those so-called compassionate landlords whom Conservative Members have praised in the past, are praising now and wish to expand in the future.<br/>
Worries about rent levels have been heaped on tenants by the Government's withdrawal of housing benefit, as the Secretary of State found when he visited Govan yesterday and spoke to a pensioner who told him that he now has to pay &#x00A3;50 of his rent instead of &#x00A3;30. We need not look back to the past; we see terrible problems today. Compassionate hon. Members who represent constituencies such as mine see them daily when they visit their constituents.<br/>
The Minister has woefully failed to address himself to these difficulties. I am speaking now rather than earlier because I thought that my points were being made far better by my hon. Friends, and felt sure that the Minister would take on board what they said. But he brazenly said that he and his party care not a whit for the widow or widower in such terrible circumstances. The charge may be made&#x2014;we have not heard it yet, perhaps because not many Conservative Members are present to intervene&#x2014;that we are constructing an exaggerated scenario involving cases that are unlikely to occur, and that the chances of a widow's obtaining a tenancy and then remarrying are slim. If the chances are so slim&#x2014;one in 100,000, or one in a million&#x2014;there is surely no problem about accepting the amendment. It cannot be a disincentive.<br/>
Pressure has been put on the Minister by his friends the private property speculators not to change the position because they know that this is not uncommon in the areas that we represent, where private landlordism is fairly prevalent. The fact that it is not uncommon means that the safeguard that we are urging on the Minister is more important than ever. We know that the Minister has sought to cloak his wish to protect and expand private landlordism and private profit in talk of security, when security has been removed. We know that the Government have made no provision not only for spouses who may find themselves homeless but for the children of the newly widowed, who may find themselves out on the street

because of a rule that can be pointed to by a landlord. The case can go to the sheriff, who will have no discretion or choice in the matter.<br/>
Is there a massive pool of other housing in either the rented sector or for purchase? No. Most people rent privately only because they cannot get on to council waiting lists, which have tragically doubled in Scotland under the present Government, or because they cannot afford the extortionate, record mortgage rates that the Government have imposed in 1980 and this year.<br/>
4.45 pm<br/>
The very people who could be flung out because of this wicked measure are being deprived of the opportunity of applying for council houses because the Government starved them of resources between 1979 and 1983. Any council will tell us that the backlog from those years is so great that, even if spending is greater than it was then, councils are still being starved of resources. They are not able to build houses to house the homeless, and people are unable to enter the housing market, especially in cities such as Edinburgh but no doubt in many other areas as well, because prices have shot up.<br/>
The Minister's failure to comment was an appalling omission. What does he expect people to do&#x2014;not just, the new widow or widower, but the children who have been thrown out on the streets? Does he not think that the rights of thousands of people should be greater than those of a few hundred private landlords?</p>

<p>I speak on the basis of solidarity with my Scottish colleagues, as a member of Standing Committee G which dealt for four months with the English and Welsh legislation. The destruction of succession rights has run through both Bills, and we have been trying to understand the reasoning behind this vicious, nasty legislation. In fact, it is all about market forces in the private sector.<br/>
The property will already be in the private sector, and on the tenant's death it will remain in the private sector. Eviction will not add a single house to the market, as the house will already be in the market place, available for rent, and indeed will be tenanted on the basis that it is in the private sector. The Minister's argument does not hold water. There is no incentive.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is quite correct, and I hope to prove the truth of what he has said.<br/>
Let me return to the pressures of market forces. The Minister is providing for a gun to be held at the head of the widow or widower. The unscrupulous landlord will say, "I have the power to have you out tomorrow, but I might be prepared to allow you to stay if you agree to a doubling of the rent, or reductions in the amount spent on repairs, or a shorter life span for your tenancy." He may even say, "Would you agree to sublet to another tenant?" That is already happening. In my constituency tenancies are being divided to increase the landlord's share.<br/>
The Government are screwing the poorest in the community. Market forces are not about the equality of tenants in the market place. They provide an opportunity


for the landlord to take as much as he can in rent and do as little as he can to provide facilities for the family renting his property.<br/>
The Bill also encourages the private sector to remove a property from the private rented sector. Private landlords will be encouraged to get rid of the tenant and sell the property as an asset. It does not necessarily mean that that property will pass to another private landlord or that it will be sold to another tenant. It could be sold for business purposes and the house could be sold as a shop or as a future site for an office block. That is already happening in the housing market in England and Wales.<br/>
If tenants are lucky they will be offered reduced tenancy rights and massive increases in rent. Alternatively, they will face homelessness. If the private landlord gets rid of those tenants it is possible for him to take the house out of the rented sector and sell it as a capital asset. Therefore, homelessness will increase and there will be a reduction in the number of houses available in the private rented sector. Given the reduction in capital investment available to local authorities, they will be unable to deal with the homeless problem as it increases. That is the reality of the Government's proposals.<br/>
The Minister is not ignorant of the facts and he knows precisely what he is doing. He believes in private market forces, not in the quality of the private rented sector or the ability of a tenant to obtain a tenancy agreement that charges an affordable rent. The Bill, which is petty and vindictive, will be transferred to England and Wales. We shall not forget the Minister for this treacherous piece of legislation.</p>

<p>Tenants and landlords have the right under the Bill to apply to the rent assessment committee for a determination of rent or of other conditions of the tenancy. However, without Lords amendments Nos. 5 and 10, only an application from a tenant under a short assured tenancy needs to be in a specific form prescribed by regulations. We believe that it would make for simplicity for tenants and landlords in making their applications, and for the rent assessment committee in processing them, if they are all in a form set out in regulations. That is what the two amendments achieve.</p>

<p>I welcome the fact that my hon. Friends, together with the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), took the opportunity afforded by the previous amendment to have a fairly wide-ranging debate

on the principles of the Bill. Lords amendment No. 5 is concerned with rents&#x2014;another fundamental aspect of the Bill.<br/>
In response to my intervention in his earlier speech, the Minister candidly confirmed that Lords amendment No. 4 means simply that the widow of a successor tenant will be exposed to the threat of summary eviction. That is one of the things that the Government are proposing to do to encourage the private sector, private speculation and private landlordism.<br/>
The entire Bill concerns increasing rents and reducing tenants' security in the private sector. I suspect that that is in the vain hope that there will be a rebirth of private landlordism in Scotland. The Labour party does not want that.<br/>
Lords amendments Nos. 5 and 10 deal with the procedures for a tenant to refer the terms and rent of a new statutory assured tenancy to the rent assessment committee. According to the amendment, the application to the committee must be in a prescribed form. The fact that it will be in a prescribed form according to a prescribed procedure and timetable will be another obstacle to tenants who want to secure their rights under the Bill&#x2014;given the limited rights that will be left to them.<br/>
It would be helpful if the Minister could say something about the interesting concept of an "affordable rent". The Government say that they want market rents so that private landlords can make a profit. On the other hand, the Government say that they will ensure that those rents are affordable and that there will be sufficient back-up to ensure that. Housing associations, Shelter and others have expressed grave concern about that.<br/>
Have the Government had any further thoughts about the concept of affordable rent? How on earth do they propose to ensure that tenants can afford the rents that are likely to be charged, given that a sellers' market already exists in Scotland? There is a gross shortage of housing in Scotland. Any hon. Member or councillor in Scotland who comes face to face with his or her constituents must be aware that an intolerable number of people are living in overcrowded accommodation. An intolerable number are stuck on housing waiting lists or in bad housing.<br/>
Because of the present housing crisis there is a sellers' market in Scotland. Given a free market, landlords will be able to charge high rents. What protection will be given to tenants? I shall return to this matter when discussing Lords amendment No. 17, which would ensure that tenants have the information that they need to assert what is left of their limited rights.<br/>
Given that the Minister was candid enough to come clean and admit that he is quite happy at the prospect of widows being evicted in Scotland, will he now come clean about the future high rents?</p>

<p>Following what my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said, I should like to quote a specific example from the Secretary of State's constituency. I hope that the Minister will comment on it.<br/>
A council house in the Wester Hailes estate had been bought from a tenant and sold on to a private landlord. One of the local councillors in that area had to deal with the subsequent tenant who was paying the private landlord &#x00A3;90 a week rent and rates for a flat which would normally go at &#x00A3;30 a week. That tenant was paying &#x00A3;28 more than the housing benefit limit just to have a roof over her head.<br/>
That house in Murrayburn Park in Wester Hailes is only one of a number of examples that are now coming to the attention of many councillors and Members of Parliament. Certainly the landlord would consider that &#x00A3;90 was an affordable rent, but the tenant did not. The local councillor, John Innes said:<br/>
<q>This case is an example of the unscrupulous and unfair actions of private landlords exploiting those in desperate need of housing".</q>
The Minister may say that the affordability of rents will be regulated in some way, but that is not good enough. The tenant in that case had to move out of the house and had to be housed by the council because she was sending herself into virtual penury as a result of the rent that she was paying to her landlord&#x2014;what the Government would describe as a "caring landlord".<br/>
Many people will find themselves in a similar position to that lady. A tenant may be charged a rent that is way above the threshold that the Government consider reasonable; under the Bill there is no set limit. Any advice given to tenants to register for a fair rent assessment is discarded because the tenant is understandably frightened of harassment from the landlord.<br/>
The article in the <i>Wester Hailes Sentinel</i> will be the first of many such articles and I take no comfort from that. It is news only because it happened in the Secretary of State's constituency. The laws over which the Secretary of State presides are inadequate. It is because the Secretary of State and his Ministers have, time and time again, rejected the requests that I, my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, Central (Mr. Darling) and others have made for tougher regulations on private landlords, that people are now in such difficulty.<br/>
In common with my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) I await the Minister's reply with interest.</p>

<p>I welcome the hon.

If someone goes through a Member of Parliament, he can get things done. In my experience, it is wise not to make judgments based on something written in a newspaper. I have learnt from experience that one should accept a specific case as such and then go into the details to find out the real problem. I believe that many things are written simply to draw attention to a paper or to help to sell it. They are written with little intention of solving the problems of the individuals involved.</p>

To whom will we refer such cases of gross exploitation in the private sector? There is no ombudsman in the private sector. In all his experience of abuse by local authority landlords, has the hon.

With regard to the question of what one is charged for anything, I stress that nothing in life is free; someone pays for it. The distributors of a free sheet may have their reasons for wanting to increase circulation&#x2014;for example, because more people will advertise. Whoever pays will have reasons for what they do.

<p>I will give way to my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heller) at a suitable moment if he asks me.<br/>
Will the Minister tell us what the Government are planning to do to ensure, in the Government's words, that rents are "below market levels" and at "affordable levels" for those in lower-paid employment? Over recent months the Minister has given repeated assurances that that would be the case. However, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations has stated that there is nothing in the Bill to ensure that that happens. What will the Minister do to ensure that the rents will be affordable?<br/>
When the Minister replies to that, will he also reply to an earlier question from my hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney) about the clause affecting a bereaved spouse who remarries and then dies, leaving a widow or widower? A landlord might tell that person that he or she cannot stay unless they pay a higher rent. The Minister managed to get off the hook by refusing to answer that question. Perhaps he will answer it now as we are talking about rents. What will he do to protect people in that position?<br/>
If a Member of Parliament has taken up a problem on behalf of a constituent with a local authority, he does not have to go to the ombudsman to sort it out. In the vast majority of cases, the local authority will respond as well as it can, although it cannot always give people what they want because there are not enough houses. However, the authority will respond sympathetically and examine the question. If I write to a private sector landlord, he need not even bother to answer my letter because there is nothing in this legislation which requires him to pay any attention to any Member of Parliament or elected representative.</p>

<p>I do not like to intervene in Scottish affairs, but this is not completely a Scottish affair. The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) said that he had to deal with bad local authority landlords. We have all had cases where local authorities have not dealt with repairs as quickly as they should have. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) said, we know that if we or the local council intervenes, action will be taken sooner or later.<br/>
I have been a Member of this House longer than the hon. Member for Tayside, North. For my sins, I have been here 24 years. On the basis of my dealings with my constituents, most of whom live in private landlords' houses, I would cheerfully hang, draw and quarter most private landlords. I would do that on the basis of what they do not do when Members of Parliament approach them and ask them to take action over repairs.<br/>
When the Labour party was in government, we had legislation under which we could go to the local authority and sometimes force a landlord to do repairs and charge it to him. That is not possible any longer. The position is not quite the same as it used to be. Landlords can now ignore Members of Parliament or anyone else and they do. There is no ombudsman or anyone else to take the case to.<br/>
From my experience of private landlords, I can state that the quicker we get rid of them, the better it will be for the ordinary people who cannot afford to buy a house of their own. I have a thing about private landlords, as I have had to deal with them for a long time. I hate most of them. There are a few exceptions who have, on odd occasions, actually concerned themselves with the people who live in their homes. However, that is not true of most private

landlords, who seek to extract the maximum amount of money from their tenants and to give the least in repairs in exchange.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the speech of the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Heller). If somebody were in a position to purchase his house, I would advise him to do so because that would provide him with much greater security. However, not everyone is in a position to do so.<br/>
No eviction can be summary. A landlord must have a ground for applying to the court for an order for possession. That is important.<br/>
It is for the landlord and tenant to decide what is affordable. The Department is working with the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations on factors to be taken into account and on collecting local information on rent levels. It might assist the House to know that we are conscious of the vital need to provide as much information as possible to tenants and landlords about their rights and responsibilities once the Bill comes into effect. Therefore, we shall be making widely available a booklet explaining the rights of assured tenants and those who remain regulated tenants; all existing private sector tenants will keep all their existing rights.</p>

<p>In the course of the last debate a question arose about the right of succession of spouses. The only new response was that landlords would have to negotiate with the spouses to ensure that eventualities such as those that we described would not come to pass. As I understand it, Lords amendment No. 5 deals with the notice that would have to be given to fix the terms for the renewal of an assured tenancy. Indeed, if the tenant was unhappy with the terms of the assured tenancy he could refer that notice to a rent assessment committee to determine whether the terms were reasonable under a contractual assured tenancy.<br/>
Could a tenant who was unable to negotiate with a sympathetic landlord a contract which included the spouse's right to succeed to a tenancy, take the matter to the rent assessment committee, saying that it was reasonable for that to be included in the terms of the assured tenancy, or would this legislation preclude such tenants approaching the rent assessment committee?<br/>
This is an historic day, because this is the 10th anniversary of the election to the House of my hon. Friend for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). His was a famous by-election victory. The Conservatives were expected to win but, as always in Scotland, the Labour party won. I would be grateful if the Minister would address himself to the question whether such a tenant could go to a rent assessment committee to ask it to determine whether it would be reasonable to set aside the terms of the agreement.</p>

<p>There have been many historic misstatements in the course of the Government's life, from the unemployed being enjoined to get on their bikes to look for work to the one that has just been uttered by the Minister with responsibility for Scottish housing. With a dire shortage of housing and a gross over-supply of people looking for the right kind of housing, people who are vulnerable economically are being told that they should eat cake if there is no bread&#x2014;if they cannot reach agreement with their landlords, they should look for

another. If ever any statement suggested that the Minister lives on a completely different planet from most Scottish people looking for housing, it was that.<br/>
Here we are down memory lane again finding landlords with sheepskin coats, big gold rings, chains&#x2014;and alsatian dogs, as my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) says&#x2014;spivs, who are all too amenable to pleasant negotiations with the poor people who happen to be in their clutches and have to live in their crumbling tenements, flats and houses. They are all too ready to sit down and negotiate an affordable rent, the speed of repairs or how bright the light on the dark and dingy stairs should be. They are all too willing to meet the tenants or their representatives at any time to drive a fair bargain with them. If, at the end of the day, despite the eminent reasonableness of the spivs in sheepskin coats, no agreement can be reached, the tenant need only pack up his bags, get on his bike and look for another landlord with whom to reach a compatible agreement. That is a fantasy &#x2014;a nightmare offered by the Government. The pitiful excuses for the legislation that the Minister is offering us are enough to make me want to demand his resignation.</p>

<p>I beg to move, as an amendment to the Lords amendment, amendment (a) leave out '6' and insert '2'.<br/>
I take it that we may also discuss amendment (b), in line 4, at end insert<br/>
<q>'and no further notice may be served within a period of six months after the lapse of a notice under this subsection'.</q>
The Lords amendment means that an eviction notice will lapse six months after the proceedings could have been raised. I suppose that that may be a small blessing. Without it the threat of eviction could hang over tenants more or less permanently. However, it does not take us much further forward, because the landlord can simply issue a new notice. Amendment (a) would further reduce the uncertainty facing a tenant by reducing the lifespan of an eviction notice to two months. More important, amendment (b) would prevent a landlord from issuing another notice within six months of the lapse of the previous one. That would prevent the landlord from playing a cat and mouse game with his tenants and harassing them by repeatedly issuing notices to quit.<br/>
Harassment is already a feature among private landlords in Scotland, and it is likely to intensify as a result of this legislation. At my constituency surgery last Saturday, there was one young mother who was being threatened with violence by her landlord, who wanted to put her out of the house because she could not afford to pay the rent. The only advice that we could offer was that she should contact the police and seek protection. Such harassment is already happening and will become mach easier under this legislation.<br/>
The Minister says, "Tenants can just go and find another landlord." In Scotland, the normal procedure


would be for a person to seek a tenancy from the local authority, but that is the one thing that the Minister does not want prospective tenants in Scotland to be able to do, because the Government keep running down and eroding the provision of local authority and public sector housing in Scotland, as they are determined to get as much of that housing stock as possible into the private sector. I invite the Minister to consider the possibility of harassment by the repeated issuing of eviction notices, so that a tenant would be constantly living under the threat of eviction. I commend to the Minister in particular amendment (b).</p>

<p>The Government cannot accept the proposed amendments to Lords amendment No. 6, as we believe that there is considerable doubt about whether a sheriff would treat as valid a notice served on a tenant many months before proceedings took place.<br/>
However, to put the matter beyond doubt, the Government agreed to placing a time limit on the lifespan of a notice. That is what we have done, and we have naturally used the same time limit as that which applies to notices served on public sector tenants. As a result, the notice is valid for six months after the earliest date on which possession proceedings could take place. That seems entirely sensible, and I see no reason to restrict the lifespan to two months as proposed by the amendments, thereby treating private sector tenants differently from those in the public sector.<br/>
I do not consider that a restriction on the issue of further notices would be appropriate. It is true that without amendment (b), a landlord could issue a series of notices and so keep a tenant under constant threat of proceedings. But if a landlord is so minded, at least the Lords amendment puts him to the trouble of issuing a notice every six months. If a landlord wishes to pursue the matter, he must go to court and through all the processes, and obviously the facts will be taken fully into acount by the court.<br/>
It must be borne in mind that there are many circumstances in which it would be perfectly reasonable for a landlord to serve another notice shortly after the expiry of an earlier one&#x2014;for example, if the tenant falls into rent arrears for a second time, or, in general, where a ground for possession applies, then ceases to apply, then comes to apply again.<br/>
I must also point out that, however well intentioned, the amendments might occasionally encourage landlords to evict tenants. That would occur if a landlord used the issuing of a notice as a form of final warning; for example, to make the tenant bring his rent payments up to date or else face eviction&#x2014;a relatively common practice in the public sector. When the lifespan of such a notice is six months after the earliest date when proceedings can take place, and when the landlord has the ability to issue further notices, he can be fairly relaxed about giving his tenant time to comply. But if the notice's lifespan is only two months and there is a restriction on issuing further notices, the tenant will have less time to comply and the landlord will be more likely to raise proceedings for eviction. I invite the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) not to press the amendments.</p>

<p>I shall attempt to summarise the Minister's remarks: he thinks that there should be a six-month rule for both the public and the private sector, as against our amendment, which would provide one rule of six months for the public sector and one rule of two months for the private sector.<br/>
The growth in rent arrears has been mainly caused by the Government's policies in respect of housing benefits, which have restricted the payments available to tenants who entered agreements with both private and public sector landlords. Those restrictions on housing benefit have caused great hardship over the past seven months &#x2014;as the Minister, his colleagues and all the rest of us know, and as the people who have been most affected by housing benefit restrictions know to their own cost.<br/>
The reason why we advocate a two-month rule for private landlords as against six months for public landlords is that the latter are geared up for changes in Government legislation. Their local Members of Parliament are advising them that the Government are cutting housing benefit and that that might have a horrendous impact&#x2014;as it has in Edinburgh. Private landlords do not have any such mechanism. I know that that is true, because private landlords have contacted me asking, "Why is the council suddenly cutting the money available to the private tenant in my dwelling? I cannot hold off eviction proceedings for much longer." I have to explain to those private landlords that it is not the fault of the local authority but is the fault of the Government, and that has been admitted by right hon. and hon. Members in all parts of the House.<br/>
While a council can, one way or another, wait more than six months for rent arrears to be paid by a cheque from the DSS, the private landlord often cannot do so. We want to ensure that any notice that is served must be acted on within a short period. We know that, with eight changes and cuts in housing benefit since 1983, there may be a ninth and a tenth on the way, and even more until we reach the 24 fiddles we have had on the unemployment statitistics. That is what worries us. We worry about the impact that this legislation will have on those people who are threatened with notices of eviction that hang over them for much longer than two months. If the period is limited to two months, attention will be focused more than ever on the Government of the day to ensure that changes in legislation such as that affecting housing benefit will not have the terrible impact that they have had in the past.</p>

<p>I am slightly out of step with my right hon. and hon. Friends because I welcome Lords amendment No. 6, which I see as being reasonable. If we shorten the period, we may encourage landlords to go to court much more quickly, rather than attempt to reach a negotiated settlement.<br/>
However, I am concerned at the Minister's rejection of amendment (b), which attempts to restrict the number of notices served. The Minister's brief comes from the vacuum, as I see it, that exists either in New St. Andrew's house or in Dover house. Certainly it does not appear to relate to the real world.<br/>
One of the most effective methods of harassing a tenant is the service of an eviction notice. From my experience as a solicitor who acted for many tenants who were in difficulties with their landlords, I know of numerous occasions when landlords wishing to avoid court proceedings, knowing that they cost money and create


difficulty, considered the service of an eviction notice as a first stage in the process of harassment. In most cases, until the tenant receives legal advice, he does not know that there is any difference, and assumes that a notice of eviction means that he must get out. Amendment (b) provides a valuable sanction in attempting to restrict the serving of notices and further to protect tenants.<br/>
One of the few benefits of the Bill&#x2014;and we welcome it &#x2014;is the improvement in the definition of and the increased penalties for harassment, contained in clause 35, which proposes a new subsection 2A(a) to section 22 of the 1984 Act. Does the Minister think that a repeated service of notice would constitute harassment? I think that it would, but I should be interested to know whether he thinks that the proposed new subsection would cover that.</p>

The Minister acknowledged that it would be possible for a malicious landlord repeatedly to issue eviction notices. As my hon. Friends have already said, that is an acknowledged method of harassment of tenants, and the Minister has confirmed that landlords will be allowed to continue to do that. He said that landlords would have to go to the trouble of issuing a notice every six months. That is hardly an undue burden in this day of word processors. The Minister is deluding himself if he does not think that some landlords will set up shop in Scotland and he only too willing to take such action to keep their tenants under pressure.

The amendment is designed to remove an anomaly in the Bill. It ensures that a sheriff may not sist, suspend or postpone proceedings or an order for possession when a short assured tenancy is involved. It simply brings the treatment of short assured tenancies in that respect into line with that of the other mandatory grounds for possession in schedule 5.</p>

<p>We have in mind the example of an engineer working abroad, perhaps in the middle east, who lets his house for a year on a short assured tenancy. He could be severely prejudiced if the proceedings were sisted. It might be his only house. Landlords let on a short assured tenancy basis because they wish to be certain of gaining possession at the end of the tenancy when, for example, they might be returning from abroad. They need to be able to reoccupy what might be their only home. Tenants who accept short assured tenancies will be well aware of the period of tenancy and will have no expectation of retaining possession thereafter. A landlord who seeks an order for possession should not have to wait indefinitely for the order to be granted or to take effect.</p>

<p>The Minister referred to a landlord who had let his house on a short assured tenancy and wanted repossession without having a fight in the courts.

<p>My hon. Friend makes a fair point about a matter of great concern. The Minister cannot simply skate over it. I realise that Conservative Members think the world is full of kindly commercial landlords who


are in business only to help tenants find housing at reasonable rents. Of course, Conservative Members may well be landlords; they are certainly not tenants. Most of them own substantial properties and have substantial incomes. They do not understand ordinary people living in Scotland.<br/>
The Minister knows that Shelter has produced figures showing that the waiting lists for council and housing association houses in Dundee have risen by 102 per cent. during the past seven years. People in Dundee do not have access to decent housing; there are too many people chasing too few houses. When the private sector does revive, it will be on a basis of short assured tenancies. People will accept them simply as a means of obtaining housing because there is nothing else available. The Minister must think of the problems that will confront those people when they are faced with eviction because they cannot pay a massive rent increase. It is possible that commercial landlords will abuse the social security system and use housing benefit to push up rents beyond what would be regarded as reasonable by ordinary people.<br/>
I draw the Minister's attention to a former children's home in my constituency. When it was under the control of the regional council, conditions were laid down relating to its use and it provided beds for between 30 and 35 children. The home has now passed into the hands of private sector landlords who have turned it into a hostel. Instead of providing 30 to 35 beds for children, it now provides 96 beds for adults. They expect 96 adults to live in a building that used to accommodate 35 children. That is how they exploit the poor&#x2014;those who have no access to housing&#x2014;and they are exploiting them to the best of their abilities. The Minister must face that problem and ensure that the House does not pass amendments that create loopholes that commercial landlords can use to exploit tenants on social security benefits.</p>

<p>I do not think that many would dispute the right of a person to re-occupy his home when returning from abroad. Can the Minister give any figures for short assured tenancies that fall into that category? Can he give figures for commercial landlords who will look upon this aspect of the legislation with delight and seize the opportunity to evict with ease? I am sure that that figure will be very much larger than the figure for people returning from abroad.<br/>
I accuse the Minister of misleading the House by choosing that example, which appeared so reasonable and sensible, but not explaining the commercial landlord aspect. He did not cite the example of commercial landlords which is far more relevant to the poor people who will be their victims.</p>

<p>The Minister said that, with this amendment, he is removing an anomaly from the Bill, but he is removing the sheriff's discretion. He is removing short assured tenancies from the sheriff's extended discretion in eviction proceedings. We regard that as another retrograde step to weaken the limited security of tenants with short assured tenancies. Under this provision, even if he may believe that the tenant has a strong case because of special circumstances, the sheriff will have no

discretion whatever. This is an eviction Bill, and the amendment simply strengthens that aspect of it, and we deplore it.</p>

<p>I shall answer one or two questions of the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion). I query his assumption that tenancies will automatically be short assured tenancies when commercial landlords are involved. I query that assumption because the rent for a short assured tenancy is likely to be lower than that for an assured tenancy, because there is not the same security of tenure for the tenant. Therefore, the norm should be a lower rent. In any case, it is important that the booklet explaining tenants' rights should be made readily available, and hard work has been put into that. The tenant on a short assured tenancy may go to the rent assessment committee at any time if he wishes to raise a certain point.</p>

The amendment makes more explicit the provisions of clause 24(4). Our intention has always been that rent increases under this provision should not take place more often than once a year. In the form in which the provision left this House, the once a year limitation applied only to notices proposing increases.

<p>The Minister is displaying his usual charming innocence, but it does not take us much further forward. The amendment simply substitutes the provision that the new rent will not come into effect earlier than a year after the previous increase for the bar which stated that no further notice of increase could be served within a year of the previous one. An increase in rent may be delayed, but harassment by notice of rent increase can go on with impunity. That is what the Government want, and I fear that that is what will happen.</p>

<p>I live in hope that the Minister will actually answer one of my questions. Just how often can there be a notice of rent increase, although the rent increases may be reduced to one a year? If a landlord may issue notices of rent increase over and again, that is an act of harassment in itself, and the Minister is doing absolutely nothing about it. Surely he knows that people fear notices of rent increase&#x2014;even people in the public sector regard them as a threat to evict, although they are nothing of the kind. They are merely formal notices of intention to increase rent. If that action is repeated over and again, it will be taken as harassment, and rightly so.</p>

<p>The amendment is intended to deal with what I fear is the likelihood that some landlords will seek to take advantage of the poll tax to swindle their tenants. I know that several of my hon. Friends, particularly those representing Edinburgh constituencies, have already drawn attention to that potential problem. In several urban areas it is not uncommon for private landlords of perhaps tenement-type property to charge rents that also cover rates paid directly to the local authority.<br/>
If the rating system is to end, for the time being anyway, on 1 April 1989, tenants in that type of relief will become liable for the poll tax. But, as things stand, there is absolutely no guarantee that their landlords will reduce their rent payments to take account of the abolition of domestic rates. It is quite possible for a landlord to seek to have his cake and eat it, and for the tenant to end up paying the tax twice. Having previously paid an element of

rent as a contribution towards rates, there is nothing to stop the landlord carrying on pocketing the difference, and the tenant will be liable to pay the poll tax. That is a serious threat, and it has been drawn to the attention of the House by hon. Members from constituencies that are likely to be affected.<br/>
I fear that it will be easy enough for tenants to be exploited under the new housing legislation that the Minister is talking about. Frankly, it would add injury to insult if tenants were to find themselves having to pay their local taxation twice&#x2014;once to the local authority and a second time to the landlord, as a little bonus for the landlord in such circumstances.<br/>
The amendment requires the rent assessment committee to intervene in such cases and to ensure that the rent paid by the tenant to the landlord is reduced to take account of the fact that the landlord no longer has to pay rates to the local authority. It is absolutely imperative that there should be a safeguard of that nature, and I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

<p>I have listened with care to what the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has said, but I do not believe that his amendment is necessary. Lords amendment No. 12 is designed precisely to ensure that, whenever a rent assessment committee makes a determination of rent for an assured tenancy, that determination must be net of any payment in respect of rates. That means that the rent assessment committee decides rent and ignores any charge that the landlord may make in respect of rates. That is to be the case when the determination takes place before or after domestic rates are abolished on 1 April next year. In practice, the hon. Gentleman's amendment would add nothing to what Lords amendment No. 12 already provides.<br/>
I should respond to the concern of some Hon. Members about the position of tenants who pay part of their rent in respect of rates when the community charge replaces domestic rates next year.<br/>
Assured tenancies will only have been allowed in Scotland for a short time when domestic rates are abolished. So the vast majority of private sector tenants will still be regulated tenants, subject to the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984. Those tenants will, of course, retain their right to have a rent registered by their rent officer. Registered rents are net of rates, so no regulated tenant needs to be unsure about his position. Of course, I strongly recommend private tenants to become registered.<br/>
I would expect assured tenants, in negotiating the terms of their tenancy with their landlord, to ensure that any payment in respect of rates is clearly distinguished from their rent payment and ceases on 1 April 1989. A written lease, for which the Bill provides, should set out the terms of the tenancy clearly and the provisions for a writen agreement are an additional safeguard. In addition, there are provisions to allow tenants with short assured tenancies to refer their rents for a determination by the rent assessment committee in certain circumstances and RACs will determine rents net of rates. In other words, they will determine solely the rent, so tenants will know what their rents will be.<br/>
In general, there is no need for any tenant to pay his landlord anything for rates after April next year. The only difficulty is encouraging tenants to make use of the rights available to them. That problem is not confined to rates


and can be tackled only by a long-term common effort involving central and local government, and advice agencies.<br/>
If a landlord persists in seeking to charge a tenant a rent which includes a payment for rates, the tenant will have every right to refuse to pay the element in respect of rates. The landlord could not evict a tenant in those circumstances, unless he had valid grounds to do so under schedule 5 to the Bill or schedule 2 to the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984.</p>

<p>Again, the Minister demonstrates a woeful misunderstanding of the realities of life in the private rented sector. A great number of my constituents are living under the yoke of private landlords. Many are young people who pay high rents for dingy rooms in dingy buildings in inner-city Glasgow. The great majority, or certainly a large number, are already paying their landlords an amount which is supposed to be calculated for rates. If I heard the Minister correctly, he said that he would expect the tenant to ensure by 1 April 1989 that he was netting the amount which is supposed to be for rates. What sort of an apology for government is that? The Government are throwing the onus on to the tenants.<br/>
Many tenants are not as legally trained or as adroit as the Minister, many are afraid of their landlords, many are from ethnic communities and are unsure of their ground, and many are young people with little experience of the housing market. Yet the Minister expects them to ensure by 1 April 1989 that they have netted the amount needed in rates. Surely it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that private landlords cannot exploit this situation.<br/>
We are not asking much, even of a Government who are clearly the landlords' friend. People in the Public Gallery who have been listening to the debate will know that by now. It is not asking much of such a Government to ask them to ensure that landlords are not making off with money that is supposed to be for rates when tenants will also have to pay the poll tax from 1 April.<br/>
The Government are again demonstrating a faith in private landlords which would be touching if it were not so repulsive. The Scottish people will look forward to the day when the last private landlord is strangled with the last copy of the <i>Scottish Daily Express,</i> to paraphrase Tom Nairn.

<p>The hon. Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) made an impassioned plea, but he probably did not listen to what my hon. Friend the Minister said. My hon. Friend stated clearly that tenants such as the hon. Gentleman described did not have assured tenancies. They will not be caught up in this until they renegotiate their tenancies after the Bill becomes law, if they decide so to do.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes ago we heard from the mouth of the Minister that he strongly recommended tenants to register straight away. The only conclusion to

draw from that statement is that he knows, and we know, that tenants will be in the hands of sheepskin spivs. Did you hear that?</p>

<p>I imagine that the Chair heard everything that was said. No doubt the question was not intended for you, Madam Deputy Speaker, but for me. Whatever amusing incidents the hon. Gentleman finds in the debate, I find it much too serious for levity. If I sincerely believed what the hon. Member for Hillhead was saying&#x2014;that all the tenants he described would be caught by the legislation &#x2014;perhaps I could move towards his position, but that will not happen in the real world. The tenants will come under the old legislation for whatever tenancy they arranged.<br/>
I choose my words carefully, because both the hon. Gentleman and I know that many people in the real world are not operating under the constraints of the legislation tabled by successive Governments. As often as not, they have reached some private arrangement to meet their circumstances and we understand that. Therefore, they will not be caught up in this until they become assured tenants. For those reasons, the amendment does not apply to them.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has not attempted to assure us that these wonderful landlords from whom the milk of human kindness flows would never attempt to do anything so dastardly as to pretend that a rent which formerly included a rates element was now a realistic rent or charge too much for the new rent.<br/>
We can all recall earlier days when a former Member of this House, now Lord Carmichael of Kelvingrove, had to introduce a Bill to prevent private landlords from fraudulently charging too much for gas. At that time, private landlords could get away with jacking up meters to charge too much for gas which was supplied at a given rate by a nationalised industry. We all know what the conduct of private landlords can be like.<br/>
The Minister suggests that the answer for tenants caught in this trap is to appeal. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Hillhead (Mr. Galloway) eloquently pointed out the difficulties that face many members of the public when attempting to make such an appeal. They may not understand their rights or the language. Instead of leaving it to individual tenants to appeal, why does the Minister not call this what it is? It is fraud and there should be a police charge for it because it is as dishonest as stealing goods from a shop or money from people.</p>

<p>Like the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) I try to live in the real world and for the most part I succeeded in doing so until I came here. Once one enters the doors of this Chamber one enters an unreal world.<br/>
In the real world it is common practice for rents to include some charge for rates. Indeed, not two miles from here is the private sector flat that I rent in Kennington, for which I am charged rent and rates combined&#x2014;to the princely sum of &#x00A3;538 a month. If anyone here knows of any cheaper accommodation I should be pleased to hear about it. That flat is rented at a market rate freely negotiated between landlord and tenant. Its price reflects the shortage of such accommodation in London, and it is the sort of rent which Members of Parliament can afford,


but ordinary working class people in London cannot. They are being squeezed out to the margins, away from central London, by Tory councils and private sector landlords.<br/>
6 pm<br/>
The Minister said that my hon. Friend's amendment was not different from the Lords amendment, but of course it is. The Lords amendment says:
<q>The rent assessment committee shall make their determination &#x2026; as if the rates were not so borne.</q>
My hon. Friend's amendment says that the tenant can draw the attention of the rent assessment committee to the fact that the rates are included in the rent. That is a big difference. How will the rent assessment committee know the facts unless the tenant has the right to go to the committee and draw its attention to the fact that rent and rates have been combined and that the latter should be discounted in determining the rent?<br/>
The Lords amendment gives the tenant no such right. There is a shortage of accommodation. All the power and influence lies with the landlord, not the tenant, and the tenant must have the absolute right to defend such small rights as he has under the present legislation. He should have the right to go to the rent assessment committee and draw this to its attention, and the Minister should know that.<br/>
The Minister also said that most tenants would not be affected, because the provision takes effect only from 1 April, and most tenants hold regulated tenancies. I understand that an assured tenancy is supposed to be freely negotiated between landlord and tenant at the market rent. How can the market rent be assessed? People look at the rents being charged in the local area. So, in this case, rents in the regulated sector will be looked at, and they may well include a charge for rates. When assessing the rent for an assured tenancy, rents for regulated tenancies may well be taken into consideration, and they include a charge for rates. There is a serious possibility that people with assured tenancies may find themselves being charged for rates that are included in the rent, and rates charged in the area in which they happen to be trying to obtain a tenancy. The Minister should recognise that that is a real possibility.<br/>
If the Minister stands by the Lords amendment, the tenant will have no right to go to the rent assessment committee and draw its attention to these facts. It will be left to the committee to discover them in some mysterious way. Landlords and tenants are in an unequal relationship; many tenants will feel intimidated. The legislation should at least include a statutory right for tenants, enabling them to go to welfare rights officers and others and ask them to intercede for them with the rent assessment committee. The Lords amendment includes no such right, and will include none if it is passed unamended.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) raised an important point. I accept a great deal of what the Minister said, which may surprise him, but I have to tell him that some of it does not affect what happens in the real world.<br/>
We are focusing on the effect of the poll tax and what it will mean to people who live in rented accommodation. Most tenants, council and private sector, when asked what their rent is will give a global figure of &#x00A3;20, rather than identifying &#x00A3;15 for rent and &#x00A3;5 for rates.<br/>
Two categories of people will be seriously disadvantaged after 1 April 1989. The first are those who already

pay rates to the landlord. The Minister is right to say that when rents and rates are paid as a global sum the tenant may have a right to recover after 1 April if there is a registered rent and the rates are separately identified. That, however, does not take account of the problem that this must be brought to the notice of tenants in some way. Most of them know that they pay a global figure and do not realise that they are paying extra for rates. I shall be interested to hear how the Government will attempt to make tenants aware of that.<br/>
The second group of people who will he at a disadvantage are those who live in areas of high pressure on housing, in which there is a shortage of rented accommodation of all kinds. Like most of my hon. Friends, I am fairly sure that there will be an increase in homelessness and in shortages of housing for rent. The private sector is not the panacea for that problem that the Government think it is. I see major problems ahead. Landlords will increasingly try to get around the legislation, although to a lesser extent than they do with the present legislation.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) said, there is already a great deal of pressure on rented accommodation here in London. I have never yet been to see a flat for rent in London without being asked to take a company lease so as to get around the English Rent Acts. The same thing will happen in high-pressure areas such as Glasgow, Edinburgh and even possibly Aberdeen, because of housing shortages.<br/>
I have tried to assess the implications for people in my area. For instance, a couple with an average rent will pay about &#x00A3;40 a week&#x2014;just over &#x00A3;2,000 a year. That will include rates, because that is the sort of rent I would expect them to pay. Unless there is some way of notifying these people that, after 1 April 1989, they will be entitled to a reduction in their rent because of the introduction of the poll tax and the removal of the burden of domestic rates from landlords, that couple in Aberdeen will face the prospect of their housing costs increasing by about &#x00A3;520 a year. We expect a poll tax of about &#x00A3;260 a year in Aberdeen, and these people will face a real increase of 25 per cent. in their housing costs.<br/>
I accept what the Minister says. In an ideal world in which everyone knew his rights and could exercise them, this legislation might be adequate, but we need much more than that. My hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian addressed that problem; the Government failed to do so.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585705" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.338.0" hansard_membership_id="5983" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2834" speakername="Mr. Home Robertson" colnum="338" time="17:45:00">
<p>The Minister sought to play down the likely incidence of exploitation of tenants by the double charging of the equivalent of local authority taxation, saying that only a small number of people would be affected and that if they had registered rents, everything would be allright. We all know that a high proportion of rents in certain parts of Scotland are not registered. We know that many people pay rent and rates together to their private landlords, and it is not impossible that some landlords will try to carry on charging that equivalent charge after the poll tax comes into effect next year. So some tenants could have to go on paying the equivalent of rates to the landlord and, the poll tax to their local authorities.<br/>
Perhaps our amendment is technically flawed; I think that was the point the Minister tried to make. I am convinced, however, that we are on to an important point here. The Government should grasp it and seek ways of


protecting tenants in these circumstances. They could do that by accepting the amendment which, even if flawed, could still be tidied up in another place.<br/>
This is a genuinely important point of principle. A significant number of tenants could face exploitation as a result of this double charging and as some private landlords try to swindle their tenants. I invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to join me in voting for the amendment to the Lords amendment.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), said that people would not know whether they were paying rates as part of their rents. They will not have to know, because any application to the rent assessment committee will mean that the committee will find out what the rent should be, and that is what the tenant will pay.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585707" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.339.1" hansard_membership_id="3538" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2654" speakername="Mr. Doran" colnum="339" time="17:45:00">
<p>My point was that people who already have a registered rent and who pay rent and rates together will not be aware of any change in their rights on 1 April 1989 unless some special effort is made to draw it to their attention. This affects the vast majority of Scottish private tenants.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585708" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.339.2" hansard_membership_id="3560" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14205" speakername="Lord James Douglas-Hamilton" colnum="339" time="17:45:00">
<p>As I explained earlier, registered tenants now have their rents determined net of rates so no regulated tenants need be unsure of his position. The facts should be before him. The hon. Gentleman pressed hard for written leases. We are bringing those in and that will help, because they will be written into the terms of the tenancy.<br/>
We fully appreciate that after 1 April rent payments by tenants should not include a sum formerly paid in respect of rates. We do not want tenants to pay such sums plus community charge payments. Lords amendment No. 12 is designed to ensure that the rent assessment committee takes account of this in relation to applications for a rent determination. That reflects the Government's concern in the matter. For that reason, the amendment of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) is unnecessary.</p>

<speech hansard_id="585709" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.339.3" hansard_membership_id="8630" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/18221" speakername="Mr. William McKelvey" colnum="339" time="17:45:00">
<p>The Minister seems to be missing the Opposition's point. Why should the onus be on the tenant? We are told that landlords will operate fair practices. Why should they not recognise immediately that they are honour bound to reduce rents by the amount that they were charging for rates? If a landlord keeps his rents at the same level and charges an amount for rates that he should not be charging, and if a rent assessment panel decides that that is the case, the landlord should be deemed to have committed a criminal offence. That would put a stop to any shenanigans and malpractices.<br/>
If tenants know the law, surely landlords should also know it and should carry out their duties so that tenants do not have to apply to an assessment panel. I have many years experience of tribunals and rent assessment panels and it was one field in which I was almost entirely unsuccessful. I raised about 400 cases and lost 398. I won on two occasions and the tenants were awarded a reduction in rent of 2p. Our people do not see rent

assessment panels as fair and unprejudiced, and I urge the Minister to recognise the reasoning behind our amendment.</p>

<p>By leave of the House, I did not suggest that the onus should be on the tenant. I said that registered tenants have a right to have their rent registered by the rent officer and should exercise that right. I am sure that in the vast majority of cases they do that and will continue to do it. I stressed that if a landlord seeks to charge a rent which includes a payment for rates, the tenant will have every right to refuse to pay that element. The Opposition amendment is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Amendment No. 13 is necessary to make clear in the Bill how a rent assessment committee is to proceed if it has to make two determinations at more or less the same time concerning the same tenancy. This could arise if a tenant were referring a proposed rent increase to the committee under clause 25, while at the same time either tenant or landlord were referring proposed changes in other terms of the tenancy under clause 17. Obviously, it makes sense for the committee to hear the two references together. In such cases, the committee should resolve the issue of what variation in tenancy terms is appropriate before considering the level of market rent to be determined. Therefore this amendment requires a rent assessment committee in these circumstances to determine the terms of the tenancy first no matter in what order the reference are actually received. The subsequent rent determination should then take account of the revised terms.<br/>
Amendment No. 14 simply corrects an error.</p>

<p>Lords amendment No. 13 highlights the range of options being made available to landlords through this legislation. It provides for the order in which a rent assessment committee should determine a landlord's applications. If he were to decide on the blunderbuss approach to a tenant, it would have to deal first with the conversion of the tenancy into a short assured tenancy, which would involve loss of security and then, if the first option failed, with the increase in the rent of the original assured tenancy. This is not a happy prospect for Scottish tenants who fall into the trap set for them by the Government. I welcome the opportunity to highlight what is going on.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Garscadden (Mr. Dewar) spoke with some passion about this on Second Reading and the amendment meets the point that he made.<br/>
Along with succession rights, which we have already discussed, I think that the issue relating to assured tenancies that caused most concern was premiums. The Bill, as introduced, contained no provisions relating to premiums. We felt that the operation of the market would work in due course to prevent the charging of unreasonable premiums. We still hold that view, but we recognise that in Scotland there has in effect been a full prohibition on premiums for tenancies for many years&#x2014;since 1920.<br/>
We have also taken on board the many representations against premiums we received from hon. Members, from the other place and from organisations that have daily contact with those involved in the private rented sector. Therefore, we tabled this new clause, which simply applies the relevant provisions of part VIII of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 to assured tenancies as well as regulated tenancies. These provisions prohibiting premiums are already well established in Scotland, so there should be no difficulty in ensuring that they are fully understood by those involved.<br/>
I am sure the new clause will be welcomed by the House.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585727" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.344.0" hansard_membership_id="5983" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2834" speakername="Mr. Home Robertson" colnum="344" time="18:30:00">
<p>Although the Minister has confirmed that the prohibition on premiums has been well established in Scotland, that did not prevent the Government from trying to exclude the principle from the Bill. The fact that this is being presented as a concession must therefore highlight the oppressive nature of the legislation.<br/>
This is a sellers' market. There is a shortage of housing to rent in Scotland and, therefore, anyone with a decent house to rent can be certain that, if the house is in a desirable area, there will be many people wanting to rent it. Without such a safeguard, there is nothing to stop a landlord asking for rent in advance or a deposit which would be returnable at the conclusion of the tenancy. Without that provision, there would be the possibility of demanding key money from tenants who were desperate to find housing, given the present shortage.<br/>
The Minister has acknowledged that we have pressed the Government on this matter, both on the Floor of the House on Second Reading and in Committee. Although there is rejoicing in heaven when a sinner repents, the Minister will have to do better before there will be any rejoicing among tenants in Scotland. There was a serious risk that unscrupulous landlords would exploit the opportunity to extort key money from desperate prospective tenants. That practice should be illegal and I welcome the fact that the Minister has at least made this significant concession in respect of assured tenancies. However, I wish to press him a little further because, as I understand it, the prohibition does not apply to short assured tenancies. Perhaps he will confirm that it will still be possible for a landlord wanting to let a property on a short assured tenancy to demand key money.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585728" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.344.1" hansard_membership_id="3560" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14205" speakername="Lord James Douglas-Hamilton" colnum="344" time="18:30:00">
<p>It is my understanding that the ban on premiums applies generally.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585729" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.345.0" hansard_membership_id="5983" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2834" speakername="Mr. Home Robertson" colnum="345" time="18:30:00">
<p>That was not clear from my reading of the amendment and I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that point.<br/>
This is a significant step in the right direction. It should not have been necessary to drag the Government kicking and screaming into such a concession, but we welcome it.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585730" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.345.1" hansard_membership_id="8410" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3058" speakername="Mr. McAllion" colnum="345" time="18:30:00">
<p>I was grateful to hear the assurance given by the Minister to my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) that this would also apply to short assured tenancies, but I see nothing in the Lords amendment that states specifically that it will apply to such tenancies. As I have often told the Minister, I have good grounds for not believing anything that Tory Ministers say with regard to Scotland, so the fact that he has said this tonight is not sufficient assurance. I would like him to tell me where in the Bill it is stated that there will be a prohibition on key money, not only for assured tenancies, but for short assured tenancies. It must be stated in the statute, if the Minister is going to make it stick in the Scottish courts. The fact that he might refer to it during a debate does not represent sufficient grounds upon which a tenant could go to a court and obtain a successful decision. The Minister has yet to address that central problem.<br/>
In the housing market in Scotland, where there is a shortage of housing and a sellers' market, there is every incentive for unscrupulous landlords to avoid the assured tenancies and to go for the short assured tenancies. We want to see in the Bill a prohibition on premiums or key money for short assured tenancies.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585731" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.345.2" hansard_membership_id="3560" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14205" speakername="Lord James Douglas-Hamilton" colnum="345" time="18:30:00">
<p>Perhaps I can assist the hon. Gentleman. He may not he aware that a short assured tenancy is a form of assured tenancy. That is the answer to his question and he can be reassured on that point.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585732" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.345.3" hansard_membership_id="8410" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3058" speakername="Mr. McAllion" colnum="345" time="18:30:00">
<p>It may well be that a short assured tenancy is a form of assured tenancy, but the phrase "short assured tenancy" does not appear in the amendment. Various words are defined at the back of the Bill. The Minister is saying that it is defined in the Bill that assured tenancies include short assured tenancies, but there is nothing to that effect among the definitions at the back of the Bill.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585733" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.345.4" hansard_membership_id="4252" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2721" speakername="Mrs. Fyfe" colnum="345" time="18:30:00">
<p>Before I comment on that matter, may I draw the attention of the House to the fact that 226 hon. Members voted against a previous amendment. That means that more than 220 people who walked through that Lobby voted to throw bereaved people out into the streets, without having heard a word of the debate.<br/>
The title in respect of amendment No. 16 on page 3 of the Lords Amendment Paper reads:
<q>Prohibitions of premiums etc. on assured tenancies".</q>
If that means all tenancies, would it not be clearer to say so? Like my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion), I am not at all certan whether what the Minister has just said at the Dispatch Box is the case and whether he intends the provision to apply to all tenancies.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585734" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.345.5" hansard_membership_id="3538" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2654" speakername="Mr. Doran" colnum="345" time="18:30:00">
<p>I want to pursue that point because the Minister appears to be saying that, wherever there is a reference to assured tenancies in the Bill, that includes short assured tenancies and that that should apply to all tenants' rights. May we assume, therefore, that the short assured tenant has the same rights as the assured tenant, with the exceptions made in the Bill? I should be happy if the Minister could give me that assurance.</p>

<p>Again, the fact that the provision for a written lease and rent book has had to be extracted from the Government as a concession must highlight the fundamentally oppressive nature of the Bill. Obviously, we welcome those concessions which we demanded in


Committee and it is an important step in the right direction, but the provision should have been in the Bill in the first place.<br/>
The Bill lays out a minefield of dangers for tenants, which will not be easy to understand. I cite, for example, the procedures for referring rent increases to the rent assessment committee, the procedures for appeal to the sheriff against eviction and other complications that arise from the Bill. We shall have a mass of different types of tenancy in addition to the protected tenancies which will continue to apply in the public sector. There will be assured tenancies, statutory assured tenancies, short assured tenancies and other variations and permutations on those themes.<br/>
I genuinely fear that some tenants will be saddled with impossible rents or leases. They could even face eviction because they cannot understand or cope with the procedures set out in the Bill. That could be a particular problem for former secure tenants who have been accustomed to the security that applies in the public sector. The Government have made it clear that they intend as many secure tenants as possible from the public sector will be transferred into assured tenancies in the private sector in the coming months and years before we have an opportunity to repeal the legislation.<br/>
That will create many difficulties for those tenants. They will need advice, back-up and all the assistance that it is possible to give them. It is questionable whether the citizens advice bureau, organisations such as Shelter, local authorities and solicitors will be able to cope with the work load of advising tenants faced with repeated applications by landlords for increases in rent and repeated efforts by landlords to evict tenants or harass them under the provisions of the Bill. However, as the Government are responsible for this phenomenally complicated and oppressive system which they are trying to impose in Scotland, they should accept the duty to provide a comprehensive guide to the basic rights and duties of tenants, which, under this amendment, could be annexed to the lease. That would be genuinely helpful to tenants.<br/>
The Minister said that the Government are intending to produce a booklet. The fact that it is a booklet rather than a leaflet emphasises the point that we are wading into complicated legislation from the point of view of tenants in Scotland. It would be much more sensible and satisfactory if there were to be a clear summary of the rights and duties of tenants which could be annexed to every lease produced under the legislation so that a tenant would have in his possession a clear guide to his rights and duties to which he could refer. He would then know when he required further advice and whether he was within his rights when a landlord was abusing his rights. There is a need for this sort of information, and I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

<p>I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), who has called for the production of a summary of tenants' duties and rights. I was a member of Glasgow district council, which spent a long time in genuine negotiation with representatives of various tenant associations and Glasgow council tenants to try to produce such a statement. The end result was a

document which ran to several pages. That was only right, because there was so much detail on which tenants and council representatives had to be clear.<br/>
When it comes to tenants' rights, there has to be a list of exactly what types of repair the council will undertake and a similar list of the repairs that tenants are required to undertake. The list included fairly simple items. For example, when the rope on the pulley broke in the kitchen, the tenant was expected to replace it. If there were wiring problems or a ceiling fell down, the repair work was the council's responsibility. By and large, serious or major works were the responsibility of the council. Trivial or everyday matters were the responsibility of the tenant.<br/>
Council tenants have various duties, one of which is to pay the rent on time, while another is to wash the close regularly. Duties have to be described in detail because some people might genuinely not know exactly what is expected of them. That might well be the position of a young person who has never been a tenant before. Many councils are now encouraging and helping young people, who may be in their teens, in an understanding of their tenancies. Rights and duties must be spelt out in great detail so that everyone knows exactly where he stands.<br/>
The tenants of Glasgow district council welcomed the spelling out of their rights and duties. Those who represented the tenants' associations thought that the document produced by the council was the best that they had seen. That feeling was based on their experience of tenancy agreements throughout Scotland. If the Government were so minded, the Glasgow district council approach could be taken as an example of how to proceed. Unfortunately, they have not said anything so far about any intention to follow the practice of that council.<br/>
I urge the acceptance of the amendment because I cannot see how it could possibly have a harmful effect on any tenant or landlord. Each would know exactly where he stood if rights and duties were set out in the detail which I have described. Without that detail, landlords can get away with far too much. Surely the Minister does not wish landlords to escape their responsibilities.<br/>
When I was a tenant of a private landlord I had great difficulty in persuading the landlord that he should make my front door secure. It took two months to ensure that I had a door which would protect me from burglars. That is an example of the sort of problems that are faced by ordinary everyday parents, who may well be young persons. I was confronted with the problem while living in my first home, and it is typical of the difficulties that many tenants have to face. Rights and duties must be spelt out clearly so that everyone knows precisely where he is. I hope that the Minister will take the point on board.</p>

<p>The hon. Members for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) and for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe), and earlier, the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran), have advanced a strong argument for ensuring that tenants are aware of their rights and responsibilities. I agree wholeheartedly with that view. The new assured tenancy system depends on both landlords and tenants being aware of their respective rights and responsibilities. It is because of our concern to ensure that tenants have the necessary information that we have provided the right, as set out in Lords amendment No. 17, for every tenant to have a written statement of the


terms of his tenancy. It is in the interests of both tenant and landlord that both of them are clear about the terms on which the let is taking place.<br/>
Many landlords already provide a written lease, but others, for whatever reason, do not. We have been persuaded that it is desirable to provide the safeguard that is represented by the amendment. Under the proposed new clause a landlord has a duty to give his tenant a written document that sets out the terms of the tenancy. The document must be drawn up at no cost to the tenant. The provision has been framed with the intention of giving private sector assured tenants a similar right to that which public sector tenants already have.<br/>
6.45 pm<br/>
We are taking other steps to ensure that tenants are aware of their rights. Whenever a landlord under an assured tenancy seeks repossession of his house, or proposes a change in the rent or other terms of the tenancy, he must serve the appropriate notice on his tenant. The notices will all be prescribed by regulations. They will include information for the tenant about his rights&#x2014; for example, his right in some circumstances to refer the proposal to the rent assessment committee.<br/>
We believe that it is much more helpful for a tenant to obtain such information when he needs it rather than at the beginning of his tenancy when he might regard it as unimportant. We shall also be issuing a booklet that will give general information about assured tenancies for both landlords and tenants. It will be circulated widely and it will be an accessible source of information for all those involved. I hope to have the booklet published before the end of the year. I hope also that hon. Members will agree that we are taking seriously the need to ensure that tenants are aware of their rights. We shall continue to give the matter high priority.<br/>
Lords amendment No. 17 would have implications far beyond tenants' rights. It would give tenants the right to raise court proceedings at no cost. That proposal, whatever is merits in general terms, should not be dealt with at the very end of our consideration of a Bill. With Lords amendment No. 17 we have tried to give private sector tenants broadly the same rights on written leases as those that are enjoyed in the public sector. To go down the road that is proposed would be, in our view, to go too far. I hope that the amendments will not be pressed to a Division.</p>

<p>My hon. Friends and I would not quarrel with a number of the Minister's remarks. It is necessary for tenants to have the information that they require so that they can protect their rights under this extremely complex Bill. That makes it even more strange that the Government Benches are almost empty. I have no doubt that Conservative Members will support the Government whenever a Division takes place, but it is clear that they have no understanding of the Bill's contents.<br/>
I agree with the Minister that there should be a duty upon the landlord to produce a written document which sets out the terms of the tenancy. For three hours we have been debating complex issues, such as a tenant's right to go to a rent assessment committee and require it to come to a judgment on whether the rent offered to him by the landlord includes some charge for rates following the decision to abolish domestic rates and impose a poll tax.

The tenant has to know where he stands. It is unlikely that a written lease would make information of that sort available to the tenant.<br/>
Under the Bill, tenants will be subject to eight mandatory grounds for eviction and nine non-mandatory grounds. These provisions are set out in tight print on four pages of the Bill. That information will not be included in the written lease that is made available by the landlord. The tenant will not necessarily be aware of his rights.<br/>
The same applies to the clause that sets out the prohibition of premiums or key money. That will not be set out in the written lease that the landlord makes available to the tenant. How is the tenant to know of his rights? In effect, the Minister says, "That is too bad. He will have to wait until the end of the year." The provisions in the Bill will take effect on 1 April 1989, and the booklet to which the Minister has referred will be available, so he says, by the end of the year. I hope that he means this year and not the end of next year. I hope that it will be available to tenants when the Bill takes effect.<br/>
What information will be set out in the booklet? The Minister spoke about "general information". What information will that be? Will every right that a tenant has be set out in the booklet? Will it be a comprehensive guide of the sort that is suggested in the amendment? Will the booklet be made available to every tenant in the private sector?<br/>
I have been fighting against the imposition of the poll tax in Scotland, but at least the Government sent an explanatory booklet to everyone who was involved. It never could be said to set out the truth, but at least it was issued. Will every tenant be sent a booklet setting out his rights and responsibilities? Will he be warned in advance of the different elements of the Bill that will affect him? It is necessary that he should be so warned.<br/>
If a booklet explains to tenants their rights in relation to assured tenancies, will it compare the rights with those of secure tenants in the public sector? One of the main motivations for the Bill is to encourage people to move out of the public sector and into the private sector&#x2014;on the basis of assured tenancies. How are people to judge whether that is good for them if they are not given a comprehensive list of information? Will the booklet contain only information about the rights of assured tenants or will it compare them with existing rights in the public sector or in regulated tenancies in the non-assured tenancy sector?<br/>
The Minister must address those problems because the Government have a responsibility. If they bring forward a major piece of housing legislation and impose it against the democratic mandate in Scotland, it is up to them to give tenants in Scotland a comprehensive guide about how their rights will be affected under this new and complex legislation. Tory Back Benchers may not give two hoots about the Bill and they may vote for it in ignorance and with contempt for what the Scottish people want. However, they should at least have the decency to inform the Scottish people about how the rights of tenants will change in the revamped private sector, but the Minister will not concede that. The Lords amendment may give a written lease, but it will not give comprehensive information about assured tenancies or about how they compare with secure tenancies in the public sector. The Minister has a responsibility to address that problem. I am not convinced that a booklet that contains general information will do that.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) believes that Tory Back Benchers do not care about the Lords amendment. The evidence is obvious&#x2014;there are no Tory Back Benchers here, or at least no Scottish ones. I see only an English stray, the hon. Member for Windsor and Maidenhead (Dr. Glyn). He is no doubt welcome.<br/>
I do not understand, from hearing what the Minister has said, why he does not support amendment (a). Everything that he has said should be leading him to support it. He has said that he is keen that tenants should be informed about their rights, so he should accept amendment (a), which provides him with an ideal opportunity. It is important that there should be a document to summarise tenants' rights and duties under current legislation, including procedures for appeal against eviction or variations in terms of rent. It is right and proper that that should be made available by the Secretary of State for Scotland.<br/>
The Lords amendment, which the Minister supports, creates a duty on the landlord to provide a written tenancy document and a weekly rent book. Those are sensible and necessary provisions for tenants and are to be welcomed. Amendment (a) seeks to take that protection one step forward. I cannot agree with the Minister when he says that it goes too far. It is a simple, straightforward, sensible measure, which I hope that he will adopt. On several occasions, he has said that he is interested in informing tenants about their rights. Here is a practical opportunity for him to do so.<br/>
If information is to be supplied by a landlord, amendment (a) is surely a sensible and reasonable provision, which adds to the ability of a tenant to know his rights. Amendment (a) would assist tenants and give protection to individuals by ensuring that they are alerted to their legal rights. I support amendment (a) and ask the Minister to think again. It is not a step that goes too far and it should be sensibly accepted as part of the protection for tenants.</p>

<p>I should like to thank the hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) for acknowledging the effective opposition by Labour Members in Committee. It is a testimony to his political integrity that he has done so, whereas many other hon. Members might not have been genuine and generous enough to acknowledge the fight put up by my hon. Friends.<br/>
I ask the Minister a simple question in two words&#x2014;why not? He has taken the opportunity tonight to tell us about what the Government will do. He has not given one good reason why a reasonable amendment, which seeks to inform tenants of their rights under the Bill, should not be accepted.<br/>
This is a complex Bill. The work that has been put in and the length of the Committee and of the Bill itself are testimony to that complexity. Anyone knows, when he is renting, or, indeed, buying a house, how complex an operation that is. The Minister must know, as presumably he buys bigger houses than we do and has more complex details to work out. Thus, an already complex situation will be made far more so by the Bill.<br/>
The Minister must tell us why it is such a bad idea or an unreasonable demand that, in the midst of those technicalities that are being inflicted upon would-be tenants, we should ask that they be given a general guide, particularly when all the evidence of the Government's

Acts shows how, when complex issues are not explained in a comprehensive and straightforward way, the people who lose are the consumers.<br/>
One has only to look at the lack of take-up of benefits. Despite all the good intentions of hon. Members on both sides of the House, because of the complexity of the benefits system&#x2014;most benefits do not involve lawyers, tribunals or the legal system&#x2014;most of those benefits are not taken up. That does not show an unwillingness on the part of the would-be beneficiaries to take up the benefits, but it shows complete ignorance, not through any fault of their own. They cannot gain access to information or to details about their rights and entitlements.<br/>
In certain spheres, the Government are intent on making sure that people know their rights. When it comes to trade unions, we are constantly told in the House that trade union members must have knowledge, must participate and be involved and; above all, must have their rights clearly outlined to them. Similarly, for consumers, there is now legislation to ensure that their rights are known to them. When it suits the Government, they are willing to undertake vast exercises of public information or, as has been said, public disinformation.<br/>
There was an example of that on the poll tax and also when this legislation was proposed, in regard to tenants of the Scottish Special Housing Association. No excuses or reasons were given by the Government for why they could not contact every member of the SSHA. The stamp machines were going 19 to the dozen and the letters were flying out of the Scottish Office at St. Andrew's house. Every single tenant of the SSHA was contacted. Incidentally, there was no ballot form in the envelope. However, when it suited the Government and when they wanted to put out their propaganda supporting their case for the Scottish Homes legislation, they managed to write individually to every one of those tenants.<br/>
When it comes to the Government's pet subjects, such as undermining the trade unions and propagating their views on Scottish Homes and the poll tax, why is it that there are no lengths that are considered too inordinate for the provision of information? But when we ask for a straightforward, simple guide to tenants' rights to be supplied to every one of the tenants, the Government do not give us a single reason why that should not be done.<br/>
I look forward to the Minister's answer. He should not tell us what he has done. Let us assume that we look upon what he has done as a sign of his benificence and benevolence. But we ask him why he cannot do what is asked in what must be judged by any objective observer to be an eminently reasonable amendment, which means that the people who will be most affected by the Bill will be given an idea of their rights under the legislation.</p>

<p>When we started the Bill's long progress towards the Floor of the House on 19 January by embarking on the Committee stage, the Government had not even conceded the right of tenants to have anything in writing from their landlords. That was to be left to the market, to be negotiated freely between landlord and tenant. We have moved on a bit since then. If the booklet that the Minister has promised will be published had been published then, it would have been one of the shortest ever published by the Government. It would have contained the phrase, "All terms and conditions of rent are to be negotiated between the landlord and the tenant. Yours sincerely." We have moved on to what may well be an


alarming position for tenants. They will have the right to a written lease, which we wholeheartedly support, but not the right to an explanation of that lease.<br/>
7 pm<br/>
I am not a lawyer&#x2014;I know that the Minister is&#x2014;but I have no doubt that it would suit certain landlords to visit certain solicitors and draw up leases that were hard to understand and would enable them to say to their tenants, "This is all legal jargon, but basically it means X, Y and Z. Sign here." We have all been subjected to pressure to sign at the foot of a page that looks too complicated to read. The Lords amendment asks&#x2014;and we ask&#x2014;for a summary explanation of tenants' rights and duties.<br/>
While it is fundamentally important that tenants' rights are explained to them, it is also vital that their duties are explained so that they cannot at any stage be hoodwinked by their landlords. That is part of our basic objection to the way in which the Government have handled the matter. They have sided with the landlord time and again. They have moved from their position of 19 January not because they disagree suddenly with the landlords, or because they think that tenants deserve better protection and more information now than they did then; their sole reason is that they fear public opinion.<br/>
Since January we have gone through what was, for the Government, a humiliating round of local elections. The Conservatives could not take back cities such as Edinburgh: they could barely gain one or two seats there, and they were wiped out in such places as Glasgow. If he did any canvassing in Edinburgh, West, the Minister will know that that was because many tenants in both the private and the public sector fear that the Government wish to hand over them and their tenancies and to prejudice their children's rights to tenancies, and they have reacted against that. Public opinion has forced the Government to make this moderate concession.<br/>
Cannot the Minister now agree that there are no real barriers to issuing a summary statement which would help tenants to know their rights and obligations and the obligations of their landlords so that when tenant and landlord sit down with the legal document that represents the lease there is a legally binding explanation that helps to describe what might be too complicated for laymen such as myself to understand?</p>

<p>I apologise for the fact that other business prevented me from being present for earlier speeches. I heard the opening of the debate, however.<br/>
Once again my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has raised an important point. It returns us to the issue that has been brought up throughout the debate, that of the real world. On paper, I am sure that many of us are pleased to see the Government cave in to the forceful arguments that we presented in Committee, when we insisted at every opportunity that tenants' basic rights should be protected. A fundamental part of those rights was the right to a written lease, which was to be removed. I am delighted that the Government now accept that principle. While we might have been happier with wording other than the "civil servantese" with which we have been dished up, progress is clearly being made.<br/>
My hon. Friend's point is valid. The lease is not a declaration of the tenant's rights and interests; it is simply an expression of the contract between the two parties. It

makes no reference to the law that backs it up. We have seen fit to regulate this matter; here we still have a bit of Government intervention. Let me direct the Minister's attention to precedents of which he will be well aware. For example, under the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, with the service of a notice to quit there is a statutory form setting out the tenant's rights and obligations as well as the landlord's obligations. That was done for good reasons. Parliament considered it important that when such a serious step was being taken the tenant should be fully advised of his or her rights.<br/>
We feel that the circumstances that we are now discussing are on all fours with that. The Bill will mean a considerable shift away from the rights of the tenant&#x2014;which were the basis of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984 and all the Acts that preceded it, right back to the Rent Act 1965&#x2014;to the rights of the landlord. There is an imbalance. But, although we have hammered the point home as hard as we could, we have been able to shake the Governrnent only a little. Opposition Members bitterly regret that they would not make the major shift that we wanted, because we believe that housing in Scotland will be profoundly affected.<br/>
The amendment seeks to achieve important but simple things. I find it rather difficult to understand why the Government have decided to produce a booklet, although I am delighted to hear that from the Minister today. Any information passed on to consumers&#x2014;which tenants are &#x2014;is welcome, as long as it is accurate and presented in an understandable form. I mentioned "civil servantese". It is important to write in ordinary plain English. There was a time when Governments attempted to do that, but they seem to be moving away from it again. We shall be discussing the documents on the community charge later this evening.<br/>
If the Minister has accepted the principle that information should be passed on to the tenant, why does he not accept the principle that that information should be targeted? The best way to target it is to oblige the landlord to include a schedule, just as he is entitled to present a notice to quit in a statutory form. Why cannot the tenant have a statutory declaration of his rights? It would be fairly simple to produce it by order, as is done in other contexts.<br/>
We are agreed on the principle that the information should be passed on to the tenant. We merely want to ensure that it reaches its source, and the simplest way in which to do that is to make it part of the lease. If he accepts the principle, why cannot the Minister accept this simple amendment?</p>

<p>The Government are fully aware that the smooth working of the assured tenancy system requires that tenants and landlords are fully aware of their rights and responsibilities. The provisions for a written lease are extremely important and should not be underestimated. We believe that the landlord must provide the tenant with a written document setting out the tenancy terms in the prescribed form, and notices for use by tenants and landlords will contain information on the rights of both.<br/>
The hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) said that that was not enough, and I agree with him: it is not enough in itself. The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked whether the booklet would be comprehensive. It certainly will be. It will set out all the


major rights and all the implications. It will also be freely available to every private sector tenant, although it will be impossible to ensure that every tenant picks one up.<br/>
The situation is not the same with SSHA tenants. There are now 80,000 such tenants, but there are no assured tenants&#x2014;of course, not everyone wants to become an assured tenant. The booklet, however, will be widely and freely available.</p>

<p>The situation may not be exactly the same as that which applies to SSHA tenants, but I gave that example to illustrate the point. The Minister says that it will be possible to make sure that every tenant picks up a booklet, and precisely the same situation applies to benefits.<br/>
Is it the Minister's intention to ensure that the Bill operates on behalf of the consumer, about whom the Government constantly speak and to whom they direct their attention and propaganda? Does the Minister accept that, as in the case of benefits, consumers may not pick up a booklet because of a lack of knowledge and because they may be unaware of their rights? Therefore, that consumer will not gain the benefits of the Bill.<br/>
If the Minister agrees with that, why does he not follow what our amendment suggests? Procedures for appeals against conviction or variations in terms should be included with a summary of tenants' rights and duties under current legislation. The Minister should ensure that there is no question of a tenant not picking up a booklet by making it available to him at the time he enters into the contract.</p>

Ironically, the hon. Member for Dundee, East cited the example of the information sent out regarding the community charge. It almost appeared that the hon. Gentleman was citing it as a good example of such communications. We shall bear in mind what he said.</p>

The hon. Member for Angus, East (Mr. Welsh) asked about the second Opposition amendment, which would give the right to raise court proceedings at no cost. We do not believe that the Opposition have considered the wide-ranging implications of that for the Scottish legal system. To accept it would be foolhardy.</p>

<p>I do not think that the Minister knows where he is either.<br/>
I acknowledge the generous words of the hon.

<p>I believe that this is a sensible amendment and I am happy to support it in the same way as the colleagues of the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) supported my amendments during earlier proceedings on this Bill. It is a sensible amendment, which protects Scottish tenants and therefore it is well worth supporting, irrespective of party.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman must forgive me, but I was not aware that he had taken a great deal of interest in this Bill up until now, although, fair enough, I recall that he tabled one amendment on Report. I will leave it at that.<br/>
The Minister has acknowledged the need for tenants to have information. He rather rashly said that, under Lords amendment No. 17, the lease would have to be provided in a prescribed form. I note that the Lords amendment refers to a prescribed form for rent books, but I see no reference to a prescribed format for leases. Therefore, I fear that leases could be curt documents setting out the rent to be paid and the duties of the tenant without giving any clear advice about the tenant's rights.<br/>
The Minister has made much of the booklet that the Government intend to publish. I echo my hon. Friends' welcome of the fact that that information will be published. However, I share the anxiety of my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) about whether the booklet will be another propaganda leaflet on behalf of the Conservative Government.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585769" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.356.3" hansard_membership_id="8410" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3058" speakername="Mr. McAllion" colnum="356" time="18:30:00">
<p>Does my hon. Friend agree that if it was intended to be a propaganda leaflet issued on behalf of the Government, it would be given to every private sector tenant and they would not have to go to collect it? After all, that is the case with the poll tax booklet, which is being published by the Government.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585770" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.356.4" hansard_membership_id="5983" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2834" speakername="Mr. Home Robertson" colnum="356" time="18:30:00">
<p>My hon. Friend is right, and there are precedents to confirm his fears.<br/>
Under the present Government, the track record of the Scottish information office is not a happy one. It has allowed itself to be used as a mouthpiece by the Conservative party and it has not disseminated information to citizens or, as in this case, to tenants.<br/>
I am inclined to stick to my guns on our amendment. Let us consider the type of problem that may occur. A tenant in an assured tenancy may receive a notice of an increase in rent or a notice of eviction. Whom does he go to to find out his rights? How does he know how to go about appealing against an increase in rent or a variation in terms? How does he know what the correct format should be for appealing against an eviction order? How will he know the timetable for such an appeal? These are complicated affairs and unless there is clear advice, readily available, to tenants there is a genuine fear that they will be harassed or exploited by their landlords.</p>

<speech hansard_id="585772" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.357.0" hansard_membership_id="4190" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3211" speakername="Dr. Reid" colnum="357" time="19:15:00">
<p>I urge my hon. Friend to stick to his guns. The Government have run on the platform of tenants' rights in Scotland. They forced through the House&#x2014;against the best interests of Scottish tenants&#x2014;the Tenants' Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Act 1980. Therefore, it would be a supreme irony if Conservative Members voted on the basis that they are all for tenants' rights, but they do not want those tenants to know about them.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585773" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.357.1" hansard_membership_id="5983" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2834" speakername="Mr. Home Robertson" colnum="357" time="19:15:00">
<p>That is exactly what the Minister is saying by resisting my amendment. It is a simple amendment which would require the Secretary of State to compile an up-to-date summary of tenants' rights, which could be annexed to every lease that is agreed between a landlord and tenant under the new assured tenancy system. That is not a particularly onerous burden for the Scottish Office. I have no doubt that if the Scottish Office wanted to disseminate propaganda it would do so cheerfully.<br/>
A summary of tenants' rights would be the mechanism whereby tenants could obtain urgently needed advice. The tenant may be lucky enough to have to hand a copy of the booklet. That might tell him how he should go about appealing against a rent increase or an eviction order. Surely it would be infinitely more satisfactory if that urgently needed information were annexed to the lease. That is what we are demanding and I invite my hon. Friends to join me in supporting the amendment.</p>

<p>These amendments relate to a point that was first raised by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood) when we discussed the Bill in Standing Committee. He was concerned that there were likely to be very few short assured tenancies in any one locality in rural areas in Scotland. In such circumstances, the rent assessment committee might be unable to make a determination of rent under clause 31 because of a lack of similar tenancies of similar houses.<br/>
We have taken on board that concern. These amendments make it clear that a rent committee determining the rent of a short assured tenancy should consider the rents of all assured tenancies, whether short or not, as evidence for the appropriate market level of rent. However, when reaching its determination, clearly the committee will bear in mind that rents for short assured tenancies will often be lower than those for ordinary assured tenancies. I hope that that change meets with the approval of the House.</p>

<p>The only query that arises from the Minister's speech is that not very long ago he was saying that a short assured tenancy and an assured tenancy were one and the same thing, so far as concerned the provisions of the Bill. Now he is saying that there will have to be an amendment to establish that they are the same for the purposes of considerations by rent assessment committees. Perhaps the Minister will return to that point.<br/>
This extension of the scope of the rent assessment committee to compare a rent that is the subject of an appeal against other rents charged in the locality, which now includes those for all assured tenancies and not just short assured tenancies, is obviously a minor improvement and one that we accept. However, perhaps the Minister will take this opportunity to address himself to the fact that the market rent likely to be established through this process will almost certainly be considerably higher in many cases than that which many people would regard as being affordable. How will that gap be bridged?</p>

<p>The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) spoke of what is an affordable rent and what is a market rent. Obviously he does not realise that if a rent is set at a level that is not affordable, the property will not be let&#x2014;and that would not be in the interests of landlords in the rural areas, of which he probably knows much more than I do, having himself been a landlord. The market will reflect the situation in whatever locality, and if landlords are determined to let their properties, they will fix rents at levels that people can afford.</p>

<p>I repeat my earlier comment&#x2014;that a short assured tenancy is a form of assured tenancy.

<p>The Minister said that the rent assessment committee will only be able to operate on the basis that it will be able to compare the rents of similar short assured tenancies in the locality. What will happen in the early stages, when the Act is first applied, and when assured and short assured tenancies are first set up? Will tenants have no recourse to a rent assessment committee because there will be insufficient numbers of assured and short assured tenancies with which to compare their rents?

<p>These amendments all relate to the new right to damages that clause 33 gives to an illegally evicted tenant. As I believe all right hon. and hon. Members agree, the increased protection and


compensation for harassed and illegally evicted tenants that the Bill introduces are an important element in our reform of the private rented sector.<br/>
Amendment No. 24 removes from clause 33(2) the need for an illegally evicted tenant to prove that his former landlord intended to force him to leave. Proof of intention has always been difficult to achieve. In clause 35, dealing with the new offence of harassment, the test is already that the landlord must only have known or have had reasonable cause to believe that his actions would make his tenant leave. Therefore, amendment No. 24 brings the provisions of clause 33 into line. Because the offence leading to a liability to damages is changed, it is necessary to change also the date from which liability can arise to that when the changes were first introduced to Parliament. That is what amendment No. 23 achieves.<br/>
Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 are different and in effect give an additional defence to a landlord who faces a claim for damages under clause 33.<br/>
Clause 33(7) provides that in proceedings to enforce a liability, a landlord may defend his actions by proving that he believed or had reasonable cause to believe that when they took place, the occupier no longer stayed in the house. Amendments Nos. 25 and 26 provide a similar defence if the liability arises because of the withholding or withdrawing of services. In such circumstances, the landlord will have a defence if he can show that he had reasonable grounds to withdraw or withhold the services. That might apply, for example, if the landlord was genuinely of the opinion that the tenant had left the house to work elsewhere for a period, or that he had made alternative arrangements to receive the services in question. I believe that these amendments improve the new right to damages in clause 33.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585810" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.365.0" hansard_membership_id="5983" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2834" speakername="Mr. Home Robertson" colnum="365" time="19:45:00">
<p>I doubt if it will give that much comfort to someone who is being evicted with his family from his home to think that he will have the option over the next six months or one year of trying to fight his case in the courts, in order to win damages for that eviction. The fact is that the family concerned will be out in the street trying to find accommodation of some kind. The whole concept of damages for unlawful eviction is bizarre.<br/>
The entire Bill is designed to make it as easy as possible for private landlords to evict people lawfully, so it will be a very careless landlord who, under the new legislation, will carry out such action illegally. I suspect that the concept of illegal eviction could become redundant. However, the principle of imposing penalties for harassment is certainly worth developing, and we accept it as far as it goes. The rest of the legislation is so flawed that this fig leaf cannot do much to conceal the problems.<br/>
I refer briefly to the specific impact of amendment No. 25, which refers to harassment in the form of withdrawal of services. I presume that that means electricity, water, drainage, and other services of that nature.<br/>
The amendment will establish a ground for defence if the landlord had reasonable grounds for withdrawing those services from the tenant. It could be construed that it is reasonable, for example, to cut off the electricity supply if the landlord is in dispute with the electricity board or if the cable or other equipment has failed. The tenant may have nothing to do with the problem between the landlord and the electricity board. Amendment (a) would restrict that ground to cases where the tenant was at

fault and where he had been given an opportunity to remedy that. I foresee genuine problems and I invite the Minister seriously to consider amendment (a).</p>

<p>Clause 33 will be improved by the addition of Lords amendment No. 24. I know from experience that there is a major problem in encouraging procurators fiscal to take action against landlords. I hope that the amendment will be a genuine improvement, but we shall have to wait to experience it in practice. However, although it improves the civil position of tenants by giving them the right to raise actions for damages, I hope that the Minister understands that the procurators fiscal need to be encouraged. No greater proof could be necessary before the civil courts than a successful prosecution of a landlord in the criminal courts for harassment. I hope that the Government will find some way to encourage procurators fiscal seriously to consider such cases, as I know from experience the difficulty of persuading the police and the procurators fiscal to take them up.<br/>
I am interested in the scope of clause 33 as expanded by the amendment. A case that has been worrying me for some time involves the tenant of a private landlord who agreed to move while the house was modernised and improved with the aid of public grants. She has been refused the right to return to her home, and in my experience that is not uncommon. Will the new legislation give my constituent the right to raise an action for civil damages against the landlord? The legal advice that she has been given so far is that her only entitlement would be to removal costs, because they would be the extent of loss that could be established.<br/>
That is unsatisfactory. Will an amended clause 33 improve my constituent's position?</p>

<p>Obviously, they will be taken seriously by those who uphold the law&#x2014;for example, the police and law-abiding citizens such as the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
I should be grateful if the hon. Member for Aberdeen, South (Mr. Doran) would give me the details of the case of his constituent to which he referred so that I can investigate and come back to him on it.<br/>
The Bill very significantly improves the protection available to a tenant against a landlord who seeks to operate outwith the law. The new provisions on improved protection against illegal eviction and the new right of a tenant to compensation have been widely welcomed.<br/>
The provisions give a landlord specific defences that he can seek to employ to justify his actions, but they involve persuasion of the sheriff. I believe that to be fair and just.<br/>
The hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has argued for the new defence to be qualified. I am afraid that his proposal would, in practice, add nothing to the effect of Lords amendment No. 26, and might in certain circumstances be detrimental.<br/>
Any landlord who sought to invoke the new defence would need to persuade the sheriff that he had reasonable grounds to withdraw or withhold the services. If appropriate, the sheriff would no doubt take into account any steps the landlord had taken to discuss the matter with his tenant, to offer alternatives, or to come to some other mutually acceptable arrangement.<br/>
I am sure that the hon. Gentleman can be confident that the defence as set out in Lords amendment No. 26 is not too loosely drawn, and in the light of my explanation I hope that he will not pursue his amendment.</p>

<p>These amendments go a long way towards meeting the concern expressed in Committee by the hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) and others. They enable the sheriff to take into account development value in certain circumstances when he is assessing the damage to which an illegally evicted tenant is entitled under clauses 33 and 34.<br/>
Clause 34 sets out how the damages should be assessed, briefly, the intention is that they should equal any gain the landlord would expect to obtain by owning the house with vacant possession rather than with a sitting tenant. The amendments mean that in assessing the potential gain, the sheriff can take into account any gain the landlord would make if he redeveloped the property for other residential purposes. That is directed, for example, at landlords who might otherwise be tempted to evict their tenants illegally so as to convert the property into flats for sale, which is the most common form of redevelopment.<br/>
I hope that hon. Members will appreciate that the amendments strike a fair balance that should moderate the behaviour of unscrupulous landlords and offer tenants increased compensation if they are illegally evicted.</p>

<p>This group of amendments may look a little odd, but I can assure hon. Members that they are necessary.<br/>
The original need to amend the clause arose because we did not extend the provisions of clause 42 to Crown tenancies. Amendment No. 37 puts it right. However, that amendment makes amendments Nos. 29 to 36 necessary to maintain the grammatical integrity of the Bill. Without them, the new paragraph we are adding would not make sense.</p>

<p>Not much of the Bill makes sense, but at least there will be some grammatical integrity, if nothing else. It would be helpful if the Minister could say a word about the impact of the extended scope of the clause to Crown tenants and Government Departments.<br/>
I am glad of the opportunity to speak to amendment No. 33, which refers to whether a house belongs to the Scottish Special Housing Association. I do not know whether hon. Members read <i>The Scotsman</i> on Monday, which referred to 1,700 SSHA houses in the Borders that apparently are to be transferred to a new trust, Waverley Housing, set up by, of all people the Earl of Ancram&#x2014;that old friend of my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, South (Mr. Griffiths).<br/>
There has been much jumping of guns in anticipation of the passing of this squalid little Bill but, quite frankly, that one takes the biscuit. <i>The Scotsman</i> states that the object of Waverley Housing will be to
<q>protect Borders tenants from profiteering private landlords who might snap up properties in a free-for-all when the SSHA ceases to exist.</q>
The Government are legislating for that free-for-all. Indeed, it can take place only if Scottish Homes, acting as the agent for the Secretary of State, allows it. Interestingly enough, in between his excursions to such places as Richmond and Epping Forest, Michael Ancram will be one of the Secretary of State's creatures on the board of Scottish Homes as well as undertaking the Waverley Housing set-up in the Borders.<br/>
The significance of all that is that those tenants will lose their status as secure tenants as soon as ownership of their properties is transferred to Ancram Homes, Waverley Homes, or whatever it wants to call itself. That is inevitable. I understand that there will be a temporary holding operation and that a management trust will run matters, but the ownership of the houses will remain with Scottish Homes.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Greenock and Port Glasgow (Dr. Godman) is quite right. Anna McCurley has landed a job on the Horserace Betting Levy Board. Yes, there are plenty of jobs. Michael Ancram has so many jobs that there are none left for poor old Alex Pollock.<br/>
Much more seriously, what will happen to tenants when their houses are transferred from the ownership of Scottish Homes in due course and are taken over by Ancram Homes or whatever it will be called? They will lose their security as secure tenants, they will lose their protection against excessive rents, and they will lose a range of vital rights. It is a matter of acute concern. Frankly, all the assurances about the future of SSHA tenants will not even last until the Bill gets Royal Assent.<br/>
Several of my hon. Friends may remember that the Secretary of State for Scotland actually criticised Opposition Members for scaremongering when we said that SSHA tenants would be sold down the river. But, already, he and his cronies are at it. Tenants and local authorities in the Borders have not been consulted. There has just been a sordid little carve-up, agreed in the Tory central bunker in Chester street, Edinburgh. The 1,700 tenants will be transferred from the SSHA in anticipation of transferring Scottish Homes to the new private trust orchestrated by Michael Ancram. That is a shameful manipulation by this minority Government, and I have no hesitation in pledging to restore proper protection to tenants at the earliest opportunity. I am grateful for the opportunity presented by the amendment to highlight the despicable action taking place in the Borders.</p>

<p>I, too, am grateful for the opportunity to ask what has happened in the Borders with the Waverley housing association. I remember the hours that we spent in Committee debating the rights of Scottish Homes tenants and whether they were threatened by the legislation. We were given repeated assurances by the Minister that there would be no element of compulsion on Scottish Homes tenants, that they could remain Scottish Homes tenants as long as they wished to do so, and that they would keep all the public sector tenants' rights that they had previously.<br/>
The Minister came to Dundee, East, along with Mr. Derek Mason, who at that time was responsible for the SSHA, but he has also now landed a plum job with Scottish Homes. The two of them took the opportunity to blazon out to the press in Dundee that no Scottish Homes tenant's position was threatened and that, as long as that tenant wishes to remain a tenant of the new housing agency, nobody will interfere. Of course, the new agency has not even been set up, and already 1,700 houses have been taken out of the control of Scottish Homes. Scottish Homes' ownership of the 1,700 houses on the Borders is a technical matter.<br/>
From a report in <i>The Scotsman,</i> I understand that the new Waverley housing association will act on behalf of Scottish Homes. It will manage houses, control rents, be responsible for maintenance, and negotiate house sales with tenants. For every possible purpose that can be conceived, the Waverley housing association, not Scottish Homes, will be the new landlord. Has any one tenant been consulted? Not in the least. They had to read about it in

<i>The Scotsman.</i> The House was not told about it. The Standing Committee that dealt with the Bill was given no warning. We were led to believe entirely the opposite.<br/>
The Minister assured us that every tenant would be consulted and that nothing would be done to take them out of the control of Scottish Homes unless they so wished. The rights of 1,700 tenants have been ignored by the Minister. Will he have the courage to go to the Dispatch Box, in a place where he is accountable, and explain to the House and to the people in the Borders why it is happening and why they and other people in Scotland have not been consulted? It is an arrogant abuse of power by the Government. I know that the Minister is a nice man who will probably sit on his bum and say nothing, but he should try to defend what the Government are doing in Scotland. There is no defence.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman has made an interesting observation. Scottish Homes is a large organisation dealing with tenants in properties throughout Scotland. It is quite right and proper that people who give their time should receive some reimbursement. The amount of reimbursement is quite trivial, considering what one might expect if one does a job conscientiously. That is true of many other public positions. I do not make that comment purely in respect of this narrow matter. We ask too many people to give too much time to public matters. We do not take into account the impingement on their time. Councillors and others are within that category.<br/>
The hon. Member for Dundee, East mentioned that Mr. Ancram will be paid. It is a big job for Scottish Homes. He accepted the chairmanship of the much smaller body near where he lives. He is a local person giving time to a local interest, and that must surely be to the benefit of the local community.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman calls &#x00A3;3,000 to &#x00A3;4,000 trivial. Does he not realise that there are millions of pensioner couples in this country who, because the pension has been depressed by the Government, are restricted to that very sum? Millions of people are on income support because of the unemployment levels that the Government have generated, and they have to live on &#x00A3;60 to &#x00A3;70 per week. The hon.

If we were talking about paying someone &#x00A3;50,000 or &#x00A3;100,000 a year, I could understand the objection, but we are talking, not of enormous sums but relatively small sums compared with the input that we expect.

<p>I should like to respond briefly to the questions on the Waverley housing trust. I understand that it is proposed that the trust will take over the management of the SSHA stock in the Borders. It will be for the SSHA to decide on Waverley's housing proposals since management issues are for the association. The association has raised certain consequential matters with my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and it has yet to take a final decision on new management arrangements, so the whole matter is under consideration.<br/>
The objective will be to improve the standards of service offered to tenants and the objectives of the trust are wholly concerned with benefiting the local community. Therefore, it is most encouraging that somebody of the calibre of Michael Ancram who has expertise in housing and is well known for his interest has been sufficiently public-spirited to offer himself&#x2014;</p>

well-established rules and procedures for board members to declare such an interest and avoid participating in discussions.<br/>
So far as political considerations are relevant, Mr. Charles Sneddon, who was appointed for his personal contribution, as were the others, based on his background of involvement with the council of management of the SSHA and his local authority, will be particularly helpful to Scottish Homes.

<p>Amendments Nos. 38, 39 and 76 make two changes to clause 43 and schedule 6. One is purely a presentational one. The other introduces transitional provisions to protect the succession rights of certain prospective tenants. The presentational change is quite significant and is designed to make what are complex changes to complex legislation easier to follow.<br/>
As a result of the Lords amendments clause 43 will introduce a new section 3A to the 1984 Act to introduce different schedules which will come into play in different circumstances. Schedule 6 becomes the vehicle for importing two new schedules to supplement schedule 1 of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, which will remain in its present form subject to a minor drafting change, made by amendment No. 83.<br/>
Schedule 1 of the 1984 Act will continue to apply to succession in cases where the original tenant and the first successor to a regulated tenancy die before commencement of Part II of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 38 and 39 pave the way for the new format of schedule 6 to the Bill, set out in amendment No. 76, which introduces two new schedules &#x2014;1A and 1B&#x2014;to the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984.<br/>
Schedule 1 A will apply to succession in cases in which the original tenant of a protected tenancy dies after commencement of part II of the Bill. Schedule 1B will apply to succession in cases in which someone who is a first successor to a regulated tenancy dies after commencement of part II of the Bill, but the original tenant dies before commencement.<br/>
As to transitional provisions, hon. Members will, I am sure, be pleased that the new schedules 1A and 1B incorporate the transitional provisions which provide a right of succession to a statutory assured tenancy for members of a tenant's family who have already lived with the tenant for six months at the commencement date of the Bill. They will not have to fulfil the new two-year residence requirement.<br/>
As a result of the recasting of schedule 6 achieved by amendment 76, an entry in schedule 10 of the Bill&#x2014;the repeal schedule&#x2014;is no longer required. The consequential amendment in the name of my right hon. and learned Friend removes that unnecessary entry.</p>

<p>This is no big deal. It is merely a redraft of clause 43 and part I of schedule 6 on succession of tenant. Our main objection to the original draft of this part of the legislation still stands. It is that the relative will now have to live with the tenant for two years before he or she qualifies as a successor. Amendment No. 76 restricts that to six months only in cases that arise immediately before the Bill comes into effect. Apart from that, until the legislation is repealed or drastically amended, as it must be, two years will be the rule. That will cause a special problem for members of a family who may make great sacrifices so as to move in with an elderly or infirm relative and care for him. If the tenant does not survive for the full two years such a caring member of a family could find himself made homeless, for his pains, on the death of the tenant. The Lords amendment is no worse than the original drafting, so we shall not vote against it, but I fear that this aspect of the Bill will lead to rough justice, and I undertake to review it at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>A constituent of mine gave up her home to go and care for an elderly relative. In this highly unusual case, when the elderly relative died my constituent then


went to care for a sick and dying brother. She spent a considerable time away from her home and ended up losing it. What would happen to such a person under this legislation? She did not spend as much as two years with either person, yet had spent much time away from her home. She would lose her home and not gain the tenancy of her parent's or brother's homes.<br/>
My constituent had no work. She is too old to find work and lives on social security. In Glasgow's housing crisis she is at the tail end of a long waiting list. Has the Minister thought through the sort of cases that will occur in real life? Conservative Members must know from their surgeries that things like this happen. I can understand efforts being made to prevent people from jumping in cynically at the last minute by going to live with a sick and elderly relative in the hopes of succeeding to the tenancy, but two years is far too long. People may go for as little as six months in a genuine effort to care for an elderly relative and then have no right to succeed to the tenancy. That is wrong.<br/>
The Government have made great play of care in the community, of driving elderly people out of hospitals and into the community. That has meant that women with low-paid jobs or no jobs at all lose their homes. That cannot be the intention even of this Government. Surely they do not want to throw on to the streets women who have devoted years of their lives to caring for others.</p>

<p>Opposition Members have raised the same points as those mentioned by the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) in Committee.<br/>
When we introduced the Bill we pointed out that as things stand a landlord can find a property that he lets the subject of a series of successions which put the house out of his reach for generations. Extensive succession rights will not apply to assured tenancies and the Government believe that succession rights in regulated tenancies should also be restricted. In our original proposals for succession in regulated tenancies we envisaged that a relative of a tenant other than a spouse would have to live with the tenant for five years before the tenant's death before he or she would qualify as a successor. That would also be one of the conditions that would have to be fulfilled if a second succession was to occur.<br/>
In Committee, the hon. Member for Dundee, East and organisations involved in housing matters argued strongly that five years was too long and should be reduced, and on reflection the Government agreed. Consequently, two major changes to the succession rules were made.<br/>
First, on Report, the five-year requirement was reduced to two years. Secondly, as well as making the provisions easier to understand, Lords amendments Nos. 38, 39, 76 and 83 introduced transitional provisions to protect the position of prospective successors who, on the death of a tenant after commencement, would not meet the two-year qualifying period, but through residence before commencement would have met the six-month qualifying period that existed then.<br/>
The Government believe the changes have improved the Bill and strike a fair balance between the interests of landlords and tenants.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment<br/>
The amendment meets a concern expressed at an earlier stage by the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire (Mr. Kirkwood). It increases the kinds of information about market rents that the rent assessment panel can be required to keep by the Secretary of State under clause 46. In the form in which the Bill left the House, clause 46 limited the information to be held to that relating to actual determinations made by rent assessment committees for assured tenancies. The amendment enables my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State to require the rent assessment panel to keep information derived not only from applications that result in rent determinations, but from applications that do not.<br/>
There are three circumstances in which no determination will be given. The first is when the application is withdrawn, presumably because landlord and tenant have reached an amicable agreement. The second is in the case of a short assured tenancy, when there are insufficient similar assured tenancies in an area for the rent assessment committee to make comparisons. The third case is when it is clear that the rent set by the landlord for an assured tenancy is not excessive in relation to rents for similar properties in an area. It would obviously be helpful to the rent assessment committees and to landlords and tenants to have readily available the wider pool of information about rent levels that the amendment will allow. I commend it to the House.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The amendment covers a technical conveyancing point and is intended to ensure that the expression "heritable proprietor" for the purposes of the tenants' choice provisions will cover all public sector landlords, who are, or may be, in conveyancing terms, "uninfeft proprietors". This term applies when they become proprietors by Act of Parliament but have not completed title in their own names in the register of sasines, or land registers. The amendment is needed to avoid any doubt that public sector landlords have a duty to sell their houses under part III to approved landlords, assuming that the tenants so wish. A similar definition applies in the right-to-buy legislation, and we think it appropriate to keep the two procedures in line as far as possible.</p>

<p>As the Minister says, this is a minor extension of the definition of proprietor for the purposes of the landlords' choice provisions of the Bill. I deliberately used the term "landlords' choice", because part III of the Bill has everything to do with extending private landlords' choice and nothing to do with extending choice for tenants. We are worried about the likelihood of abuse of this scheme by unscrupulous speculators who may try to entice tenants to consent to the transfer of their houses out of the public sector.<br/>
We are also worried about the possible break-up of tenant management co-operatives. The main message on part III of the Bill which should go out from the House and from any responsible person in Scotland, is that a tenant should think very carefully before allowing a private landlord to take over his public sector house. Such a transition would lead to an immediate and drastic loss of important rights of security and loss of rent control. We shall need to return to that topic when the Housing Bill for the United Kingdom as a whole comes back to the House. That will raise the possibility of large-scale transfers without the consent of tenants. This is an alarming principle and the House should deplore the Government's action.</p>

The amendments made in the other place offer a choice between the district valuer and another qualified valuer nominated by the landlord, but acceptable to the applicant. Amendment No. 43 also clarifies that it is for the landlord to decide whether it should be the district valuer or another qualified valuer who should determine the market value.

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
The main purpose of the amendment is to clarify that the property transferring under the tenants' choice provisions in part III can have not only a positive or zero value but, on occasions, a negative value.<br/>
Most houses in the public sector in Scotland have been maintained to a reasonable standard and are likely, therefore, under tenants' choice, to attract a positive value on transfer. However, there are some tenanted properties where this is not so, and these properties now need significant renovation to bring them up to the desired standard. In the very worst of such housing, it is possible that the cost to a potential new landlord of bringing the property into a reasonable state of repair could exceed the value of the property after the necessary renovation had been effected. In such cases few, if any, new landlords would be willing to participate in the acquisition of public sector housing under the powers in part III of the Bill, or would be willing to do so only in return for rent payments well above the going rate for such housing, and therefore well above the level that the tenant could afford to pay.<br/>
One can well imagine that it will be those tenants in local authority housing which is in the worst state of repair and who are least satisfied with the service provided by the local authority who will be most willing to contemplate a change of landlord. Therefore, the tenants' choice provisions should be especially attractive to such tenants. There should be no artificial barriers to such transfers proceeding. If we did not specifically permit negative valuations, and if we did not oblige local authorities to make payments equivalent to the amount of the negative valuation, the result would be an impediment to transfers.<br/>
I have considered the position from the point of view of the local authority or other public sector landlord whose tenants wish to transfer. Such landlords may argue that having to pay some new landlord to take away their housing would be a quite unacceptable form of asset stripping. I do not accept that, because if a house is in such a poor state of repair that it would cost more to renovate than the house would be worth when the work is done, the house in its present state is clearly a liability. In such circumstances, rent payments by tenants are probably insufficient to cover the cost of maintenance work necessary to prevent the housing deteriorating further. Moreover, in fulfilling its duties to the tenants the local authority would inevitably soon have to spend substantial sums to bring the property up to standard. By transferring the house to a new landlord the local authority is relieving


itself of the liability to meet such costs. The concept of negative valuations is therefore sensible, and fair to all parties.</p>

<p>This is an outrageous proposition and the Minister should be ashamed of himself for reading a brief of such nonsense. There is an urgent need for investment in public sector housing to rent and a need for investment in house building because as many as 30,000 people become homeless in Scotland every year. It is an outrageous proposition in view of the huge waiting list for public sector housing to rent. Shelter estimates that as many as 192,000 Scots are now waiting for houses. All that the Government can think of doing is to siphon money out of the public sector housing budget so that they can pay private sector landlords to take over public sector property.<br/>
There is a desperate need for investment but there are many calls on the budgets of local housing authorities and it cannot make sense to raid those budgets for the Government's purposes. The Government are legislating to require local authorities to pay speculators to take over housing stocks. That is an interesting new twist to the concept of expropriation without compensation and we should reflect on that idea in connection with the case for the acquisition of private sector housing stock. There is a great deal of substandard and empty private sector housing in Scotland, but the Government are under the happy illusion that it will all he renovated and let under this legislation. I suspect that that will not happen.<br/>
Perhaps we should pursue the precedent being set by this provision and think about taking empty substandard private sector housing stock into public ownership under the housing action area procedure. As far as I know that is still on the statute book. Perhaps we should go the whole hog and require private landlords to pay the local authority for bringing houses up to standard. That is the precedent that the Government are setting in this amendment.<br/>
The Government tell us about tens of thousands of empty or substandard privately owned houses in Scotland and say that they want to do something about them. Let us consider some drastic action to get that criminally neglected property back into service for the benefit of people who desperately need houses in Scotland. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is understandably alarmed by the prospect of the effects of this amendment. COSLA says:<br/>
<q>the Convention is extremely concerned at the prospect of local authority stock being transferred to private landlords at negative values which in effect will mean that local authorities will require to pay the new landlord to take over the stock. The method of valuation which will he used allows the District Valuer to take the state of repair of the house into account twice and the local authority is not allowed to appeal the District Valuer's decision.</q>
The Government's provision is a totally unwarranted attack on local authorities. Why should a local authority or, more significantly, local tenants, pay speculators to take over property that may have considerable potential but which is in bad condition because of the combined effects of criminal architecture and the malicious under-funding of local authorities by the Government? This provision comes on top of the abolition of the cost floor for council house sales on terms that will be even

more harmful than those which will apply under the English and Welsh legislation. Once again the remaining tenants will have to pay for the shortfall. They will have to pay for the effects of this legislation. That is wrong and unwarranted and the Minister should be ashamed of himself. We shall oppose this provision.</p>

<p>One of the blights of Scottish housing along with many other blights in the United Kingdom is the vast number of houses which, for whatever reason, were not built to a standard to enable them to last. Many of them were post-war and many such houses suffer from condensation, dampness and other horrors. Some of the schemes are not liked by the people who have been forced in the past to live in them and many houses have become derelict. Anything that can be done to revitalise those areas must be good. I pay tribute to Dundee district council, which has been imaginative and has shown the way that a combination of local government and private sector can bring a dramatic change to housing that is in a state of ghastly disrepair and houses the reputation of which was such that no one wished to live in them.<br/>
We have to view the amendment along these lines. I accept that in some circumstances&#x2014;I trust not in all&#x2014;it may be that the cost of bringing the houses up to an acceptable standard and of changing the face of estates so that people will be happy to live in them will be in excess of the value of the property, so the value of the property, taking account of its condition, may be negative. Sadly, some estates in Scotland have been knocked down before people have gone to live in them. Therefore, we cannot be proud of everything that has happened in housing in Scotland&#x2014;quite the reverse. Too often, we should be ashamed of the properties and even more ashamed that we ask people to live in them.<br/>
It is in that light that I welcome the amendment, because it makes a contribution to real problems, and shows how we can quickly rehabilitate areas that are falling into disrepute and disrepair. I was pleased to see my old home town of Dundee being so progressive, and to see what the council has done to bring back to life estates that had the most appalling reputation over many decades.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) for the compliments that he pays to Dundee district council, which has been imaginative in the way that it has tackled the problems of empty and derelict houses and blocks in certain housing schemes. It has done so on its own, without any support from the private sector. It approached the private sector to see whether it would help in such projects, but it did not want to know. The district council conceived these plans, led their implementation and funded them. The private sector came in only at the last stages, so the council should get the credit. However, I am sure that this Minister, and other Ministers, will try to claim credit at the next general election and will tell us what a marvellous job they have done in Dundee, when it has been the Labour-led Dundee district council that has done a marvellous job. Like the hon. Gentleman, I am concerned about the blight that has affected Scottish housing over the past 10 years, not least as a result of Tory housing policy.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman says that the amendment deals with the problem of blocks that have become empty and derelict, but it does not because it deals only with inhabited blocks. We are dealing here with tenants' rights and the


right to pick. One has to be a tenant before the amendment comes into play. It is strange that the Minister tries to argue that district councils in Scotland collect rents and put tenants into flats that are so run down and neglected that they have a negative value. That is not so. Many tenants in public sector housing in Scotland live in houses that have been neglected for many years because of the failure to invest. The real problem is that the district councils have been forced to rely only on rents to maintain and manage housing.<br/>
A few years ago, Dundee district council received &#x00A3;8 million a year in housing support grant from the Government to help it to maintain the housing stock. It also had a huge rate fund contribution to the housing revenue account, which helped to maintain the housing stock for which it is responsible. That is no longer the case. It has to manage and maintain all its housing stock on the revenue from rents because the Government have stopped housing support grant and rate fund contribution while giving increasingly massive subsidies to the owner-occupier sector through mortgage tax relief. It is strange that the Government can say that they are right to use public subsidy to encourage owner-occupation but that it would be wrong to use public subsidies to maintain public sector rented housing at a decent level that would allow tenants to live in those houses in peace and contentment.<br/>
8.45 pm<br/>
The Minister is saying that if a council tenant makes an agreement with a private sector landlord, the council will have to accept that some negative value will be placed on the house and will have to pay the private sector landlord for taking the house and the tenant off its hands. At the same time, the district council and the ratepayers in the area will be left to pay off the massive borrowing cost for that house. The loans for public sector houses are paid back over 60 years, and most of the houses in Dundee are still being paid for by the district council. The Minister is saying that, on top of that burden, the council will have to pay the private sector to take the property off its hands.<br/>
The Government must accept responsibility for restoring public subsidies to the public sector as well as to the private sector. They must allow district councils to get on with tackling the real problems of housing in Scotland &#x2014;condensation, dampness and overcrowding&#x2014;and give public subsidies to enable councils to maintain and manage the stock properly. Instead, the Government are robbing the public sector to fill the pockets of the greedy people in the private sector. That is what this amendment is all about.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the people of Maryhill are more streetwise than people elsewhere in Scotland, but I have yet to meet a district council tenant in Maryhill who has the slightest intention of choosing a private landlord. They are not naive or green or stupid or inexperienced about the wiles of private landlords and any poor soul who was likely to fall into the clutches would quickly be advised by their friends and neighbours not to do so.<br/>
The hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) has argued that there is no other solution, and that when a house is in an inadequate state and has a low valuation, it should be valued negatively on the market. However, the local authority is not allowed to appeal to the district valuer against what the value of the house is supposed tho

be. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) pointed out, had the Government maintained housing subsidy, things would not have been as bad. In Glasgow, the housing support grant is half what it was in 1979, and that is allowing for 1979 prices and inflation. In addition, the majority of Scottish housing authorities no longer receive any housing support grant.<br/>
When one considers that Glasgow district council has to spend 40 per cent. of its budget on paying the interest on debts to those who lent it money so that it could get houses built, one realises the size of the problem. That problem has been ignored while the Government's intention has been to make hfe easy for those who want to make easy profits as private sector landlords. They have the house handed to them for nothing and are even made a present of some money along with it. They can then sit back and make a killing doing nothing except filling out a rent book once a month. It is a farce and does nothing to ameliorate people's housing needs, and well the people of Scotland know it.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker), who congratulated Dundee district council. My district council, Motherwell, and others have been struggling, despite the handicaps imposed upon them by legislation, to continue public sector housing. However, it is disingenuous of the hon. Gentleman to try to draw a comparison between those efforts and what has been done in the Bill. What this part of the Bill sets out is not a joint enterprise or a combination of private and public sectors working towards a common end for the benefit of both. Because of Government restrictions it is a zero sum game that one of them must lose. Under this part of the Bill, it is clear that it robs public sector Peter to make sure that private sector Paul is fattened up.<br/>
The Minister did what he could to defend us and I compliment him. His detailed explanation was as clear as mud. The Minister is a master of obfuscation. It occurs to me that had he been a defence lawyer at the Nuremberg trials it would have been no wonder if Goering had won the order of Lenin. Despite the Minister's explanation, this part of the Bill can be put simply. It forces councils to get rid of houses that they do not want to abandon and, because of laws that councils do not support, there is a loss that the council cannot afford, and they must pay for the privilege into the bargain. All that is done on the basis of a valuation which is negative only because the Government have refused in the first place to give the council the money to carry out the repairs.<br/>
When it is put as simply as that, a number of questions arise. Why should local authorities be so different from anyone else in the Government's view? The Government are always talking, not about the necessity to bear a loss, but about the need to make a profit. Who else would the Government force to sell off goods that they do not want to sell at a loss? Can we imagine them imposing that form of legislation on Tesco, Sainsbury or Wimpy? Can we imagine the Government leading with a slogan for private enterprise not of "make what profits you can", but, "Sell your goods on that basis not of 'buy one, get one free', but 'buy one, get one free and get a rebate thrown in'"?<br/>
Why is it always the taxpayer who has to lose? Why will taxpayers lose over the steel privatisation when the industry is sold off? Why did they lose over the land sales in connection with the royal ordnance factories? Why will taxpayers and ratepayers lose now when it comes to local


authorities? The authorities have already been wrapped up in a legal straitjacket. Their funds have already been withdrawn and they have been prevented from raising additional funds to carry out repairs by the Government's rate capping policy. They have had inadequate remuneration.<br/>
I agree with the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) that elected officials deserve proper remuneration, but there is a distinct difference between proper remuneration for our elected officials and greedy golden handshakes for those who abjectly failed to get elected in the first place and are being propped up by public money. All those problems have been inflicted on local councils and they are now being forced to sell at a loss.<br/>
The policy affects not just old houses but new houses. A district council near me has been forced to sell four new houses which did not have negative values and were not in such dire conditions. It had to sell them before new tenants came in because, as soon as a new tenant stepped in, it would have had to sell the house in good repair at a loss to the council, only weeks after it had been completed. How much worse will it be when it comes to houses where there is double jeopardy, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) said? It is not only unfair; it is a disincentive to build council houses in the first place.<br/>
There must be a growing suspicion that this measure, like other measures in the Bill, is not simply a matter of clearing up. This is not a technical amendment. It is an integral part of the Government's policy of undermining the provision of public sector housing by penalising councils in every way possible and forcing them to sell. This measure, which adds insult to injury, forces them to sell at a loss. That policy is mistaken. The policy of undermining council house provision is not born of principle. It has been born of the Prime Minister's prejudice. It is not a policy shaped by concern. It has been marked rather by callousness. The measure is intended to add to the crippling financial burden of councils and to ensure that there will be little or no new public sector building. If the Government insist on maintaining that policy and if they reject the amendment tabled by Opposition Members, the public will draw their own conclusions.</p>

<p>It is entirely fair that there should be payment by the council to relieve itself of a liability in those few cases where a negative valuation may be appropriate. I shall answer the general point raised by the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) that there should be sufficient funds for capital investment in Scotland. Total gross public capital investment in Scottish housing has risen in real terms since 1979&#x2013;80 from &#x00A3;718 million to &#x00A3;847 million, which is a marked contrast with the 8 per cent. per annum decrease over the preceding five years when the Labour Government were in power.<br/>
I should like to give the House an example of how a negative valuation could work. If a house requires &#x00A3;6,000 worth of repair work to put it into a state of repair required by the landlord's common law and statutory repairing obligations, and if the district valuer took the view that the house would then be valued at &#x00A3;5,000, subject

to tenancy, the current market value for tenants' choice would be &#x00A3;5,000, minus &#x00A3;6,000. That is a negative valuation of &#x00A3;1,000</p>

<p>I cannot understand why the Government are prepared to go through the rigmarole of valuations and assessments of repairs when a house is being sold off to the private sector, when, for years, councils such as Motherwell district council have been screaming at the Government for repairs. Tenants have to live in these houses needing repair, whether in the private or public sector. Why were the Government not channelling their efforts towards assessing those repairs and ensuring that the council had the money to carry them out?</p>

<p>I explained earlier that we have increased the sums available on housing. The housing revenue account last year was &#x00A3;411 million and this year is more than &#x00A3;441 million, so there has been a substantial increase.<br/>
I wish to deal with the point that has been raised about the financial arrangements for local authorities. The authorities will not lose out. In those rare cases where the valuer decides that the valuation is negative, the authorities will make payments from their housing revenue capital accounts. The loan charges resulting will be taken into account in the determination of housing support grant. Therefore, where an authority is eligible to receive housing support grant, it will recoup its costs and, if it is just outside housing support grant, it could come back into it.</p>

<p>I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question.<br/>
I appreciate that some people take the view that authorities should not be expected to hand over their stock, but I hope that I have shown the House that it is in their interests, on occasions, not to keep what has become a liability. I imagine that negative valuations will be found occasionally and only in the very worst council housing. None the less&#x2014;</p>

<p>Amendment (a) would provide for schemes for payment to local authority tenants to help


them to obtain alternative accommodation. I stress that we in the Opposition have always supported the principle of help for first-time home buyers.

<p>When we have a Scottish Assembly in Scotland to debate Scottish affairs, we shall not have the problem of extraneous people hanging around cluttering up our debates.<br/>
We have no objection to the underlying principle of the scheme, but I should like to talk about some detailed points. I shall not spend time on amendments (a) and (b) because we are short of time. I shall concentrate on amendment (d), which would require the Secretary of State to fund such a scheme separately and directly.<br/>
We are becoming accustomed to the dishonest claims of Ministers in this Administration. I have no doubt that the Government will go around saying that local authorities should implement the scheme and blaming them if they do not. Expectations will be raised as a result of Government statements in connection with the amendment and, as usual, local authorities will be left to face the music.<br/>
Local authorities in Scotland have more than enough obligations already to be met from hopelessly inadequate resources and they might have good reasons for deciding not to implement the scheme. I am happy enough that such incentives should be set up, but it is the Government who are proposing the scheme and who will undoubtedly claim credit for it, so I respectfully suggest to the Minister that, just for once, the Government should put their money where their mouth is and accept amendment (d), which would ensure that the Scottish Office funds such schemes separately from the rest of local authority housing finance.</p>

<speech hansard_id="585923" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.389.2" hansard_membership_id="3538" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2654" speakername="Mr. Doran" colnum="389" time="20:30:00">
<p>I am a wee bit less sanguine and quite a bit more concerned about the provision than my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson). The debate that we have just had on the negative value of council houses could be equally applied to this debate. Perhaps the Minister will say a wee bit more about what is intended, because it appears that what is being established is a scheme that would require local authorities to pay from either the capital or revenue account those tenants who wish or who are encouraged to be removed from local authority houses. We need to know in what circumstances it is envisaged that schemes would be approved. For example, will schemes be approved for the sole purpose of transferring those houses to the private sector? We should like the Minister to answer such questions.<br/>
I am extremely concerned about subsection (5) of the new clause. A scheme will be made by a public authority, that is the local authority, and approved by a public official, that is the Secretary of State for Scotland, but subsection (5) seems to rule out any challenge to the operation of the scheme. That strikes me as intolerable, particularly when we are talking about substantial sums of public money.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585925" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.390.0" hansard_membership_id="3560" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14205" speakername="Lord James Douglas-Hamilton" colnum="390" time="21:15:00">
<p>I have been asked whether there are resources for such schemes. Local authorities making payments to tenants will be required to find the resources from within their housing revenue account capital allocations for the year in which payments are made. The logic is simple. The payments are made, in effect, to release accommodation for letting as an alternative to new build. Such payments are therefore instead of direct capital expenditure. Local authorities have discretion on how to use capital consents issued to them under section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.<br/>
Among the factors taken into account in the allocation of resources will continue to be the levels of homelessness and the demand for accommodation locally, as shown, for example, by homelessness returns and the size of the local authority waiting lists. Payments made by authorities from their capital allocations will as usual be taken into account in the calculation of housing support grant.<br/>
Our reason for rejecting the amendment is that, while local authorities will not be given a specific allocation earmarked for the purpose of giving cash incentives to tenants, powers in the new clause will enable them to use the resources available more effectively in providing housing accommodation in their areas. For example, instead of building one new house, they might be able at the same cost to encourage tenants to vacate three to five houses, which could assist their provision for the homeless.<br/>
Let me further explain the positive approach. New clause 62 and the consequential drafting amendment to the title will give local authorities, with the consent of the Secretary of State, specific powers to make payments to their tenants to help them to obtain other accommodation. I hope and believe that the clause will be welcomed by the House, as it was in the other place. It is an enabling provision designed to allow local authorities to draw up schemes that will require the Secretary of State's approval, under which they will be able to offer payment to tenants to move out of their council houses. Such payments would be used, for example, as deposits on the purchase of houses in the private sector. That will leave council accommodation vacant, which will then be available for letting to, for example, homeless families or persons on the waiting list.<br/>
I stress that the new clause would not oblige local authorities to offer cash incentive payments; nor would it give tenants a right to a payment. I also stress that no tenants will be forced to move. Local authorities will be able to come to the Secretary of State seeking approval for schemes for making such payments. The nature and extent of cash incentive schemes will be for local authorities themselves to devise.</p>

<p>As usual, the buck stops with the local authorities. The Minister has tried to develop a wonderfully circuitous argument to explain how such a scheme could be funded. The fact is that the Government are once again raising hopes among some people who will no doubt make approaches to their local authorities on the strength of publicity about the provision, but the Government are not prepared to put up the finances that will be necessary to implement it. It has done no harm to expose that. We are not opposed to the principle of such payments, but we feel that the Government should for


once be honest and pay for the schemes that they are dreaming up. Having made that point, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p>Under paragraph 1(b) of schedule 16 to the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987, local authorities are required to credit to their slum clearance revenue account payments of slum clearance subsidy. However, under the provisions of this clause the only payments to be made to local authorities in respect of expenditure on slum clearance on or after 1 April 1989 will be capital payments made under subsection (3). Slum clearance subsidy itself will disappear. Such capital payments will be credited to the appropriate capital account and not to a revenue account.<br/>
Lords amendment No. 49 therefore replaces the existing subsection (8) with a more definite provision to remove the duty on local authorities to credit subsidy payments to the slum clearance revenue account with effect from 1 April 1989. Lords amendment No. 100 adds paragraph 1(b) of schedule 16 to the repeal schedule. The repeal will take effect from 1 April 1989. Lords amendment No. 92 similarly amends section 207 of the 1987 Act to import the relevant parts of section 200, which is being repealed, explicitly into section 207. In summary, the points are therefore technical ones, consequential on the rest of the clause.<br/>
I understand that COSLA welcomes the change because it gives local authorities more flexibility.</p>

<p>When the Bill left this House for another place, clause 66 provided that the orders to specify the functions of rent officers in relation to housing benefit subsidy were to be subject to negative resolution of either House of Parliament. However, the first order, which will set out in detail how rent officers will carry out their new role, seems to us to warrant a debate in this House. Hon. Members clearly have a major interest in the details of the provisions. Therefore, the Government have decided that the first order should be subject to affirmative resolution. Any subsequent order will, however, be subject to negative resolution.<br/>
As hon. Members are aware, the new role of the rent officer has been the subject of consideration by working parties comprising Government Departments, local authority associations and rent officers. The working parties have completed their deliberations and the Government are currently examining what they have proposed. The House will have an opportunity to discuss the detail of the new arrangements when we debate the first order within the next few months.</p>

<p>I wish that that meant something. Clause 66 is an extremely offensive and alarming provision and we shall be able to say something about the principle behind it when we discuss the next group of amendments.<br/>
The Minister has represented as a concession the fact that the first order will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure of the House. That still means that the restrictions will apply to housing benefit whether anyone likes it or not because the affirmative resolution does not provide for proper parliamentary scrutiny. The Minister said that this matter should be debated in the House, but I think that it should be debated in Scotland. I believe that the Scottish people would deliver the same verdict on this provision as they have delivered on the Government repeatedly in the past.</p>

<p>Lords amendment No. 52 brings the Scottish Bill into line with the English one. This is necessary since the housing benefit system with which the rent officers will become involved through clause 66, covers the whole of Great Britain.<br/>
The amendment allows my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security to take into account the determinations made by rent officers under clause 66 if he makes regulations limiting the maximum amount of housing benefit that may be paid in certain circumstances. That is designed to avoid obtaining unnecessarily the same information twice which would be wasteful and lead to inconsistency. If my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State did not have the power to use the information of determinations by rent officers, he would have to obtain the same information from a different source. Lords amendments Nos. 53 and 54 are simply consequential drafting provisions.</p>

<p>Not yet, Mr. Speaker, but hope springs eternal.<br/>
The amendments establish a link between clause 66 of this Bill and the Social Security Act 1986 to provide for the limitation of housing benefit paid to claimants living in accommodation which Tory Ministers think is too good for them. We debated this point at length in Committee. As we now know, the carve-up of the housing benefits system in April has led to drastic cuts in support for hundreds of thousands of Scots.<br/>
About 650,000 claimants in Scotland are worse off as a result of the changes imposed by the Government in April and that includes about 120,000 claimants whose housing benefit has been stopped altogether. The transitional relief system is, frankly, little better than a fig leaf. Where it has led to any payments, it has not been much help to the claimants.<br/>
We all have constituency experience of the hardship caused by the changes. As a direct consequence of the housing benefit changes, we now have unprecedented levels of rent arrears throughout Scotland. I am sure that all of us have come across cases in our constituencies of elderly people who find themselves in debt for the first time in their lives because of the cuts in their housing benefit. Their family benefit can simply no longer cover their obligation to pay rent on time. That is causing terrible distress to many people.<br/>
On top of that, clause 66 means that a householder claiming housing benefit who happens to live in an up-market area or in a house deemed to be bigger than is absolutely necessary for the tenant, will have housing benefit entitlement cut. That is a nauseating provision designed to force the poor people of Scotland into ghettos.<br/>
I invite the Minister to take us through the sequence of events which might occur if a family in his home neighbourhood of north Berwick in my constituency was to find itself in this trap. If a tenant living in a nice house in that neighbourhood which happens to have one room more than is strictly speaking necessary for the family's needs were to lose his job, become ill and have to claim housing benefit, will the Minister acknowledge that in due course under this clause the claimant would find his level of benefit would be restricted and that he and his family

would in due course be forced out of the home to look for cheaper or smaller accommodation, which is unlikely to be readily available in the same neighbourhood?<br/>
That is an appalling scenario, but that is what has been built up by the Government arising from this shameful clause and its connection to the Social Security Act 1986. We are violently opposed to that aspect of the legislation and we intend to vote against Lords amendment No. 52.</p>

<speech hansard_id="585953" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.394.0" hansard_membership_id="8410" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3058" speakername="Mr. McAllion" colnum="394" time="21:15:00">
<p>Obviously we are dealing with housing benefit here. I do not think that we could be dealing with a more controversial subject now. A tremendous amount of heartache has been caused in Scotland, particularly to people on low incomes, as a result of the changes in housing benefit introduced in April.<br/>
I want to refer to two short examples of this hardship, gained from people who came to my surgery and drew my attention to their experience of what happened to them under the Government's transitional protection arrangements. The first example is of a lady who sent her application off in July and was told that if she had not heard within six weeks, she should give the transitional payment unit in Glasgow a phone call. She did that and was told that they were sorry and if she phoned back in two weeks they would let her know then. She called back in two weeks and was told that everything was held up because of the postal strike. She was told to wait until the strike was over and call back then. She called back last week and was told by a very harassed girl in the office that everything was in chaos. She was told, "We cannot find your letter. You need to re-apply because we don't know what has happened to your application and we don't know what you are entitled to." It is time something was done about the way in which the transitional payments unit in Glasgow is operating the housing benefit transitional protection payments. The unit simply is not working. Somebody somewhere in the Government will have to waken up to that reality and start to do something about it.<br/>
9.30 pm<br/>
In another case a man was told that if he lost in excess of &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;50 a week he would be eligible to apply for transitional protection. He did so, but after five or six months, during which time his applications was lost in the convolutions of the bureaucratic machinery that has been set up, he was sent a notice to say that he had been awarded transitional protection payments of 9p a week and that if he sent a stamped addressed envelope the payment would be sent to him. That is the sort of nonsense that is affecting ordinary people with low incomes, leading them directly into massive debt and leading councils into massive rent arrears. It is time that the Government properly funded the housing benefit system in Scotland.<br/>
The Minister mentioned that working parties have been set up with representatives from the Government, local authority associations and rent officers. May we have more information on the kind of recommendations that those working parties are likely to come up with? I want to know exactly how the rent officers will assess whether a rent is unreasonable for the purposes of housing benefit. What criteria will rent officers be expected to use in making such assessments?<br/>
For example, we are told that rent officers are supposed to use their professional judgment. However, since they have never before been required to consider this area and


have no direct experience of what is required from them, I do not see how they can. Their professional judgment has never before required them to consider the specific problem of whether people should be receiving housing benefit for the particular house in which they happen to live.<br/>
We are told that rent officers are to be guided by the need to protect public funds. Are they also to be guided by the principle that the tenant's right to live in peace should be protected, or is that principle to be thrown out of the window for the sake of a miserable saving for the public purse so that the Chancellor can come here and boast about how the public sector borrowing requirement is falling year upon year, when it is doing so upon the back of the misery inflicted upon many poor families in Britain?<br/>
The Secretary of State for Scotland will be issuing guidance. As I understand it, one of the first things that the rent officers will be asked to do is to discover the address of a person who applies for housing benefit. Once they have that, they can judge what kind of area that house is in. If it is a good area of a town, they might decide that an unemployed person has no right to be living there and would be far better off in a less desirable area. Is that one of the professional judgments that rent officers will have to make?<br/>
What about people who, through no fault of their own, find that they have fallen on bad times? A husband might die or find himself out of work. Could such a family then be judged to be living in the wrong area? Will a wife who is left with the children have to get out of her house and move to a less desirable part of town as a result of clause 66? The Minister will have to answer those questions.<br/>
We are also told that the rent officers will have to consider details of the occupants of a property and the number of rooms in each house. Again, we suggest that a judgment will be made on whether a person applying for housing benefit has a right to stay in a house with more than one bedroom if he is the only person living there. Will a widow or widower living in the house that previously housed their family be required to get out if the rent officer decides that housing benefit cannot be paid because he or she is over-accommodated in the house?<br/>
The Minister cannot simply let this slip through as some kind of technical link between the Housing (Scotland) Bill and the Social Security Act 1986. These are serious matters which frighten many people in Scotland. The Minister has a responsibility to come to the Dispatch Box and say how the clause will operate in the kind of cases that I have outlined, and that he too is anxious about the transitional payment unit's failure to operate in Scotland and the Government's bureaucratic incompetence which has led to their failure to assist people who find themselves in serious debt.</p>

<p>This amendment deals with the maximum housing benefit that can be provided, and comments have been made about the problems that have arisen resulting from transitional payments. I am sure that all right hon. and hon. Members have had to deal with constituents who have experienced difficulties as a result of the changes that occurred, but it is not all doom and gloom.<br/>
I took up a number of cases on behalf of my own constituents. One that particularly springs to mind

concerns a man living with his common law wife and seven children who had been receiving more than &#x00A3;70 per week housing benefit. Changes were made and he found himself in some difficulty. The House will be interested to learn that under the transitional arrangements, that figure has now been paid in full&#x2014;including the arrears that accrued during the weeks when there was some doubt about his payments. The fact is that the regulations that operated during the transitional period worked in my constituency. I say to the hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) that my experience is not the same as his and that the people who merit proper housing benefit are receiving it.<br/>
We regularly hear about the failure of the housing coffers to be sustained by the public purse, yet right hon. and hon. Members on the Opposition Benches regularly overlook the massive sums of public money that go into the housing coffers every week directly through housing benefit provisions, including the transitional arrangements operating at the moment. The sum involved runs into many millions of pounds. That has been the most massive increase of all in housing support to those in need.<br/>
I am not arguing that those who are in need should not receive housing benefit, because I believe that they should. One of the ways in which the public purse can assist people is by making sure that they may have the funds that allow them to live in proper homes. Housing benefit has worked and it will continue to work under this amendment. Much of the scaremongering we hear from the Opposition Benches is just that&#x2014;scaremongering.</p>

<p>I hope that the Minister will give his attention to some of the very serious comments made from these Benches. He has been amazing in his resilience to the points that have been made; it has been like grappling with a wet Kleenex. I hope that on this occasion he will give specific answers to questions asked of him by my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion).<br/>
It is no use the Minister withdrawing into the fantasy world that he created when giving his answers in our debates on the last few amendments&#x2014;the fantasy world of the benevolent landlord, which, like military intelligence, is a contradiction in terms. One cannot withdraw into a fantasy world if one is living, perhaps with a family, in a council house which is associated with one's past&#x2014;perhaps with one's deceased spouse, with one's children, and with the good times&#x2014;and where one's residence there is dependent upon housing benefit.<br/>
Enough difficulties have already been caused by existing housing benefit legislation, not only in itself but in respect of rent arrears. I can tell the Minister that in my own area, the arrears for Motherwell district council at the start of the financial year 1987&#x2013;88 totalled just over &#x00A3;1 million. By July they had risen to &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;8 million. There can be no substantial reason for that increase other than the effect of housing benefit cuts. It represents an increase of more than 80 per cent. in rent arrears&#x2014;more than &#x00A3;750,000 lost by the council. That is because the number of beneficiaries has been reduced by 3,000. Their benefit has not just been reduced&#x2014;they have been taken off benefit altogether.<br/>
Between April and July 1987, benefit was being paid to the tune of &#x00A3;6,593,000. In the period from April to July 1988, the figure was only &#x00A3;5,441,000, which is a reduction of more than &#x00A3;1,100,000 for that quarter; a yearly equivalent of &#x00A3;4,607,000. That is the loss in benefits to a


constituency such as mine, which has among the highest public sector housing populations, if not the highest, in Scotland.<br/>
The Minister must answer the questions that have been put to him. I shall not burden him with all the cases that have come to my surgery, because time moves on. I shall give him just one example. It concerns not a young person but an 83-year-old man, who is not able-bodied. He has suffered from pneumoconiosis and he still does. The Minister will be aware that pneumoconiosis is not a medical characteristic of an idle life. It is not a sign of a life spent in a billiard room or in a bar; it is a sign of a life spent in the depths and the darkness of a pit, creating value by extracting coal. He was not someone who, when war came, asked what his country could do for him, or even what he could do for his country&#x2014;he went out and did it. Now, at the age of 83 and crippled with that disease, his rent is raised from 72p to &#x00A3;27 a fortnight. He is entitled to ask what his country will do for him. He has asked, but he has received no reply. I hope that tonight he will receive a specific and sound reply that will at least give him some hope for the remaining years of his life.</p>

<p>The electorate of Tayside, North certainly had negative value when they elected their Member of Parliament. It is true that housing benefit involves massive sums, but that is because people are out of work. They would rather be in employment than be unemployed and receiving housing benefit.<br/>
For the sake of brevity, I shall cite only one example of the effect of the limit on housing benefit. We have already discussed the problem faced by widows, but there is also the problem faced by women who have been deserted by their husbands. They might be left in houses that the Government consider to be too good or too big, but why should they have to leave them and their neighbourhoods, give up their friends and change their children's schools? They might have made many improvements to their houses, at great cost to themselves. Why should they hand them over with no return just because some Conservative politician thinks that they are too good or too big? The Government have failed to justify this legislation and it will not be welcome in Scotland.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Mr. McAllion) asked about the transitional payments unit and how quickly applications were processed. I understand that the unit has received about 352,000 applications of which 218,000 have been processed, with 116,000 of them being successful. By the end of the week about 108,000 payments will have been made.<br/>
The Government have made it clear, at all stages, that housing benefit should be available to qualifying tenants paying rents at the level determined by the markets. Rent officers will have the task of verifying that the rent being paid by a private tenant who claims housing benefit is no higher than the market level. In cases where the rent officer judges the rent to be above the market level, he will assess the reasonable market rent for the property, and housing benefit subsidy will be available up to the level of that assessment. The local authority can pay benefit above that level if it chooses, but it will lose subsidy on the excess.<br/>
The housing benefit system is not designed to enable claimants to occupy, at public expense, the sort of accommodation that the vast majority of people could not

reasonably expect to afford out of their own resources. That is why we made clear, in setting out our proposals on the housing benefit implications of deregulation, our intention to introduce in due course a limit on housing benefit itself&#x2014;not just on housing benefit subsidy&#x2014;in cases where a claimant is occupying accommodation that is at the top end of the market. We also indicated that we should consider further restrictions on benefit should that prove necessary to prevent abuse of the housing benefit system.<br/>
Accordingly, the amendments to clause 66 provide an enabling power for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Services to make regulations requiring housing benefit to be restricted by reference to rent officers' determinations. As hon. Members know, working parties involving the local authority associations, the Institute of Rent Officers and Government Departments, including the Scottish Office, are currently considering how the system will work. They are paying particular attention to the problem of identifying what houses are over-luxurious, but they have not yet reached a conclusion. When they do, hon. Members will have an opportunity to debate the outcome.</p>

<p>Amendment (a) would retain the requirement for a statutory instrument on rent limitation for the SSHA, new towns and housing associations, which would be removed automatically and immediately, without further consultation or debate, if the Lords amendment were implemented.<br/>
Amendment (b) would similarly provide for further consultation about and consideration of the abolition of the cost floor for sales of councils houses, and would enable us to think about its impact on local authorities and their tenants. Under the Lords amendment it would be implemented automatically only two months after the Bill came into effect.<br/>
Amendment (c) would require a statutory instrument on the sales of new town housing land, which I know is a matter of particular concern to my hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram).<br/>
These are all contentious issues and require proper consideration and consultation with the people who will be affected before the details of the implementation are finalised. The Bill originally provided for such consideration before regulations are made and Lords amendment No. 58 would provide a short cut for Ministers. They should not he allowed to get away with that, and the House should insist on being allowed to return to these matters and to give full consideration to the regulations before they come into effect.</p>

<p>At present and because of unforeseen consequences of amending the definition of housing associations for the purpose of part VI of the Rent (Scotland) Act 1984, the SSHA, development corporations and co-operative housing associations are included within the scope of part VI of that Act. This means that, unintentionally, these bodies can have their rents determined and registered by the rent officer. Of course, this is nonsensical and has never happened. Having seen this mistake, we naturally want to correct it at the first available opportunity and have thus included clause 65 and an early commencement date&#x2014;the day the Act is passed. That deals with amendment (a).<br/>
I cannot accept amendment (b) and can find no good reason why the provisions in clause 62 should not be commenced two months after the Bill receives Royal Assent.<br/>
Since the provisions in clause 62 were tabled by amendment on Report, they have been the subject of much debate in this House and in another place. I have listened with interest to what the hon. Member for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson) has said but cannot accept the points that he makes.<br/>
In connection with amendment (c), despite misgivings expressed earlier in the House, the matter was not challenged in another place and I find it surprising that the hon. Member for East Lothian now returns to the provision in such an obscure way. I recommend that amendment (c) be rejected.<br/>
I shall now deal briefly with the amendment to Lords amendment No. 58 in the name of my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland. Under the provisions of clause 63 some Exchequer subsidies are terminated on 1 April 1989. Because of a drafting error, the date of the consequential repeal of the existing powers is specified in paragraph (b) as being two months after the date of Royal Assent.<br/>
This error, if uncorrected, would leave a gap of about three months between the repeals and the coming into force of the new provisions on 1 April 1989. There would therefore be no legal right for a local authority to receive, or for the Government to pay, the grants and subsidies covered by these repealed provisions during that period. The amendment to Lords amendment No. 58 removes from paragraph (b) the references to existing provisions, leaving them to be repealed by a commencement order under subsection (2)(d) on 1 April 1989.<br/>
Lords Amendment No. 58 sets out on the face of the Bill commencement dates for certain of its provisions. An order will shortly be prepared setting out the commencement dates for the other provisions of the Bill. Hon. Members may find it helpful if I set our intentions out in broad terms. Scottish Homes will come into operation on 1 April 1989, but it will be necessary to bring some provisions relating to it in part I and the schedules into effect earlier, so that it can prepare itself for full-scale operation. The provisions relating to the private rented sector in part II and the related schedules will come into effect early in the new year. Finally, part III of the Bill relating to tenants' choice will come into effect on 1 April next year.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="585974" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.402.0" hansard_membership_id="5975" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2874" speakername="Mr. Adam Ingram" colnum="402" time="21:15:00">
<p>I should like to ask the Minister for some assurances on clause 67. Will he give us an assurance that there will be no disposal of land or houses on land within the Scottish new towns before the full consultation process has been gone through? I understand that Lords amendment No. 58 would take away one aspect of the process by which there would be discussion in the House. It appears that two months after the Bill becomes an Act clause 67 could be applied in full.<br/>
The House should be aware that within the last four weeks the Government have twice called off the consultation document on the wind-up of the new towns. They did so without any consultation with the district councils or even with the development corporation. They simply said that they wanted those documents produced and in the hands of the public, and then called off the consultations at the last moment.<br/>
People in the new towns are worried that, as a result of Lords amendment No. 58, shortly after the Bill becomes an Act, the Government will start disposing of land and, more importantly, the houses on that land. Will there be full consultation? Will that consultation paper, when it is produced, be subject to the full rigours of the normal consultation period, and will the Minister give his assurance that there will be no implementation of the intention to wind up the new towns until that process has been gone through?</p>

<p>These amendments will ensure that Scottish Homes does not inherit the application to the SSHA of the wider competition requirements to be introduced in the course of 1989 by the Local Government Act 1988. The hon. Member for East Kilbride (Mr. Ingram) raised this point with me when we debated the matter last summer.<br/>
The competition requirements are intended primarily for local authorities but apply to some bodies which are very similar to local authorities, as the SSHA is at present. They do not apply to the Scottish Development Agency or the HIDB and they are inappropriate to a wide-ranging body like Scottish Homes. This amendment will simply put Scottish Homes on the same footing as the SDA in this matter.</p>

<p>The Minister has just confirmed that there is one law for a Tory quango and another for elected local authorities. The latter are forced to go through the farce of the competitive tendering process under the privatisation provisions of the Local Government Act 1988, but this Tory-inspired and principally Tory-manned quango is being specifically excluded from the duty to put contracts out to competitive tendering. If it is so good for a large authority to be compelled to go in for competitive tendering, why should Scottish Homes not also be required to carry out that process? This exposes the hypocrisy of the competitive tendering scheme in the public sector, and it has done no harm to draw attention to the Government's conduct in this connection.</p>

<p>I beg to move, That this House doth agree with the Lords in the said amendment.<br/>
This concerns a very important matter and one to which we have given much consideration&#x2014;the granting of tenancies and other benefits to those involved in the running of housing associations or their close relatives.<br/>
Amendment No. 63 gives Scottish Homes the power to define classes of case in which the granting of benefits will be allowed. As such, existing controls will be relaxed but abuse of the system will not be allowed to creep in. We believe that we are getting the balance right and that is very important.<br/>
This amendment will allow Scottish Homes to introduce exceptions to the general prohibition against benefits, which are tailored to particular circumstances as they emerge. By confining this power to classes of case, rather than applying it to individual cases, we are ensuring the even-handed treatment of those closely involved in the running and decision-making of individual housing associations.<br/>
This subject has concerned all parties in this House and I am very pleased that we have been able to meet the concern which has been expressed. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations wrote to say that it is grateful for the efforts taken to achieve this necessary and important change.</p>

<p>I acknowledge this important concession to committee members, office bearers and staff of housing associations. The matter has been raised repeatedly over the years by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations and by a number of hon. Members in Committee. I cited the case of one of my constituents who has two disabled sons and serves on the committee of a specialist housing association for disabled people. Because of her membership of that committee, her sons have hitherto been prevented from becoming tenants of that housing association. It has been absurd and unfair that membership of such committees should prevent members of such families from becoming tenants of housing associations. That has been demanded over a long period. I welcome the fact that the Government have conceded this significant point. Perhaps the Minister can tell us when he expects that the provisions will be implemented.</p>

<p>I beg to move,<br/>
<q>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Abolition of Domestic Rates (Domestic and Part Residential Subjects) (Scotland) Regulations 1988 (S.I., 1988, No. 1477), dated 22nd August 1988, a copy of which was laid before this House on 24th August, be annulled.</q>
Despite the fact that we have lost some time for these regulations, I can assure you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, that I have no intention of speaking at the speed at which you dealt with the final Lords amendments to the Housing (Scotland) Bill.<br/>
We have just considered what can now rightly be called the Michael Ancram Benefit Bill, set up to give him a job in his retirement from Parliament. In dealing with poll tax regulations, we now move to the measure that led to that gentleman's demise from the House. The only shame about that is that he is not here to apologise for the promises that he made about the poll tax, which are now being broken by the Government.<br/>
None of the six sets of regulations is of itself of great importance. Some of them give minor concessions to demands that the Opposition, local authorities in Scotland and COSLA have been making for some time. We have made it clear from the beginning that whenever we have an opportunity to debate the obscenities of the poll tax, we shall take it.<br/>
It is absurd that with only five months to go before the poll tax is imposed on 1 April 1989 we are still debating regulations that will bring the Act into force. When the Government introduced the commencement order for the Abolition of Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987 over a year ago, they announced their intention to have, with the exception of the rebate scheme, all the regulations clear of the consultation process by the end of 1987. They said that the regulations would be laid and debated long before now. The report of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, which the Government commissioned, made it clear that if the timetable was not adhered to&#x2014;it wanted a tighter timetable than that which the Government proposed&#x2014;local authorities would be in considerable trouble in implementing the poll tax efficiently by April 1989. Ten months have passed and the tax will come into force in five months' time, and the process is still not complete.<br/>
Even the regulations that we are discussing will not complete the process. Several important issues are still being discussed with COSLA and local authorities in Scotland. Other regulations have been discussed, but they have not yet been laid before the House. They include the exemption from poll tax of care workers in residential homes, the registration of cross-border students from England and Wales to ensure that they do not become liable for two poll taxes, information from the Registrar General of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys on deaths of those who are on the register for the poll tax to ensure that bereaved widows are not hounded, the prescription of base rates for non-domestic rates, and regulations on the direct reduction of poll tax from social security payments when arrears have been accumulated, which was one of the promises made in Committee by Mr. Michael Ancram. He said that that would never take place but now we know that it will.

There are also to be regulations on the provision of information to registration officers from the DSS, as we now have to call it. The promise was made by Mr. Michael Ancram in Committee that no information would be sought from the DSS. We find now that information will be given to registration officers on all those claiming income support. It is a great shame that promise after promise is being broken by the Government.<br/>
One major set of regulations is still to come, and they concern the rebate scheme. It appears that we are to have yet another broken promise. My hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) has obtained a letter which was written by the Secretary of State for Social Security to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. It makes it fairly clear that the Government will break a promise that was given to those who are the hardest off in our society, the very poorest, who are living on basic income support, that their benefit would be uprated by the 20 per cent. that they will have to pay as a contribution to their poll tax liability. That promise will be broken by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.<br/>
It is a pleading letter. The Secretary of State for Social Security pleads with his right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to ensure that the rating matches the average poll tax payment. He is asking for an uprating of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;05 and &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;30 for single people under and over 25 respectively and &#x00A3;2&#x00B7;10 for couples. The uprating of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;05 assumes an average poll tax in Scotland of &#x00A3;273. No one believes that that will be the average. It will certainly not be less than that.</p>

<p>That having been said, I shall quote the Secretary of State for Social Security. He said:
<q>I should also emphasise that my officials' estimates arc, if anything, on the low side because they are based on average liabilities to the community charge for the population as a whole whereas the Prime Minister's pledge was to protect the average liability for those on income support. The latter will probably be higher, as income support recipients are not spread uniformly throughout the country but tend to be in poorer authorities with higher levels of spending per capita.</q>
Hon. Members should notice that the authorities referred to are not high-spending Labour-controlled authorities, but poorer authorities, which have greater demands made on them and, equally, a lower tax rate to start with. That is the point that hon. Members should bear in mind.<br/>
One other point that is made by the Secretary of State for Social Security is that, unlike any Scottish Office Minister at any time, he is prepared to concede that the average poll tax in Scotland will be higher because local authorities may not be able to collect all of it. He says:


<q>The fact that local authorities may not collect the community charge in full is one, but by no means the only, reason for these estimates being higher than those published for the current year.</q>
The letter reveals a very serious breach of promises made by the Prime Minister, by the Secretary of State for Scotland and by junior Ministers in Committee. The Miniser has a responsibility tonight&#x2014;</p>

<p>The Minister has a duty to say that that will not happen, that the promise that has been made will be fulfilled and that, if necessary, the rating will be even higher than the Department of Social Security is asking for, so that those who are the poorest in our society will receive their full entitlement.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend makes a good point. The Treasury Bench should ensure that a Treasury Minister is here before 11.30 pm, when the debate finishes. It would make more sense for a senior member of some standing in the Government to be here, even the Secretary of State for Scotland, rather than his underling. That would add a little more weight to the debate.<br/>
I do not want to speak for long because many hon. Members want to take part in this short debate. However, I must say that we await the details of the rebate scheme with interest. There has to be a rebate scheme with the poll tax. If many Conservative Members had their way, there would be no rebate scheme. Over a month ago, the Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland hyped the rebate scheme in Scotland and made a great deal of play of its being generous and taking account of ability to pay.<br/>
But everybody must pay a minimum of 20 per cent. That is the first point to be made about the rebate scheme. If there is not full uprating, someone under the age of 25 will pay a minimum of &#x00A3;1 a week even in the lowest rated authority in Scotland. In other rating authorities, the amount will be considerably more. That amount is nearly 4 per cent. of a low income. My wife and I will pay &#x00A3;500 in poll tax, but that is only 1&#x00B7;5 per cent. of our income. That is what makes this tax so obscene and unfair: someone on the lowest possible income will pay a higher percentage of his income than someone on my income will pay.<br/>
We shall continue on all occasions to fight the poll tax. We shall put the case to the people of Scotland and the people of Great Britain as a whole. As is clear from the last general election, the tax will bring down the Government. It will lose many Conservative seats in England and Wales. We shall form the next Government, and we shall withdraw the poll tax.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) has continued his speeches of misinformation. We seem to have gone round and round the buoy several times on the community charge, as directed by the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
In a general debate on the community charge, I think that we should record the good news that registration has gone so well in Scotland. Only an infinitesimal proportion of people have not registered. That is entirely contrary to the expectation of Opposition Members, who hoped that it would be a rating disaster. It has turned out exactly the opposite: the Scottish people have shown great responsibility, and have reacted to the registration procedure as we had anticipated. I think that they now understand, despite the Opposition's efforts, that it is a fair system and particularly helps those on low incomes. The Opposition have gone out of their way to avoid discussing the rebate scheme, and have spent the last few months scaremongering in Scotland and trying to create dissatisfaction and dissension about a new system that is entirely different from the rating system, based as it is on fairness and the ability to pay.<br/>
As the day of implementation gets closer the Opposition are realising how wrong they have been about the views of the majority in Scotland&#x2014;despite the public opinion polls. As we all know, anyone can get the right answer out of any public opinion poll. I anticipate that by next summer there will be even less opposition to the charge than at present, especially when people find out what the charges will be. The hon. Member for Cathcart &#x2014;with, no doubt, his cohorts behind him&#x2014;has grossly inflated the likely charge. The hon. Gentleman said that the average charge might be &#x00A3;250, but obviously a good many local authorities will charge less if the average is as high as that. My authority, which has not been the warmest supporter of the charge, estimates it at &#x00A3;230, including the water rate. I believe that it will be very much lower than the figures bandied about by the Opposition.<br/>
Until now&#x2014;when they realise that the charge is so imminent that they will have to accept it&#x2014;Opposition Members have dodged explaining to the Scottish population about the rebate scheme, that 80 per cent. will be available to those with the appropriate income level and that those who thereafter still cannot afford the 20 per cent. will have support from the DHSS. There could be a 100 per cent. rebate for those on the lowest incomes.</p>

<p>Yes, it is nice to know. That couple would probably be paying more under the present rating system.<br/>
A pensioner couple would need to have a gross unearned income of &#x00A3;6,300 a year&#x2014;the equivalent of &#x00A3;115 a week&#x2014;before they would pay the full community charge.</p>

<p>Well, it is much better than the stuff that the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook) produced&#x2014;that was the greatest non-event of the year. After listening to the one o'clock news I thought that something dramatic was going to turn up later on, but it all fell as flat as a pancake.<br/>
A single pensioner would need to have a gross unearned income of more than &#x00A3;3,530&#x2014;a net income of &#x00A3;66 a week &#x2014;before he would have to pay the full community charge.

<p>Earlier, when we were discussing the Scottish homes legislation, the point was raised about the landlord who attempts to continue charging rents and rates on a house when the poll tax is implemented. The Minister said that, in that case, the tenant was being charged fraudulently for rates and that he should complain and refuse to pay. That is the Minister's advice to a tenant who may be poor, young or elderly or who may have difficulty with the English language. The Conservatives are on the side of the landlord who attempts to defy the law by obtaining money under false pretences. We are on the tenants' side.</p>

This week Opposition Members have been visiting Govan and we are entitled to know what the Labour party candidate had to say about paying the community charge, the candidate said:

<p>As I appreciate the embarrassment on the Opposition Benches, I will not proceed with that line.<br/>
However, the people in Scotland would certainly like to know where the Labour party&#x2014;which seems to be fractured in every direction&#x2014;is going with respect to the community charge. The intention to defy the law is a shocking example from any party that aspires to government in Scotland, and that applies as much to the Scottish National party and the Democrats as to the Labour party.<br/>
The regulations that are the subject of the Prayer tonight help to clarify a number of important parts of the community charge legislation. They add substantially to helping those who need help and we should have no problem approving them tonight. I warmly support my hon. Friend the Minister's proposals. We have had another opportunity tonight to show that the Labour party does not understand the community charge. It is hopelessly split and is against the wishes of the people of Scotland.</p>

<speech hansard_id="586027" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.410.4" hansard_membership_id="9198" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3102" speakername="Mrs. Ray Michie" colnum="410" time="22:35:00">
<p>When I saw that these regulations had been brought forward tonight, my immediate reaction was to say: "How much longer is this going to go on? How many more bits and pieces will be brought to the House in a patched-up job?" Will the Minister assure us that the regulations will help the individuals and the local authorities which collect the poll tax? Will he also confirm that no individual will be excluded from the electoral register simply on the grounds that he or she is exempt from the personal poll tax due to severe mental impairment?<br/>
That exemption clause should probably be extended. The revised definition of severe mental impairment extends the original definition to include those suffering from an injury to the brain causing severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning which appears to be permanent. It could be argued reasonably that dementia &#x2014;and Alzheimer's disease is the commonest form of dementia, in neurological terms&#x2014;can be described as


injury to the brain. Should those sufferers be included? We should also consider dementia sufferers in residential care or in hospital who will be exempt from the charge while those living in the community will remain liable to it. That does not seem to be particularly fair.<br/>
I am also interested in the need for a certificate to qualify for exemption. I understand that the registration officer requires information from a general practitioner. With all due respect to general practitioners, who are busy people, I believe that "general" is the operative word. I am worried because it is the general practitioner who will say whether someone is severely mentally handicapped. Quite rightly, few general practitioners can make the proper assessment and conduct the proper investigation into whether someone is severely mentally handicapped.<br/>
Will those people who have to produce a certificate from the doctor for the registration officer have to pay for it? Will they get it free? With regard to the question of the invasion of privacy which was raised earlier, the form from the DHSS requests the date of birth in Scotland only. That has caused a great deal of resentment in my constituency. Here is the Department sending a form to the community charge registration officer saying "This person is getting income support. It may be that you do not know they are living at the address given below. You may wish to register them for the community charge." Already, information about where a person is staying is to be passed on from one to the other.<br/>
You asked us to be brief, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I hope that I shall be. I hope to goodness that this is the final word on this awful poll tax. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Some hon. Members seem to think that there will he more, but it remains unfair and regressive, and the Government will rue the day that they ever introduced it.</p>

<speech hansard_id="586029" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-10-26a.411.0" hansard_membership_id="10155" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/32893" speakername="Mr. Bill Walker" colnum="411" time="22:40:00">
<p>Following the trend set by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) and my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), may I say that I too am delighted that the registration process has gone so well. It has gone so well that the Opposition have gone quiet about it all.<br/>
It is also interesting that the hon. Member for Cathcart, if I understood him and our previous debates and discussions, complains that the Department of Social Security is to be consulted, yet any other proposals for amending local authority rates, from wherever they come, involve local income tax. That would necessarily involve substantial consultation and would mean that the town house would have access to information that it does not have at present. That shows the sort of humbug that we are hearing from the Opposition in their proposals.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister of State will take this opportunity to answer a query that has arisen in my constituency on the views being taken by the assessors in Forfar. They have been advising some of my country constituents who have cottages which they let for holiday purposes, on an ad hoc, not an annual, basis to people on vacation.<br/>
My understanding of the debates that took place during the passage of the Scottish legislation was that such cottages would be treated as a business. I see the hon. Member for Cathcart nodding his head. However, the

assessors in Forfar are advising my farmers and others with cottages in that category that they will have to pay the double community charge, whether or not the cottages are let.<br/>
That is a fundamental and important difference because if the cottages are let for holiday purposes the rate charge can be set as an expense against the income from the lets, whereas the community charge falls into a different category.<br/>
I have been interested in some of the Opposition's comments on the rebate scheme. There is no question but that this has been welcome. It may interest the House to know that during the recess, in common with many other Scottish Members, I went round my constituency knocking on doors asking my constituents for their views on current affairs. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I do it every year. Is that unusual? I should have thought that I was merely doing what everyone else does.<br/>
I can tell the House that out of the many hundreds of homes on which I called, I received only two critical comments about the community charge. That says much more about public reaction to the community charge and why people have registered to pay it. All the other comments made to me were complimentary, with people saying, "It is long overdue, and we cannot see it come in quick enough." That is certainly the situation in North Tayside.<br/>
That did not surprise me, because I was able to advise single pensioners on state earnings only, that if they had &#x00A3;4,000 in savings, they would receive a rebate of nearly 70 per cent. of the community charge. I was able to advise married pensioners that those of them receiving &#x00A3;69&#x00B7;90 gross per week would receive the maximum rebate, which reduces progressively until income rises to &#x00A3;115. That was seen as being a responsible way of offering rebates and of making the community charge acceptable to the population at large.</p>

<p>I may first tell the hon. Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood) that I never once discussed the poll tax&#x2014;it does not exist. I discussed the community charge. I discussed with those individuals their current situation, which is what I believe the hon. Gentleman meant. I discussed also what will happen after the community charge comes into operation. I assure the hon. Member for Clydesdale that there were no complaints from any of the pensioners to whom I spoke.<br/>
What is important and relevant, certainly in my constituency, is that pensioners are among the most responsible and sensible of those in the community. They recognise that services must be paid for, and they acknowledge also that 14p in every &#x00A3;1 as their contribution, if they are paying the maximum community charge, is not unreasonable. If they enjoy a rebate, as in the case of the couple that I mentioned, they will receive a rebate on that 14p. The rest is paid for by taxation through central Government and the non-domestic rate.<br/>
I assure right hon. and hon. Members that what I have told them is no fairy tale. It can all be checked. I can mention the names of some of the towns I visited. They


included Aberfeldy, Pitlochry, Dunkeld, Blairgowrie Forfar and Kerriemuir. The people there all know that I have been to those places.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) said that right hon. and hon. Members should read the papers to learn what is happening. I can tell the hon. Gentleman that on 25 October, <i>The Scotsman</i> carried a headline,
<q>Half Scots on poll tax rebate 'would soon be in arrears'.</q>
Does the hon. Member for Dumfries believe that that is true? The article begins:<br/>
<q>Half of Scotland's 1&#x00B7;5 million community charge payers who next year will qualify for a rebate will be in arrears after only three months of its operation, it was claimed yesterday.</q>
The responsible person making that claim was an officer of the Scottish Consumer Council, which has carried out a survey of what is happening just now&#x2014;as the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) suggested one should do. Currently, people are in debt with their rent and rates, but they will be even more in debt come 1 April 1989. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) mentioned a letter from the Secretary of State for Social Services to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. The letter states:
<q>I am copying this letter to Nick Ridley.</q>
There is no suggestion that the Secretary of State for Scotland was sent a copy, yet it is far more pressing for Scotland than it is for England and Wales that there is some understanding of the rebate system and the cut-off points.<br/>
What is the position in Scotland? What is the Treasury saying? What defence will be forthcoming? What can the Secretary of State and his Ministers plead in aid?<br/>
My views about the tax are probably too well known for my own good. I have made my position clear and I only hope that others will join me in my regretful defiance.

<p>One way to cure that would be to give us a Scottish Assembly.<br/>
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) spoke for the so-called Democrats&#x2014;I mean no disrespect to her&#x2014;about the severely mentally impaired. I shall briefly explain what the Government are doing by putting this measure on the statute book. There have been slight concessions and we understand that, in round figures, they will affect about 6,000 people in Scotland.<br/>
Let us examine the conditions being laid down for exemption for someone who is severely mentally impaired and living in the community. They do not apply to someone in a hospital or a home; they relate to someone who is being compassionately cared for in the community and who has to go through such a rigmarole to gain exemption. All conditions must be fulfilled for someone to be granted exemption on ground of severe mental impairment. They are:
<ol>
<li>"(a) he is severely mentally impaired;</li>
<li>(b) he is stated to be severely mentally impaired in a certificate of a registered medical practitioner;</li>
<li>(c) he satisfies at least one of a number of benefit/pension conditions&#x2014;see Annex A."</li>
</ol>
I will not go through that. The procedure when a poll tax registration officer has been notified of a possible claim on behalf of a person with severe mental impairment is that he will use the form annex B to request:
<q>(a) evidence of the applicant's entitlement to one of the relevant social security benefits"&#x2014;</q>
which is an invasion of privacy&#x2014;[HON. MEMBERS: "Nonsense."] It is not nonsense. One thing for which I have fought throughout my life in politics is not to humiliate the poor and those whom we are sent here to defend and who cannot defend themselves.<br/>
The conditions continue:
<q>(b) the name of the applicant's general practitioner or other registered medical practitioner with knowledge of the applicant;</q>
<q>(c) agreement to the CCRO approaching the doctor to obtain a certificate</q>
and so on. They go through all that.</p>

<p>There has been widespread abuse for 6,000 people. We are talking about 6,000 people having to go through the rigmarole to obtain exemption. The most pointed fact is that, when all that is done, if the community charge registration officer declines to treat a person as exempt, he will enter the name on the register. What expertise has the poll tax officer to determine that matter? What assistance does he have? If he does so determine, there is a right of appeal, but who will appeal and humiliate themselves?<br/>
I have written to the Secretary of State, but he has still to reply. Should not the onus of proof be the other way?<br/>
If a medical practitioner adjudges a person to be severely mentally impaired, and if that person is in receipt of benefit, and if there is widespread abuse, should not the poll tax registration officer have to prove to the contrary?</p>

<p>No, I shall not give way.<br/>
That is what we are doing to impose a tax on society. As my hon. Friends have said, it means that, in terms of a youngster of 18 earning about &#x00A3;4,000, the proportion of tax is greater than that of someone earning &#x00A3;80,000. It is

nonsense to argue that that is ability to pay. The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute has rightly pointed out that there are severe restrictions and restraints. Members of the House of Commons are asking people to humiliate themselves to get narrow exemptions.<br/>
The House and the country should be ashamed. Conservative Members want to ensure that the more fortunate in society bear a lesser burden than the poorer section of the population. If that is the type of society that Conservative Members want to live in, we in Scotland should completely reject them. I hope and trust that, in the forthcoming Govan by-election, the signal goes out for a complete rejection of them.</p>

Once again, he treated us to reminiscences of his personal canvassing around his constituency. I have distrusted these reminiscences since a previous poll tax debate just before the district elections. Hon. Members will recall that the hon. Member for Tayside, North assured us that his personal canvassing in his constituency detected an upsurge of support for the poll tax legislation. That was followed in the elections not only by the defeat of many Conservative councillors but by the fact that the Conservative party was out-polled by the Scottish National party in Tayside, North.<br/>
Like the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), the hon. Member for Tayside, North claims to be well understood by his constituents. I suspect that that will be a major problem for them both at the next election.</p>

I shall follow the unusual example in this debate of the hon. Members for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) and for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) and speak briefly about the regulations. Conservative Members seem to believe that the registration process is over. What is made clear by statutory instrument No. 1539 is that the registration process is a continuous one and the registration officer at any point from now until this dreadful legislation is repealed can demand information with menaces from any one of us. A snoopers' charter, once in place, will stay there until it is repealed.<br/>
I shall not attempt to emulate the eloquence of the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West on statutory instrument No. 1541 concerning the mentally handicapped, but 1 do want to put this question to the Minister. How and why is it that the Government can spend so much time drawing

the offensive distinction between the severely mentally impaired, who will be exempt from the poll tax, and the merely mentally impaired, who will have to pay poll tax, but cannot draw the distinction between those on average earnings, the rich and the very rich in terms of their liability to pay the poll tax? How can the Government make such efforts to draw the first distinction but no effort to make the second?<br/>
Conservative Members seem to believe that the poll tax debate is coming to the end of its term, but it is just beginning. The full ramifications of what is being done are just beginning to be understood. I hope that the hon. Member for Dumfries can explain to his constituents why a young, single person on just over &#x00A3;50 a week will bear the full blast of the poll tax next year or why a pensioner couple on &#x00A3;85 a week will pay one full poll tax between the two of them. Is he really saying that the levels of rebate are satisfactory and reflect the principle of a person's ability to pay? That is without going into the shameful deceit that is being practised in terms of the rebate system for those on income support.<br/>
The impact of the poll tax in political terms is just about to be felt at the Govan by-election. But the real level of resistance to the poll tax will be at its highest and greatest at the point of payment next April. I give the Minister my personal assurance that I shall be part of that resistance, as will my colleagues.</p>

<p>I am sure that all Scottish Opposition Members who are not members of the Scottish National party listened with fascination to the electoral predictions of the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond). I am sure we are all fascinated to know whether that party's candidate, who is, after all, a traitor to the Labour party, will win the Govan by-election for another brief spell of emotional fantasy &#x2014;a glimpse or two of the tartan miasma. Like other salmon, such people come to Scotland only occasionally and go away for a long time thereafter.<br/>
I pay a sincere tribute to the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas). His speech was responsible, and the House should honour it.<br/>
The Opposition have overlooked one matter of importance. Their criticism of the community charge is that it is a standard charge that is imposed regardless of ability to pay. An income of &#x00A3;60 a week has been mentioned. But Opposition Members never stop talking about the National Health Service, which is central to Socialist philosophy. How do we pay for the NHS? [HON. MEMBERS: "Through taxes."] We have a standard charge, called the national insurance contribution. People who earn &#x00A3;30, &#x00A3;40, &#x00A3;50, &#x00A3;60, &#x00A3;70, &#x00A3;80, and &#x00A3;90 a week all pay exactly the same charge&#x2014;or their employers pay it on their behalf.<br/>
In the context of the poll tax, therefore, we must ask who introduced the concept of a standard charge for an essential service&#x2014;whether or not for the mentally handicapped. The answer is: the Labour party. It was the biggest fraudulent poll tax ever imposed on the British people in the name of the emotion of Socialism.<br/>
I have noticed no objection from any party to the fact that everyone, regardless of ability to pay, pays the same for a motor car licence, or a television licence&#x2014;</p>

The dog licence was not introduced to entitle someone to have a dog.

<p>I was answering a charge about a dog licence from the wolf, the hon. Member who sits for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley. The licence was introduced because in the last century men stole dogs. It was not introduced to entitle people to have dogs.<br/>
I have never heard anybody complain that the rich man and the poor man pay the same price for a loaf of bread or a lettuce, a haggis or even a dog. The attempt to make out that the community charge is unfair is hysterical and foolish. We are replacing a system of grotesque unfairness with a system that is fair. It exempts those who are ineligible and it is correct. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley asked how much I will save on my castle. I was impressed when the BBC sent a team of 12 people from London to do a programme about how much I will save on my castle which, incidentally, I bought for &#x00A3;100.</p>

<p>I shall, Mr. Deputy Speaker.<br/>
The hypocrisy of the debate is evident from the sedentary illustration given by an Opposition Member. A team of 12 with four Mercedes at Edinburgh airport came to photograph this great castle of mine to prove how much I will save. Before they left they asked me where they could get the best meals and the richest hotels. On that trip alone they spent money contributed by pensioners and mentally handicapped people for their television licences and spent more money than I have paid in rates on my castle since I restored it. That is an illustration of the attempt to introduce a false air of unfairness into the debate. We have redeemed a pledge of fairness to those who have to pay their mite towards local services.<br/>
When all the hullabaloo and the attempts to get marchers out is over, when everybody is drained and when the Scottish National party has got the last bit of blood out of the Labour party, and when the Labour party has got the last bit of blood and guts out of the Scottish National party, people will say that this is a wise and fair tax that is also honourable and responsible.</p>

<p>It is clear that the hon. and learned Member for Perth and Kinross (Sir N. Fairbairn) has recovered all the faculties that he had

prior to his recent operation. The statutory instruments that we are debating are considerably more serious than either the hon. and learned Gentleman or his contribution.<br/>
Like some of my colleagues, I should like to focus on statutory instrument No. 1541 against which the Opposition have also tabled a Prayer. That and the letter to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury from the Secretary of State for Social Security, form two more pieces of that evil jigsaw that has become the poll tax/community charge in Scotland. It shows how much more evil it is than was predicted by many of the most bitter opponents of the poll tax. These regulations show a deliberate attempt by the Government not to target rebates at significantly mentally handicapped people, nor to absolve them from the need to pay poll tax on compassionate grounds. Instead, they are designed to ensure that these are the very people who do not claim, because it is too humiliating to claim.<br/>
In my work with the mentally handicapped in the eight years before I became a Member of Parliament, I built up many contacts with families with mentally handicapped people and with organisations that have done far more than all Tory Members put together have done for the mentally handicapped, or ever will. They tell me that this is the most pernicious legislation affecting mentally disabled people. As a result of it, many parents, who have to suffer because their children will never achieve what the rest of us might&#x2014;although their achievements in their personal struggle are so great that many hon. Members would be ashamed to compare their modest achievements with them&#x2014;will not go through the humiliation of going to the doctor to ask him to certify their mentally handicapped relatives as severely mentally disabled.<br/>
The doctors have written to me, as they have to organisations that deal with the mentally handicapped, to say that they are not qualified to distinguish types of mental handicap. That is not in any of their medical training. However, the Government are using them as a convenient way to cut the numbers of those exempted, so that almost nobody will be eligible for exemption.<br/>
Even those handicapped people who are in the same category as all those who will have to pay the minimum payment will have to pay far higher sums than has hitherto been admitted. That brings me to the letter and to the information that the Minister gave me on 25 April, in a written reply.<br/>
Next year, the community charge in Edinburgh is likely to be &#x00A3;442 for a single person, and &#x00A3;884 for a couple. After the water charge has been paid in full&#x2014;there is no rebate on the water charge&#x2014;at &#x00A3;105 for a single person and &#x00A3;210 for a couple, according to the figures given by the Secretary of State for Social Services, a couple in Edinburgh will be presented with a bill for &#x00A3;208&#x00B7;80 for their poll tax, and will receive from the DHSS only &#x00A3;109&#x00B7;20 to pay for it. That is a shortfall of almost &#x00A3;100, or more than &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;90 a week. Single people&#x2014;the handicapped, the disabled and the pensioner on the basic state pension&#x2014;will receive only &#x00A3;54&#x00B7;60 from the DHSS to pay a poll tax bill of &#x00A3;104.40.&#x2014;a shortfall of &#x00A3;49&#x00B7;80&#x2014;almost &#x00A3;1 a week of their meagre incomes.<br/>
In Glasgow, the comparable figure is &#x00A3;812 for a couple, who will have to pay &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;54 a week out of their benefits over and above anything that the Government are offering. In Dundee, a couple will be &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;13 a week worse off, even after the payments promised by the Secretary of State. In Aberdeen, the shortfall will be &#x00A3;46. In Edinburgh, the mentally handicapped will have to pay not just the 20 per


cent. that was set out in the Government information leaflets, not even the 25 per cent. that the Minister admitted would be the liability to personal community charge and water charge, but nearer 30 to 35 per cent. In Glasgow, the figure will not be 26 per cent., as the Minister predicted in April, but closer to 35 per cent. In Aberdeen, the minimum fee will not be 30 per cent., but closer to 40 per cent.<br/>
It is clear that, when the figures are adjusted as councils have been telling the Minister they will have to be adjusted because they may not collect the community charge in full &#x2014;those words are now being echoed by the secretary of State for Social Security&#x2014;the bill for individuals will be considerable.</p>

<p>The regulations reflect the sensitivity and flexibility with which the Government have approached the implementation of the community charge in Scotland, taking account, as many of them do, of arguments advanced and pledges given during the passage of the Local Government Finance Act 1988. They also show the progress of the community charge arrangements towards full implementation next April.<br/>
The House has this evening identified an important underlying theme to the debate, which was apparent in almost all the contributions&#x2014;the question whether the Opposition believe in obeying the law. You, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I know that they had a conference in Govan to decide their view on this matter and it was plain after that conference that the party was suffering from a multiple fracture in its opposition to the community charge. Seven Opposition Members set up a committee of 100 prominent citizens against the community charge and a further four&#x2014;the hon. Members for East Lothian (Mr. Home Robertson), for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood), for Glasgow, Pollock (Mr. Dunnachie) and for Glasgow, Provan (Mr. Wray)&#x2014;also said that, although they were not taking part in the committee&#x2014;presumably because they were not sufficiently prominent in the class structure

of Socialism&#x2014;they were also unwilling to pay the community charge. The hon. Member for Provan dismissed the committee of 100 as elitist and bourgeois.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) put his finger on the issue when he quoted the comments of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) in the <i>Morning Star.</i> She said:
<q>if voting does not get you what you want and the Government does not reflect the will of the people, then you have to resist that Government by any means open to you".</q>
That appears to be the reality of the policy of the Opposition. It is no wonder that we now have organisations spawned by attitudes such as that, represented&#x2014;</p>

<p>Thank you for your guidance, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I shall reply to some of the other points.<br/>
For months, the Labour party has sought to frustrate the law through its "Stop It" campaign and its urgings to procrastinate or overwhelm registration officers with delaying tactics. They produced experts to talk about a shortfall in registration of 10 per cent., 15 per cent., 20 per cent. or more, whatever happened to suit them at the time.<br/>
I am glad to be able to tell the House that, in spite of the Opposition's feeble attempts to disrupt the system, and the assertions of prophets of doom that it would be unworkable, preparations have gone ahead as planned. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries said, the community charge registers have been drawn up successfully. The preliminary signs from registration officers are that the number of people included on the registers, which came into force on 1 October, amount on average to over 99 per cent. of the adults resident in their areas according to the Registrar General's population figures, not 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. The registers are subject to checking by the residents concerned and to the appeal process if there is any question about their accuracy.<br/>
This is a splendid result that gives the lie to the criticisms of the system that have been made. We have always said that the system is entirely workable and practicable. It is clear that the people of Scotland are more law-abiding than the Opposition give them credit for.<br/>
Over the next few months, it will be for local authorities to establish who will be eligible for community charge rebates and then to prepare community charge bills once the levels of the charge for 1989&#x2013;90 have been set. We shall play our part in the process by undertaking a comprehensive publicity campaign to ensure that everyone is aware of the availability of rebates for those on low incomes. From now, on the standard procedures for updating the register as people move will apply. I am confident that they too will work smoothly.</p>

<p>No. I have a number of matters to cover and I do not have time to give way. I am sorry.<br/>
The regulations before us range over a number of issues that are connected with the abolition of domestic rates and the introduction of the community charge system to replace them. The need for the new provisions in the regulations arises for the most part from changes which have been made to the community charge system and to primary legislation in the Local Government Finance Act 1988. I make no apology for that. We have always made it clear that we would consider carefully the application to Scotland of any changes to the system that were made during parliamentary consideration of the Local Government Finance Bill, as it was, and that is what we have done. The revised and improved system of community charges will therefore apply on both sides of the border.<br/>
We have also made clear that we shall keep in close touch with the registration officers and other local authority interests to ensure that none of the changes that we shall be introducing will jeopardise the timetable for the introduction of the community charge system in Scotland. I am happy to say that the system is well on course for introduction next April, as we intended. The registration process has gone ahead and it has achieved nearly complete coverage. Preparations are well advanced for the setting up of a billing and collection system. I am confident that work will go forward smoothly in accordance with the planned timetable.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) referred to a letter that came into the possession of the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook). I shall make no comment on the propriety of the publication of letters between Ministers. I cannot anticipate the statement on the uprating of income support that is to be made tomorrow by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security. The Government have given a clear pledge that income support levels will include an element that reflects the average minimum liability for the personal community charge, and we shall honour the pledge.<br/>

<p>No, I shall not give way. I wish to respond to the arguments of the hon. Member for Cathcart about the severely mentally impaired.<br/>
It has always been our intention to exempt from the community charge liability on the ground of severe mental impairment only those who are unable to play any meaningful part in the democratic process. The 1988 Act amended the previous provisions to allow for the exemption of those who have become severely mentally impaired as a result of an accident in adulthood, for example, as well as for those who are congenitally mentally handicapped.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cathcart referred to the mechanics of the exemption process. I believe that the system that we have devised is a sensible and humane one. It will be for the person who looks after the application for exemption to inform the community charges registration officer that he or she wishes to claim exemption on the ground of severe mental impairment. The officer will ask him or her to nominate a general practitioner to provide a

certificate. The officer will then approach the nominated doctor and request a certificate, and make his decision accordingly. Any decision will be open to appeal. This procedure will keep to a minimum the inconvenience that is caused to those who care for a severely mentally impaired person.<br/>
Our debate marks another step forward in the process of removing the totally discredited domestic rating system. We have heard a number of criticisms of the regulations and of the community charge system in general, but I remind the House that they pale into insignificance in contrast to the huge and entirely justified weight of criticism that has been directed at the domestic rating system over the years. I rejoice, and so do the people of this country, that we are now within six months in Scotland of the ending of the domestic rating system for ever. I commend the regulations to the House.</p>

<p>I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak about the concern that has been expressed by teachers and parents about the GCSE history examination.<br/>
I welcome my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department of Education and Science to the debate. I remember with affection when we were both councillors attending the Association of Metropolitan Authorities conference in Liverpool in 1980. There were a total of four Conservatives at that conference and we made sure that the Conservative viewpoint was made known during every debate. I also welcome the Minister's private parliamentary secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Stamford and Spalding (Mr. Davies) to his first Adjournment debate in his new capacity.<br/>
I must make it clear at the outset that I am not opposed to the reform of the exam system. In some ways the GCSE is an improvement on the O-level examination. The traditional O-level was not perfect. It could be dull and success was often possible by repetition of the facts without necessarily understanding them. The GCSE has brought about improvements in teaching method through a wider use of documents and sources and it has increased pupil interest. I believe that it was right to widen the scope and type of question and to evaluate more fully the skills used in history.<br/>
The GCSE history examination, however, has fatal flaws. It has lost the best of the O-level examination and gained some of the worst attributes of the CSE. My interest in this examination goes back to my time as a schoolteacher, when I taught CSE and O and A-levels, although I left teaching before the GCSE came into operation.<br/>
I believe that history is valuable for its intrinsic merit. It is a subject that should be taught to children because it has an interest separate from anything else. It is also essential that pupils should know the past if they are to understand the present. Two weeks ago, at the Conservative party conference at Brighton, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Science said that a sense of history is essential to the well-being of any nation. We are right to insist in the GCSE that national identity and national history are at the forefront of the objectives set for examination groups.<br/>
There has also been some debate and concern about the divide between skills and content. I believe that that division is a false dichotomy. Without the content as a basis for study, there can be no historical skills. Equally, without some skills&#x2014;for instance, the ability to analyse evidence or appreciate the context of historical data of the society being studied&#x2014;we can only truly speak of pupils knowing historical facts. We cannot say that they understand. It is important that they understand the context as well as knowing the facts.<br/>
The argument that skills and content can be divided is a false one. It is important that we should have both. That point was made by R. G. Collingwood, perhaps the leading philosopher of history this century, in his seminal work, "The Idea of History" in which he wrote:<br/>
<q>The enlargement of historical knowledge comes about mainly through finding how to use as evidence this or that kind of perceived fact which historians have hitherto thought useless to them".</q>
That leads me to the major concern expressed by critics of the examination, which professional historians have taken up recently, the so-called empathy questions. An HMI document "History in the Primary and Secondary Years" published in 1985 defines empathy as:
<q>Simply a word used to describe the imagination working on evidence, attempting to enter into a past experience while at the same time remaining outside it.</q>
The HMI definition, which concentrates on the evaluation of evidence while resisting direct and emotional involvement in the events, is very valid. G. R. Elton in "The Practice of History" went further. He said:
<q>Understanding what the evidence really says and understanding how it fits together is of crucial importance for the historian &#x2026; Imagination controlled by learning and scholarship, learning and scholarship rendered meaningful by imagination&#x2014;these are the tools of enquiry possessed by the historian.</q>
<q>It is the use of imagination based on the facts as known to understand the actions of participants from where the evidence is missing or imprecise to make informed supposition as to what may have happened.</q>
That is a far cry from the empathy of the GCSE. Macaulay's statement that
<q>a perfect historian must possess an imagination sufficiently powerful to make his narrative affecting and picturesque",</q>
has been corrupted into fiction writing.<br/>
Questions such as "Imagine if" and "Explain the feelings of" litter the GCSE papers. They are nothing but historical fiction. Here are examples from the Southern Examining Group on a question of the United States of America 1898 to 1968:
<q>Show how a democratic newspaper might have replied to these criticisms of Republican comment about the new deal.</q>
A question on Japan and China 1890&#x2013;1960 says:<br/>
<q>As a Japanese general at the time, explain your country's reasons for involvement in Chinese affairs in the 1930s.</q>
A question on Britain and Europe 1945&#x2013;1985 states:
<q>Explain the feelings and reactions of each of the following to the economic condition of Britain at the end of the Second World War: the owner of a pottery works; the manager of a shop selling pottery; a customer in that shop.</q>
Those are the kind of questions that pupils are asked to answer in history examinations. There was a classic question on the welfare state 1942&#x2013;1985:
<q>Explain the feelings and reactions of local education authorities to the issue of Circular 10/70. Explain the feelings and reactions of parents after the issue of Circular 10/65</q>
&#x2014;as if parents and local education authorities were some kind of cohesive block with one point of view. Those are false questions which one should not ask 16-year-old pupils to answer.<br/>
Questions were also asked about the partition of Pakistan and India in 1947. Pupils were asked to write about the reactions of a person living in that country at the time. However, the pupil was not told whether that person was Moslem or Hindu, or what community that person belonged to. It becomes very difficult for a 16-year-old to put himself in the position of a professional historian and answer that kind of question.<br/>
It goes against the whole idea of education and history to suggest that there is only one viewpoint and only one way of teaching it. We should not encourage that in the GCSE.<br/>
I have another example taken from a trial paper issued by one of the boards:


<q>Write an article from the point of view of a supporter of President Castro living in Havana in 1962 explaining the missile crisis and condemning American policy in the earlier Bay of Pigs episode.</q>
That is an open invitation to fiction writing. It may be good fiction writing, but it is not history.<br/>
Moreover, such questions are politically dangerous. They give a teacher with a political point of view to put across the opportunity for biased work within the class course work, and they can lead to indoctrination.<br/>
Indeed, some of the trial papers from the exam groups are outrageous. One said:
<q>Draft a speech to be made by a representative of the Palestine Liberation Organisation. This speech will justify these actions: the hijacking of aircraft to Jordan in 1970, the shootings at Tel Aviv airport and the attack on Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic games.</q>
GCSE empathy is a parody of the real thing.<br/>
What was Her Majesty's inspectorate's view on the issue? The interim report, which came out in March, contained no comments on the concern that by that time had already been expressed. I think of the case of the dog that barked in the night. The remarkable thing was, of course that the HMI dog did not hark. In the latest report, issued only last week, the question of empathy received three lines. The dog is now whimpering but it is still not addressing the concerns that have been occupying the national press and teachers for some six or seven months.<br/>
Some of the empathy questions, especially on world history, are concerned with recent issues, which, in some cases, are still current. Indeed, one exam group stresses the need for pupils to read the newspapers for the purposes of the examination. We as politicians are aware of the fact that what seems urgent and relevant one week does not merit a footnote in the next. The problem with recent or current events is that they lack the perspective that history offers. Should we be devoting history lessons and examinations to the study of current affairs? By all means, let pupils learn about current affairs, but should the history lesson and examination be used for such purposes?<br/>
I want to deal briefly with other worries about the examination. First, there is too much project work. That is of special concern to pupils because every GCSE examination involves project work. Bright young children taking eight or nine subjects have eight or nine projects to do. That weight of work is counter-productive. My experience from teaching the certificate of secondary education is that they are rarely done well and almost never contain any original or individual research.<br/>
Leaving aside empathy questions, the structure of questions is debatable. Little exam history appears to be taught within a chronological framework. Nor is it thematic, except in a small number of cases. For instance, questions on the evolution of parliamentary democracy concern themselves with only the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Therefore, the pupil has no idea, unless he was taught it earlier in the school, of 1215 and 1265 and the development of Parliament over the centuries. It creates a ragbag of disconnected topics.<br/>
The level of questions rarely stretches the bright child. There are few extended essay questions, unlike on the old O-level papers where a student could be forced to analyse, think logically and write coherently. The level of questions rarely stretches a child at all and is often facile in the extreme. Indeed, the questions can insult the intelligence of the child of average ability.<br/>
Let me give some examples. The Northern Examining Association shows a cartoon by Low of Hitler with a smoking gun. The questions include:
<q>Name the person, shown in source A, holding a smoking gun.</q>
That is given one mark.
<q>How did the cartoonist in source A indicate that this person was a Nazi?</q>
The answer is that he has a swastika on his arm. That earns another mark.<br/>
The Midland Examining Group had a question about the European Economic Community. It consists of two paragraphs with some missing words. They are at the bottom of the page. Anybody of average intelligence with a smattering of general knowledge could guess where the missing words go. That may be an English exercise, but it is not a proper history exercise.<br/>
Some questions are confusing. A question on one paper talks about Zimbabwe and the fight for national independence. The question asks how the student knows it was a British colony. There is nothing in the extract to say that it is a British colony. It could belong to Germany or elsewhere. Therefore, the question does not follow on from the source material in the question. That is true of many questions.<br/>
Sometimes the terminology is not suitable for the time and place being referred to and could be confusing to the pupil. An example from another board starts off: "Hey Dad, this plebiscite&#x2014;or whatever it is called&#x2014;about staying in the Common Market." The 1975 referendum was not, to my knowledge, ever called a plebiscite. That was a word from the 1930s. It is historically out of place, and anybody being taught about the European referendum will wonder what on earth was the plebiscite. It appears that the exam boards are not thinking clearly before phrasing the questions, and about how ambiguous some of them are.<br/>
Turning to the evidence questions, many of them require no historical knowledge but are merely comprehension questions more suited to an English paper. They raise serious questions in themselves. In many cases the pictures and cartoons shown are irrelevant and would only confuse. I have one such example taken from the Southern Examining Group paper of summer 1988. It shows Disraeli carrying a Turk. The paper states:
<q>Study the cartoon below and then attempt all parts of the question which follows.</q>
The three questions have no relevance to the cartoon; they are about the Eastern question, but otherwise they are irrelevant. It appears that, often, examining boards have stuck in cartoons to make the exam paper look pretty or interesting, but they do not help the student answer the questions.<br/>
Another famous cartoon from 1878 shows Gladstone and Disraeli covered in mud, accompanied by three questions. They refer to the cartoon, but the cartoon itself does not help one to answer them. I do not know who it is in the examination board who has the copyright on <i>Punch,</i> but its cartoons appear almost without fail in virtually every examination board paper.<br/>
In some cases&#x2014;and I have studied many examples&#x2014;the primary source material is not what it claims to be. I have another good example taken from the Southern Examining Group paper. I do not want to he seen to be getting at that group, but it seems to have the worst empathy questions of them all; it actually puts the empathy into the examination paper. It concerns a cartoon


of the 1921 triple alliance&#x2014;a very famous <i>Punch</i> cartoon. If one compares it, as I did, with the original in the issue of <i>Punch</i> for 20 August 1921&#x2014;as an eccentric, I have a very large collection of <i>Punch</i> magazines&#x2014;one finds that key words have been omitted from the cartoon, as it is reproduced in the exam paper. The title has been left out. The whole purpose of the cartoon has been totally changed. If one wants to teach children about historical material, it ought to be reproduced as it originally appeared.<br/>
I am sure that there is scope for an enterprising university student to write a thesis on how extensively source material has been altered to suit the requirements of exam groups. There is scope for evidence questions, but the answers need to be obtainable from the source, they need to be relevant, and some thought needs to be given to them by the student&#x2014;for instance, as to how they cohere with other material he might have.<br/>
My final point concerns marking of the examination. Sir Keith Joseph, as he then was, as Secretary of State for Education, called for criterion referencing&#x2014;that is, that marks should be based on an accepted criterion that remains constant from year to year, in order that comparisons can be made. The previous system of norm referencing, whereby exam grades were fixed in accordance with a particular cohort being examined, was to go. Her Majesty's inspectorate claimed:
<q>There has been a move away from norm referencing towards criterion referencing.</q>
According to Her Majesty's inspectorate, that is
<q>giving credit for positive achievements, or what pupils know, understand or can do according to predetermined assessment criteria.</q>
That is from the "Introduction to the GCSE in schools 1986&#x2013;88" published last week.<br/>
A report in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> on 3 August called "History in the marking", which concerned the London and East Anglia Group shows that it is in the business of fixing grade boundaries:
<q>Our two chief examiners disagree on the minimum mark required: one says 12, the other says 15 &#x2026; 'Oh this is no good,' somebody mutters. 'I've got a 10 and a four here. Anyone got two sevens?</q>
That exercise, as I said, is called fixing grade boundaries; in other words, translating marks into grades. That is a classic example of norm referencing. Certainly is not criterion referencing, when the grades move around according to the marks and to the numbers of pupils who have achieved certain numbers of marks. I thought that the GCSE was trying to get away from that, but it seems that bad habits die hard among some of the exam groups.<br/>
I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can give an assurance that those points will be examined. In conclusion, I shall make a number of suggestions. First, the empathy questions be transferred from assessment to the general aims section. Secondly, "imagine" style questions should be abolished, and that longer primary source extracts be used. Next, traditional, unstructured essay questions of the sort that ask the entrant to describe an account be reintroduced. Also, there should be a great variety and diversity of types of GCSE paper, with different historical approaches, so that teachers are not faced with solid uniformity. If need be, let us divide the history paper, as we do the maths paper, into two

overlapping ability papers. If we do that we shall eliminate some of the major problems that have been faced during the past few years.<br/>
Finally, we must ensure that English comprehension is no longer part of the history paper. We must return to finding out what the students know about history rather than testing their English&#x2014;something that should properly remain within the English papers.</p>

<p>I wish to pay the usual courtesies to my hon. Friend the Member for Pembroke (Mr. Bennett) and congratulate him on securing this debate. I certainly welcome the opportunity to discuss aspects of the new GCSE examination, especially his points about the teaching and examining of history. It is an appropriate time for such a debate as the dust begins to settle after the first GCSE examinations.<br/>
As my hon. Friend mentioned, we also have a report from Her Majesty's inspectors who have studied the introduction of the GCSE in our secondary schools. I shall draw a little on the report as the basis for assessing the early progress of GCSE. It attempts to identify the issues that must be addressed. Although my hon. Friend does not think that it deals sufficiently with empathy, the work as a whole is professional and is the result of close monitoring over the past two years. I wish to put on record my gratitude to HMI for producing the document.<br/>
The report confirms that, overall, the GCSE is off to a good start. I think that we would all agree with that. It concludes that the examination has achieved many of the objectives set for it. In particular, it has led to improvements in learning across a range of subjects; it has succeeded in raising pupils' motivation and enthusiasm. The vast majority of those involved with the exam like it, which is a change; it has helped teachers to improve their teaching approaches and raised their expectations of what pupils can achieve.<br/>
The inspectors found that, overall, there was a significant increase in the number of lessons where effective learning was taking place. They judged that about four out of five fourth and fifth-year lessons were satisfactory or better. As we know, the results are encouraging. Early analysis of the first results shows that more candidates achieved higher GCSE grades&#x2014;A to C&#x2014;than with the equivalent O-level and CSE grades in previous years. Fewer candidates were left without anything to show for their years in school and their hard work during the GCSE courses. That should not in any way be taken, as some might mischievously take it, as meaning that the GCSE is an easier exam than the two exams that it has replaced.<br/>
I noted with interest my hon. Friend's clear critique when he dealt with history papers and set out for the House the individual exam questions. The Department does not believe, and nor do HMI, that at this stage we should be complacent. There have been some well publicised teething troubles, which have arisen in part because some of the independent examining boards did not get their act together as well as we had hoped. I have been known to criticise those bodies, and my hon. Friend has graphically illustrated the problems when reading out some of the questions. There have been difficulties with questions, and the examining boards are only too well


aware of some of the shortcomings that have caused disappointment and frustration for teachers, pupils and parents alike.<br/>
The HMI report makes it extremely clear that, although overall the GCSE has been successfully implemented, many improvements are still required. Everyone who is involved with the exam must study the HMI report and make sure that the GCSE is better next year, and that certainly applies most particularly to independent exam boards.<br/>
I now turn to the points that my hon. Friend raised in relation to his concern about history and the examination that youngsters have taken over the past two years. The assessment of work done during the GCSE course&#x2014;it includes but is not limited to extended project work&#x2014;is a central element of the concept of GCSE. At least 20 per cent. of marks in virtually all syllabuses must be allocated to course work. An element of assessed course work provides a better assessment of achievement than a system based only on the old end-of-course exams. Course work has certainly helped to make GCSE results a fairer and more accurate reflection of achievement by the individual pupil. It certainly enables teachers to tailor work more closely to individual needs and allows full credit to be given for a wider range of pupils' achievements. The HMI has seen course work of an exceptionally high quality&#x2014;contrary to what my hon. Friend has said&#x2014;from pupils of all abilities, and it has found that it has contributed in general to higher levels of performance.<br/>
I agree that there is a need for improvement in the way in which some course work is done. Certainly in some cases the work load on pupils has been excessive. Examining groups and the new statutory School Examinations and Assessment Council should look closely at some aspects of the assessment and moderation arrangements. I hope that my hon. Friend will welcome that statement. The GCSE examining groups are already urgently reviewing syllabuses and administrative procedures in the light of experience.<br/>
Schools and teachers too should build, as always, on their experience of the first GCSE course work. There is certainly room for improvement in school and classroom practice&#x2014;for instance, in better integrating course work into normal classroom teaching. My hon. Friend's concerns about project work need to be addressed. The HMI has found many examples of good practice, but, as always, there is need for further improvement to bring the general standard of course work tasks set for pupils up to the level of the best.<br/>
Inspectors see a need also for a continuing programme of training for teachers, focused in particular on assessment of course work. I hope that that will be in relation to history just as much as to anything else. The Government have allocated about &#x00A3;40 million over three years for introductory training for the GCSE. In the current year, about &#x00A3;15 million of that is specifically intended to train teachers in the techniques of assessment. In 1989&#x2013;90 and beyond, GCSE teachers will benefit from the national priority that will be given to training in the assessment requirements, which will be associated with the introduction of the national curriculum.<br/>
My hon. Friend's concerns about GCSE history are shared by others within and outside teaching. The issue of empathy has been picked up in the HMI report. Although he described it as a whimper, we all agree that we must closely examine the issue.<br/>
In broad terms, "empathy" is shorthand for teaching techniques that are designed to help pupils to understand different viewpoints in history by encouraging them to look through the eyes of a contemporary observer. My hon. Friend has given many illustrations of how that is done. As my hon. Friend said, the merits of the empathy approach are the subject of current debate within the teaching profession in the context of history teaching generally, not just in the context of GCSE courses and examinations.<br/>
Of course, many of the aims of the empathy approach are welcome. As my hon. Friend said, empathy is one of a range of skills expected of a good historian. History teachers have long sought to find ways of making their subject rather more interesting, if I may say so as an ex-history teacher. They need also to look for ways of stimulating a wider range of pupils.<br/>
In my office this morning, I took a straw poll of officials. It confirmed my general impression that, by and large, O-level history has not done justice to what should have been an attractive and exciting subject. For example, one senior official barely scraped through O-level history because his teacher generated enthusiasm by teaching only the topics that enthused him, which, unfortunately, bore little relation to the syllabus. My private secretary's teacher never covered part of the syllabus because she believed that study of the Renaissance was unsuitable for a 14-year-old girl. Perhaps a proper use of empathy techniques can not only make history more attractive, but help children to develop genuine historical understanding.<br/>
There is also a danger that teaching that relies too much on a crude approach to empathy will result in superficial treatment of the subject, giving little benefit in terms of a proper understanding of historical events. I fear that there is a temptation to use empathy too much, particularly for the less able child, and that empathy may squeeze out knowledge and understanding rather than reinforce them. Empathy must not be a substitute for learning.<br/>
I sympathise with my hon. Friend's concern to see full criterion referencing in GCSE. This has long been central to the Government's education policy, and will come about when our plans for a national curriculum are implemented. Criterion referencing&#x2014;the assessment of all candidates against clear attainment targets&#x2014;is a central feature of the intended national curriculum assessment arrangements.<br/>
However, the GCSE is already a substantial improvement in this respect on O-level and CSE. The system of grade descriptions for the main GCSE subjects is a major step forward. The grade descriptions set out in general terms the types of performance expected at key grades. HMI confirms that the first GCSE exams have largely succeeded in the key aim of rewarding positive achievements.<br/>
A great deal of effort has gone into developing more thorough-going grade criteria to spell out in greater detail what these achievements are by grade and by subject, but this is a complex business that has not yet produced a workable system. The work must continue so that GCSE can become an integral part of criterion-referenced national curriculum assessment arrangements.<br/>
I note the many suggestions that my hon. Friend itemised at the end of his speech, but I must emphasise that GCSE has led to the start of many major improvements in the education of individual pupils&#x2014;</p>
