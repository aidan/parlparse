<p><i>During the Session which is now concluding substantial progress has been made in the work of reconstruction, but the economic difficulties resulting from the war, both at home and abroad, have presented My Ministers with serious problems and have required continuing efforts and sacrifices by My people. To enable My Ministers to deal rapidly and effectively with these problems, a measure has been enacted extending the purposes for which emergency powers can be used, and a new organisation for economic planning has been established. In order to secure a redistribution of labour to assist those industries which are essential to economic recovery, My Government have reintroduced a measure of control over the engagement of labour, supported by some limited use of the power of direction of workers.</i></p>

<p><i>My Ministers have given unremitting attention to the serious deficit in the overseas balance of payments and to the continuing need to stimulate exports and limit imports. In order to protect our reserves of gold and foreign exchange, it has been necessary temporarily to suspend the convertibility of sterling. My Government have been fully aware that our own difficulties cannot be overcome except in conjunction with other Governments. They have, therefore, warmly welcomed the initiative of the United States in seeking to promote joint action by the Governments of the European nations to increase production and extend international trade, and they have given this initiative their strongest backing.</i></p>
