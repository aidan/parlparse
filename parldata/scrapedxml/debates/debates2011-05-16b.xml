It is extremely worrying that the SNP has previously had a posture that is anti NATO and anti the nuclear defence of this country. It is time to engage in a serious debate on issues that ought to worry all those who believe in the United Kingdom, and in sound defence for the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.27.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for his statement, and for my advance sight of it. I would also like to place on record the Opposition&#8217;s appreciation of Professor Strachan and his sterling work.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/2">Today we are reminded of our armed forces and the sacrifices that they make in defence of our country. They and their families are in all our hearts. Their actions overseas make Britain&#8217;s streets safer, and we not only honour them, but celebrate their immeasurable professionalism and bravery. In that context we support the headline measures announced in today&#8217;s statement, which can improve the well-being of service communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/3">However, in the military covenant it appears that the Government are doing the right thing for entirely the wrong reason. The Armed Forces Bill is currently going through Parliament, and was meant to be debated just</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/4">last week. The Government faced concerted pressure in Parliament&#8212;along with enormous concern in the country&#8212;to amend the Bill and enshrine the military covenant in law. However, at short notice and in the face of almost certain defeat in Parliament, that was delayed so that Ministers could organise this retreat, which they are announcing today.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/5">As someone who has been open in saying that we should have gone further in the past to take the covenant out of the cut and thrust of party politics and put its principles in law, I congratulate all who played a part in the campaign. However, the Secretary of State today finds himself in the peculiar position of announcing a policy that he recently voted against. In February my colleagues and I tabled an Opposition day motion that called for</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/6">&#8220;establishing in law the definition of the Military Covenant, in so doing fulfilling the Prime Minister&#8217;s pledge&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/7">The Secretary of State, his Front-Bench team and the entire Cabinet voted against the motion.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/8">The Minister responsible for veterans has been the principal covenant-denier. In February he said in Committee that to &#8220;write down&#8221; the covenant and</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/9">&#8220;try to codify it by statute would be, frankly&#8230;surprising.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/10">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/11">&#8220;The covenant is a conceptual thing that will not be laid down in law.&#8221; &#8211;&#8211;[<i>Official</i> <i> Report, Select Committee on the Armed Forces Bill</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-10">10 February 2011</phrase>; c.20-21.]</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/12">Those were the words of Ministers in February. Although today&#8217;s announcement is welcome, it is not an action of conviction by the Government, but an act of submission to the parliamentary arithmetic that was building against them.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/13">In the few minutes that I have, let me turn to the other measures in today&#8217;s statement and strike a more bipartisan tone. Many of the announced measures appear to have their roots in the 2008 Command Paper on service personnel. We will want to look at the detail of today&#8217;s proposals. Let me ask the Secretary of State some specific questions and invite him to offer the House, and forces families, direct answers. Can he say what criteria will be used to identify those qualifying for council tax relief, and whether they will be the same as for those receiving the operational allowance? Will those currently serving in Libya or Afghanistan benefit from the policy?</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/14">The announcement on concessionary travel is welcome. The Secretary of State will know that the Command Paper announced that the bus concession in England would be extended to include service personnel and veterans under the age of 60 who were seriously injured. Can he share with the House whether his announcement today is the implementation of that policy, or whether it is an entirely new announcement?</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/15">On housing, can the Secretary of State say whether today&#8217;s announcement is in addition to or supersedes the introduction by the previous Government in January last year of the shared equity armed forces home ownership scheme? How many forces families will benefit from the scheme announced today? He has said that a new veteran&#8217;s card will be introduced. We strongly welcome that, but again, the Minister responsible for veterans said in February that</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/16">&#8220;the Government still have no intention of introducing a veterans card,&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/17">adding:</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/18">&#8220;I do not think that a veterans ID card is necessary, even in relation to access to commercial discounts.&#8221;<i>&#8211;&#8211;</i>[<i>Official Report, Select Committee on the Armed Forces Bill, </i><phrase class="date" code="2011-02-17">17 February 2011</phrase>; c. 102.]</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/19">What role will the veterans card have if it is not to be used for commercial discounts? Will the Secretary of State say who will pay for the card and how much it will cost?</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/20">My final specific question is to invite the right hon. Gentleman to tell the House whether he would consider exempting the seriously injured and war widows from the impact of recent pensions and benefits indexation changes, which will lead to enormous financial loss on the part of those who have given so much to our country. I am sure that the House and the British people would like to know his thoughts on that matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/21">I have asked a number of questions in response to direct announcements made today by the Secretary of State. We will support today&#8217;s announcement, but we will scrutinise it. We will want to know which of the announcements are genuinely new and involve new investment. However, the Government are entitled to widespread support in on setting out to enshrine the military covenant properly in law. If they set out to achieve what they have announced today, the Opposition will strongly support them in that.</p>

Yes, it is perfectly true that the Opposition raised some of the issues in a recent debate&#8212;except that they would not define what they meant, nor would they tell us what rights they might create or how they would pay for them, yet they expected us to take them seriously. The reason why we have taken time to produce these reports and responses to detailed work is that we want to get the policies right and do the right thing for our armed forces, their families and their personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman asked about the doubling of council tax relief. As I said, this will be 50% for personnel on eligible operations overseas. It will go to all those who currently get the 25% discount, which is a wider definition than that used for the operational allowance, but not to all those serving overseas&#8212;for example, in Germany. He also asked about the launching of the veterans card. It will be used to access commercial discounts or privileges, and we will consider how to expand it to include service families. It is linked to the relaunch of the defence discount scheme next year. It is not an ID card, for the reasons that we consistently gave in Committee and in the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.0/3">On indexation, when the change was made from RPI to CPI, none of us in the coalition Government wanted to see anyone in the public sector disadvantaged&#8212;but may I remind the Labour party that it left us with a &#163;158 billion deficit, which has to be addressed? We will spend more on debt interest next year than on defence, the Foreign Office and aid put together. That is the scale of the problem, and it is the deficit deniers who are now on the Opposition Benches who put this country at risk. They had 13 years in office, yet they now have the audacity, after 12 months, to tell us that we are doing things at the eleventh hour. No credibility!</p>

	<p pid="b.30.1/1">The Secretary of State&#8217;s congratulations to the Royal British Legion are well deserved, because it was its campaign more than anything else that forced this most welcome retreat by the Government. He will know that what wound the Royal British Legion up more than anything else was the attempt to water down the involvement of the reference group in the monitoring system set up under the Command Paper on service personnel. He appears to be saying that that is now to be restored, and that that role will be fully implemented in the proposed reporting mechanism. Can he confirm that there is to be no watering down of the involvement of the reference group&#8212;the stakeholders and the service personnel charities, including the Royal British Legion itself&#8212;in the ongoing reporting of the covenant?</p>

	<p pid="b.31.1/1">The hon. Lady makes two valuable points. As regards the first, on IVF, it is bad enough that we often deny mobility and life chances to individuals, but to deny them the chance of producing another generation is worse, particularly when it is something that we can avoid. We should avoid it, and doing so sends out an important signal about the pastoral care that we are willing to give to our armed forces. Today&#8217;s announcement is a key one, which I think will be welcomed across the whole country.</p>
	<p pid="b.31.1/2">On the hon. Lady&#8217;s second point, I think many of us will celebrate the fact that the care we give our armed forces is so much better than others might receive in the NHS that parity is being demanded. That is not a bad position for a country to be in, in terms of the care it gives to service people. The work we are undertaking with the Department of Health will set out to see what lessons the NHS can learn from the treatment of those who have been injured in military action&#8212;which I believe is a very proud moment for the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.1/1">As my hon. Friend knows, there is considerable debate about the numbers of the armed forces as a proportion of the prison population. I think we can say that for many of those who end up in prison, particularly those who have been homeless or who have been subject to drug and alcohol problems, it represents a failure of other systems to provide a suitable safety net. As a country, when we consider issues such as mental health we need to ensure that we do not allow those who are potentially vulnerable to fail to be picked up by the services that might prevent them from ending up in an inappropriate institution such as prison.</p>

	<p pid="b.38.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point that is key to this whole debate. As I said earlier, we had a duty to try to get a balance between, on one hand, wanting to preserve the chain of command and, on the other, the legitimate interests of the wider service community, charities and the public. We did not, therefore, want to create a set of rights that could have had the armed forces tied up in European courts for ever, which would have been an utterly inappropriate use of their time and funding, but we did want to set out in the law of this land the principles about where there should be no disadvantage and where there should be special care, if required. It will be against those principles that future Secretaries of State for Defence will be judged and I think the balance is appropriate. We have looked at all the legal implications in great detail over a very long time and we believe that this is an appropriate balance to strike.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.49.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40508" speakername="Kevin Barron" colnum="49"  time="016:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0002.htm#11051612000648">
	<p pid="b.49.3/1">No&#8212;I shall just carry on for a few minutes, if my hon. Friend does not mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/2">The commissioner&#8217;s report suggests that the public purse was overcharged by between &#163;80 and &#163;270 per month, even in comparison with assured shorthold tenancies. Property advisers considered that the rent in the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s lodging agreement was between &#163;209 and &#163;370 a month higher than the market price.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/3">The right hon. Gentleman and his supporters say that he acted to preserve his privacy. Extensive press briefings suggested that the breach would be somehow less blameworthy if that were the case, but the commissioner expressed his sympathy for the right hon. Gentleman, and the Committee recognised his motivation. However, there were other ways to preserve privacy. He could have refrained from claiming. Alternatively, he could have designated his main home properly, which would have meant that there would be no need to conceal receipts that might have identified his landlord.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/4">The right hon. Gentleman instead took the decision to preserve his privacy by concocting a rent agreement and, wherever possible, claiming below the receipts threshold. He told the commissioner:</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/5">&#8220;After the receipts threshold changed I reduced my claims below the threshold.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/6">Ultimately, as the report says, this case is about the fundamental principles of the code of conduct, which says, and has always said:</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/7">&#8220;Members shall base their conduct on a consideration of the public interest, avoid conflict between personal interest and the public interest and resolve any conflict between the two, at once&#8230;in favour of the public interest.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/8">As the Committee said:</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/9">&#8220;We consider the rental agreements submitted between 2003 and 2008 were misleading and designed to conceal the nature of the relationship. They prevented any examination of the arrangements that in fact pertained over the entire period.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/10">That is why this case is worse than many others in which the commissioner has found there has been a breach of the rules of the additional costs allowance. In many of those cases, the Members concerned had consulted the department of finance and administration, and in some cases both the department and independent valuers, so there was no intention to deceive. In one case, the Member&#8217;s circumstances changed, so that arrangements that were expected to be temporary lasted longer than expected.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/11">In contrast, the case before us involved a deliberate attempt to conceal the Member&#8217;s real living arrangements that continued for many years. It is clear that he recognised the potential conflict between the public interest and his private interest. By omitting to seek advice, however, he made himself the sole judge of whether that conflict was properly resolved. It was inappropriate for him to be judge and jury in his own case. As the commissioner commented, it can never be acceptable to submit misleading documents to those charged with overseeing public finances. As this case shows, the right hon. Member&#8217;s desire for secrecy led him to act in a way that was not compatible with the standards expected of an MP. Whatever the motive, I do not think that is acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/12">Now I will address the concerns of those who think that we have been too lenient. Since the Committee reported, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40217" name="Thomas Docherty">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Thomas Docherty)</phrase> has asked the police to investigate. There is a protocol between the police, the commissioner and the Committee providing for liaison between the commissioner and the police, if either of them has concerns. The police will not comment on individual investigations, and the commissioner is also understandably reluctant to comment on such matters, even to the Committee. However, the fact that the commissioner has reported to us suggests the Member&#8217;s behaviour is unlikely to have been criminal.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/13">I have already explained why we felt this case was more serious than others, but there were mitigating factors. As we stated in the report:</p>
	<p pid="b.49.3/14">&#8220;Not only has Mr Laws already resigned from the Cabinet, his behaviour since May 2010 has been exemplary. He quickly referred himself to the Commissioner, has already repaid allowances from July 2006 in full, and has cooperated fully with the Commissioner&#8217;s investigation. This behaviour has influenced our recommendation.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.51.0/1">I will not detain the House too long. I realise that we have immensely important business to discuss later, and we should get on to it as soon as possible. However, this matter is not unimportant. Judging from the number of Members seeking to take part in the debate on the report, I fear that it would otherwise slip quietly into parliamentary history. We have realised over the past few years just how tainted this House&#8217;s reputation has become vis-&#224;-vis not just the conduct of some Members, but how the way in which we deal with them is perceived.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/2">I do not want to go into extreme detail about what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40680" name="David Laws">the right hon. Member for Yeovil (Mr Laws)</phrase> has done&#8212;or not. The commissioner has conducted a characteristically scrupulous and systematic investigation of the events, and the Committee and all its members have followed in the same vein. I will not seek to divide the House on the recommendation, which I am sure will be agreed. However, I fear that the way in which the case has been dealt with and the conclusion that the Committee has presented create the danger of emphasising the idea that, superficially at least, there is one rule for some Members of this House and other rules for others. Some are taken before the courts&#8212;and, indeed, imprisoned&#8212;for their conduct; some get barely a slap across the wrist; and others escape scot-free.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/3">I accept that the speculation around this case is nothing to do with the right hon. Gentleman personally, but so much of the comment outside this place&#8212;I accept, too, that neither this House nor any Member is</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/4">responsible for such comment&#8212;is about how much time he should serve not before he is brought before the courts or sent to prison, but before he is brought back into the Cabinet. That changes the aspect and the proportion of this case entirely. The report makes it plain that there has been a systematic, calculated and flagrant pattern of behaviour by the right hon. Gentleman, which, describe it as we might&#8212;deceit, deception, fraud&#8212;amounts to dishonesty. If this House is to rebuild its reputation we need not only procedures that are, to quote an oft-repeated phrase in the report, &#8220;above reproach&#8221;, but systems that are seen to treat each and every Member of this House in the same fashion. I do not think that we have that at the moment&#8212;I do not criticise the report; I am sure that we will pass it and move on&#8212;but it is for the authorities and the Committees in this House to ensure that one simple procedure applies to everybody.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.0/5">As the Chair of the Committee, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40508" name="Kevin Barron">the Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron)</phrase>, has said, this matter is now under investigation by the police because somebody has referred it. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> I am told that he did not say that, in which case, we need to refer it. However, it is equally true that in other cases, the police have not waited for a referral for matters to be investigated, but have taken it upon themselves to investigate whether there was any criminal or corrupt element in Members&#8217; behaviour. Indeed, matters that for a while fell within the purview of the commissioner were passed on, because the police had commissioned investigations into whether criminality and wrongdoing had taken place. There are those who have said that Members found guilty of serious wrongdoing should resign and leave this House, triggering a by-election&#8212;so much so, indeed, that the current Deputy Prime Minister said in his first address to the Liberal party conference that he wanted to add a &#8220;Derek Conway&#8221; clause.</p>

	<p pid="b.55.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House has considered the matter of the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/3">Our security and prosperity in Britain are indivisible from those of other countries. We cannot seal ourselves off from dangers in other countries or prosper fully alone, and it is against our values&#8212;as, indeed, it is against our interests&#8212;to stand by while conflict and instability develop. That has been shown to be true time and again in the regions that we are debating today.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/4">Britain could not turn a blind eye when Colonel Gaddafi turned his forces against innocent civilians in Libya, shelling crowds of peaceful protestors and even hospitals crammed with victims, and launching a ferocious campaign of arbitrary detentions, torture and summary executions. This is a country on Europe&#8217;s southern edge, and a regime that threatened to &#8220;exterminate like rats&#8221; the people who had risen against it. The Arab League clearly called for help and intervention, which is one of the reasons why we have taken a strong lead in calling for, securing and implementing UN Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973. Other reasons include the effect on Libya&#8217;s neighbours and the consequences for migration, terrorism and our own national interest if a pariah state had emerged in north Africa. Our action in Libya has a compelling legal and moral basis, strong regional and international support and a clear objective, and it continues to make progress.</p>

Many different parts of the apparatus of the regime in Libya that are engaged in prosecuting a war against its own civilians have not actually been targeted yet.</p>

	<p pid="b.59.2/1">Those countries are all in different situations. I wish to discuss those different countries later, but Libya&#8217;s is the one case where we are dealing with a clear call from the Arab League and a United Nations Security Council resolution, and that makes it very different from all the other situations that we are dealing with. The hon. Gentleman should support the fact that Britain is acting on that basis, with that international authority. The purposes of our military action are exactly as set out in the resolution but, for the reasons that I have just been explaining, it is hard to see us achieving those objectives, or any peaceful solution being arrived at among the people of Libya, while Colonel Gaddafi remains in power. We have to recognise that, and it is why most of the world, including people across north Africa and in the Arab world, want him to go.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.2/2">This House and our country should be confident that time is not on the side of Gaddafi; it is on our side, provided that we continue to intensify the diplomatic, economic and military pressure on his regime. The tempo of military operations, which some of my hon. Friends have been asking about, has increased significantly in recent weeks, and we are now targeting not just deployed military assets, but the fixed military command</p>
	<p pid="b.59.2/3">and control facilities which the regime uses to threaten the civilian population. That action is within the constraints of the Security Council resolutions, and we are increasing the regime&#8217;s diplomatic and economic isolation at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.2/4">At the contact group meeting in Rome on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-05">5 May</phrase>, which I attended, all members agreed to reject diplomatic emissaries from Tripoli unless the regime shows serious willingness to implement a real ceasefire. We also agreed to explore action to prevent the regime from exporting crude oil and importing refined products for non-humanitarian use, and to clamp down on states and entities supplying arms and mercenaries to the regime. We are also working with our partners to stop satellite or state support for the broadcasting of Libyan state television, and the whole House will welcome the Arab League&#8217;s decision yesterday to request a ban on Libyan state-owned TV from broadcasting on the Arabsat satellites. We also welcome the mediation role of the UN special envoy, as I have said.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.2/5">In parallel with that pressure, we are increasing our support for the Libyan national transitional council, which we regard at this moment as the legitimate representative of the people of Libya. In Rome, the contact group agreed terms of reference for a temporary financial mechanism which will aid the provision of basic services in eastern Libya, as well as efforts to stabilise its economy. The first meeting of the steering board for the mechanism is due to take place today in Doha, and up to $180 million has already been pledged by the Gulf states.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.2/6">The British Government were also one of the first to provide humanitarian support to Libya, including medical supplies for 30,000 people and basic necessities for more than 100,000. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development will want to expand on this when he winds up the debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.64.3/1">Turkey is taking a lead in the region, in particular in trying to persuade the Syrian authorities to go down the route of reform, rather than the route of repression. We very much welcome the highly active role&#8212;not yet a successful role, but a highly active role &#8212;played by the Turkish Government in that regard. Of course, we look to Turkey, particularly as an aspirant nation for membership of the European Union, always to set a strong example itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/2">While condemning so many things that have happened in some countries, we should welcome the fact that in some other countries of the Arab world Governments are setting out plans for reform. In March, the King of Morocco announced a package of reforms, including putting the national human rights body on an independent footing and constitutional changes that will be put to a referendum. Jordan has announced committees on national dialogue and constitutional and economic reform, and we look forward to those reforms being agreed and implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/3">In Yemen, the economic, security and humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate. More protesters were killed only last week by Government forces, in violence that the whole House will deplore. The United Kingdom supports the Gulf Co-operation Council&#8217;s initiative to resolve the deadlock, which requires the President to step aside and a new Government to be formed who include members of the Opposition. We are in close contact with the GCC about the progress of negotiations, we have supported those negotiations, and we are in close contact with the United States and our partners in Europe about our wider approach to the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/4">Instability in Yemen has serious implications for the terrorist threat from that country, and al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has demonstrated the intent and capability to attack western targets inside and outside</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/5">Yemen. Britain and our allies are working around the clock to counter this threat and we will continue to do so. The arguments about the need for reform and dialogue apply to all countries in the region. Although each country is different, we will make the case to all that steps to reverse freedoms and curtail human rights are wrong and counterproductive.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.3/6">We welcome the announcement in Bahrain that the state of national emergency will be lifted on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-01">1 June</phrase> and look forward to this commitment being met. We remain very concerned by the restrictions on freedom of speech and the reports of human rights abuses, including the widespread arrest of political activists and the severe charges brought against a number of doctors and nurses by a Bahraini tribunal. The Government of Bahrain must meet their human rights obligations and uphold political freedom, dialogue, equal access to justice and the rule of law. We also call on opposition groups in Bahrain to be prepared to enter into genuine dialogue.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.1/1">I am coming on to Afghanistan, and I will talk briefly about troop levels, but I will leave any such announcement for my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/2">We have received news in the past 24 hours&#8212;the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s remarks relate to this topic&#8212;of the death of a Royal Marine from 42 Commando Royal Marines, and the whole House will join me in paying tribute to that officer and in expressing our sincere condolences to his family.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/3">Osama bin Laden&#8217;s death will not mean the end of the security threat posed by the insurgency, or of the need to build up the capacity of Afghans to take charge of their own affairs. We remain committed to building a stable and secure Afghanistan that is able to prevent international terrorist groups from operating from its territory. Bin Laden&#8217;s death presents a clear opportunity for the Taliban to break decisively from al-Qaeda and to participate in a peaceful political process.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/4">I wish to spend the remaining few minutes of my speech&#8212;so that others can speak&#8212;updating the House on recent developments and on the Government&#8217;s overall strategy, treating these remarks as our quarterly report to Parliament on progress in Afghanistan. At the close of this debate, the Secretary of State for International Development will inform the House of development progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/5">The next four years in Afghanistan will be decisive. The Prime Minister has made clear that by 2015 our troops will no longer have a combat role or be there in the numbers they are in now. President Karzai and the international security assistance force coalition have</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/6">confirmed that, by then, Afghanistan will be in charge of its own security. That process of security transfer is already under way, and President Karzai announced in March the first group of provinces and districts where the transition will begin. Lashkar Gah district in Helmand is in that first group, confirming the progress that we have made in improving security in central Helmand. The National Security Council has approved our strategy that will support this transition over the next four years.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/7">The momentum of the insurgency has been halted and, in many areas, reversed. Afghan and ISAF forces are now working to consolidate gains, which are not yet irreversible, and levels of violence have been relatively low in recent months, although a little higher than in the same period last year. In April there were a number of insurgent attacks, including the barbaric assault on a UN compound in Mazar-e-Sharif and an attack on the Defence Ministry in Kabul, and there was the escape of a large number of insurgent detainees from prison in Kandahar. Those incidents underline the need to continue pursuing our counter-insurgency strategy and our efforts to build Afghan security capacity, but they should also be seen as of limited wider impact when placed in the context of the campaign. In early May, Taliban leaders announced the start of their spring offensive, and we must therefore be prepared for such attacks to continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/8">The UK&#8217;s overall military contribution is well over 10,000 troops. In task force Helmand&#8217;s area of operation, our focus is on maintaining momentum and retaining the tactical initiative in preparation for the end of the poppy harvest, when Helmand&#8217;s fighting-age males, many of whom have in previous years turned to the insurgency for employment, must be encouraged not to do so again. We keep our force levels under constant review, and some reductions this year may be possible, to answer the question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40424" name="Paul Flynn">the hon. Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn)</phrase>, dependent upon conditions on the ground and the implementation of the security transition.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/9">If the transition of security responsibilities to the Afghans is to succeed and endure, we have to build up Afghan capacity, and we are making progress on that. Afghan security forces responded capably to the Taliban&#8217;s co-ordinated assault on Kandahar city on <phrase class="date" code="2011-05-07">7 May</phrase>. The numbers in the Afghan security forces continue to grow ahead of schedule, but just as important are the improvements being made in their capability and professionalism.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/10">Some 95% of ISAF operations are conducted side by side with Afghan forces, and about 74% of Afghan national army kandaks and 75% of Afghan national police are now rated as effective with advisers or effective with assistance. Eleven out of 12 planned ANA branch schools are now open, teaching the soldiers the skills they will need to move from an infantry-centric force to a more self-supporting organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/11">Literacy rates in the army continue to improve, with 80,000 members of the security forces having now completed a period of literacy training and a further 60,000 in training at any one time. The NATO training mission estimates that in nine months more than half the Afghan security force will have completed basic literacy training, compared with just 15% today.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/12">We continue to work with the Afghan Government and our international partners to support reconciliation in Afghanistan and to make progress towards a political</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/13">settlement. We want a durable and inclusive settlement that respects the interests and rights of all Afghans. I agree with Secretary Clinton, who said on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-18">18 February</phrase> that we must intensify our efforts on a political process. We need to take advantage of military and civilian gains to make 2011 a year of reconciliation and transformation in Afghanistan. We will work with anyone who genuinely shares the goal of a secure, stable and prosperous Afghanistan that is not threatening to its neighbours and who is not threatened by it, and we look to the Bonn conference later this year as an important opportunity for progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/14">In all the countries and regions that I have discussed today, we have a strong national interest in both democracy and stability, and our country is playing a major role bilaterally through the European Union, the United Nations and NATO, including in Afghanistan, where we are the second largest contributor of international forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/15">This year already stands out as a momentous year in foreign affairs&#8212;one that not only gives rise to great optimism about the potential for greater economic and political freedom in a part of the world that has known little of either, but that generates risks to the United Kingdom which we will work to anticipate and address, working with our allies to protect our nation&#8217;s interests while standing up for the highest values of our society.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.70.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40632" speakername="John Spellar" colnum="70"  time="018:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0002.htm#11051617000221">
	<p pid="b.70.0/1">This debate certainly covers a vast number of countries of interest, but it does not include China, which my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40474" name="Douglas Alexander">the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire South (Mr Alexander)</phrase>, the shadow Foreign Secretary, is visiting today, as he mentioned in last week&#8217;s exchanges. It is also unfortunate that so much other business has been put on today&#8217;s agenda, given what is clearly a timely, popular and well supported debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/2">I accept that we are in somewhat uncharted territory, and we recognise the difficulty for the Government of making decisions in response to rapidly changing circumstances, but it is nevertheless necessary that those decisions are taken speedily and coherently and that they are implemented effectively. For Parliament to scrutinise the Government&#8217;s performance properly, it is important that the Government share their thinking and the evolution of their doctrine in assessing options and that they ensure a firm grip on delivery.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/3">I know that a considerable number of Members wish to speak, that they have an interest and considerable expertise in the subjects covered by the debate and that there is a time limit, so without more ado I will cover some, although not all, of the countries involved. Inevitably, given the dramatic death of Osama bin Laden, we must start with Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/4">At the outset, let me make it clear that we believe that the allied forces were right to go into Afghanistan in response to 9/11, and that the UN was right to set up ISAF with the following mandate, which we should remind ourselves of today:</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/5">&#8220;<i>Stressing</i> that all Afghan forces must adhere strictly to their obligations under human rights law, including respect for the rights of women, and under international humanitarian law,</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/6"><i>Reaffirming</i> its strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Afghanistan,</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/7"><i>Determining</i> that the situation in Afghanistan still constitutes a threat to international peace and security,</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/8"><i>Determined</i> to ensure the full implementation of the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force, in consultation with the Afghan Interim Authority established by the Bonn Agreement&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/9">That mandate, in its essence, remains relevant today.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/10">The UK took the lead in the initial phase of ISAF, and our forces have played a prominent and&#8212;I am sure that hon. Members in all parts of the House recognise this&#8212;distinguished role since then. They show great skill, courage and determination in their operations, and some have made the ultimate sacrifice, including the Royal Marines sergeant mentioned by the Foreign Secretary. Others have suffered serious injuries that will affect their whole lives, as was highlighted in the statement made earlier. Because my constituency is very close to Birmingham, I recently talked to a nurse there who works at Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham, who described how heartbreaking it is to see these once-fit young men who have desperate injuries but who remain enormously positive and resolute. We owe them a huge debt. The nation must honour the military covenant, and today&#8217;s statement is an important step in that process. I also join the Foreign Secretary in his tribute to aid workers in Afghanistan, a number of whom have died in trying to bring help to the people of Afghanistan. They have shown enormous dedication and courage.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/11">We must look to the manner and timing of the handover of the governance of Afghanistan to the Afghan authorities, army and police. One of our key objectives was to prevent al-Qaeda from using Taliban-run Afghanistan as a base from which to launch terrorist attacks around the world. While Osama bin Laden&#8217;s death has not finished al-Qaeda, it has certainly dealt it a serious blow. It also confirms previous intelligence suggesting that nearly all of al-Qaeda has left Afghanistan. That probably means that Washington will start phased troop withdrawals in the next couple of months. We must be clear that the process is determined by the situation on the ground, not by the calendar, but also that it will start to happen shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/12">It is clear that intense internal discussions are going on in Washington, and some elements of those discussions are starting to emerge. Senator John Kerry, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, last week described as &#8220;fundamentally unsustainable&#8221; the US&#8217;s current expenditure of $10 billion a month on what he called a massive military operation with no end in sight. He made it clear that he was not advocating a &#8220;unilateral precipitous withdrawal&#8221;, but that the US ought to be working towards achieving what he described as the &#8220;smallest footprint possible&#8221;. The ranking Republican Senator, Richard Lugar, who also has huge experience on that committee, reinforced the message, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/13">&#8220;The question before us is whether Afghanistan is important enough to justify the lives and massive resources that are being spent there, especially given our nation&#8217;s debt crisis.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/14">The atmosphere in Washington shows that people feel that the death of bin Laden will have a significant effect on the setting of milestones and the pace and slope of the US troop withdrawal.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/15">I hope that in his reply the Secretary of State for International Development will outline, as far as is prudent and possible, our plans in this regard and the</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/16">considerations that will shape the progress of the draw-down. Will he also, without being definitive, indicate the intended completion date, although we recognise that that will, of its essence, be tentative and might be varied in either direction? We all know that the British public are realistic and resolute, but it is also clear that they now want to see our boys, and increasingly our girls, starting to come home.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/17">Will the Minister indicate what role he sees for the neighbouring powers&#8212;obviously Pakistan, but also Iran, Russia, China, India and possibly Turkey, as well as the various &#8220;stans&#8221;&#8212;in this process of a resolution for Afghanistan? They all have significant interests, which are not entirely geopolitical, and many also have kinship with ethnic groups within Afghanistan. However, their interests are not necessarily coincidental and will have to be carefully handled. It is in no one&#8217;s interests, neither in the wider world nor in the neighbouring powers, for Afghanistan once again to be a centre of instability and a haven for international terrorism. We need to decide what outcome is desirable and practicable and, together with the United States and the international community, move resolutely towards it.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/18">In that context, what should be the basis of a settlement? First, there should be a new and more inclusive internal political arrangement in which enough Afghan citizens have a stake and the central Government have enough power and legitimacy to protect the country from threats within and without. Secondly, on which the first depends, there should be a new external settlement that commits Afghanistan&#8217;s neighbours to respecting its sovereign integrity, as outlined in the UN resolution that I have mentioned, and carries enough force and support to ensure that they abide by that commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/19">In the UN&#8217;s words, the internal settlement will require</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/20">&#8220;a process by which the ex combatants acquire civilian status and gain sustainable employment and income&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/21">It will then require reconciliation, including ensuring that tribal, ethnic and other groups are represented and recognised. Parliament and parliamentarians should also be recognised and encouraged. Several Members of Parliament participated in the sessions with the group of Afghan parliamentarians who were over here last month and who are developing a vibrant approach to their democracy. That event was extremely welcome, and we congratulate the organisers, but a lot more needs to be done by us and by the international community to sustain the process. As has been self-evident in many exchanges about this in the Chamber, there must also be a sustained drive to cut corruption.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/22">In many ways, we have been looking at events in what I will describe, in historical terms, as the north-west frontier region from the wrong end of the telescope. We are considering events in Pakistan in the light of their impact on Afghanistan, whereas the crucial issue is how Afghanistan will affect Pakistan, which is a country of 160 million people&#8212;it is the second largest Muslim country&#8212;with a significant military, including nuclear, capability. It is also, as the Foreign Secretary has rightly acknowledged on behalf of Britain, a country that has suffered considerable losses from fundamentalist terrorism, and it continues to do so even in recent days. We need to think very seriously about Pakistan&#8217;s concerns and prospects. This is not helped by some of the knee-jerk responses to the death of bin Laden that we have seen in the media, with too many people making facile assertions regarding</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/23">subjects about which they do not have, and may well never have, the full picture. Idle speculation on this matter is not helpful in forming an effective, considered judgment, and it is certainly not helpful in the internal politics of the region.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/24">I therefore welcome the fact that the United States appears determined to continue to support Pakistan rather than to repeat the mistake that it made following the end of the Soviet invasion by cutting aid substantially and drastically. I note the welcome news in today&#8217;s <i>Financial Times</i> that Senator Kerry is about to visit Pakistan. However, there is also a clear obligation on Pakistan, in terms of good governance, to improve its administration, especially in relation to tax collection; to improve educational opportunities, particularly in taking education away from fundamentalist madrassahs and thereby ensuring proper education for its young people; to enable and sustain a more pluralist society; and to engage in dialogue significantly to reduce tension with India, which occupies so much attention and resources in both countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.73.1/1">I certainly do. This is an argument that needs to be had right across the world. Recently in Australia, there was a big attack on the aid programme to Indonesia&#8212;again, it is substantial&#8212;which is designed to ensure proper secular, state-run education, so that youngsters do not only get their education in fundamentalist organisations. It is enormously important that we sustain that programme for the future of that country, the largest Muslim country, as it is for the future of Pakistan, the second largest Muslim country. That is essential not only for the long-term security of the region but for international security. I was encouraged by the comments of the Foreign Secretary on that subject, and I hope that the Secretary of State for International Development will enlarge on them in his response.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/2">Turning to the middle east and north Africa, it has been rightly said that the death of bin Laden was a serious setback for al-Qaeda, but the most telling blow has been the Arab spring, with its demands for democracy and more open societies, and certainly not for al-Qaeda&#8217;s dream of a return to mediaeval brutality. We should be realistic about the various elements that are involved in that movement and the possible course of developments.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/3">I congratulate the Foreign Secretary on his Mansion House speech. I notice that he recycled quite a bit of it in his speech this evening. That is obviously part of the Government&#8217;s commitment to be greener. However, the speech bears repetition. As he rightly said:</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/4">&#8220;Demands for open government, action against corruption and greater political participation will spread by themselves over time, not because Western nations are advocating them but because they are the natural aspirations of all people everywhere.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/5">In that context, we should recognise that the events in the middle east and north Africa are not isolated. A tide has been sweeping around the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/6">In spite of some disappointments, we should reflect on how much progress has been made around the world over the past couple of decades. Most countries in</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/7">south America have emerged from military dictatorship, are overcoming their ruthless, destructive guerrilla groups and are building a better future. Interestingly, in his famous Chicago speech in 1999, Tony Blair referred to the need for</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/8">&#8220;more effective ways of resolving crises, like that in Brazil.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/9">Brazil is now a roaring economic power, and it has just celebrated the election of a new successive social democratic President. The countries of eastern Europe have returned to their European home, having thrown off the shackles of their corrupt, vicious, incompetent communist leaderships and the Warsaw pact. They have willingly joined NATO and the EU. Indonesia, which I mentioned in response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40280" name="Malcolm Bruce">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase>, is the world&#8217;s fourth most populous state and the largest Muslim state. In 10 years, it has gone from being a military-backed dictatorship to being a vibrant democracy with a rapidly expanding economy. It is now a G20 member and an effective partner against terrorism. There has been a seismic, historic shift in the international landscape, and we should recognise and welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/10">That is why we fully supported and support the Government&#8217;s decision to join international partners to enforce United Nations resolutions 1970 and 1973 in Libya. Those who query resolution 1973 and this country&#8217;s rapid decision to act must consider how we would have felt, and how the world would have reacted, if Gaddafi&#8217;s tanks and death squads had poured into Benghazi over that weekend and killed people, to use his words, &#8220;like rats&#8221;. In this day and age, that would all have been carried out on 24-hour TV in real time.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/11">While giving support, it is our responsibility, as a Parliament and as an Opposition, to scrutinise carefully the Government&#8217;s conduct and effectiveness in fulfilling the task. We need from the Government a clearer and better articulated strategy. Frankly, we need them to explain how their self-imposed cuts to our expeditionary capability will enable them to implement the policy. The article that the Prime Minister wrote with the French and US Presidents in April said:</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/12">&#8220;So long as Gaddafi is in power, Nato and its coalition partners must maintain their operations so that civilians remain protected and the pressure on the regime builds&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/13">It is incumbent on the Government to be clearer to this House and to the British people about how they propose to bring about such a resolution of this situation, especially in light of the comments over the weekend.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/14">It was asked earlier, but I think it needs to be asked again, what is meant by &#8220;infrastructure targets&#8221;. If it means command and control posts within a military structure, I understand that. I think it is arguable&#8212;I hope that the Attorney-General would back me&#8212;that that is perfectly within the bounds of the UN resolution. If, as some commentators have suggested, it means industrial infrastructure, and particularly electricity infrastructure, we have considerable doubts. Even in Kosovo, which was a major operation, the object was to immobilise the transmission systems not to destroy them, because after military operations are over, there is a need to reconstruct the country. It is difficult to do that without adequate electricity supplies. It is therefore important that we have clarity on what is meant by infrastructure. One meaning is perfectly within the current programme, but otherwise we have considerable questions and doubts.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/15">It has to be clear that there is continuing international and regional support for our strategy. I can see no UN mandate for ground troops to move into Libya, and I think it is fair to say that there is no chance of getting such a mandate at the Security Council and no prospect of regional support. We must recognise that there is little appetite among the British public for such a course of action, and I suspect that the situation is similar in the United States and France.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/16">I hope that the Secretary of State for International Development will update the House on the considerable efforts of his Department, with others in the international community, to assist the 750,000 people who are estimated to have crossed from Libya into neighbouring countries, and to get supplies to people in parts of Libya that are under siege from Libyan Government forces. I do not underestimate the task, but we need to know how we are tackling it, because it is substantial and urgent.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/17">What are our realistic options across the middle east and north Africa? Although it is true that we are one of the few countries with the strategic capability to provide meaningful intervention, we must recognise the constraints imposed by our existing commitments elsewhere, the clear problems of overstretch, and the cuts made in the strategic defence and security review, which are increasingly seen as ill advised and outdated. Whatever action we take will be in conjunction with others, and not only our key strategic ally, the United States, but increasingly the EU, or at least key European allies. It has become clear, particularly in the last week or so, that a stretched United States has self-imposed limitations. Our European deliberations will have to consider that, and our response will have to be shaped accordingly. It is true that we could take a position of splendid isolation and say that those issues are nothing to do with us, but developments would continue in north Africa and the middle east. Although we should not overestimate our ability to shape events, we should not underestimate it either.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/18">A key area is to develop capacity for the emerging democratic forces and parties in the countries concerned. It would be tragic if the principal beneficiaries of the new democracies were the remnants of the old dictatorial parties or underground fundamentalist Islamist groups. We should draw on the experience of eastern Europe, where post-communist parties were able to exert disproportionate influence because of their well-developed corrupt networks. I am sure all parties hope that the Westminster Foundation for Democracy will play a major role in building capacity for democratic parties.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.76.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40632" speakername="John Spellar" colnum="76"  time="018:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0002.htm#11051617000227">
	<p pid="b.76.1/1">We certainly ought to be concerned about that; my hon. Friend highlights another significant concern. Because of the vast array of countries across a wide and diverse region, our debates focus on certain countries. Inevitably, today&#8217;s debate will be focused primarily on Afghanistan and Libya, along with maybe one or two other countries. I am concerned that some of the countries that have been making some progress might start to slip off the radar, and it is important that we do not allow that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/2">We must not allow our level of interest in the countries that are making progress to fall. Development there must be sustained, because there will not just be a steady path towards a democratic society. There will be pitfalls along the way. To make a comparison with eastern Europe again, the involvement of the secret police networks can be a considerable factor in the development of those countries, as I described earlier. We ought to be alert to that problem, but we should also take the positive way and build the capacity of democratic parties so that they can take the best advantage of democratic elections when they come.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/3">I hope that Members of all parties will consider the role that the Westminster Foundation for Democracy and other such bodies can play in building capacity for democratic parties. The Foreign Secretary has announced substantial cuts in the Foreign Office programme&#8212;the sum will go down from something like &#163;139 million to &#163;100 million. We did not get details, but we need to know whether the cuts will have an impact on those organisations and their programmes.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/4">In the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s statement last week, he talked about increasing our presence in a number of missions across the world. Interestingly enough, only one of those, Pakistan, is in the area that we are discussing today. There was, understandably, mention of a reduction in Afghanistan and Iraq, but in none of the other countries concerned did it seem there would</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/5">be an increase in our local involvement despite the considerable interest that we need to be taking in them. On the face of it, that seems a slightly strange decision, and it would be helpful to have some explanation.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/6">We have to recognise that not all of the liberation of eastern Europe went smoothly. Ethnic tensions rose to the surface, and in one case, Czechoslovakia, were resolved by a&#8212;fortunately peaceful&#8212;division of the state. Catastrophically, however, in Yugoslavia they led to vicious civil wars, appalling violence and the necessity of NATO intervention. Some states in north Africa and the middle east are fairly homogenous, but others are riven by ethnic differences and, in some cases, considerable and long-standing ethnic feuds. The international community must use all its endeavours to ensure that the outcome of the Arab spring is more like Poland than Yugoslavia. In that context, I welcome the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s comments about Tunisia and hope, as I said to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>, that we will not focus only on countries where there is conflict. We must also provide assistance to those that are making a more orderly transition.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.1/7">I shall move on briefly to the middle east and the Israel-Palestine issue. I am sure that everyone in the House and internationally is frustrated by the failure to get engagement in substantive talks leading to the creation of a new Palestinian state, living peacefully side by side with Israel. We echo the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s statement yesterday, which he repeated today, when he expressed Britain&#8217;s concern about the violence on the border and the loss of life, and called on all parties to exercise restraint. We should be persuaders for peace, to ensure that Palestinian aspirations can be realised alongside Israel&#8217;s equally legitimate desire for a peaceful existence within secure and recognised borders.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.1/1">Yes, and I presume that the hon. Gentleman would also have mentioned the fact that the Israeli army enforced those movements at the direction of Sharon. Pointing such things out is important, but it is equally important to get back to the fundamental need for talks and negotiation on the acceptance of a two-state solution. From many of the discussions that there have been, I do not believe that the sides are too far apart on the detail. We therefore look forward to the initiative that we hope the US Administration will take later this month, which we hope all parties will then pursue.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/2">On Syria, we welcome the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s comments about making approaches to the EU and the UN to step up pressure on the regime. At the moment, however, the regime seems well past his &#8220;fork in the road&#8221;, and I hope that the message is getting through to it clearly.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/3">I am mindful of the time, Mr Deputy Speaker, and of the numbers who wish to speak in the debate, so I wish to raise only two other issues&#8212;and to do so briefly. First, on protecting our security and national interest, and ensuring stability in the region, the Foreign Secretary will be unsurprised if I once again raise the issue of piracy off the coast of Somalia. The problem now stretches right round the gulf of Aden and out into the Indian ocean, which has a considerable effect on countries in the region. Nearly 800 seafarers are being held hostage, often in appalling conditions. Some have been brutally murdered. More than 30 ships are being held&#8212;some are used as mother ships to extend the pirates&#8217; reach far into the Indian ocean. Ransoms totalling well over $100 million were paid last year, and there are credible reports that the pirates have entered a deal with the al-Shabab organisation in Somalia, which is linked to al-Qaeda, for a percentage of the ransom.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/4">Therefore, in effect, the shipping industry is directly funding terrorism. There has been some response, but I feel that it has been inadequate. I had a helpful response from an Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, but I was concerned when a Defence Minister told me that there had been no recent change in the rules of engagement. I recognise that there is no easy instant solution, but there is a danger that the crisis will continue to outrun and overwhelm the response. Piracy threatens not only lives but a vital world trade route. Incidentally, the unwillingness of crews and ships to go through the Suez canal and pay dues could have a damaging effect on the income of the emerging Egyptian democracy. Frankly, the Government need to get a grip on that. They must engage with other maritime nations and get commitments for sufficient ships and personnel, but there must also be a step change in the rules of engagement and operational tempo.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/5">To pull those arguments together and put them in a broader context, we do not accept that if we intervene anywhere in the world, we must take action everywhere. Nor do we accept the converse&#8212;that if we cannot or will not take action in one country, we should be immobilised elsewhere. That is why the previous Labour Government, when I was a Defence Minister, intervened militarily in Sierra Leone, but were unable to take action against the brutally repressive Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/6">I also accept&#8212;the Opposition have supported the Government in this respect&#8212;that a range of factors must be taken into consideration, and that countries must be considered on a case-by-case basis. However, we would like evidence not only of more coherent planning, but of more rigorous analysis. Around the time of Kosovo both Tony Blair, in his Chicago address, and Kofi Annan, in his Ditchley lecture, extensively developed the doctrine of humanitarian intervention. They might have been controversial, but they helped to create a framework within which policy could be decided, and indeed scrutinised and criticised.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/7">I have not detected the development of such a doctrine in the speeches of the Foreign Secretary, including his speech today. The Opposition support much in his policy, but we require the Government as a whole to get their act together on policy and to be more effective on delivery. In short, we believe that it is time for them to get a grip.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.79.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40340" speakername="Malcolm Rifkind" colnum="79"  time="018:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0002.htm#11051619000039">
	<p pid="b.79.2/1">In the short time available, I shall concentrate my comments on two matters: first, the conclusions we should draw from bin Laden&#8217;s demise, and secondly, the remaining challenges faced by the international community with regard to Libya.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/2">Bin Laden&#8217;s demise was of course an historic event. We should not underestimate the significance of the US special forces operation, or of the extraordinary intelligence operation that their achievement represented. The timing of the operation is significant in that it happened right in the middle of the Arab spring. What could better demonstrate the ultimate irrelevance of what al-Qaeda has to offer? There is reason to believe&#8212;a massive amount of evidence has emerged from throughout the Arab world&#8212;that the lure and attraction of, and the significance of and interest in, al-Qaeda are beginning to wane. Al-Qaeda not only does not feature in the demands of the hundreds of thousands of people who demonstrate throughout the Arab world for reform and change, but it has been positively rejected by many as they advance claims for universal values.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/3">However, if we begin to believe that the attraction of al-Qaeda is waning in the Arab world, I caution the House against coming to a similar conclusion with</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/4">regard to Pakistan. We are in a very different time zone there when it comes to the possibilities of change. Bin Laden may have been of Saudi or Yemeni origin, but we should remember that ultimately the al-Qaeda movement originated in south Asia, not in the Arab world. We also know that that happened in the context of experiences in Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is perhaps significant and not irrelevant&#8212;I do not want to anticipate events&#8212;that the only revenge act so far in response to the assassination of bin Laden has come not from al-Qaeda or the Afghan Taliban, but from the Pakistani Taliban, who feel, and who have expressed sympathy for al-Qaeda and endorsed it.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/5">That is significant for how we see developments in Afghanistan. There is a powerful argument for saying that if our original purpose for going into Afghanistan was the threat of al-Qaeda operating from within the country, that reason is now much less valid than it has been at any time in the past few years. However, the question of the timing and method of our withdrawal from Afghanistan must take into account not just the implications within that country, but to an even greater extent, the possible consequences for the destabilisation of Pakistan. Up to now, we have primarily worried about the consequences of al-Qaeda or the Afghan Taliban using the border as a refuge zone, but in some ways, things are now the other way around. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40632" name="John Spellar">the right hon. Member for Warley (Mr Spellar)</phrase> said, the problem in Pakistan is of far greater significance to the wider stability of the world, and it must be given priority. I hope that that is taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/6">On Libya, I pay tribute to what has already been achieved. There is no doubt that Benghazi would have experienced an incredible massacre, and that Misrata would have been overthrown by Gaddafi, but for the efforts that have been made. However, those who have warned of the dangers of stalemate pose a real question. Without wanting to criticise the Government&#8212;I am aware of the international constraints on what they can do&#8212;there is a fundamental inconsistency in arguing that the mission is purely humanitarian at the same time as making it clear that it cannot be completed until we have, in effect, regime change.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/7">The question, therefore, is this: how does one square that circle, and can it be squared in a way that does not breach the UN resolution? Whether we like it or not, that is the framework within which we must operate. As I see it, there are only three ways in which that stalemate can be broken over a reasonable period of time. First, implosion in Tripoli is quite possible. In the past few months, a significant number of leading Gaddafi adherents have defected. It is not impossible or inconceivable&#8212;it could happen next week or next month&#8212;that many of the senior adherents who remain, including generals and Cabinet Ministers, will simply fade away and disappear. I suspect that even Gaddafi&#8217;s immediate family will eventually not wish to share his bunker. Saif al-Islam and some of his colleagues might prefer to be in the south of France rather than the quagmire that Gaddafi&#8217;s regime could become.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/8">That is one option, but we cannot count on it, and certainly not in any short time scale. The second option is a very slow process of gradual disintegration of the regime. That might be happening already because of the combined impact of economic sanctions and the fact that the oilfields are primarily in the east of the country, with very little utilisable refining capacity in</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/9">the west, plus all the other forms of political, diplomatic and other pressure that is being put on the regime. However, by itself, that will not deliver the outcome that we need to bring this matter to a conclusion for many months, and possibly for several years. It is a serious option, but do we want to contemplate that the international action will take that long?</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/10">That leads me to the third option. What do we do, and what can we do within the UN resolution, to help the insurgents who are struggling for freedom and the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime? We have had a crucial watershed in the past couple of weeks in how the British and other Governments treat those insurgents. This is perhaps the first debate in which they have not been described as rebels. For many months, that was the description used not just in this country, but elsewhere, but that is no longer the case. The insurgents have been invited to open an office in London, they are being treated as serious politicians, and they are rightly considered to have greater legitimacy than the Gaddafi regime, which I welcome. However, we also know that they do not have the military capability with which to achieve the result that we all want.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/11">The question is whether that can be achieved within the terms of the UN resolution. If it requires us&#8212;I do not complain about this&#8212;simply to protect civilians, what happens if there is hand-to-hand fighting in Misrata or Tripoli? It could not be stopped by air power or an international coalition; it could be stopped only by the people on the ground. Only they could protect civilians in such a situation. Therefore, I argue&#8212;and I believe that some of the legal advice agrees&#8212;that if we could be satisfied that the provision of military assistance to the insurgents would help to protect civilian lives and deal with the threat to civilians in Libya, it would be consistent with the resolution. In those circumstances, that kind of help should be considered. In reality, of course, that sort of help is already being given. The French, the Qataris and several other countries are already providing it, whether or not they acknowledge it publicly.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.2/12">Were that help to be provided&#8212;I am talking about training as well as weapons&#8212;two things would happen. First, those around Gaddafi would know that the game was up, and gradually, as the insurgents became more of a disciplined, trained military force, it would become obvious&#8212;in their view, as well as in ours&#8212;that the regime was finished. Secondly, Misrata and the east of the country would gradually be united under insurgent control, and Gaddafi&#8217;s remaining power would be so restricted as to be insignificant. That is the real challenge, not just for the British Government, but for the international community, and I believe that we can respond to this situation positively within the terms of the UN resolution.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.81.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40194" speakername="Ann Clwyd" colnum="81"  time="018:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0002.htm#11051619000040">
	<p pid="b.81.0/1">I am glad that the Foreign Secretary mentioned Iraq, because it is seldom mentioned now, and needs to be mentioned far more often. I have three recent Amnesty reports on Iraq that are well worth reading, because they point out some of the deficiencies in the Iraq that we have left behind. Tens of thousands of Iraqis, emboldened by the successful uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, have taken to the streets since early February to protest against the chronic lack of basic services, rising prices, mass unemployment and endemic corruption, and to demand greater civil and political rights. Unfortunately, the security forces have</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/2">frequently responded with excessive force, using live ammunition, sound bombs and other weapons forcibly to disperse peaceful protesters, particularly during what the Iraqis called the &#8220;day of rage&#8221; on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-25">25 February</phrase>, when demonstrations were held across Iraq. At least 20 people were killed, many of those arrested say that they were tortured or ill-treated, and journalists trying to cover the protests, as well as political activists, have been targeted for attack or threats.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/3">I obviously have a particular interest in this subject because, for seven years, I was special envoy on human rights to Iraq for the previous two Prime Ministers. I therefore have an ongoing interest in the development of human rights there. During this &#8220;day of rage&#8221;, protesters used violence, mainly by throwing stones at members of the security forces or public buildings, and on rare occasions by setting fire to public buildings, and as a result members of the security forces have also been injured. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-30">30 March</phrase>, in a belated but welcome development, the Iraqi authorities announced that their security forces were under orders not to use firearms against demonstrators except where necessary for self-defence.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/4">Up to now, the Iraqi authorities, in both Baghdad and Kurdistan, have sought to crack down on peaceful protesters. That obviously has to change. As Amnesty wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/5">&#8220;They should be cracking down on the use of excessive force and torture by their own largely unaccountable security forces, not on the right of people to peacefully protest. The Iraqi authorities should be upholding the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, including the right to protest, not trying to suppress them. It is high time to do so&#8230;Torture and other ill-treatment were widespread in Iraq before the US-led invasion in 2003&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/6">of which we were part,</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/7">&#8220;and continued in prisons and detention facilities controlled by coalition forces and the new Iraqi governments. Since 2004, suspects held in Iraqi custody have been systematically tortured and dozens of detainees have died as a result.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/8">In my seven years as special envoy, I continually visited prisons and detention centres and spoke on many occasions to the Iraqi human rights Minister, to whom I pay tribute, because she has a difficult job but has not had enough support.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/9">Amnesty also wrote that</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/10">&#8220;US forces handed over tens of thousands of prisoners to Iraqi custody between early 2009 and July 2010 without any guarantees that they will be protected.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/11">I argued constantly in this Chamber that they should not have been handed over to the Iraqis, because they did not have the capacity to deal with the thousands of detainees they were expected to hold. Amnesty also wrote that</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/12">&#8220;there is every likelihood that torture and ill-treatment will remain widespread. Such abuses have a devastating impact on the victims not just when they are being tortured or ill-treated, but often for years afterwards&#8230;Urgent action is needed to end the pattern of abuse and to help the victims and their families.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/13">I received an email from an American working in Iraq. His name is Tom Cruise&#8212;not the actor Tom Cruise&#8212;and he is the former senior adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Defence directorate of human rights. He came to see me several times in the Baghdad embassy because of his great concern about an Iraqi prisoner killed while in detention. He wrote to me in February saying that he was still trying</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/14">&#8220;to bring attention to the disturbing torture and murder of detainee Adnan in&#8230;the former Iraqi 2/3/6 brigade which was run by BG Nasser who is now the Commander of the Iraqi 2nd DIV in Mosul.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/15">He was tortured and murdered, and the person responsible was known to everybody. His name is Lieutenant Nabil Rahman Ali Mosa al-Yasseri. After eight months of intensive investigation by the FBI, he was located and arrested in al-Hillah. He was held for a mere 10 weeks, and then suddenly he departed. He was helped to escape. Tom Cruise wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/16">&#8220;I hope this communication can serve to bring the necessary attention to resurrect this matter and initiate further judicial action so the world can see that Iraq respects human rights and it is important for all and especially for Adnan Awad Mohammed Thaib Al-Jumaila and his family.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/17">Our embassy has raised this matter with the Iraqi President, Deputy President, Prime Minister and many others in Iraq, but with no results. Obviously, I think that the UK Government can play an important role in putting pressure on the Iraqi authorities to ensure that detainees are either released or brought promptly to trial on recognisable criminal charges, with full and fair trial rights and without recourse to the death penalty. We have invested too much&#8212;in money and blood&#8212;in the country to allow this abuse of human rights to continue in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="b.85.0/1">Three months ago it seemed that the Arab spring in north Africa and the middle east might bring democracy to widespread areas of the region. Tunisia made major changes with its jasmine revolution, and Egypt rid itself of the Mubarak regime, even though the aftermath rumbles on. Now, however, the situation seems far less promising. Syria, Bahrain and Yemen continue to suppress the movements for democracy, with continuing serious loss of life inflicted by brutal regimes.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/2">In Libya, not only has the situation reached deadlock, but misgivings must be aroused by NATO&#8217;s lack of political direction. UN Security Council resolution 1973 was right and necessary. There is no doubt that the implementation of the no-fly zone has saved very many lives. However, NATO now appears to be stuck, turning to regime-change policies, which are in no way authorised by the resolution. Loathsome though Gaddafi may be, attacks on his compound, apparently targeting him personally, are unacceptable, and it is deplorable that members of his family have been killed. There is no way in which the Security Council has authorised political assassination. It is essential that there should be a clear line of political control, linked to discernible political objectives. The resolution would otherwise never have been nodded through by Russia and China. It is a matter of concern that over the weekend General Sir David Richards tried to state political objectives that are not within his remit. Our brave armed forces are there to carry out objectives decided politically. It is not their leaders&#8217; role to make or urge political policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/3">Political assassination appears to be becoming the flavour of the month. I shed no tears for Osama bin Laden, a monster who was responsible for this century&#8217;s most lurid atrocity, but for Barack Obama to violate another country&#8217;s sovereignty by sending in an assassination squad must arouse deep concern, especially as the White House has made so many conflicting statements that it is impossible to know what really happened in Abbottabad. Was bin Laden armed, and did he seek to resist with arms, thus provoking the Americans to kill him? Did he try to use women as human shields, or was he unarmed? Was any real attempt made to take him alive and put him on trial for his crimes? The White House's handling of the situation has turned a killing into reality TV. There is also a lethal aftermath: 80 innocent Pakistanis were killed by the Taliban at the weekend in what they say was a revenge attack, with a threat of more to come. Did the Americans think this through before they acted?</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/4">This latest episode confirms&#8212;to me, at any rate&#8212;that Obama is simply a sanctimonious version of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. An example is his breaking his pledge to shut down the Guantanamo Bay illegal torture camp. As Zbigniew Brzezinski, the former US national security adviser, has said of Obama: he does not strategise; he sermonises. Nowhere has Obama&#8217;s failure been more damaging than in his handling of&#8212;or</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/5">inability to handle&#8212;the Israel-Palestine stand-off. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-04">4 June 2009</phrase>, he made a ponderous speech in Cairo that was supposed to launch a successful peace initiative. Now, two years later, not only has there been no such initiative but his envoy has packed it in and the situation has become threateningly worse. We are told that the President is going to say something more, quite soon. He will be praised for his oratory, but will it have any practical, useful or helpful consequences?</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/6">This past weekend, Israeli soldiers slaughtered 14 more Palestinian protesters. Last week, they murdered a Palestinian teenager on the west bank. Their brutal treatment of peaceful protestors with rubber bullets, tear gas, the spraying of sewage and the manhandling of women and children would be the object of condemnation if inflicted by any other country. The way in which Israeli soldiers maltreat Palestinians is appalling. A Palestinian contact of mine e-mailed me at the weekend with this description of what happened on Friday:</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/7">&#8220;In Nabi Saleh where I was, the soldiers attacked the men and women with extreme cruelty, although our demonstration was extremely peaceful. We had at least 24 injuries, without counting injuries with pepper spray. They were shooting the gas canisters right at us, aiming at our bodies. One American citizen was shot with a canister on his head. I was standing right to him and I saw the soldier aiming at him. The man is fine now, but he lost part of his scalp.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.85.0/8">I cannot fault the way in which our Government have reacted to this situation, and I particularly commend the Secretary of State for International Development for the way in which his Department has done everything possible to assist those affected. In the end, however, only the United States can exert the necessary pressure to make Israel see sense. The Palestinians are an oppressed people, and the Israelis will never know peace and security until there is a two-state solution. How long, O Lord, how long?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.88.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40685" speakername="Dan Jarvis" colnum="88"  time="019:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0003.htm#11051620000031">
	<p pid="b.88.0/1">As we approach the sixth anniversary of 7/7 and the 10th anniversary of 9/11, my thoughts turn to the lives so tragically lost. It is clear that the war on terror is the battle of our era&#8212;a struggle to rid perceptions and ethics, ideology and religion of extremism and its deadly inevitability.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/2">I find it hard to rejoice at the death of any man, even that of Osama bin Laden. I hope that his death is the beginning of the end for al-Qaeda&#8212;I accept that it might not be&#8212;but we must not be naive of history: no individual is irreplaceable; the war, the fight and the danger are far from over. However, bin Laden&#8217;s death provides us with an opportunity which, if seized, could lead to real progress in the fight against extremist violence, especially on the two key fronts of Pakistan and Afghanistan. There could be no better tribute to bin Laden&#8217;s victims than to use his death for lasting good.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/3">In this war, our relationship with Pakistan is perhaps the most crucial. One immediate impact of the raid on Abbottabad has been to put that country under pressure as never before. One well-informed observer in Pakistan told me over the weekend that the country feels like it is in anaphylactic shock, while some in my constituency called for us to review our co-operation and aid in light of the perception that Pakistan was complicit in harbouring the world&#8217;s most wanted man.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/4">I doubt whether we will ever know the hard facts about what the Government of Pakistan knew or did not know about bin Laden&#8217;s whereabouts. It should be investigated, but what is most important is the bigger question of our overall longer-term relationship with Pakistan. There are clearly severe problems that need to be resolved and changes that can and must be made. We need urgently to find new ways to do that, but there is an overriding mutual interest in making the relationship work. I think that the basic outline of how to achieve that is clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/5">Pakistan has legitimate concerns about sovereignty and its own security. Those concerns can be addressed, but in exchange, the Pakistanis cannot pursue those interests in a way that directly undermines stability in Afghanistan and harbours extremism at home or abroad. I believe that the crisis that has followed the killing of bin Laden provides a real opportunity for ourselves and the Pakistanis to reflect on how we refine our relationship to suit our shared interests. It is an opportunity we must take; indeed, we have to take it and we have to get it right. The consequences of failure&#8212;for ourselves and for the Pakistanis alike&#8212;are too dangerous to contemplate.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/6">The UK's interest in a stable, democratic and peaceful Pakistan is clear. The country faces serious challenges and internal divisions. Those are very real: they include rising political tensions, unrest in the tribal areas, insecurity on its borders and more violent extremist groups than any other nation in the world. As with the wider middle east and north Africa as well as Afghanistan, the UK will feel the effects of state failure in Pakistan all too directly. The path used to import its product&#8212;whether it be drugs, the hateful rhetoric of extremism or the suicide bomber&#8212;is well trodden. We should also not forget how many of Pakistan&#8217;s people have died as a result of terrorism or in their fight to contain it. The prospect of a nuclear-armed Pakistan collapsing into internal strife or war with its neighbours is a nightmare. Now, more than ever, Pakistanis need us to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.</p>

	<p pid="b.90.0/1">In January this year, I had the privilege to visit Pakistan with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association delegation. We all know that the danger with such visits is that we travel fast, meet a few people and come back as instant experts. I am aware that many Members know much more about the subject than me, but I feel completely confident in saying what I am about to say.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/2">Sadly, it has recently become fashionable to criticise Pakistan&#8212;to criticise the amount of aid that we give it and to criticise it for being lukewarm in its reaction to the terror threat. The point has been made this evening on a number of occasions that Pakistan has invested more blood and treasure than any other country in the world in the fight against terrorism. We met the Pakistan Minister for Minorities, Dr Shahbaz Bhatti on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-24">24 January</phrase>; a fortnight later, Dr Bhatti was dead&#8212;murdered because of his Christianity and, more particularly, I think, because of his commitment to the cause of moderation. If such people are not to have died in vain, we have to ensure that we stand behind Pakistan and offer such assistance as we may.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/3">The country has changed its constitution. There will be a shift of power from federal government to the regions. The point has also been made that it is a young country in respect of its population&#8212;it is one of the few countries in the world with more young people than old people. The young people we met were hugely enthusiastic for their future, but they were also hopelessly disorganised. In the regions, the democratic processes and the infrastructure are lamentable.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/4">I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development is hugely committed to the cause of education in Pakistan, but we need to go one step further and strengthen the democratic infrastructure, perhaps through institutions such as the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, so as to enable the transfer of power from the federal government to the regions without extremism taking over. We will report to the Minister next Monday, and we will make those points then, but I want to make them to my right hon. Friend here tonight and to put them on the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/5">I have the honour to be the chairman of the all-party parliamentary Tunisia group. The Arab spring, as it is now called, actually began in midwinter with the jasmine revolution in Tunisia. Since then, the introduction of an interim Government has led to the creation of an election commission, which has set in train the processes for the democratic elections that we hope and believe&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/6">despite some misgivings&#8212;will still be held on <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-24">24 July</phrase>. I say &#8220;despite some misgivings&#8221;, because the task is herculean. In the time available, the commission must try to create a register and an identification process, and it must try to work out the detail of the election itself. It must establish whether the election will be held in constituency terms or nationally on a proportional-representation basis. As things stand, some 60 parties will be entering the election, which will create huge problems in itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/7">The choice, however, is between action now and delay. Delay will lead to further unrest and further confusion. The consensus seems to be that it is right to move ahead, accepting the fact that the election will probably be ragged around the edges. Those of us who have worked as international election observers know only too well that in developing countries there must be an acceptance of some degree of imperfection. If we judge on the basis of our own methods, perhaps we should not look too closely at the dust in other people&#8217;s eyes.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/8">The important part of the process will be what follows the election. The Government who are elected will again be an interim Government, but they will have been elected. They will be charged with the duty of creating a constitution that will then be taken back to the people for a further election, and only then will the real process of reconstruction start. However, that should not gainsay the fact that Tunisia is, at this moment, open for business. What it needs more than anything else is economic development and investment. The tourism industry is on its knees, but the country is safe and able to receive visitors.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/9">The other problem that Tunisia has with Europe is that Europe will not take its agricultural goods, which has implications for rural jobs. It is not good enough for France and Italy to complain about the number of migrants from north African countries, while closing their doors to the produce that those countries, especially Tunisia, need to sell in order to create the jobs that will keep migrant workers at home and enable them to grow their own economies.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/10">The abandoning of the Schengen agreement by France and Italy should come as no surprise to any Member, but it would behove, in particular, the southern states of the European Union to try to create real opportunities, rather than investing cash in programmes that may or may not lead to jobs in the longer term. They should immediately consider the possibility of bringing Tunisia into a customs union, so that it can look to Europe legitimately and play a real part in the development of the Arab spring and of democracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.95.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40609" name="John Stanley">the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase>. He and I have served together on the Committees on Arms Export Controls and on the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs for many years, and he speaks a great deal of sense on those arms exports issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/2">Somebody once said, in the context of British politics, &#8220;You can be in office and not in power.&#8221; That situation clearly applies in a number of countries around the world, but I wish to focus my remarks, as others have done, on what is happening in Pakistan. The fact that Osama Bin Laden apparently lived in Abbottabad with food and access to information, although not to the internet, and was somehow protected, is a matter of deep concern, but I have no doubt that the Government of President Zardari had no knowledge that that was the case. The question for us, which is highlighted in a very good book that came out this week, &#8220;Pakistan: A Hard Country&#8221; by Anatol Lieven, is about the relationship between the civil society and the political society in Pakistan and the military and intelligence elite that has run that state.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/3">Anatol Lieven says:</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/4">&#8220;the Pakistani national security state&#8230;was born chiefly out of fear of, and hostility to, India. This is felt most strongly in the military and, in the ISI, it is a raging monomania.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/5">That sums up the problem. According to an opinion poll of about two years ago, 85% of the Pakistani population want better relations with India. We find the</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/6">same thing when we speak to people in the British-Pakistani and British-Indian community&#8212;many of whom, including many of my constituents, have roots in the divided Punjab&#8212;and when we go, as I did with the Foreign Affairs Committee five years ago, by road from Amritsar to Lahore, through the Wagah crossing. If we leave aside the symbolism of the soldiers on both sides at the ceremony, we also find the interesting sight of the bearers, who, on the one side, carry sacks of onions on their heads for about a mile and half and, on the other side, carry boxes of dried fruit. This is an international border where people cannot trade by means of vehicles passing through; everything has to be unloaded and then loaded again.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/7">Economic co-operation between India and Pakistan would be of great benefit to both countries, especially in dealing with Pakistan&#8217;s problems arising from its rapidly growing population: it has 180 million people, and that is on the way to becoming 300 million or 350 million. Massive difficulties are also caused by the fact that a disproportionate amount of money in Pakistan is taken up by the national security structure, and because the obsession with India means that it is a state that has in the past, through its Inter-Services Intelligence, sponsored terrorist organisations and insurgent groups in both Afghanistan and India. The democratic and secular forces&#8212;the people, including the late Shahbaz Bhatti, to whom reference has been made, who believe in women&#8217;s rights and in protecting minorities, and who stand up for ethical values and global values of human rights&#8212;are besieged now in Pakistan because of the international context.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/8">The Pakistani Government and Pakistani politicians can rightly point out that many of the problems they face arise because of the misguided interventions of 25 and 30 years ago, which led to the situation in Afghanistan, where the groups that evolved into the Taliban were developed. However, there was also a Pakistani hand in some of that; they got the money from the United States&#8212;from the CIA&#8212;it was pushed through the ISI and it went through to people such as Mr Hekmatyar, to what is now the Haqqani network in Afghanistan, and to the Taliban.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/9">That worm has turned, and the Pakistani state faces enormous threats from those organisations, but it also has its own resilience and ability to fight back. In my opinion, it is good news that Osama Bin Laden was killed and is dead, and however critical we might be of the fact that he was in Pakistan, we need make an assessment and take a clear view. The Government of Pakistan were not shielding that man, nor were the Pakistani people. That was done by certain rogue elements within their society, and it would be completely wrong to do what some in the United States Congress are calling for and punish Pakistan by cutting off economic assistance and ending co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/10">What Pakistan needs today is our solidarity against the terrorist threat it faces. Its secular politicians need our support and an encouragement to rebuild the dialogue with India, to resolve the difficulties over Kashmir and to co-operate against the common threats of terrorism which both those countries are facing. That is not going to be easy&#8212;the history and the fact that the pain is so deep on both sides means that it will be very difficult&#8212;but the alternative is to play into the hands of the extremist groups that wish to foster a failed state, further conflict</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/11">and terrorism. That will not only be destructive to all the values of Pakistan and India, but it will blow back into this country because people here have family roots in that part of the world. We owe it to them, as well as to ourselves, to work in co-operation with Pakistan at this time of great difficulty.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40329" name="Mike Gapes">the hon. Member for Ilford South (Mike Gapes)</phrase>, the former Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I agreed with almost everything he said. I agreed with the main thrust of it, and with his point about the essential need for our continued involvement in Pakistan in terms of providing aid and support. I also pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development for his concentration on the issue of education in Pakistan. A country that spends only 2% of its gross domestic product on education is one that must cause considerable concern to the rest of the world, as it is doing now.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.0/2">I declare my interest as the chairman of the Conservative Friends of Israel, and I wish to say two things, which may take me a little time. First, it has become increasingly clear over the past six months that the middle eastern problem is not Israel. When Osama Bin Laden was killed a few weeks ago, an important article by Robert Fisk appeared in <i>The Independent</i>, in which he made the point that al-Qaeda&#8217;s irrelevance has been shown by the fact that the Arab spring was demanding not more Islamic fundamentalism, but freedoms. It is just as important to note that the Arab spring has not been demanding a change in Palestine, essential though that change is; the Arab spring has been demanding the sort of freedoms&#8212;freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the rule of law&#8212;that are provided and embodied in Israel. My main initial point about Israel is that it is not the middle eastern problem; the autocratic regimes that have been surrounding Israel are the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.0/3">The second issue&#8212;it looks as though I shall have plenty of time to finish within my eight minutes&#8212;is the rapprochement between Hamas and Fatah. I would like to ask what it means. If it means that Hamas and Fatah will be united on the Fatah way of looking at things&#8212;the renunciation of violence, the recognition of Israel, the agreement to maintain and honour previous agreements&#8212;it will be a very good thing indeed. If, however, it means that they will be united on the Hamas view of things, that is entirely different. We know about Hamas. In the last month alone more than 120 rockets have been fired into Israel from Gaza, some with 40 km in range. There have been rockets and mortars, and a guided anti-tank missile hit a school bus in Israel and killed a 16-year-old schoolboy. Terrorism sponsored by, perpetrated by and supported by Hamas has killed more than 500 people in Israel since the beginning of 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.0/4">If the new Hamas-Fatah organisation follows the Fatah line I will be utterly delighted. That would mean that we could negotiate with Hamas again and that Israel would have a useful negotiating partner, because all these things must be achieved by negotiation and cannot be achieved by force or unilateralism. If, however, the new united organisation follows the Hamas line, the reconciliation will be either meaningless or significantly worse. This is not a various shades of grey issue, but a black and white one.</p>

	<p pid="b.100.0/1">It is an honour to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40627" name="David Winnick">the hon. Member for Walsall North (Mr Winnick)</phrase>, who can always be relied on to make a thoughtful contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/2">In 1961, a young man, Abdul-Ghani, left his poverty-stricken village in Punjab, Pakistan, for England. He had heard that the mother country, as England was still known at that time, had plenty of jobs, so he decided to try his luck. Like many young Pakistanis arriving in Britain at that time, Abdul-Ghani planned to stay in England for only a few years&#8212;just long enough to earn enough money to send back to his siblings so that they could have the education that he never had. He also intended to return home because he loved his homeland. He remembered how, at the age of nine, he had been part of the largest population exchange in history, in which more than 15 million Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs had tried to find safety in their newly born nation states. To this day, he will never forget the stench of death and the heart-wrenching human misery that he witnessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/3">In the early 1960s, many young Pakistanis such as Abdul-Ghani still harboured huge hopes for their country. They believed in the vision of Pakistan&#8217;s founding father, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who wanted a democratic, secular, modern state. As the years passed, Abdul-Ghani, who was by then a very proud bus driver in Rochdale, sadly came to realise that he would not be going back to Pakistan because the country was moving backwards. He gave up on his dreams of returning home and decided that he and his future family would be wise to make their permanent home in England. It is because of that decision that I am able to stand before the House and contribute to this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/4">By the 1960s, it was already clear that the ruling bargain in Pakistan had changed. Gone was the dream of a tolerant, democratic and secular nation. In sharp contrast to the situation in neighbouring India, the rules of the game in Pakistan were being set by the Pakistani army. The army allowed the pretence of civilian rule, but everyone knew that it called all the shots. Each year, the army granted itself nearly 25% of the national budget and justified its rule on the grounds that Pakistan needed to confront its real enemy&#8212;India. Despite the very real challenges of widespread poverty and illiteracy, with enlightened leadership Pakistan could have taken the path to greater prosperity. That is not just a dream: many Muslim-majority countries have achieved that, including Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia. Virtually every leader of Pakistan has failed his people, choosing self-interest over the national interest. They have all too often obscured their own incompetence and deceit by blaming every failure on an external, exaggerated threat. In much the same way, many Arab rulers love to blame Israel for all their problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/5">I was saddened but not surprised that bin Laden was found to be living in Pakistan. Let us be clear. He was not just living in Pakistan: he was a stone&#8217;s throw away from the national military academy and just a two-hour drive from Islamabad. I have no doubt that it was just and strategically right for the US to kill bin Laden, and although I do not think that the Pakistani Government were involved in any way or were complicit as a whole, I find it very hard to believe that there were not elements of the Pakistani military intelligence services and some Government officials providing him with safe harbour. To suggest otherwise is frankly laughable. That is why there is no way that Britain&#8217;s relationship with Pakistan can remain the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/6">When the Prime Minister visited Pakistan last year, he was right to say that Pakistan looked &#8220;both ways&#8221; when it came to terrorism. He was also right when he told the House very recently that we cannot afford to turn our back on Pakistan. If we did, the threat to Britain from the emergence of a nuclear-armed failed state in one of the world&#8217;s most volatile regions would be far too great. It is in neither Britain&#8217;s interest nor Pakistan&#8217;s for relations to become more adversarial, but Pakistan&#8217;s strategy of being both a friend and an adversary is no longer tenable. That is why we need to take a harder line on Pakistan and demand a lot more in return for our assistance, aid and friendship. The UK and the US should formally present to Pakistan&#8217;s leaders any information they have about Pakistani complicity in shielding bin Laden and should demand tough and immediate action. We should demand that Pakistan uproots insurgent sanctuaries, shuts down factories that produce bombs that kill our soldiers, and hunts down leading terrorists who are still at large.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/7">We also need to start reducing our dependence on Pakistan. First, the international security assistance force should find an alternative to the supply lines that run through Pakistan to Afghanistan, and we should expand alternative supply routes through Azerbaijan and other countries in central Asia. Secondly, NATO and Afghanistan should reach agreement on a longer-term settlement allowing for a small but lasting military presence in Afghanistan. That capability could be indispensible in preventing some of the worst-case scenarios involving Pakistan and its nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/8">When it comes to helping Pakistan, our No. 1 focus should be on promoting commerce and education, as they are the only tools by which to help ordinary, long-suffering Pakistanis to climb out of poverty. Our message should not be that we are abandoning Pakistan, but that we will help Pakistan fight its true enemies&#8212;ignorance, illiteracy, corrupt elites and religious conflict. Although the killing of bin Laden was an important success, a greater achievement would be to transform UK-Pakistani relations into a true partnership that fights terrorism and helps ordinary Pakistanis.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.103.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="103"  time="020:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0003.htm#11051627000107">
	<p pid="b.103.5/1">I will not give way any more as I have had my allotted injury time, if the House understands what I mean.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.5/2">I want to mention two other topics. I believe that there are double standards at work. The west has intervened in Libya, where there are large amounts of oil and where, under Tony Blair, a deal was done with the Government and arms were sold. They were being sold right up to the point when NATO was preparing to go in there. Interestingly, the arms sales there and in every other country in the region are, yes, planes, missiles and radar systems, but in every case they include anti-personnel equipment for crowd control, to deal with civil disorder and control populations.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.5/3">That is what is now happening in Bahrain, with the support of Saudi Arabia. Other Members have drawn attention to what is going on there. I was with the Bahraini opposition groups in London last week. I first met Bahraini opposition groups at a UN human rights conference in Copenhagen in 1986, when they were complaining about British support for the regime, the suspension of the constitution and the lack of democracy</p>
	<p pid="b.103.5/4">in Bahrain. That has not stopped this country doing a lot of business with Bahrain. It has not stopped arms exports and oil imports from Bahrain. I would like condemnation of the violence of the Bahrain and the Saudi regimes equal to the condemnation of the Libyan regime and, rightly, of the Syrian regime for what it is doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.5/5">My last point concerns Palestine. Yesterday, on the anniversary of Nakba, the day on which the Palestinian people were driven out of what is now the state of Israel to become that vast diaspora, was the occasion for demonstrations outside the Kalandia crossing. Thirteen Palestinians were shot dead. Last year or the year before, Operation Cast Lead over Gaza brought about the deaths of nearly 1,500 people in that bombardment. Routine operations by Israeli forces over Gaza result in deaths. Rocket attacks and suicide attacks also result in deaths.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.5/6">However, there seems almost to be an approval of Israel and its perceptions of its own security needs to the exclusion of all understanding of just how brutal the regime has been towards Palestinians. If someone tries to travel through the west bank and sees the settlements, the settler-only roads, the check points and the abuse that Palestinians receive every day from Israeli border guards, they will understand why people feel so angry. They will see the walls being built, the wells being taken away and the opportunity for economic life being removed. The people in Gaza are living in an open prison and young people are growing up living their lives vicariously through TV and computer screens because they cannot work and they cannot travel&#8212;they cannot do anything. They get very angry. There must be a recognition of the rights and needs of Palestinian people.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.5/7">Likewise, the huge Palestinian diaspora, largely living in refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, but also all over the world, feels very angry. On a visit to Lebanon earlier this year my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40387" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase>, who led the delegation, and I met an old man living in Shatila refugee camp&#8212;hon. Members will remember the Sabra and Shatila massacres in 1982. A man in his mid-80s could remember with absolute precision every tree, house and well of his Palestinian village, which he was driven out of when the state of Israel was established. Is he determined to go back? Yes. Does he think he has a right to go back? Absolutely. Do the people in that camp think they have a right to return? They absolutely do. This anger among Palestinian people is a cause that will go on for a very long time.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.5/8">The result of 1948 might have been seen as a reasonable diplomatic solution to the massive and awful experience that Jewish people experienced before and during the second world war, but the residue of the ill-treatment of the Palestinian people lives on. The state of Palestine needs to be supported and the Palestinian people need to be recognised. If we do not do so, the cause will go on for a very long time. We cannot just sell arms to Israel and pretend that what is happening to the Palestinians is nothing to do with us.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.106.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" speakername="Keith Vaz" colnum="106"  time="020:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0003.htm#11051627000115">
	<p pid="b.106.1/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40283" name="Nicholas Boles">the hon. Member for Grantham and Stamford (Nick Boles)</phrase>, and may I offer the congratulations of the House on his recent civil partnership? I am disappointed that he did not invite me to the event: after all, we share offices in Norman Shaw North and Leicester is not that far from Grantham&#8212;I would have made the journey.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/2">I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40128" name="Sajid Javid">the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Sajid Javid)</phrase> that I am glad, as I think is the whole House, that Abdul Ghani decided to stay in Britain rather than go back to Pakistan. The hon. Gentleman made a forceful and important contribution, and throughout the entire year of his being a Member I am sure his constituents have been extraordinarily proud of his contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/3">I always use opportunities such as this to talk about Yemen, and I make no apology to the House for doing so. I was born in that country and chair the all-party group on Yemen. I always start my contributions to such debates by saying that Yemen is in crisis, but it really is in crisis. There is a deep humanitarian crisis affecting Yemen. Some 40% of the country live on</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/4">under &#163;1.25 a day, one third of its people are unemployed and 7 million literally cannot find anything to eat each day. The situation that led to the uprising has caused the displacement of 330,000 people in the north of the country. As a matter of urgency, therefore, we need to continue the work that was started under the previous Government, through the Friends of Yemen procedure, and to give Yemen the support that it needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/5">I am delighted to see the Secretary of State for International Development here today. I have known him for 35 years, and he is responsible for giving me my first political speech when he presided over the debating society that we both belonged to; he probably regrets it now. In the work that he has done, he has been an outstanding International Development Secretary. I know that there are many countries and that the budget is limited, but it is very important to focus on Yemen, which is one of the poorest countries on earth. It does not have the political capacity to punch above its weight as other countries have done, and it does not have the focus of the international community. That is why it is important that we should give it as much help as we can.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/6">On the political side, tomorrow there will be a mass demonstration in Sana&#8217;a, and the predictions are that even more people will die unless there is restraint on all sides. So far, 170 people have been killed in the uprising. When I spoke in an Adjournment debate on Yemen a few weeks ago, I believed that we were near a solution, and I think that that was the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s view as well. The Gulf Co-operation Council had negotiated an agreement with President Ali Abdullah Saleh that he would stand down in 30 days. That agreement was also adhered to by the opposition. Everyone agreed that there was a process for the resignation of the President, with all the dignity of a person who has occupied that post for 32 years, and that a new Government would take over. This did not happen. It is vital that we provide not only humanitarian relief but political support. I have urged on the Government and the Prime Minister the need to appoint an envoy who will be able to bring all sides together; it could be an EU envoy or someone from the United Nations. After all, we are proposing to do this in other countries. I believe that Yemen is a country that can be saved from civil war if we are able to provide that political support.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.1/7">Why is it in our interests to support Yemen? Why do we want to keep the country as one? The reason is the power that al-Qaeda has in Yemen. A lot of reference has been made to the death of Osama bin Laden, but the head of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Anwar al-Awlaki, is still in Yemen. Though born in the United States, he is of Yemeni descent. According to the Pentagon, he is more dangerous, as a person, than Osama bin Laden was. It is therefore in our interests to ensure that the country remains stable and united, that humanitarian support is given, and that the security situation in that whole area is not infected by the break-up of this impoverished country.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow the hon. Members for Newport West (Paul Flynn) and for Walsall North (Mr Winnick), who is not in the Chamber. I learned tonight that the hon. Member for Walsall North entered the House before I was born, but if the clarity and passion of his speech is anything to go by, he will almost certainly still be here long after I am dead. He spoke about Libya, which I shall speak about, but from a different point of view&#8212; I do not share his outlook.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/2">Since the insurgents began their campaign against Gaddafi some three months ago, they have scored a remarkable victory, in as much as they have built around themselves a tremendous international coalition. Something like 17 countries are contributing to the Libya campaign, and many more provide overflight rights, yet that military capability, which has undoubtedly reduced the opportunity for Gaddafi to strike against civilians with his tanks and heavy weaponry and stopped his using air power against them, has not removed him. While he is still there, he presents a terrible threat to civilians, as he has rather chillingly said. Anybody who calls their people &#8220;rats&#8221; cannot</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/3">&#8220;live in the hearts of millions&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/4">other than as a feared and loathed object.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/5">We have reduced Gaddafi&#8217;s military capability by something like a third, but that means that two thirds of it remains. His ability to strike at the insurgents is greater than their ability to defend themselves. As long as that position obtains, he will go on fighting. There was a striking piece the other day in <i>The New York Times </i>on the hidden workshops of Misrata, which describes the insurgents&#8217; position. Men who a few months ago were welders or electricians now run makeshift military workshops, putting armour plating on pick-ups, cannibalising captured machine guns and building do-it-yourself rocket-propelled grenades. They do not have munitions know-how or the tools with which to do the job. They scrape explosives out of shell canisters to reuse, because they do not have supplies. They have nothing other than what they make themselves or that they capture from Gaddafi.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/6">Is it therefore any wonder that the insurgents&#8217; battle is desperate, bloody and very slow? That is why I am persuaded by my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40340" name="Malcolm Rifkind">the Member for Kensington (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> that we need to move to bring the conflict to a conclusion. If we have a stalemate in Libya, and a failed state, torn in two, with factions fighting one another, we risk a Somalia-type situation. We also risk people in this country becoming tired and bored with a drawn-out campaign. We therefore need to take on board what General Richards, who is a thoughtful man, has said, and acknowledge what the Foreign Secretary has said on intensifying our military, diplomatic and economic campaign to remove Gaddafi from power. A few men in workshops&#8212;a few enterprising rebels&#8212;are not enough to do the job that needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/7">If we cannot, within the bounds of UN Security Council resolution 1973, put boots on the ground&#8212;I agree that we should not do that&#8212;or give military mat&#233;riel directly to the insurgents, it seems to me that we can at least release frozen Libyan assets to the national transitional council. We have effectively recognised it; it has its own defence minister; and Baroness Ashton has set up her EU legation in Benghazi. Hundreds of millions of dinars are locked in this country and should be released to the NTC for it to spend as it wishes, whether on utilities in Benghazi to look after its people or, if it wishes, on the military campaign against Gaddafi.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/8">The balance is already tipping in favour of the insurgents, but it is taking a long time and needs to be tipped more quickly. In Misrata, we have a refugee crisis. There are electricity cuts, and oil, food and medical supplies are running out. We have seen people migrating from Libya, causing friction on the country&#8217;s borders and friction between Italy and France. If we are to raise the siege over these cities, if we are to stem the migration from Libya and if we are to demonstrate to people at home that we can prosecute a compassionate and successful war to a quick conclusion, we need to move to remove Gaddafi, either through allied effort or by giving the Libyans the means to do so themselves. The status quo is not an option.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.114.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40518" speakername="John Glen" colnum="114"  time="021:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0003.htm#11051627000124">
	<p pid="b.114.1/1">Quite possibly; that is my point. Given recent events, I believe that the notion that we can bring the situation in Libya to a neat, precise conclusion by the extension of targets will prove erroneous.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/2">These operations have significant implications for our armed forces. Last week, the Defence Committee, of which I am a member, interviewed the heads of the three services. It was quite clear, when we read between the half-answers and the attempts not to address the issue directly, that all the services are under massive strain. It will be an abdication of responsibility if the Government do not address that point and allocate appropriate resources. I was very concerned to hear that there is to be a review of defence expenditure over the next three months, as we try to squeeze out more resources. Concern was expressed following the strategic defence and security review about putting off decisions on expenditure until future years.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/3">We need to deal with the reality, and a number of scenarios could evolve. We could find ourselves in a perpetual stalemate. Alternatively, we could have a little more humility about the way in which this awful situation could be resolved, and realise that it will not happen very quickly. We must realise that a change in regime achieved by the rising up of internal forces against Gaddafi is hardly likely to happen in just a few weeks or months, given the grip that he has had on his country over so many years. It is necessary for us to maintain the current posture and continue to develop diplomatic pressure and the role of the regional players. Yes, it is messy and uncomfortable, but it is right to hold the line and to continue to strengthen and broaden the base of support. We must continue to show resolve and to provide as much support as possible. It is also clear that going down the route of putting boots on the ground is never going to be acceptable in the current environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/4">We acted on the basis of stopping an evil man from murdering his people. We may find the process since then rather uncomfortable, but it is not one from which we can pull away.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.1/5">Some parallels have been drawn with Syria. There, we have seen numerous efforts taken to impose travel bans, to freeze assets, to provide medical supplies and so forth. There, too, the answer is in diplomacy and securing concessions one by one rather than necessarily threatening military action. The reality is that each country in the region is different, which means we cannot have a one-size-fits-all policy; we need the slow, sober, determined, persistent and measured policy that this Government are undertaking. We need to recognise that we do not have the right or the means to solve this problem overnight.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.117.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40569" speakername="Stephen Gilbert" colnum="117"  time="021:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0003.htm#11051632000135">
	<p pid="b.117.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40289" name="Diane Abbott">the hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase>. I agreed with some of her analysis, although by no means all of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/2">As we meet here tonight, civilians in Libya continue to become victims of a brutal regime that is showing no humanity in its efforts to impose its will on the Libyan people. The contrast between the cowardice of Gaddafi and the courage of his people could not be greater. While he continues to hide behind mercenaries and soak himself in delusional rhetoric in his compound, the vast majority of the Libyan people are standing in hope, in the open, and poorly armed, against him. Like all tyrants, he has lost his grip on reality. He is alone, and lost in his own propaganda.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/3">When I look at the faces of the men and women fighting Gaddafi, I see a yearning for freedom and a grasping for dignity, pride and self-determination. All those are the antithesis of what Gaddafi represents. The only person he is fooling with his insane rhetoric is himself. He is hated by his people, he has lost legitimacy, he is shortly to become a wanted war criminal, and it is now a question of when, not if, he must go.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/4">Against that backdrop, I pay tribute to the men and women of our armed forces who continue to execute the tasks set by the Government with the professionalism that we have come to expect from the best armed forces in the world. I remain in awe of their selfless determination and courage. In putting themselves in harm&#8217;s way to protect innocent people, they are standing up for the very best traditions of our nation, and they should rightly be proud of the work they are doing on behalf of their country.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/5">Unlike the hon. Members for Walsall North (Mr Winnick) and for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn), I remain convinced of the legitimacy of the steps the international community is taking. We could not have stood by and watched Benghazi entered by Gaddafi&#8217;s murderous thugs. We could not have watched from the sidelines and merely grimaced at the slaughter that would inevitably have followed.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/6">I fear that we are witnessing Syria begin the slide into the same violence and bloodshed that we have seen so dramatically in Libya. The United Nations estimates that over the last two months about 700 innocent civilians have been killed and hundreds more detained by the Syrian security services. We have seen their cities shelled by tanks, and troops conduct house-to-house searches to arrest and intimidate protestors. In Syria, as in the early days in Libya, people are standing up unarmed,</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/7">with only an idea to inspire them: the idea of freedom, which we in this country all too often take for granted. The reality is that the only long-term solution for the Syrian regime is one that regains the consent of the Syrian people. Failure to reach out to a political solution will only result in Syria descending into further turmoil and bloodshed. The international community must do all it can to impress that on the Syrian regime.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/8">President al-Assad is at a crossroads. He can either respond to the demands of his people or he can continue his efforts to repress them, but only one course of action will leave his regime with security and legitimacy. If he chooses repression over reform, I believe he will ultimately be swept from power. I therefore welcome the steps the Government have taken to put pressure on the Syrian regime, but I ask the Secretary of State to say in his winding-up speech whether the discussions with the Syrian ambassador touched on rights of access to that country for the foreign media, and what the Syrian representative told him about the national dialogue proposed by that country&#8217;s President.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/9">The events of the last few months in north Africa and across the middle east highlight the urgent need to review our arms export regime, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40609" name="John Stanley">the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> made clear. People across the middle east and north Africa have displayed true courage in standing up against oppressive regimes that have used the most modern equipment and munitions to try to break their will. It is difficult for any of us in this House to stomach the idea that British-made equipment may have been used against these courageous people.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/10">Of course it is right for the UK to play an active part in the international negotiations that have recently started at the United Nations aimed at securing a global arms trade treaty, but we must not lose sight of the choices that we ourselves can make to tighten our export regime. That is why I welcome both the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s review of British arms export controls announced last month and the fact that the Government have revoked more than 150 export licences in recent weeks&#8212;but we can, and we must, go further. We need to tighten controls on both exports and re-exports, and we need to make sure that we put human rights at the heart of our consideration of which countries we should export to. When will the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s arms export review be published, and will it be brought before the House for debate?</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/11">It should now be crystal clear that the long-term interests of this country will always be best found in standing next to the people who seek freedom, and against the regimes that would simply impose their will. This strategic reality needs to be reflected in all corners of our Government and in all parts of the United Kingdom&#8217;s global posture.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.118.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16c.118.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.118.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40075" speakername="Rushanara Ali" colnum="118"  time="021:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0003.htm#11051632000136">
	<p pid="b.118.0/1">Today&#8217;s debate is profoundly important and comes at a critical time. I thank the Secretary of State for providing Government time for it in order to consider the issues facing the people of the middle east, north Africa, Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as our military, political and humanitarian response to the multiple crises in those crucial parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/2">Following the earlier debate on the military covenant, it is right that we pay tribute to the brave servicemen and women who are engaged in protecting civilians in Libya under UN resolution 1973, as well as to our troops in Afghanistan. In particular, I wish to join others in paying tribute to Nigel Dean Mead, from 42 Commando Royal Marines, who was killed in Helmand province yesterday. We remember the continued price paid by innocent people whose lives have been taken in terrorist attacks around the world, most recently in Morocco and, last week, in Pakistan. I also wish to reiterate Labour Members&#8217; grave concern about the killing of protestors by Israeli soldiers on the Syrian-Israeli border and about the injuries of civilians in the Palestinian territories. We join the Foreign Secretary in reaffirming calls for restraint on both sides.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/3">A common theme that has arisen from events in Tunisia and Egypt, and the current situations in Libya and Syria, has been the way in which citizens have responded to the abuse of power by, and the lack of legitimacy in, their Governments. People have taken to the streets in their millions to bring about badly needed change. Few could have imagined just how much a few short months would change the world, as the self-immolation of one man led to a chain of unstoppable events around the Arab world. Tunisia will hold its first elections to a new Assembly in July, Egypt will go to the polls in September, and we are seeing rapid change in a number of other countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/4">However, it is also vital to pay closer attention to the need to tackle global inequality and economic inequality, given the situation in those middle-income countries. Many of the international financial institutions did not foresee what was about to happen in these countries, which did not have significant levels of poverty but did have great inequality. The historical failure of their Governments to deliver political and human rights opportunities, and economic growth, continues to fuel the protests, and this country has a crucial role to play in supporting the people of those countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/5">For many, these events have been a cry for freedom, democracy and transparency after decades of repression and abuse of power by those in positions of authority and responsibility; they have been about the need to be treated with dignity and fairness, and the opportunity to have jobs and decent chances in life. The international community must do everything possible to help realise those aspirations and ensure that the brave people of those countries genuinely have the best chance for a better future.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/6">Excellent speeches have been made by many distinguished right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House, in which they have highlighted their great insight, expertise, conviction and passion for the subject. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> spoke with great passion and expertise about the need to support Yemen, about the threat from terrorism and about the many challenges facing that country, including the need to tackle poverty. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40479" name="Stewart Jackson">The hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase> spoke of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and concerns about Iran&#8217;s nuclear capabilities. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40280" name="Malcolm Bruce">The right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase> spoke of the importance of the EU providing support for the middle east in its pursuit of democracy and human rights. The right hon. Member for Tonbridge</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/7">and Malling (Sir John Stanley) raised concerns about the UK Government&#8217;s export licences for arms to the middle east.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40128" name="Sajid Javid">The hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Sajid Javid)</phrase> spoke with great passion about Britain&#8217;s relationship with Pakistan. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40100" name="Yasmin Qureshi">the Member for Bolton South East (Yasmin Qureshi)</phrase> highlighted the many challenges faced by Pakistan and the loss of thousands of civilian lives in terror attacks, including the one last week. It is vital that we continue to work closely with Pakistan despite the challenges and some of the criticisms. We must recognise, as many have in the House today, the importance of working with Pakistan, maintaining our alliances and ensuring that the terror threat is overcome.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/9">Many Members have spoken with great expertise and passion about the situation in Libya and the middle east and, in particular, their concerns about the UN resolution, which we support, the dangers of scope creep and the parameters within which the resolution is implemented. Clearly, there are great concerns about stalemate, as highlighted by a number of Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40340" name="Malcolm Rifkind">the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40192" name="Richard Ottaway">the hon. Member for Croydon South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/10">Let me turn to a recent tragedy involving migrants. The Government rightly supported the International Organisation for Migration, but I am sure that the Secretary of State for International Development will have been deeply concerned about reports last week that a boat full of migrants, including young children, died after their distress calls were not acted on. Only 11 survived. Will the Government clarify whether British forces intercepted any such distress messages, and say that they will co-operate with any international investigation?</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/11">As has been touched on by many hon. Members, including the hon. Member for Croydon South and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40387" name="Gerald Kaufman">the Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase>, in the light of the recent comments made by the Chief of the Defence Staff about upping the ante, may we also have an assurance that the House will be consulted before any significant change is made to targeting policy in Libya? Given the concerns expressed by Baroness Amos, will the Secretary of State assure us that a thorough assessment will be made of the humanitarian impact if military action is stepped up? In particular, if power, water and fuel cuts are made, as reported in some of the press, there are grave concerns about a humanitarian catastrophe. That contradicts the very reason why we are there: our military action is designed to protect civilians. There are also concerns about access for medical personnel, and we would appreciate an update on whether we are providing additional support to get medical personnel into Libya.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/12">At a meeting today with Michelle Bachelet, the head of UN Women, the shadow Secretary of State for International Development and I discussed the concerns about sexual violence faced by women. May we have an assurance from the Secretary of State that the British Government will ensure that every effort is made to provide security and safety for women in conflict, not just in Libya but in other parts of the world? As was pointed out by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40194" name="Ann Clwyd">the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)</phrase>, drawing on her experiences in Iraq, human rights, particularly those of women, are crucial and are often left out of major discussions and political negotiations on matters of conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/13">Many of my hon. Friends and other hon. Members raised concerns about what is happening in Syria. We, like the Government, denounce the appalling violence that the Government of Syria are using against their own people. We recognise the complexity and difficulty of the situation and we call on the Government to do everything possible to ensure that every pressure is put on the Government of Syria to bring an end to the violence against their people, who are out protesting. Will the Secretary of State for International Development, in his summing up, update the House on his assessment of the situation on Syria&#8217;s borders, and tell us whether large numbers of civilians are starting to leave that country?</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/14">On the situation in the middle east, many right hon. and hon. Members spoke passionately about the situation in Israel and Palestine and the need for a lasting peaceful settlement, with many highlighting the deaths of Palestinians over the weekend and the security concerns of Israel. We heard speeches from both sides of the argument: my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> spoke with great expertise about the plight of the people of Palestine, and others spoke of concerns about the security issues facing the Israeli people. It is clear that we desperately need a lasting settlement in the middle east, and we urge the Government to do everything possible to keep the pressure on the US and on the Israeli and Palestinian Governments to resume negotiations as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/15">I now want to address issues concerning Pakistan and Afghanistan, particularly the political settlement in Afghanistan and the great concern about the exclusion of women from those negotiations. That concern has been raised a number of times in our discussions with politicians in Afghanistan, and we very much hope that the UK Government will do everything possible to make sure that women have a strong voice in the peace process, including in discussions about the role of the Taliban. There are particular fears about the violation of women&#8217;s human rights in Afghanistan, and we must do everything possible to ensure that those rights are not neglected&#8212;not just in Afghanistan but in Libya, Egypt and the many other countries in the middle east that currently face such challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/16">In conclusion, I reiterate how vital it is for the House to debate this important issue and I thank the Foreign Secretary for the opportunity to do so. I hope that in his summing up the Secretary of State for International Development will shed light on the many issues that have been raised by hon. Members on both sides of the House, and that he will address some of the questions that have not yet been answered, particularly about the widening scope of the UN resolution and about the humanitarian situation in Libya and other countries. I also hope that he will ensure that Britain provides the support needed not only to bring an end to the violence in countries such as Libya, but to ensure that the aspirations and hopes of the people who have been out on the streets demonstrating over recent months are realised.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.0/1">This has been an important, timely and wide-ranging debate&#8212;a huge mouthful of a debate with a number of very fine speeches, not least</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/2">from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40075" name="Rushanara Ali">the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Rushanara Ali)</phrase>, who speaks for the Opposition. I will address the issue of Libya at the end of my remarks and I will write to hon. Members if I do not cover the issues that they raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/3">Let me start with a view of the discussion on the middle east. The transition sweeping the middle east is an historic opportunity for the region, as many hon. Members have pointed out. The Government are working to ensure that the international community rises to the challenge in its support for countries that embark on change. It is in our interests to ensure that those transitions succeed, but significant challenges must be addressed before lasting stability can be achieved. In particular, there must be the political and economic reforms that will support sustainable growth and facilitate the transition to a freer, fairer and more inclusive society. Britain is pushing the international institutions to play a leading role in galvanising support for that process, including by meeting the significant financial needs. As the Chairman of the Select Committee on International Development, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40280" name="Malcolm Bruce">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase>, said, the role of the European Union is critical. We are pressing for the restructuring of European neighbourhood funding for the region to ensure that it backs strong commitments to political and economic reform and to make it easier for countries in the region to trade with Europe. We also plan to fund a &#8220;know-how&#8221; facility to provide immediate access to expertise on economic reform. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40632" name="John Spellar">The right hon. Member for Warley (Mr Spellar)</phrase> raised that issue. The facility will be closely linked to the efforts and expertise of the international financial institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/4">As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made clear, the European Union has a huge and critical role to play. The right hon. Member for Warley mentioned my right hon. Friend&#8217;s announcement of the expansion of the Foreign Office footprint, but said that it was not expanding in the middle east. I point out to the right hon. Gentleman that we are already represented in all the countries that we are discussing today, and more widely. The mission to Benghazi is an example of the expansion of the Foreign Office in a timely and sensible way.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40447" name="Roger Gale">the Member for North Thanet (Mr Gale)</phrase> spoke with his usual expertise about Tunisia. He spoke wisely about elections and in particular about the importance of opening markets. The difficult but important subject of the international arms trade was raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40627" name="David Winnick">the hon. Member for Walsall North (Mr Winnick)</phrase> and by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40609" name="John Stanley">the Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase>. I emphasise that there are high British standards for this trade, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40163" name="Martin Horwood">the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> pointed out in an excellent intervention. In the end the answer is for the international community to accept the need for an international arms trade treaty.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/6">On the occupied Palestinian territories, the wave of democratic movements that we are witnessing represents a unique opportunity to take forward the middle east peace process. The violence over the weekend at Israel&#8217;s borders underlines the urgency of making progress. With British support, the Palestinian Authority has developed its institutions to the point where the International Monetary Fund, the UN and the World Bank have recognised them as technically ready for</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/7">statehood. To achieve a two-state solution it is important that this work continues. The recent announcement of a reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah is a step in the right direction if it leads to a Government who reject violence and pursue a negotiated peace&#8212;a point set out eloquently by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/8">We heard disparate but firmly held views across the Chamber this afternoon. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40387" name="Gerald Kaufman">The right hon. Member for Manchester, Gorton (Sir Gerald Kaufman)</phrase> was characteristically forthright, and I thank him for his kind comments about my Department. We heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40283" name="Nicholas Boles">the Member for Grantham and Stamford (Nick Boles)</phrase>, on whose civil partnership the whole House will wish to congratulate him, from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>, who entered the House on the same day as I did and whose views have not changed one jot in the past 24 years, from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40479" name="Stewart Jackson">the Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase> in a fine speech, and from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40289" name="Diane Abbott">the hon. Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase>, who touched on Israel in a wide-ranging speech. Everyone was united in the absolute requirement to make progress and to take advantage of the changed circumstances, which were eloquently described.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.3/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/2">I have even greater concerns about the situation in Syria. The current ongoing human rights abuses and lack of access to humanitarian organisations is particularly worrying. If organisations are to compile an accurate</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/3">picture of need, sustained unhindered humanitarian access is essential. I call on the Syrian Government to allow United Nations humanitarian organisations unfettered access to undertake assessments of the situation across Syria without delay. As the Foreign Secretary made clear, the EU will insist that the violence must stop or additional measures will be taken, and I note that there was strong support across the House for that stance.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40569" name="Stephen Gilbert">the Member for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert)</phrase> mentioned the importance of international press and humanitarian access in Syria, but I can offer nothing for his or anyone else&#8217;s comfort on that point tonight. Finally, with regard to the sensible comments made by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, we are watching the humanitarian situation on the borders with great care. I discussed that matter a few days ago with Jakob Kellenberger, the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/5">Pakistan, which has been mentioned a great deal in the debate, remains a top priority for the Government. It can meet its enormous potential only if it works to stabilise its economy in the short term and to educate and develop opportunities for its rapidly expanding population in the longer term. A stable and prosperous Pakistan that can meet the needs of its people will benefit regional and global stability and security.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/6">Britain will therefore support Pakistan in achieving this end. As the Prime Minister announced last month, our aim is to help Pakistan to get 4 million children into school, out of a population of 17 million who do not go to school. Pakistan could become Britain&#8217;s largest country development programme, but only if we see commitment and progress on reform from its Government, including a fairer approach to taxing its elite.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/7">The people of Pakistan have suffered grievously from terrorism. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made clear, many thousands of civilians have been killed and many more maimed or injured. The right hon. Member for Warley made the same point. Osama bin Laden was no friend to the people of Pakistan; all he brought was a nihilistic message of death and destruction. His death, however, presents an opportunity for a brighter future in Pakistan and the region. Pakistan can make greater strides in its fight against extremism and the way is now clear for the Taliban to make a decisive break from al Qaeda and join the Afghan political process. The choice is theirs. Peace and security can be improved for Afghan and Pakistan civilians on both sides of their border.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/8">To grasp this opportunity, Pakistan needs to make a clean break with the past. There are serious questions to be answered on bin Laden&#8217;s support network in Pakistan, and we welcome Prime Minister Gilani&#8217;s announcement of an investigation into the matter. Nevertheless, it is right that we remain steadfast in our support for Pakistan as its democratically elected Government continue their fight against terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/9">Pakistan matters to us. In an increasingly interconnected world, the UK cannot simply look on from the sidelines. More than 1 million people of Pakistani origin live in this country. We have a long, close and historic relationship with Pakistan. What happens there directly affects us. There is no serious alternative to our continued engagement with Pakistan. Neither the region, nor we, would be safer by leaving a nuclear power that is in danger of</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/10">extremism and instability to its fate, a point my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40128" name="Sajid Javid">the Member for Bromsgrove (Sajid Javid)</phrase> made in an interesting and thoughtful speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/11">Our engagement with Pakistan must therefore be both long term and strategic. Increasing access to high-quality education and developing greater economic opportunities will improve the lives of the Pakistani people and help strengthen resilience to terrorism. A stable and prosperous Pakistan that can meet the needs of its people will not only benefit regional stability and security, but directly benefit our own security.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/12">On Afghanistan, the Chair of the International Development Committee noted that we should not concentrate only on military aspects, important though they are, and I join the whole House in paying tribute to Marine Nigel Mead, who recently lost his life. Although the next four years will be critical, 2015 will not be the end of the story. This is why Britain has made a long-term commitment to Afghanistan. It is unrealistic to expect the Afghan Government to become perfect in such a relatively short time, but they must be strong enough to secure the support of their people and defend themselves. To achieve these objectives, the Department for International Development is focusing on three development aims: supporting stability in insecure areas, stimulating growth and building the capability of the Afghan Government to deliver basic services.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/13">I was able to see for myself the very real impact that aid is having on stability when I recently visited Helmand. British assistance has helped to train more than 2,000 policemen and women, built 12 checkpoints, with 16 more in construction, and laid more than 80 km of roads, giving local farmers the access to markets that they badly need.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/14">At the same time, we are helping people to develop the skills that they need to improve their lives. We are developing plans to provide vocational training for 45,000 people, and that will include funding Turquoise Mountain to equip almost 200 men and women with traditional skills and crafts.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/15">Although there is evidence of progress, the scale of Afghanistan&#8217;s challenge remains considerable, as the recent disgraceful events relating to the Kabul bank have illustrated. We are working closely with the International Monetary Fund and the Government of Afghanistan to address the very serious issues that have arisen. They are undoubtedly a setback, but I can reassure the House that we have wasted no time in taking steps to protect British taxpayers&#8217; money.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/16">On the wider economic front, Afghanistan is making good progress. With British support, it has achieved 20% growth in revenue each year since 2002, and economic growth averaged 9% between 2002 and 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/17">The mining sector will be absolutely critical to future growth. I met Minister Shahrani in March and was encouraged to hear about the reforms that he is making&#8212;reforms that Britain is supporting. He also told me of his success in letting a number of mining concessions, and the details of the 108 contracts on the departmental website are also welcome evidence of its commitment to transparency and accountability.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/18">Decades of conflict have inevitably left Afghanistan&#8217;s civil service ill equipped to do its job. During my visit, I announced funding for the Government-led civilian technical assistance programme, which will provide</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/19">international and regional expertise to support local and national Government as we train the next generation of Afghan civil servants.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/20">On Libya, I pay tribute to the thoughtful and important speeches by my hon. Friends the Members for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher) and for Salisbury (John Glen), and to the interesting contribution from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40424" name="Paul Flynn">the hon. Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn)</phrase>. I wish to address directly one of the points that the right hon. Member for Warley made in his opening remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/21">Britain made two important decisions on humanitarian issues early on in the conflict. First, we gave very strong support to the weight of migrant workers moving across the borders into Tunisia and Egypt, and as a result of that support from Britain and others almost 800,000 migrant workers have crossed those borders and tonight less than 10,000 are caught on them. That help has prevented a logistical crisis turning into a humanitarian emergency.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/22">Our second key decision was to announce that we would finance the rescue of 5,000 poor migrant workers who have been caught out on the portside in Misrata and subject to shelling and other attacks in recent weeks. Britain has been able to lift some 4,000 of them out of Misrata, and the final boat to remove the last 1,000 should go in any day now. The House will be aware that Misrata is no longer in Gaddafi&#8217;s hands but has been completely taken over by the interim transitional national council.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/23">In addition to that, we are also working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Medical Corps to supply medicines, 30 tonnes of which were recently delivered by boat to Misrata, and to support 100,000 internally displaced persons as well as 3,000 walking wounded.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/24">We will shortly deploy a stabilisation response team, including some 10 stabilisation experts and 20 support and protection officials, to join together with the United States, Italy and the European Union. That team will work on infrastructure demands, basic services, justice, security and a political plan, all of which will be necessary following the ceasing of the conflict and as part of an early recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/25">We will of course work closely with the United Nations. When I saw Michelle Bachelet this morning, I had a chance to discuss with her the very matter that the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow raised. All of us believe that the plan that is worked up must be run by the United Nations, owned by the Libyans and supported by the region, the European Union and the international financial institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.3/26">All of us in the Chamber can draw inspiration from the way in which democracy is beginning to flower throughout the middle east. The Arab spring marks a truly historic moment not only for the middle east itself, but for us here in the United Kingdom. Our own peace and prosperity depend on the stability of the region and on the rights and freedoms that it espouses. Yes, there are challenges, and we will rise to them. The international community&#8212;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.129.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40591" speakername="Therese Coffey" colnum="129"  time="022:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0004.htm#11051632000148">
	<p pid="b.129.0/1">My hon. Friend and my hon. and learned Friend are right to recognise that this issue will impact on everyone. If our countrymen are happy to see greater imports, perhaps we will be protected from the price surges, but I believe that given the choice most people in this country would prefer to buy British, so we must do something as a consequence.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/2">As I said, this issue does not affect all farmers or all counties across the country, but it does impact on the bread basket of our fair land. In my constituency, spraying has started early. Irrigation has long been part of the agriculture of Suffolk Coastal, which has a similar climate to north Africa. We have imported technologies from Morocco, Israel and similar places in recognition of the fact that we have one of the driest areas, although I recognise that one of my colleagues believes that his area is drier. This issue is impacting not just on agriculture, but on wildlife. Landguard nature reserve near Felixstowe is facing similar troubles and the lack of water is having an impact on biodiversity.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/3">I will come on to the realities affecting farmers in my part of the world. The people who abstract came together in 1997 to form the East Suffolk Water Abstractors Group. They work with the Environment Agency to abstract correctly and appropriately to balance the needs of different water users. Most people have a quota for the year. Some people have taken a gamble by starting to spray early compared with previous seasons. They are concerned that they might be restricted later in the season. Thus far, the Environment Agency has not shown the flexibility that it did in 2009, when it allowed people to abstract later. I recognise that the Environment Agency has been proactive on this front and is working with farmers and other people to manage the situation. I pay tribute to it, because it is difficult to strike the right balance. However, there is no question but that people in my constituency are worried about the potential lack of water for their crops.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/4">Some people abstract from ground water. Thus far, the aquifers are coping, but there is genuine concern about what will be available later in the summer and in the early autumn without further rainfall. The situation is more worrying for people who abstract from the rivers. This matter has been referred to by other Members who are worried about the impact on biodiversity. I believe that we should be more worried about the impact on food and agriculture. Frankly, other things can be cosmetic and temporary, whereas if farming is wiped out in certain areas of our country, it will greatly disadvantage food security.</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/5">What is the risk to rivers? In my constituency, the Blyth is running very slowly. Other parties, such as the internal drainage boards and the water companies, sometimes help by pumping water out to increase the flow. However, some of the farmers in my constituency are facing the reality that, by the end of next month, they may no longer be able to abstract at all. That is particularly worrying. Will the Minister say what co-ordinated action is being taken by the Environment Agency, internal drainage boards, water companies and farmers to understand how we can ensure that abstraction can continue?</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/6">I recognise that back in 2006, the last time we had a particularly dry summer, there was some voluntary activity that worked very well. People ended up abstracting</p>
	<p pid="b.129.0/7">every other day, and they managed to cope through that summer. I am keen to ensure that there is similar preparation in future.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.130.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16c.130.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-16b.130.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40591" speakername="Therese Coffey" colnum="130"  time="022:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110516/debtext/110516-0004.htm#11051632000150">
	<p pid="b.130.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that correct point. In my view, water is the new oil, and we need to ensure that we are careful with it where we can be. We have already seen cases of commodity prices spiking thanks to demand from the far east, particularly China, and we have felt the consequences. I agree that we need to be able to feed ourselves as best we can and not be subject to unnecessary spikes.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/2">The rural development programme has given some priority to the management of resources such as water. In my constituency, the East of England Development Agency has undertaken some relevant projects. I do not have the details, but I am led to believe that 100,000 cubic metres of new storage facility will be made available in the summer. I would like the Minister to give us an understanding of the influence that he could have in helping the future Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs programme, and the existing programmes that are under the auspices of development agencies, to address the real need that exists. I understand that licences need to be made more flexible so that more water can be harvested in the winter, and that the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 changed the parameters so that those harvesting 10,000 cubic metres took on a significantly greater regulatory burden. What can we do to remove that burden and encourage co-operative reservoirs?</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/3">I will put in a bid for my area. A tiny part of my constituency managed to get in on the Leader programme, and I know that Suffolk is one of the pilot counties for the &#8220;Total Environment&#8221; scheme. I hope that we will be able to move forward after 2013 and allow Suffolk to form more co-operatives, so that funding can be diverted towards water storage. That would be good for farmers, for consumers and for the environment, and I am sure the Minister will put his mind to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/4">I know that the farming community has great confidence in our Minister. He is a Suffolk man who was born in my constituency, and he was a farmer. <i>[Interruption.] </i>He still is a farmer&#8212;I apologise. I was not fully cognisant of that. The industry is looking for flexibility for the Environment Agency and for local farmers and stakeholders, and on that point I am more than confident in handing over to him.</p>
