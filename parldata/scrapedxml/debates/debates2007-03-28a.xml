	<p pid="a.1480.2/1">I could not agree more with my hon. Friend on the last point. One of the puzzles in all this is why Governments in some developing countries have not got the message more loudly about the importance of clean water and sanitation. In my experience, as she says, it is women in villages and elsewhere who are most concerned about that matter, not surprisingly, as they spend most of their day fetching and carrying water. If girls have to do that, one of the consequences is that they cannot go to school. We know the impact that that loss of opportunity has on the lives of girls. I assure my hon. Friend that we will continue to do all the things that she asks for.</p>

	<p pid="a.1480.3/1">I commend the Secretary of State for the work that he is doing on clean water. However, is not it true that the United Nations has 23 agencies dealing with water in one way or another? Would not it be better if there were much more focus among the donor communities and the organisations trying to help in that situation, so that we could really try to tackle the problem and some of the 6,000 children who die every day of diarrhoea would not have to die?</p>

I have a lot of correspondence about water and sanitation, which I greatly welcome. When it comes to public, private or community-led provision, I am interested in investing more of our money in what works to bring clean water to people, and that is where we should put our effort.</p>

	<p pid="a.1481.2/1">Is the Secretary of State aware that Norwayhas withdrawn its funding for the public-private infrastructure advisory facility, because its projects involving water have so often failed and been so widely criticised? How does the Secretary of State scrutinise the use of UK taxpayers' money? If we are unable to do so effectively, is he likely to withdraw British funding from the PPIAF?</p>

	<p pid="a.1481.3/1">The PPIAF is having a real impact, not just in relation to water but in other areas. The one example that I can think of is that it has helped to improve the availability of mobile phones in Afghanistan, which is good for helping the economy there to grow and develop. As I said a moment ago, in the end I am interested in investing money in what works. There are examples of private sector water provision that work and there are spectacular failures. There are examples of public provision that work and there are those that have been spectacular failures. The conclusion that I draw from that is that it does not matter so much whether it is one or the other, we should be putting cash, effort and time into what really makes a difference. I will assess our contribution to the PPIAF on that basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.1481.4/1">Hon. Members have come up with many useful suggestions that will improve the situation and my right hon. Friend understands the issues of water pretty well, but does he agree with Tearfund, which in its report &quot;Making every drop count&quot; states:</p>

	<p pid="a.1482.1/1">I have recently observed in Bangladesh that it is possible to make progress on water and sanitation, with,for example, microcredit schemes, enabling the manufacture of sanitation facilities in small, rural communities. The Secretary of State has admitted that DFID has not performed on the issue and has taken its eye off the ball. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> rightly pointed out, the UN has 23 unco-ordinated agencies working on water and sanitation, and the EU water initiative has been excruciatingly slow and mired in bureaucracy. For the sake of the 2.6 billion people who do not have access to water and sanitation, what steps is DFID taking to improve its performance, international coherence and donor co-ordination to ensure the replication of such schemes across the developing world?</p>

	<p pid="a.1483.4/1">I agree with my hon. Friend that there is much that the Government, through public procurement, can do to send strong signals about the need to use sustainable and legal sources of timber. At central level, the Government have set an example by setting out through the CPET what we want to see happen. We need to work with local authorities to help them see the benefits in that direction, and we need to encourage other Governments across the European Union and across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries to do so,too. Yesterday, I met my Norwegian and Swedish counterparts and we are encouraging them to look at exactly that issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.1486.0/1">The Secretary of State is aware that, over the last year, we on this side of the House have been pressing the Government to set up a truly independent aid evaluation process, so we welcome the answer that he gave just now&mdash;although I hesitate to point out to him that he gave exactly the same answer two months ago. Will the Secretary of State accept that the issue is about not only aid effectiveness, but development effectiveness and demonstrating results and outcomes so that taxpayers can have confidence that their money is being well spent?</p>

	<p pid="a.1486.7/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that response and commend the book to everyone. It is a sad reflection of society that it was just 200 years ago that we had to abolish slavery. However, it is also an indictment of today's society that slavery still exists in all forms, whether that is child slavery or human trafficking. In India, with the Dalit system, we have a situation in which individuals are paid just 80p a day and have to try to survive on that pittance. Does my hon. Friend agree that we will need to do an awful lot more before we can say that slavery has truly been abolished?</p>

	<p pid="a.1490.3/1">No, I am glad that the right hon. Gentleman has raised the issue of rules of engagement, because I think that it is important that we deal with it. First, I should make it absolutely clear that the rules of engagement do allow our forces to take whatever measures are necessary in their own self-defence. However, in my view, it was entirely sensible that those on the spot conducted themselves and behaved in the way that they did. They were coming down off the merchant civilian vessel, having checked it, and they were then surrounded by six Iranian vessels, which were heavily armed. If they had engaged in military combat at that stage, there would undoubtedly have been severe loss of life. I think that they took the right decision and did what was entirely sensible. Of course, we always keep the rules of engagement under constant review to make sure that we are carrying out our functions and protecting our people properly, but my understanding is that those who were out there and patrolling these waters believed that the rules of engagement are right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1490.3/2">It is important that we understand one another additional fact: by the time HMS Cornwall knew that our forces had been detained unlawfully by the Iranians, they were in Iranian waters, and again military engagement would have put a lot of lives at risk. I think that they took the right decision, and it is important that such decisions are left to people on the ground.</p>

As a leading Christian in this place, would my right hon. Friend care to comment on the Pope's view?</p>

	<p pid="a.1496.1/1">Frankly, I would not. I do not think that the Pope needs me as his spokesman, so it is better that he makes his statement and I make mine. I would say that we should be immensely proud of the values represented by the European Union, where we now have a unified Europe, east and west. Without in any way detracting from our firm, independent sovereignty as a nation, I think that the European Union has been good for this country over the past30 years and good for Europe over its lifetime.</p>

	<p pid="a.1498.2/1">Of course, the polls indicate that this is a real fight. People in Scotland will have to make up their minds whether they want the policy that the hon. Gentleman represents, which is separation&mdash;with all the risks that it entails, with tax and spending policies that would mean a &pound;5,000 hit for average households and a 3p local income tax&mdash;or whether they want to continue with what has happened to the Scottish economy and living standards over the last10 years, which has meant Scotland's unemployment being below the UK average for the first time, 200,000 extra jobs and a booming Scottish economy. That is the choice and I look forward to debating with the hon. Gentleman from now until polling day.</p>

	<p pid="a.1499.1/1">I would like to make a statement about the current situation regarding the15 British service personnel detained by Iranian forces on Friday of last week, and say that the Government are doing all they can to ensure that they are released immediately. I should say at once&mdash;I am sure I speak for the whole House&mdash;that our thoughts and prayers at this moment are with all our detained personnel in Iran and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/2">I would like to begin by explaining the facts of what happened last Friday and the actions we have taken since, and to share with the House some of the details about the location of the incident on which the Ministry of Defence briefed this morning. At approximately 0630 GMT on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-23">23 March</phrase>, 15 British naval personnel from HMS Cornwall were engaged in a routine boarding operation of a merchant vessel in Iraqi territorial waters in support of Security Council resolution 1723 and of the Government of Iraq. They were then seized by Iranian naval vessels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/3">HMS Cornwall was conducting routine maritime security operations as part of a multinational force coalition taskforce operating under a United Nations mandate at the request of the Iraqi Government. The taskforce's mission was to protect Iraqi oil terminals and to prevent smuggling. The boarding party had completed a successful inspection of a merchant ship 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi waters when they and their two boats were surrounded by six Iranian vessels and escorted into Iranian territorial waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/4">On hearing this news, I immediately consulted the Prime Minister and the Secretary State for Defence, and asked my permanent under-secretary to summon the Iranian ambassador to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. We set out our three demands to the ambassador: information on the whereabouts of our people; consular access to them; and to be told the arrangements for their immediate release. Cobra met that afternoon, as it has done every day since. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-24">24 March</phrase> my colleague the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Lord Triesman, held a further meeting with the ambassador to repeat our demands. He has had several such meetings since that date.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/5">At that first meeting the Iranian ambassador gave us, on behalf of his Government, the co-ordinates of the site where that Government claimed that our personnel had been detained. They were not, of course, where we believed that the incident took place but we took delivery of them as the statement of events of the Government of Iran. On examination, the co-ordinates supplied by Iran are themselves in Iraqi waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-25">Sunday 25 March</phrase>, I spoke to Minister Mottaki, the Iranian Foreign Minister, as I did again yesterday. In my first conversation, I pointed out that not only did the co-ordinates for the incident as relayed by HMS Cornwall show that the incident took place 1.7 nautical miles inside Iraqi waters, but that the grid co-ordinates for the incidents that the Iranian authorities had provided to our embassy on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-23">Friday 23 March</phrase> and to Lord Triesman on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-24">Saturday 24 March</phrase> also showed that the incident had taken place in Iraqi waters. I suggested to the Iranian Foreign Minister that it appeared that the whole affair might have been a misunderstanding which could be resolved by immediate release.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/7">In Iran, our ambassador, Geoffrey Adams, has met senior Iranian officials on a daily basis to press for immediate answers to our questions. He has left the Iranian authorities in no doubt that there is no justification for the Iranians to have taken the British Navy personnel into custody. He has provided the grid co-ordinates of the incident which clearly showed that our personnel were in Iraqi waters and made it clear that we expect their immediate and safe return. I should tell the House that we have no doubt either about the facts or about the legitimacy of our requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/8">When our ambassador and my colleague Lord Triesman followed up with the Iranian authorities on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-26">Monday 26 March</phrase>, we were provided with new, and&mdash;I quote&mdash;&quot;corrected&quot; grid co-ordinates by the Iranian side, which now showed the incident as having taken place in Iranian waters. As I made clear to Foreign Minister Mottaki when I spoke to him yesterday, we find it impossible to believe, given the seriousness of the incident, that the Iranians could have made such a mistake with the original co-ordinates, which, after all, they gave us over several days.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/9">There has inevitably been much international interest in the situation, particularly given our personnel's role in a multinational force operating under a UN mandate. I have spoken to a number of international partners, including the American Secretary of State Rice, the Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan and the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud. We have also been keeping other key international partners informed, and I am pleased to be able to tell the House that many of them have chosen to lobby the Iranians or to make statements of support. I am particularly grateful to my colleague Hoshyar Zebari, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, who has confirmed publicly that the incident took place in Iraqi waters, and called for the personnel, who are acting in Iraq's interests, to be released.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/10">The Iranians have assured us that all our personnel are being treated well. We will hold them to that commitment and continue to press for immediate release. They have also assured us that there is no linkage between this issue and other issues&mdash;bilateral, regional or international&mdash;which I welcome. However, I regret to say that the Iranian authorities have so far failed to meet any of our demands or to respond to our desire to resolve this issue quickly and quietly through behind-the-scenes diplomacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/11">That is why we have today chosen to respondto parliamentary and public demand for more information about the original incident, and to get on the public record both our and the Iranian accounts, to demonstrate the clarity of our position and the force of the Prime Minister's words on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-25">Sunday 25 March</phrase> when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/12" class="indent">&quot;there is no doubt at all that these people were taken from a boat in Iraqi waters. It is simply not true that they went into Iranian territorial waters, and I hope the Iranian Government understands how fundamental an issue this is for us. We have certainly sent the message back to them very clearly indeed. They should not be under any doubt at all about how seriously we regard this act, which is unjustified and wrong.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/13">The House might also be aware that, even if the Iranian Government mistakenly believed that our vessels had been in Iranian waters, under international law warships have sovereign immunity in the territorial sea of other states. The very most that Iran would have been entitled to do, if it considered that our boats were breaching the rules on innocent passage, would have been to require the ship to leave its territorial waters immediately.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/14">We will continue to pursue vigorously our diplomatic efforts with the Iranians to press for the immediate release of our personnel and equipment. As Members of the House will appreciate, with sensitive issues such as these&mdash;as with the recent Ethiopian case&mdash;getting the balance right between private, but robust, diplomacy and meeting the House's and the public's justified demand for reliable information is a difficult judgment. I am very grateful for the support that the foreign affairs spokesmen of other parties, you, Mr. Speaker, and others in the House have given us over the past few days, and I hope that that will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1499.1/15">As the Prime Minister indicated yesterday, however, we are now in a new phase of diplomatic activity. That is why the Ministry of Defence has today released details of the incident, and why I have concluded that we need to focus all our bilateral efforts during this phase on the resolution of the issue. We will, therefore, be imposing a freeze on all other official bilateral business with Iran until the situation is resolved. We will keep other aspects of our policy towards Iran under close review and continue to proceed carefully. But no one should be in any doubt about the seriousness with which we regard these events.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-28a.1501.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" speakername="William Hague" colnum="1501"  time="012:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/debtext/70328-0004.htm#07032868001348">
	<p pid="a.1501.0/1">I thank the Foreign Secretary for her statement. When she demands the safe and swift return of our Royal Navy personnel, she has the united support of the House. We support the Government in the firm but measured approach that they have adopted so far, as well as the announcement that she has just made about the freezing of other bilateral business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1501.0/2">Clearly the seizure of our personnel was unjustified, and the evidence that the Foreign Secretary and the Ministry of Defence have presented shatters the credibility of any claim that our personnel were operating in Iranian waters. The Government are right to use every diplomatic channel, and to have avoided early escalation of the matter beyond the publication of the evidence and what she has said in her statement. If this turns into a protracted dispute, this country is placed in the strongest moral and legal position by having approached the issue in this way. Is it not vital for Iran to understand that such actions only damage its standing in international opinion? This country's response must be one that increases its international support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1501.0/3">I commend our forces for the difficult and dangerous tasks that they are undertaking in Iraq and its territorial waters, under a clear UN mandate, and in support of the stability of that country. I also welcome the Government's action to keep the families of those involved&mdash;who are very much in our thoughts, as the Foreign Secretary has said&mdash;fully informed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1501.0/4">Can the Foreign Secretary say what justification was given by the Iranian ambassador or Foreign Minister for their failure to provide consular access to our personnel, or to reveal their location? Is it not unacceptable that British officials have not been given access to them? Has she received any indication of when that will finally take place? Have the Government managed to ascertain exactly who is believed to be holding them in custody? In their communications with the Iranian authorities, will the Government make it absolutely clear that any repeat of the mistreatment experienced by the British marines held by Iran in 2004 will be viewed with the utmost seriousness in this country?</p>
	<p pid="a.1501.0/5">The Government will be aware of speculation that some in Iran view the detention of British personnel as an asset that can be traded in for concessions. Have any demands been made by Iran&mdash;the Foreign Secretary did not mention any in her statement&mdash;in relation to their capture?</p>
	<p pid="a.1501.0/6">Can the Foreign Secretary indicate what effect, if any, the incident has had on the ability of British naval forces to continue to operate in Iraqi waters? On the rules of engagement, will she and the Defence Secretary be able to assure the House that any changes requested by those commanding our forces will be granted?</p>
	<p pid="a.1501.0/7">Three years ago, eight British personnel were seized by Iran from the Shatt al-Arab on the grounds that they had violated Iranian waters. Will the Foreign Secretary say what conclusions were drawn from that experience? In particular, was any understanding sought with Iran, or offered by it, about the waters in which British naval forces operate, and about the fact that such operations pose no threat to the Iranian state? Will the Ministry of Defence look again at its configuration of forces in the area, so that the forces undertaking these tasks are fully protected, or better protected, or better able to deter interference with their activities?</p>
	<p pid="a.1501.0/8">We support what the Prime Minister has said about British efforts moving into a different phase. If agreement to release the personnel is not forthcoming in the coming days, will not the correct way to pursue their release be multilateral and through the UN, since Britain is operating under a UN mandate? Will the Government take all necessary steps to ensure that if the situation endures we will have the maximum support from the UN Security Council and the EU, which has very extensive trading and financial links with Iran and our many friends in the region? In that way, the greatest possible degree of international unity can be brought to bear.</p>
	<p pid="a.1501.0/9">Finally, the international effort to convince the Iranian Government to suspend their nuclear programme and return to negotiations passed an important milestone on Saturday, with the agreement of a Security Council resolution widening UN sanctions against Iran. Will the Foreign Secretary assure the House that that separate matter will in no way weaken our resolve, or that of other nations, to enforce those UN sanctions, so that nuclear proliferation in the middle east can be resisted?</p>

	<p pid="a.1504.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman, too, for his co-operation and that of his colleagues. There is no indication of whether this is a one-off event, or of the significance that it might have. We are not aware of any change in the pattern of Iranian behaviour in the Gulf. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">The right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase> asked about the Iran nuclear file. The incident took place close to the vote in the Security Council but, I repeat, the Iranians have told us that they are not making a link between that and any other issue. I assure him and the House that that will make no difference to our determination. Indeed, it is a constant source of astonishment to me that it seems not to dawn on some of the authorities in Iran that behaving in that manner increases rather than diminishes people's concern about how they would behave if they had a nuclear weapon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1504.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" name="Michael Moore">The hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore)</phrase> asked me at what level we were operating. The answer is: at every level we can&mdash;official level and ministerial level. Everywhere where there are levers to pull, we are pulling them. I am delighted to say that we have been offered wholehearted and strong support from our many allies to whom we have spoken. They have all expressed grave concern and been willing to try help in dealing with the Iranians. Indeed, they have done that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1511.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to empower the National Assembly for Wales to make provision about transport opportunities for long-term incapacity benefit claimants who have gained employment; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/3">A couple of weeks ago the Minster for Employment and Welfare Reform came to my constituency to speak at an employment summit. Everyone who attended recognised that the Government, in partnership with the Welsh Assembly Government, had achieved enormous success in reducing unemployment in the south Wales valleys. In Wales as a whole there are now more people in work than ever before.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/4">However, everyone at that meeting also agreed that there was still a lot to do if we are to achieve full employment. The pathways to work programme underlines the fact that the central task is successfully to tackle the issue of economic inactivity. Unfortunately, in the south Wales valleys, because of the legacy of heavy industry, a huge number of people are languishing on incapacity benefit. Those are people who were written off by the Tories when they decimated the coal industry and now this Government have the task of breathing new life once again into communities and individuals who have been ignored for so long. Let me be clear: we are not talking about people who are lazy or workshy, as some of the Tories would have it. These are proud people who have been treated with contempt by consecutive Conservative Governments. Our task today is to work with our people to provide support, encouragement and real opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/5">Nowhere in Britain is the problem of economic inactivity more entrenched than in the area at the heads of the south Wales valleys. Recently, the Bevan Foundation indicated both the scale of the problem and some innovative ways forward. Undoubtedly, one of the problems in helping people off welfare and into work is the topography of the area. From Blaengwynfi in the west to Blaenavon in the east, there are what the writer Gwyn Thomas once called the gulches of south Wales&mdash;deep ravine-like valleys, running from north to south. The problem with such topography is twofold. First, it makes it very difficult for industry to locate, and secondly, it makes it very difficult for people to travel to work, especially if they have to travel east-west rather than north-south.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/6">In one of the Welsh Assembly's Committees that looked at economic inactivity in Wales, the lack of transport was correctly identified as one of the main barriers to work. Transport was also referred to time and time again at the employment summit that I referred to earlier. Only the other day, a constituent explained to me how he was faced with the difficulty of travelling from his home in the village of Graig-y-Rhacca across the Rhymney valley to his place of employment just south of Ystrad Mynach. That is a classic example of how just one individual had difficulty in travelling east-west rather than north-south.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/7">In many valley communities poor public transport is part of the fabric of life. A large number of communities do not have passenger rail links and in many cases buses do not service industrial estates and business parks. Where business parks are serviced, bus timetables rarely reflect shift-working patterns. Owning a car for many people is a practical necessity. Those unable to afford a car are frequently left immobile and isolated. Limited access to personal transport is a labour market barrier often cited by new deal participants.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/8">In the long term, the answer is to improve public transport, and the Welsh Assembly Government, through their newly devolved powers, are working hard on that. In the short term, car ownership or access to cars is the only way to enable many people on benefit to secure employment. Of course we should be concerned about carbon emissions, but this is one of the rare cases where car ownership would have a positive social advantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/9">In that respect, Working Links, a public-private partnership, is engaged in truly path-breaking work. In the valleys of south Wales, Wheels4Work and Wheels2Work are two unique loan schemes that provide cars, commercial vehicles and scooters free of charge to people requiring personal transport to enable them to get work. Today, the two initiatives have some 80 vehicles and have helped over 400 people into employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/10">There is also the question of helping individuals who want to work when they have particular disabilities or conditions. I cite the example of a constituent of mine, Anthony Wilson. Anthony is a young man who suffers from epilepsy. He found a part-time job in the next valley and was supported by Jobcentre Plus, but Jobcentre Plus was unable to help him with his transport costs. Because of his condition he needed a taxi to get to and from work. Working Links was able to provide assistance and 12 months later Anthony Wilson is still in work. Fortunately, in my area we have Working Links, which complements the work of Jobcentre Plus, but it does not have contracts everywhere, so there are gaps that need to be filled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/11">One of the features of the past couple of years has been the increasingly positive partnership between the Department for Work and Pensions and the Welsh Assembly Government. My suggestion is that we need to consider how best to deepen that relationship; the will is there but we need to look into how the relevant legislation and regulations can be modified and fine-tuned to enhance the relationship. We need to consider in particular whether we need enabling legislation to allow the WAG to intervene in DWP programmes to provide more transport opportunities. Under the Government of Wales Act 2006, the National Assembly for Wales has the opportunity to propose legislation that can then be handled speedily by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/12">I hope that due consideration will be given to my proposals. Problems due to transport difficulties are more widespread in the south Wales valleys than in any other part of the country. Devolution is about finding particular solutions to particular problems. This is a problem particular to the south Wales valleys, which is why I propose that consideration be given to the Welsh Assembly's gaining the ability to intervene more proactively in the welfare to work agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/13" class="italic"> Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1511.1/14">Bill ordered to be brought in by Mr. Wayne David, Mr. Don Touhig, Ann Clwyd, Mr. Dai Havard, Nia Griffith, Chris Bryant, Julie Morgan, and Chris Ruane.</p>

	<p pid="a.1515.4/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that there is a disconnect with the public and that it is important for MPs to communicate with their constituents who contact them? I have received a referendum signed by 8,500 of my constituents on Canvey Island against a major accident hazard site that is proposed for the island and which concerns them greatly. The referendum had a massive turnout of68 per cent. of the total voting population of Canvey Island, and 99.5 per cent. of the people voted against the proposed liquefied natural gas plant. That is now going to appeal. I must write to all those people to tell them what happened to their petition and what they must do next to write to the inspector to make sure that their rights are upheld. That is 8,500 people I will have to write to perhaps twice this year. How am I going to be able to do that within the allowances?</p>

	<p pid="a.1516.8/6">of importance to them locally. In better facilitating lines of communication between MPs and the public, it is important that the allowance is set up in a way that means that it does not become a propaganda tool used to entrench the position of incumbents. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase>, the shadow Leader of the House, is concerned about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1516.8/7">While we are on the issue of incumbency, I will just say, because I am sure that we will hear a bit more about this matter&mdash;it is at the heart of any argument between us and the Opposition on this matter&mdash;it is a simple arithmetical fact that, irrespective of party, the Government party will have more incumbents than the Opposition party. However, as the right hon. Lady knows as a member of the Members Estimate Committee, we have worked hard to ensure that the measure is not there to entrench the position of incumbents. In anticipation of her making any partisan point, which I am sure she will not, I would also say that I do not remember concern about incumbency ever passing the lips of any Conservative Member of Parliament when they were sitting on the Government Benches for 18 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1516.8/8">What I do remember in those 18 years is how often we in the Opposition pleaded for more Short money. All our applications for Short money were turned down. So if the right hon. Lady thinks that she is hard done by as a member of the shadow Cabinet, she should have tried being in the shadow Cabinet for the 10 years that I was there, between 1987 and 1997. I record&mdash;I am sure that she will wish to bring this out&mdash;the extraordinary selfless generosity of this Government in not doubling, not trebling, but almost quadrupling the amount of Short money from&pound;1.6 million in 1997 to &pound;6.3 million in 2006.</p>

	<p pid="a.1517.7/1">On the subject of the sums that taxpayers will have to pay, the Leader of the House may remember that when we debated the issue on<phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November</phrase>, I did some arithmetical calculations on the back on an envelope and suggested that</p>

	<p pid="a.1518.0/1">The maximum gross cost is easy, arithmetically, to work out: it is 650 times &pound;10,000. We can all do that sum, can we not? What I was disputing was the idea that people would spend up to the maximum. That is not the case for other allowances. I understand that, in general, other allowances are spent at the level of about 90 per cent.&mdash;I have just had semaphore confirmation of that from the Box. Italso needs to be borne in mind that an estimate&mdash;these are only estimates; time will tell whether they are correct&mdash;has been made of a possible saving of &pound;400,000 in respect of those who currently draw allowances above the &pound;7,000 limit.

	<p pid="a.1520.6/1">We were advised that if we wanted the staff to have effective control, we would have to set the limit at &pound;7,000&mdash;full stop. If the system does not work properly, I am sure that the House will be able to review it in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.6/2">Allow me to give the House further information, which, after communing through the ether, has now arrived&mdash;this shows the power of prayer to those who dispute it. A few hon. Members have been asked to repay costs for pre-paid envelopes to the Serjeant, usually because of a misunderstanding about the rules. The sums are usually small: the cost of a few hundred envelopes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.6/3">I am reminded that I wrote to the SSRB in advance of discussions on the allowance. It gave its blessing and said that it would return to the matter in its evidence when the triennial review is published in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.6/4">This is a relatively short debate, but I have already been speaking for 24 minutes&mdash;I have been taking interventions for 22 minutes and speaking for a couple&mdash;so I will canter through what the allowance is not for and what it is for. It is not for party political advocacy or for Members to undermine the reputation of others. It is not to give incumbents an advantage over challengers. Accordingly, the report states that the allowance would not be used for fundraising, encouraging people to join a party, campaigning for or against a candidate, or advancing arguments to promote a particular political party or organisation. As I have said, the boundaries between parliamentary and party political work can be difficult to draw, but we all understand where they lie. The Department of Finance and Administration and the Fees Office are accustomed to handling the distinction in respect of constituency reports and newsletters, which are sent out by Members on both sides of the House and are a useful initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.6/5">All members of the MEC who have considered the matter know that there are occasions when Members on both sides of the House make mistakes. That is especially a danger in respect of the ever-changing world of websites, in which the rules have not kept pace with developments. The MEC saw evidence of websites of Members of all three major parties that were not in accordance with the current rules. If those websites had been submitted as a hard-copy draft of an annual report, they would never have got past the Department of Finance and Administration. In fact, I do not think that anyone would have had the cheek to put them forward. However, the websites were in place and using public money for purposes other than parliamentary purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.6/6">Websites that are funded from the communications allowance should be used only for parliamentary purposes. To ensure that there is much better control, we have decided to make the rules clear and to say that it will not be acceptable for Members to allow publicly funded web pages to be contained in another domain or website, and vice versa. Members will have a parliamentary website, and they may have separate websites if they wish to fund them from other sources. Parliamentary websites will close down when Parliament is dissolved after a general election is called.</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.6/7">A website must comply with the same rules on the content of material as any other publication, and it must contain on the home page a statement that it is funded from parliamentary allowances. Any links to other sites must make it clear electronically that the reader is leaving the parliamentary-funded website. However, websites are becoming increasingly sophisticated and it is important that the MEC should have asked the DFA to monitor website content so that the MEC can be assured that the allowances are being used for the stated purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1520.6/8">As I have said, we have proposed a level of&pound;10,000 per Member, and we think that that is reasonable. It will go hand in hand with the establishment of a cap on envelopes. Most&mdash;including me&mdash;spend an average of between &pound;4,500 and &pound;5,000. Most Members fall on the normal distribution curve, spending between &pound;2,500 and &pound;7,000, but some were spending considerably more. That will now end. The estimated take-up is about 90 per cent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-28a.1527.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="1527"  time="013:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/debtext/70328-0008.htm#07032868001467">
	<p pid="a.1527.3/1">As I have made clear, the rules are absolutely clear on what can, and cannot, be included in annual reports. Many hon. Members ask the Department of Finance and Administration, as I do myself, to check the text of annual reports to ensure that we do indeed abide by the rules and do not risk going outside them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1527.3/2">I accept that the role of a modern Member of Parliament is very different from that of previous generations of politicians. We are all familiar with the stories of times gone by. Enoch Powell used to compose handwritten letters to constituents in the Library. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> is doing his Enoch Powell impersonation from a sedentary position&mdash;and very good it was too. I remember a story about a former Member who used to read his constituents' letters on the Terrace so that he could drop them into the river. I suppose that that is one way of keeping communication costs down, but I do not imagine that many Members would keep their seats for long by doing so these days.</p>
	<p pid="a.1527.3/3">I accept that the rules need to be adapted to reflect modern circumstances. For example, it is odd that if we receive 50 letters on a particular subject, we are supposed to write 50 different replies to meet the rules about circulars. It is sensible that that should change. If we receive letters about a planning application from10 houses in a small street, we are not allowed to write to the other houses in the street. It is sensible that that should change. As Members, we are increasingly involved with community groups, campaigns and social action projects. It is sensible that we should be permitted to contact them without waiting for them to approach us. There are therefore good reasons for changing the rules on the expenditure of Members' allowances, but there is little justification for increasing Members' budgets. My personal preference is for Members to be given a single budget that would cover office costs, communications and stationery and for them to be free to choose how they spend it within the rules and within the budget. That would get round the rather strange situation that will arise, and to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> referred, in which there will be a limit on the number of prepaid envelopes that can be used by hon. Members. However, they can use other allowances to communicate through the post with their constituents and to buy postage stamps for that purpose. Indeed, they can vire money from their staffing allowance to do so. I think that there is a reason for changing the rules, but I do not think that there is a reason for introducing a new communications allowance, which will enhance the role of incumbents.</p>
	<p pid="a.1527.3/4">May I touch briefly on the motion on the tabling of questions during September? If Parliament does not sit in September, it is absolutely right that Members should have the opportunity to hold Ministers to account. The system for questions and statements last year was a welcome intervention, and I am sure that the House is grateful to the Leader of the House for introducing it. As with last year, this year's motion proposes that Members should table questions for three days for answer on three subsequent days. I see no reason why Members should not be able to table questions throughout the recess, and the Leader of the House should consider that. I hoped that the changes this year would extend last year's opportunities, and I am disappointed that they do not do so. As the party conference season evolves, the need for the House to have such a long recess may disappear. I would not argue that conferences themselves should disappear, although I gather that that happened to the Labour party spring conference this year, but I would certainly argue for a change of approach to them. Conferences are not a chance for a holiday, as some people have viewed them in the past, but an opportunity for healthy political debate. I have long made the case for conferences to be held at weekends and in different locations to enable that to take place.</p>

	<p pid="a.1531.4/1">I agree with much of what the hon. Gentleman is saying. He argues that from time to time, issues arise in Members' constituencies and Members must have the ability to respond. He will know, as he has the figures in front of him, that last year I spent &pound;3,800 on my envelopes, which was slightly less than the average, so I certainly am not a serial abuser of the system. This year I will spend considerably more because of the issue of the LNG plant on Canvey Island. I am grateful to the Government for facilitating the good service that I give to my constituents.</p>

	<p pid="a.1532.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is distinguishing himself in the debate through his contributions. I would go further. We should turn the question round and ask why are focusing on him, or <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Spelthorne or sometimes my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>&mdash;who, I concede, invites attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1532.0/2">I would focus on hon. Members who are happy to draw a &pound;60,000 salary and appear to have a zero against their postage budget head. I am not sure what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1405" name="George Galloway">the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Mr. Galloway)</phrase> is doing on behalf of his constituents. I am not sure what Sinn Fein Members are doing on behalf of their constituents. They seem to be happy to claim every other allowance, but can get through a whole year without writing to a single constituent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1532.0/3">The hon. Member for Castle Point probably will not want to agree with my next point. I have been looking at figures for Members of Parliament who are happy to claim their full salary, are happy to claim the full allowances, but also appear to have a number of outside interests. They are not necessarily giving time to this place. They are not necessarily being conscientious. How can they be, if they are serving three, five, six or, in the case of one hon. Member,18 different paymasters?</p>
	<p pid="a.1532.0/4">Information dug up by a former Member a couple of years ago shows that Members of Parliament with outside interests participate in only 65 per cent. of Divisions, whereas those of us who are full-time MPs, who spend all our allowances on services for our constituents and who are diligent about what we do&mdash;the vast majority of us, in all parts of the House&mdash;participate in 91 per cent. of Divisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1532.0/5">I would take more seriously some of the protestations from Opposition Members if they were prepared to examine the real scandals, such as Members of Parliament moonlighting or drawing salaries and not writing a single letter to their constituents in the course of the year. Perhaps that is what the debate should focus on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1532.0/6">The debate and reports of the Members Estimate Committee were informed by a previous report from the Modernisation Committee to which it was my privilege to contribute. That report, published in June 2004, was entitled &quot;Connecting Parliament with the Public&quot;. The report was informed by a questionnaire that was sent out to all Members of the House of Commons which covered the rules relating to the use of prepaid envelopes and direct mail. What emerged was that as MPs cannot communicate with constituents on matters on which they themselves are statutory consultees, write to their constituents about matters before Parliament, or consult them about the implementation and the effect of legislation on their lives and their communities, it is important to amend the House rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.1532.0/7">The right hon. Member for Maidenhead conceded that the definition of a circular communication was nonsense, and that individual letters to 50 people on the same issue will clearly not happen. We have all been breaking the rules. Let us be honest&mdash;we have all been at it, and I more than most, probably, because it is common sense to do so. It cannot be right that as Members of Parliament we have less ability to engage with our constituents than councillors. Councillors in my constituency and across the country are perfectly within their rights to ask the Member's secretary to mail out, at council tax payers' expense, a survey about a particular issue in their area. We cannot do that because we are not allowed to be proactive. We are restricted to replying to people who have written to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1532.0/8">How have I gone about overcoming that in my constituency? I have got hold of every petition on God's earth. I have made sure that huge numbers of people have come to me. I have been incredibly busy. I have a substantial database. That gives me the ability, within the rules, to mail out on a range of issues to an awful lot of people, but it is a make-work exercise. What I like about the new rules for the communications allowance is that I will have the ability to be proactive in an appropriate manner. How can it be right for all of us as consultees on post office closures not to be ableto communicate that fact through the House of Commons postage system to our electors and communities who may lose a post office? That is a subject on which Opposition Members get extremely aerated, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1532.0/9">I can write to 500 people telling them what I have done on their behalf and taking up their case, but only if they contact me first, yet a local councillor can be proactive about such issues. The right hon. Member for Maidenhead is right to say that we need some changes, but they will require resources because, as the hon. Member for Castle Point observed, proactive constituency work may have a resource implication when issues blow up in the constituency at any given point.</p>

	<p pid="a.1534.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a forceful and powerful speech. However, I suggest that we need not be shy about this. The amount of constituency correspondence and the number of single issue campaigns instigated within our constituencies are inexorably on the increase, and there will inevitably be a cost attached, whatever means we respond to them by. Let me remind him of what I said in evidence this morning, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Maidenhead was unable to hear: despite all the people who e-mail us, we have to be conscious that there are still substantial numbers of people who will continue to write through the pigeon post, and who deserve every bit as timeous a reply as the e-mail enthusiasts. That costs, and we should say so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1534.3/1">I could not agree more. In fact, as a renowned Luddite myself, I take some pleasure in ensuring that I respond, usually on the basis of need but certainly in date order, to Mrs. Miggins with her spidery writing, who is every bit as entitled to my attention as someone&mdash;we all have these people among those we represent, sadly&mdash;who e-mails an hour and a half after their original e-mail, usually at 4 inthe morning, to ask why we have not replied. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i> From Estonia, in the case of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase>. He has a big personal vote there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1534.3/2">The right hon. Member for Maidenhead protested a bit too much with her array of soundbites on what a dreadful day for democracy the approval of this allowance would be. Any abuse of parliamentary facilities is to be regretted, including the abuse of luncheon clubs and dining facilities. I understand that we are to hear more about that in weeks to come, and there could be an awful lot of humble pie eaten on the Conservative Benches.</p>
	<p pid="a.1534.3/3">Some Members of Parliament are very assiduous in their correspondence, and some are not. There is a massive range in the amounts of money spent on postage. Just for the record, last year I came in at &pound;5,500&mdash;well within the average. Some Members made it up to &pound;37,000, while many struggled to make &pound;300 or &pound;400. There is no golden rule as to how we do our job. Different constituencies have different demands, and different issues will bubble up. This set of proposals will limit the activities of some of the high spenders; it is not, as Opposition Members suggest, about mis-spenders. As the hon. Member for Buckingham said, we do not have to be shy about this. People respondto our reaching out, and to good, non-partisan, informative communication. We should welcome our ability to compete on equal terms with those&mdash;sometimes lobby groups, certainly local councillors&mdash;who have more resources at their disposal than we do.</p>

	<p pid="a.1537.1/1">I thank the Leader of the House for introducing this short debate and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">the hon. Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase>, who it is great to see back in the post that he previously occupied. He always did a wonderful job, particularly on pre-recess debates, and it is good that he will have the opportunity to exercise his skills again so soon in his revised career. I am sure it will thrill him.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.1/2">I shall deal with the provisions before us in ascending order of controversy. First is the proposal to appoint Sir Graham Bright as managing trustee of the parliamentary contributory pension fund. I do not believe that any Member will wish to disagree with that. I enter just one caveat; it does not relate toSir Graham. I thought that we had established a little while ago as a matter of protocol&mdash;it has been happening in statutory instruments Committees when dealing with the confirmation of an appointment&mdash;that it is appropriate to circulate to those who will make the decision a curriculum vitae of the individual concerned. We should not assume that everybody knows the person. In this instance, the explanatory notes might have provided a brief resum&eacute; ofSir Graham Bright's career in order to allow Members to take an informed decision. Had that happened, I am sure that they would have come to the view that I and the rest of the House share&mdash;that he will be an admirable member of the pension fund panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.1/3">On Select Committee reports and the period of embargo, I have no problem with changing the rules if that is the wish of Select Committees. I hope, however, that it will not become normal practice to extend the period of embargo, because that runs the risk of Select Committees falling into the same trap that Ministers so often fall into&mdash;of briefing before a report is published to an inappropriate extent. I can envisage circumstances in which a longer period of embargo may be sensible, but I hope that it will not be the norm.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.1/4">On notice of questions, I wholly welcome what has been done to normalise, as it were, the ability to table questions in recess. I am still not reconciled to the long summer recess and I still want to see changes to our political calendar to enable us to sit more regularly and therefore avoid being unable for a quarter of the year to hold the Government to account. However, given that we have what we have, it is right to be able to table questions. I would like to see it extended and I believe that the Leader of the House opened the door to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.1/5">There is a quid pro quo, and I suggest to right hon. and hon. Members that they need to exercise more care about their prolixity in putting down questions. We all know the reality: often it is not Members but their researchers who think up jolly good questions in abundance. I am not sure that having so many questions and so few answers of any profundity necessarily improves understanding of what the Government are doing. Perhaps an element of self-denying ordinance might be helpful.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-28a.1538.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="1538"  time="014:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/debtext/70328-0010.htm#07032868001504">
	<p pid="a.1538.1/1">I am sure that there are, but I am wary of suggesting that that should be the case because there are sometimes very good reasons why a number of questions need to be tabled. What I am really appealing to is the good sense of Members to realise that there are limits in tabling questions, but nevertheless to welcome the opportunity to table them. Of course, when one was required to put down a question by going to the Table Office with one's hand-scrawled note and signature at the bottom, that was itself a limiting factor, which we have now moved away from.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.1/2">I want to move on to the contentious issue of the communications allowance. I believe that Members on both sides of the House will have a free vote on the motion, as we always do on House matters, and I have had no indication of how my right hon. and hon. Friends intend to vote. We have to be extremely careful when we are seen by those outside to be awarding ourselves yet another allowance of substantial size without any clear indication of how it is to be spent, or of how it will be of advantage to our constituents rather than to us as incumbents in parliamentary seats.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1700" name="Theresa May">The right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> mentioned that the imbalance between the cost of providing office space in different constituencies was not reflected in the present allowance structure. That needs to be addressed, as it curtails the amount of money available to somehon. Members in pursuing their constituency or parliamentary work, simply because so much of their budget is pre-empted by office accommodation costs that they cannot avoid.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.1/4">The proposed communications allowance represents a significant sum of money. The last time we discussed the matter, my hon. Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire was absolutely right to mention the amount of &pound;6 million; as we have heard, the Leader of the House pooh-poohed her suggestion that it would be anything like that amount. My hon. Friend has repeated today that it is to be &pound;6 million, and the Leader of the House has invited us to do some elementary arithmetic, apparently without having noticed that &pound;6 million is the discounted figure. It is the figure associated with the normal take-up of allowances and is therefore the figure that the taxpayer is likely to have to stump up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.1/5">The rules&mdash;and how they are applied&mdash;are key to many people's view of how the money is to be spent. There is a nagging suspicion among many of us that the proposal is partly a reaction to the massive overspend on postage by certain Members. I have yet to hear a satisfactory explanation of how some of the figures mentioned in relation to the spending on postage by individual Members can possibly be reconciled with the present rules. Obviously it must be possible; otherwise, the Fees Office and the Serjeant at Arms would have investigated, and there would have been consequences. I find it difficult to understand, however.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.1/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1774" name="Martin Salter">The hon. Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter)</phrase> argued persuasively for better communication with our constituents. He clearly uses the rules in order to provide such communication, and he revealed that his postage costs were about &pound;5,500. If he can give the kind of service that he described for that figure, it is hard to understand how a multiple of six or seven times that amount can still be within the rules. I am not accusing any hon. Members of abusing the rules. I am simply saying that I cannot understand how such amounts can be reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.1538.1/7">While we are talking about the rules, I want to say clearly to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" name="Stewart Jackson">the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson)</phrase>&mdash;who has scuttled from the Chamber because he knew that I was going to bring this matter up&mdash;that I found his intervention on the hon. Member for Reading, West offensive in the extreme. The clear implication of what he said was that the Liberal Democrats were sending out surveys on voting intentions at the taxpayer's expense, but I know of no instances of that being done. It would be against the rules, and there would have been complaints if it had been done&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1543.1/1">No, because we have nearly reached the time limit for the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.1/2">I want to draw attention to one thing that is allowed, and one thing that is not allowed. According to paragraph 12 of the report, hon. Members will be able to use the communications allowance to meet thecost of &quot;questionnaires and surveys&quot;. According to paragraph 14, however, the allowance cannot be used to meet the cost of petitions, surveys or questionnaires if they are</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.1/3" class="indent">&quot;associated principally with national campaigning or local elections.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.1/4">It is naive to a high degree to believe that the questionnaires and surveys issued will not somehow tie in with national campaigning issues for every Member who uses the money to meet that cost. If a party is running a massive campaign on health service cuts, for example, a survey that may relate to local health service provision will nevertheless tie in with that. If we are to allow that sort of material, which is questionable, let us openly accept that within a national campaigning profile its use will be ambiguous.</p>
	<p pid="a.1543.1/5">Lastly, some Labour Members have suggested that any Member who votes against the allowance this evening&mdash;because they are not satisfied with the details or even the principle of it&mdash;would be hypocritical if they subsequently used any of it. That is simply nonsense, and a misreading of what the House is for. We take decisions, express our opinions and vote. Once the matter has been voted on, however, individual Members, whether they thought a proposal was a good idea or not, have a duty to their constituents to use the funds available. <i> [Laughter.] </i>I make the point in all seriousness. I might disagree with a lot of provisions. I sometimes vote against them and do not, if they would be to my personal advantage, take them. For instance, I voted against the pension enhancement, and refused to take it. I know that many Members voted against it and still took it. This issue, however, does not relate to my or any other Member's personal position, but to the service that will be provided to constituents. Therefore, I hope that accusations of hypocrisy will not be made against hon. Members who choose to vote against the proposal today.</p>

	<p pid="a.1544.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, and I shall refer to some of the points that he made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/2">I can tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> that some of us will have to claim under the communications allowance for activities that we are undertaking at present and which are paid for by the incidental expenses provision. Without wishing to spend any more money, we will have to claim under the communications allowance, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman accepts that there is no implication of hypocrisy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/3">I join in the chorus of approval welcoming back <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr. Tipping)</phrase>. At a time of preservation, conservation and recycling, it is marvellous to see him back in the post that he occupied in the 1997-2001 Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/4">We debate these allowances for ourselves after spending four days debating the Budget, which involved very tough decisions on public expenditure for some important public services, including education and the Home Office. People outside the House will want us to make a very good case for increased public expenditure on our services, given the background of the Budget debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/5">When he introduced the debate, the Leader of the House used the argument about disconnect to support the communication allowance. That argument can be stood on its head: we could argue perfectly well that it is our voting for more money for ourselves in this way that adds to, rather than solves, the problem of disconnect. One of the jobs of the House is to examine claims for increased expenditure. We are sent here to see how money extracted from constituents is spent. When we are the conduit for that increased expenditure, we need to be even more vigilant and demand an even higher standard of proof.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/6">The motion before us is the next stage in a debate that began on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November</phrase>, in which a number of those present today took part. When we considered the matter then, it was on a motion from the Leader of the House, and no document had been brought forward. The idea had not been examined by any Select Committee or by the independent outside body charged with determining our allowances. The SSRB is, at this very moment, looking at our salaries and allowances. In a passing reference in the previous debate, the Leader of the House said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/7" class="indent">&quot;I have also kept the Senior Salaries Review Body in touch with what is proposed.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-11-01.312"><i> Official Report</i>, 1 November 2006; Vol. 451, c. 312</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/8">With the greatest respect to the right hon. Gentleman, that is precisely the wrong way round: the SSRB ought to be keeping him in touch with what is proposed. What is the purpose of having an independent body to make recommendations about our allowances if&mdash;unilaterally, and before its report is published&mdash;we help ourselves to higher allowances? When I intervened on him, the Leader of the House said that the proposed allowance is a new one. That is true, but a lot of the activity that it subsumes is catered for already.The right hon. Gentleman would have been on much better ground if we had waited for the SSRB's recommendations and come forward with a much more robust case than the one that he presented this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/9">There is another reason why I believe it injudicious to proceed at this moment. As various hon. Members have noted, a fortnight ago Sir Haydn Phillips published his recommendations on party funding, with no agreement having been reached between the parties. There are a number of outstanding issues, one of which is a proposal for a new cap&mdash;one that does not exist at present&mdash;on what can be spent locally by a political party. That is of particular relevance where that local party is challenging an incumbent, and I quote what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1856" name="Chris Mullin">the hon. Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin)</phrase> said in our earlier debate:</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Were I a candidate for Parliament running against an incumbent who was using public funds to publish and distribute what looks to most people like campaign literature, I would be mightily upset.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-11-01.350"><i> Official Report</i>, 1 November 2006; Vol. 451,c. 350</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/11">At the very moment that the Government are seeking consensus with the Opposition parties on a new limit on what a prospective candidate can spend, they are also proposing to increase what the incumbent can spend without having to raise the money. The Leader of the House must realise that what is being proposed today will make it more difficult to secure the consensus on party funding that I know he wants.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/12">I shall be brief, as I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> wants to contribute to the date. On a more positive note, I welcome the decision to cap the value of pre-paid envelopes and other stationery. With an average spend of &pound;3,500, &pound;7,000 leaves a substantial amount of head room for the majority of MPs. I hope that we can stick at that level for some time. I assume that, as the cost of postage rises, the number of free envelopes to which we are entitled will fall.</p>
	<p pid="a.1544.0/13">We are told in paragraph 12 of the motion that detailed rules will follow in a new, separate and comprehensive booklet, and I welcome that. At the moment, the advice is all over the place&mdash;in the stationery catalogue, in the Green Book, in leaflets and guidance notes issued by the Serjeant at Arms Department and on that Department's intranet site. I welcome the prospect of one, comprehensive publication telling us exactly what we can and cannot do.</p>

	<p pid="a.1546.0/1">I appreciate the fact that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> kept his remarks brief. I believe that someone else wishes to speak so I, too, will try to be brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/2">As a Member of Parliament, I believe that communication is incredibly important. As a former marketing manager, perhaps I know more than many the benefits of good communication. Those of us who oppose the allowance do not say that ensuring that we are in touch with our constituents, reporting back and making sure that people in our constituencies are engaged in politics are not important parts of a Member of Parliament's job. Far from it. My problem is the cost that the taxpayer will incur. Through interventions, I have already expressed my disappointment that the communications allowance will cost an extra &pound;6 million, with a perhaps an additional &pound;1 million in increased postage costs. That means that the taxpayer must bear the brunt of an additional &pound;7 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/3">Good communication with constituents does not always have to be costly. We spoke earlier about technology and leaps forward through e-mail communication and websites, which are an especially cost-effective way of keeping in touch with people. The communications allowance can be used for websites, but my website, for which I personally pay, costs only about &pound;15 a month. Basic technology hardly costs a huge amount these days.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/4">Of course, local visits, which Members of Parliament often make on Fridays and the weekends are a way of communicating face to face with constituents. Dare I say it?&mdash;going back to the good old days of knocking on doors to communicate directly with individuals is perhaps one of the most potent ways of engaging people in politics. There is a role for leaflets, too. As a Liberal Democrat, I would say that. I have spent many a happy hour delivering leaflets and I shall do much more of that in the next few weeks. I enjoy doing it&mdash;it is good exercise. However, I would argue that political parties have an important role to play in funding political leaflets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/5">Many of us send out an annual report funded from our parliamentary expenses. However, it is not rightto increase the money by &pound;10,000 when adequate provision is already made in our incidental expenses provision. We do not need to increase that further. We should consider the cases of Members who have problems with their office rent costs, which means that they cannot use their current expenses for incidental provision, but a total blanket increase of &pound;7 million, even for those who do not suffer the problem, is excessive. We do not need that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/6">Let us consider timing. The report suggests that there is a good case for combining the communications allowance with the allocation for pre-paid stationery in one allowance. However, it also states that although that appears attractive in the long term, the financial and administrative difficulties would delay unduly the introduction of the communications allowance. What is the rush? The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire mentioned the SSRB review. Why could we not let it reach a conclusion about the matter? Why do we need to rush the matter through? Some hon. Members may suggest that a forthcoming general election is a factor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1546.0/7">I urge hon. Members to oppose the allowance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1554.0/1">My hon. Friend has made that point several times. Let me make it clear that Professor Crow was asked to consider the applicant local authorities in the context of three tests on social impact, the capacity for regeneration and the willingness of the local authority to license. Hon. Members will be aware that we made specific provision in the Gambling Act for local authorities that did not wish to have any casinos&mdash;this is rather at variance with the belief that casinos are being foisted on an unwilling public who do not want them&mdash;to apply a blanket ban. During the process, several local authorities opted to take that course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1554.0/2">My hon. Friend has given this matter an enormous amount of thought on behalf of his constituents. The matter before the House and Ministers is one of judgment, given Professor Crow's report, the report of the Merits Committee and the objectives of the legislation. However, he should be in absolutely no doubt that the overriding concern of Ministers when reaching conclusions is the capacity of authorities to conduct a proper test of social impact and thus express the public-protection objectives of the Act.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-28a.1555.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1555" speakername="Tessa Jowell" colnum="1555"  time="015:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/debtext/70328-0012.htm#07032868002019">
	<p pid="a.1555.1/1">The hon. Gentleman and I had full exchanges on precisely that point at the Select Committee, where I made clear, beyond any doubt, the approach I would take. I have sought throughout the process of this controversial legislation to be clear and consistent at each stage. As I have explained to the House, I have sought to do the same on this decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.1/2">Much has been made of the Merits Committee report in the other place, which expressed reservations on two grounds&mdash;on how the panel interpreted its remit and on the issue of destination casinos. Both points have been raised by my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, South and for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood. I have placed on record and in response to the Committee my view that its concerns were misplaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.1/3">The primary consideration that we set for the casino advisory panel in making its assessment was to identify locations that would provide the best possible test of social impact. We did not ask the panel to identify a location that would reduce problem gambling as such, because our wider policy is the legislation itself, and it is the responsibility of the Gambling Commission to implement the most rigorous regulation to ensure that problem gambling is anticipated, acted on and contained.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.1/4">The Merits Committee also reflected a claim made by some that it is perverse to locate the regional casino in deprived, residential east Manchester. East Manchester is deprived. On the basis of official figures, it actually ranks as more deprived than Blackpool. One of the panel's considerations was to identify areas in need of regeneration, so it is not surprising that some of the candidate areas are very deprived. The panel's job, however, was to recommend a local authority area rather than a specific site, and it is possible to locate a regional casino in east Manchester without putting it in the very poorest residential area. After all, that will be what the local planning system is for. The same would apply to Blackpool or anywhere else. Blackpool's own bid placed the casino in the town centre, next to what I understand is judged to be a deprived ward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.1/5">Let me move on to the questions that have been raised about destination casinos. The argument is that the panel has failed because it did not recommend a seaside resort to host the regional casino and has ignored the Joint Scrutiny Committee's recommendations. That is to misunderstand the concept of a destination resort. Manchester is in its own right a significant tourist destination. Apart from 2002, when it came fourth, in each of the years between 2001 and 2005&mdash;the figures bear this out&mdash;Manchester was the third most important overseas tourist destination in the UK, behind London and Edinburgh.</p>
	<p pid="a.1555.1/6">Such a view also fails to reflect the Joint Committee's intentions. The Committee expected regional casinosto be large-scale entertainment complexes offering gambling alongside a wide range of non-gambling facilities. Anyone who has been to Manchester in the past 10 years can see that the city is at least as compatible with the concept of a leisure destination casino as anywhere else. <i> [</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.1556.1/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.1556.1/2">On the evidence, the panel concluded that Manchester offered a</p>
	<p pid="a.1556.1/3" class="indent">&quot;good test of social impact&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1556.1/4">for a regional casino. That was the judgment of some of the most eminent planning experts in the country, and that is why I have put forward Manchester in the order that we are debating.</p>
	<p pid="a.1556.1/5">I know that whatever the outcome of today's debate, and the debate taking place in another place, hon. Members will continue to fight Blackpool's corner, and rightly so. I know that my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, South and for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood and other hon. Members will welcome what my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has today announced&mdash;a fully fledged regeneration task force to review the totality of economic, social and environmental development plans in the Blackpool area and to make recommendations on the way forward. That is a very constructive and practical response; it is a response to the persistent advocacy of my hon. Friends, and a proper response for this Government to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.1556.1/6">Looking to the future, the Government intend to accept the amendment tabled in another place by my noble Friend Baroness Golding, calling for the creation of a fresh Joint Committee of both Houses to look at the casino advisory panel to see what lessons can be learned&mdash;<i> [Interruption.]</i> Hon. Members might like to wait so that they can understand the nature of the proposition. However, in addition to giving Members of both Houses an opportunity retrospectively to examine the panel process, while recognising that the creation of the Joint Committee and its terms of reference are a matter for the House authorities, let me state now that the Government would like the remit of any Joint Committee to be forward looking and not just retrospective.</p>
	<p pid="a.1556.1/7">I have been very clear with the House, and I repeat now, that there will be no more new casinos in the current Parliament, because the results of the social impact studies of the current 17 pilot casinos and of the next prevalence study will not be available until 2010. Proposals for more new casinos will therefore not be initiated by this Government. As I have said before&mdash;I reiterate it today&mdash;the impetus for such proposals would have to come from Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.1557.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will have plenty of opportunity to address the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.1/2">At the moment, there is no consensus on allowing any more new casinos, and there may never be such a consensus, but it is only right that the Joint Committee to which I referred should be allowed to examine the criteria and the conditions that could govern any possible future decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.1/3">If the Joint Committee decided that a future Parliament might allow another regional casino, and if it recommended a specific location, I doubt that many hon. Members would be surprised if the place recommended was Blackpool. I hope that the Joint Committee will produce its first report within six months. I can assure the House that, with the agreement of my right hon. Friends the Chief Whips in both Houses, the Government would then make time available in both Chambers for any report from the Joint Committee to be debated. I know that that does not give the supporters of Blackpool an immediate gain or the reassurance that they wish for, but they will continue to have every opportunity to make their case in Parliament, and to work with the regeneration taskforce, which will engage in its work shortly after today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.1/4">The House must decide today whether it wants to accept, and support the consequences of, a policy that it voted for in 2005, and that the Opposition accepted at that time, and even welcomed. The policy recognised that in the new world, millions of people want to gamble and have increasing opportunities to do so, but that the role of government is to ensure a high and rigorous level of protection. I remind the House of the many thousands of new jobs and the millions of pounds of investment that may be put at risk across the country if the order is not approved. Our policy recognises the inalienable role of the Government in protecting the public, and specifically the vulnerable and children, but it also responds to calls from local authorities to bring forward a limited number of casinos for the regeneration and leisure investment that they will bring.</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.1/5">On the debate that will follow my speech, when hon. Members consider how to vote tonight and think about voting with the Opposition, I want them to ask themselves two questions. First, are they really prepared to be associated with an Opposition who are so unprincipled and inconsistent? Who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.1/6" class="indent">&quot;I add my congratulations to Manchester on its success in securing the proposed regional casino.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-01-30.89"><i> Official Report</i>,30 January 2007; Vol. 456, c. 89</phrase>.]?</p>
	<p pid="a.1557.1/7">It was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase>. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1868" name="George Osborne">The hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Osborne)</phrase>, who seems to have disappeared, said that he was delighted that Manchester won the competition. Secondly, I would ask Members whether they really are prepared to throw away the chance of seeing regeneration benefits for 17 local authorities across the country. I hope that, having considered those two questions, they will join me in commending the order to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1558.2/1">Not yet. The Secretary of State needs to clarify matters at the outset of the debate; that is absolutely crucial to the debate. It is crucial, too, I suspect, to the way in which many people will vote at the end of what the Order Paper says is a debate, although she is not encouraging debate, because she did not allow people to intervene on her.</p>

	<p pid="a.1558.4/1">No, I will take my lead from the Secretary of State. If the hon. Gentleman will just allow me to complete a paragraph, I will give way to him in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1558.4/2">Will the right hon. Lady say whether the Joint Scrutiny Committee can scrutinise the decision that we have been asked to support? If, given the remit that she outlined, the Committee concludes that it was a mistake, or that there was something wrong with the process of awarding the licence to Manchester and that perhaps it should go elsewhere, will its recommendations carry any weight at all? Can the Committee recommend the withdrawal of the licence from Manchester if we vote for the order this evening? Will she confirm that she will not issue the Manchester licence unless and until the Joint Scrutiny Committee agrees to it? If she cannot do that, the Committee, as she outlined it, is nothing more than an exercise to get her out of a hole, and it will not do any of the things that we would expect such a Committee to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1558.4/3">The Secretary of State is right to say that there has been much recent discussion about those casinos, and about gambling in general&mdash;and not just by Members of Parliament. In the past week alone, we have heard the strong reservations of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who warned of the impact on</p>
	<p pid="a.1558.4/4" class="indent">&quot;the youngest, the poorest and the most vulnerable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1558.4/5">Those are the very people whom the Government's Gambling Act 2005 is supposed to protect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1558.4/6">The Secretary of State was understandably brief at the outset of her statement, but it is important to remind the House of why we are here today. My party agreed, largely thanks to the efforts of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase>, to a pilot scheme of one regional casino, and eight large and eight small casinos. We reached that position after the right hon. Lady initially proposed an unlimited number of regional casinos. Our top priority throughout the passage of the Act, and ever since, has been to minimise problem gambling, and we have been entirely consistent in that aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.1558.4/7">The Government always say that the Act is about protecting the vulnerable, yet they are pushing the order through without adequate scrutiny of the risks of problem gambling associated with siting the regional casino in a city centre. The casino advisory panelhas made a recommendation to Parliament, which Parliament is free to accept or reject after debate. That is why we are here.</p>

	<p pid="a.1559.3/1">I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I have quite a long speech to make. He can intervene, but if he will allow me to make progress, he may find that I will answer some of his questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/2">The right hon. Lady claims that the future of all17 casinos is at risk if the order is defeated this afternoon. That is clearly not the case. Let me remind the House that we need not be considering one order this afternoon. We offered the Secretary of State the opportunity to put forward one order covering the16 large and small casinos, which we would support. She rejected that offer. Her approach remains &quot;all or nothing&quot;, and it is designed solely to put pressure on her Back Benchers and to steamroller the decision through without proper scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/3">Let me make it clear to the House that no Member who votes against the order today need worry that those 16 large and small casinos are under threat, regardless of the scare stories that the right hon. Lady is putting around. If she re-tabled the order with just the 16 locations, we would support it. We are voting against the order, but it is not a vote against the casino advisory panel or a vote against Manchester. It is a vote for further parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/4">I turn to the substance of the matter before us&mdash;whether the Opposition are willing to accept the casino advisory panel's recommendation to site the regional casino in Manchester. The right hon. Lady referred to the congratulations that my colleagues and I offered to Manchester and the 16 other locations in the hours after the advisory panel made its announcement. Those congratulations were genuine. We had no intrinsic opposition to Manchester or any other individual location, but given the surprise choice of Manchester&mdash;the right hon. Lady conceded that even for her, it was a surprise choice, not least, I suspect, as it had risen from the bottom of the casino advisory panel's ranking table to the top&mdash;it is right for us to have used the time since then to look in greater detail at the report and to listen to the concerns that are now in the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/5">The right hon. Lady will also remember that in the same statement I said that we intended to</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/6" class="indent">&quot;hold the Government to account on the many promises they have given to protect the most vulnerable and those most at risk from their legislation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1559.3/7">That is the right approach, and it is exactly what we seek to do today.</p>

One hopes that the regenerative benefits will be as envisaged, although there are all kinds of reports, such as the Hall Aitkin report and another report from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, which suggest that the regenerative benefits of the regional casinos are not all they are cracked up to be. If the hon.

	<p pid="a.1561.2/1">I must make some progress. I have given way far more&mdash;in fact, 100 per cent. more&mdash;than the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.2/2">The Secretary of State has tried to turn this into an issue of party politics, yet she cannot deny that a clear coalition of concern has emerged in both Houses and across all parties in the weeks since the casino advisory panel published its report. Before the strong arm of the Government Whips swung into action, 83 of her Back-Bench colleagues signed an early-day motion questioning the panel's decision and calling for the Joint Committee that scrutinised the draft Gambling Bill to be reconstituted. That is the clearest evidence that there can be of the concern that exists on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.2/3">Were that not enough to make the Secretary of State think again, last week the House of Lords Merits Committee raised some crucial questions. It stated that the order might</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.2/4" class="indent">&quot;imperfectly achieve its policy objective&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.2/5">One of the three core objectives of the GamblingAct 2005 is</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.2/6" class="indent">&quot;protecting children and other vulnerable persons from being harmed or exploited by gambling&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.2/7">Yet the Committee found that the casino advisory panel's interpretation of its criteria</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.2/8" class="indent">&quot;did not give high priority to the prevention of harmful effects to the community from gambling&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.2/9">It said that the panel</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.2/10" class="indent">&quot;veered towards their terms of reference with their emphasis on the research testing of impacts rather than the minimisation of harm&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.2/11">The Joint Committee, under the chairmanship of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase>, who is in his place, concluded that regional casinos should be located in a resort destination rather than in a city centre where there is greater risk of &quot;ambient&quot;, or casual, gambling from people living nearby.</p>

	<p pid="a.1562.1/1">I must make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.1/2">Not only was that the view of the Committee, but it was backed by the study of international research which was commissioned by the casino advisory panel, but which for some reason</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.1/3" class="indent">&quot;was not used in the Panel's selection process&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.1/4">according to the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. The Secretary of State will remember that one of her former Ministers, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, formerly the Minister with responsibility for gambling, told the Joint Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.1/5" class="indent">&quot;we have taken the view that in what I call destination gambling&mdash;in other words where you have to make a positive decision to go into a location where gambling takes place&quot;&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-28a.1562.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" speakername="Hugo Swire" colnum="1562"  time="016:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/debtext/70328-0013.htm#07032868002043">
	<p pid="a.1562.4/1">Not only that, but it is not a very good point, because I happen to know that although the casino is destined to go to east Manchester, under the legislation it is within Manchester's rights to relocate it anywhere within the area, as the Minister for Sport confirmed to the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. I can happily refer hon. Members to the relevant <i> Hansard</i>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/2">Lord McIntosh told the Joint Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/3" class="indent">&quot;we have taken the view that in what I call destination gambling&mdash;in other words where you have to make a positive decision to go into a location where gambling takes place, rather than casual gambling which is thrust at you at the street corner&mdash;there is likely to be less increase in problem gambling than there is from casual gambling.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/4">As Professor Peter Collins, an expert in gambling who is himself based in Salford, which is not in east Manchester, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/5" class="indent">&quot;convenience is the single greatest spur to increase problem gambling&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/6">Yet when Lord Filkin asked Professor Crow, the chairman of the casino advisory panel, to confirm whether</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/7" class="indent">&quot;Their interpretation of their terms of reference made it virtually impossible for them to recommend that there should be a destination casino?&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/8">Professor Crow replied, &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/9">Are we not right in wanting to scrutinise further why such a diametrically opposed approach was taken by the casino advisory panel? Why is the Secretary of State content to push this order through without proper consideration of that fundamental discrepancy? Why are the Government so intent on forcing their Back Benchers to rubber-stamp this decision without allowing proper scrutiny?</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/10">It is also not sufficient to say that the casino advisory panel simply followed its terms of reference. Is the Secretary of State content that, as the Merits Committee makes clear,</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/11" class="indent">&quot;the panel had added some elements to the selection criteria, for example their own assumptions about relative profitability&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/12">Or is she happy that, according to the Committee, the panel's analysis of the ability of local authorities to manage the process</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/13" class="indent">&quot;was not in the terms of reference&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/14">What is clear is that many of the problems arose from the panel's interpretation of the terms of reference. I quote the Lords Committee again:</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/15" class="indent">&quot;Adding maximisation of profit into the consideration...seemed to have a greater weight on the Panel's recommendations than minimisation of harm&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/16">Does not the Secretary of State find it amazing and worrying that maximisation of profit was such a priority for the panel, ahead of reducing social harm? Indeed, the casino advisory panel's report states explicitly:</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/17" class="indent">&quot;Problem gambling is more of a town planning consideration than one for us&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/18">How does that square with the Secretary of State's claim that her legislation will protect the vulnerable?</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/19">The Secretary of State's explanations of the casino advisory panel's terms of reference are simply not sufficient. We have no confidence that the rationale of the casino advisory panel was the same rationale as this House had in mind when it agreed to a pilot scheme of new casinos&mdash;<i> [Interruption.]</i> It is not enough for the Secretary of State and Ministers to say that the Gambling Commission will tackle problem gambling. This pilot must not be some sort of social experiment. The new legislation clearly states that it should be about minimising harm, which must include the decision about where to locate the regional casino.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/20">In the light of all the expert advice gathered by the Lords Committee and its conclusions, we believe that the panel's recommendation on the regional casinos should be subject to further scrutiny by a properly reconstituted Committee of both Houses. That is necessary to ensure that Parliament is confident that the final decision is the right one, and that the importance of minimising problem gambling is fully taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/21">The Secretary of State's argument that this is putting 7,000 jobs at risk, which I have seen rehearsed in some of today's and yesterday's newspapers, simply does not hold water. We are calling for a four to six-week delay while this recommendation is given proper scrutiny. Given that the casino will not be built for three years or so, and that the legislation has in any case been on the cards since 2001, why would a delay of six weeks make any material difference whatever? Is it because, as many believe&mdash;and in line with her concession in the other place&mdash;the Secretary of State has already realised that the whole process was flawed?</p>
	<p pid="a.1562.4/22">Yes, we supported the establishment of an independent panel to advise the Secretary of State on the locations of the new casinos, but the right hon. Lady should not abdicate her responsibility and hide behind what is ultimately advice&mdash;I repeat, advice&mdash;without giving the recommendations adequate parliamentary scrutiny. So far, her only concession has been to extend the length of this debate to three hours and to offer up a Committee that, on closer inspection, is likely to be powerless. That is simply not good enough.</p>

	<p pid="a.1564.1/1">I think that there have been more U-turns than a driving instructor encounters in a lifetime. It is certainly extraordinary to try to reconcile that statement with what we have heard today. My hon. Friend would do well to examine what the Secretary of State has actually said about this reconstituted Committee. I think that it is effectively a dog without teeth, but we will come on to that in a minute.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.1/2">Does the Secretary of State not recognise that she could have saved her legislation in its entirety by splitting the order, as we and many others have asked her to do, so that the 16 large and small locations could be voted on while the regional casino recommendation was examined by a proper reconstituted Joint Scrutiny Committee? The Government are asking us today to make a leap of faith based on the recommendations of the casino advisory panel, but the Secretary of State's attack on the Opposition would have carried more weight if the Government's own stance had been clearer. We are voting this afternoon on the biggest change to gambling law in memory, yet only a week ago, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was imposing a new 50 per cent. tax rate on these casinos, because, we are told, of his personal distaste for gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.1/3">The Chancellor&mdash;or should I say the Prime Minister in waiting?&mdash;has apparently ruled out any increase in regional casinos under his premiership. At the same time, the Deputy Prime Minister, who, as we all know, takes an active personal interest in those wanting to build regional casinos, has been telling anyone who will listen&mdash;I understand that there are still one or two such people&mdash;that Blackpool should have been chosen. If the Secretary of State does not have the support of her own Cabinet colleagues, how can she expect to have the support of Parliament? Why is she so determined to charge ahead despite all these objections?</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.1/4">In a desperate last-minute attempt to buy off those who are set to vote against her this afternoon, the Secretary of State has suggested that she will accept the amendment tabled in the other place by Baroness Golding. I urge Members to get a copy of that amendment, which clearly states that it is</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.1/5" class="indent">&quot;desirable that Lords be appointed to join with a Committee of the Commons as a Joint Committee to consider the Panel's report in detail before any decision is arrived at with regard to the issuing of casino premises licences.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.1/6">Will the Secretary of State confirm, as I asked her to do at the outset, that not a single licence will be issued until the reconvened Joint Scrutiny Committee has sat and judged whether the casino should be in Manchester or somewhere else? If the Secretary of State is using the reconvened Joint Scrutiny Committee only as camouflage, or as a device to get her out of the hole that she finds herself in, it simply will not wash on either side of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1564.1/7">The Secretary of State's slightly chaotic, eleventh-hour approach typifies her attitude towards gambling. She dismisses with equal scorn the critical, the questioning, the concerned and the cautious. This afternoon we are simply asking, &quot;What's the rush?&quot; She has already conceded defeat in the other place. It is because she is still refusing to grant the measures additional proper parliamentary scrutiny that we shall still vote against the order today. That is not a vote against Manchester, or against any of the other proposed locations. It is a vote for caution and for further scrutiny, so that Parliament can assure itself that the final decision is the right one, not only for the Government and for this beleaguered Secretary of State, but for the community in which the casino will be placed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1567.3/1">I suppose that it depends on the exact nature of my hon. Friend's difficulty. Like my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I have genuine respect for those who are opposed to gambling&mdash;full stop. That is a perfectly legitimate and intelligible position, but what is not intelligible is to play politics about whether the casino should be located in Manchester, Yarmouth, Milton Keynes or somewhere else. That is not a reputable argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.1567.3/2">However, we can argue about how we maximise regeneration. I believe that regeneration could be done very successfully in Manchester, which has a good record for making it work. We can also argue about how harm minimisation could be carried out, and Manchester&mdash;uniquely among those areas that bid for the casino&mdash;put forward a comprehensive plan in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1567.3/3">In any case, and irrespective of the decision reached this evening, Manchester city council accepts that problem gambling already exists in my city, as a result of the internet and all the other ways that peoplecan access gambling in our society. The town hall's responsible gambling unit will carry on its work anyway, because we feel that we have a duty to take a responsible approach to the gambling that already goes on. Manchester's commitment to responsible gambling must underwrite the bids for regional casinos, and the whole approach to gambling in modern Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1567.3/4">Gambling is better done in a casino regulated by law than in those that exist in hyperspace, which allow people to operate on credit and incur considerable debt without proper recourse. I hope that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1418" name="Lynne Jones">the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase> will at least acknowledge what Manchester tries to do about problem gambling and to ensure that the 2,700 jobs we believe that we can create through the casino turn into more by using it as a lever for the hospitality industry. Despite hollow laughter from Conservative Members, that is an important part of the Manchester economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1567.3/5">It is important to hold a parliamentary debate on the matter. There is little opposition in Manchester, other than from the occasional opportunistic politician, to siting the casino in the city. The north-east Manchester<i> Advertiser, </i>the <i> Manchester Evening News </i>and the local media have all run campaigns in favour of locating the regional casino there. We want the casino to be based there&mdash;the general public in my city are overwhelmingly in favour of it. That is an important endorsement. Frankly, that cannot be claimed by all those who promote different casino sites throughout the country. I do not criticise people for that; I accept that the subject is controversial in some areas. However, it is not controversial in the poorest part of the city of Manchester, which I represent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1568.0/1">I respect the hon.

	<p pid="a.1569.0/1">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> and his colleagues, we will vote against the order. I want to make it clear, especially to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase>, that our decision has nothing to do with a specific casino bid or a particular location. I hope that he will acknowledge that my speech demonstrates that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/2">Also like the hon. Member for East Devon, I am disappointed that the Secretary of State did not make available to me or the hon. Gentleman the contents of the letter that she wrote to hon. Members who represent Blackpool. I have now had an opportunity to read it, but the Committee that she proposes to establish, through an amendment tabled in another place by Baroness Golding, will do nothing to tackle our anxieties. The letter describes the creation of a fresh Joint Committee of both Houses to consider the casino advisory panel and ascertain what lessons can be learned for the future. Clearly, such a Committee will have no impact and give no help to those of us who believe that we need to establish a Committee to examine the recommendations before a vote is taken on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/3">The Secretary of State knows that this is extremely controversial legislation. She said so herself in her speech. She has many times argued for a cautious approach. That is why I wrote to her on two separate occasions requesting that she reconvene the Joint Scrutiny Committee of both Houses of Parliament, which was ably chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase> and gave us excellent advice before we set off on the road that led to the Gambling Act 2005. We believe that it should be reconvened and that we should not go ahead with a vote on the CAP's recommendations without the Joint Committee's views on two specific issues. First, it should consider the impact on the CAP's recommendations of the recent and significant changes in gambling ecology in this country. Secondly, it should consider the concerns that have been expressed not least by the Merits Committee in another place about the remit given to the CAP and the way in which it met that remit. The Secretary of State's toothless Committee will offer none of those things.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/4">Since the CAP was established, there have been some significant changes in gambling in this country, which were referred to by the hon. Member for Manchester, Central. Surely those changes have to be considered alongside the recommendations of the panel. In particular, as he said, there has been a huge growth in internet gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/5">It was a year ago that the Secretary of State herself expressed concern. She told the &quot;Today&quot; programme that there had been</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/6" class="indent">&quot;an explosion in online gambling...an explosion over which we have very little control&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/7">Her Department and the Gambling Commission have both admitted that the online gambling market has more than doubled in the past five years and that there are now 1 million online gamblers in this country. It is surely worrying that when I asked the Minister of Sport, in a parliamentary question, what research he had commissioned into the relationship between internet gambling and problem gambling, he told me that he had commissioned no such research.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/8">It is equally worrying that the Government's efforts to bring online gambling companies onshore and under our proposed regulatory regime, which we spent so much time in Committee discussing, have so far completely failed. Frankly, the Chancellor's recent Budget means there is now no chance of success. The online operators have made it clear that they will not seek a UK licence because of the 15 per cent. remote gaming duty outlined in the Budget. It is no wonder that the chief executive of the Remote Gambling Association, Mr. Clive Hawkswood, said that the Government</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/9" class="indent">&quot;has missed a real opportunity to lead the way in terms of international regulatory standards&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/10">To make matters worse, while everyone knows that problem gambling is on the rise, efforts to help those who suffer from gambling addictions remain woefully inadequate. Although, belatedly, the gambling industry has now contributed &pound;3 million voluntarily to support the work of the excellent Responsibility in Gambling Trust and has promised more, we are still way behind other countries. We spend approximately &pound;10 per head on problem gambling support, but it is significantly less than the amount spent in New Zealand, Canada and Australia, where it is &pound;44, &pound;40 and &pound;26 respectively per problem gambler. Failures to address problem gambling should be factored into our thinking about the panel's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/11">We should also be considering the Government's complete failure to be clear about how many casinos we are likely to have at the end of the process. The Secretary of State said that there will be no more casinos until the next parliamentary Session, but in the Gambling Bill Committee it took many weeks even to get clear information about how many existing casinos we have&mdash;139 at the time, as it turned out. Then the Minister confidently stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/12" class="indent">&quot;we can say with certainty that there will be no more than 150 casinos.&quot;&mdash;[<i> Official Report, Standing Committee B,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-11">11 January 2005</phrase>; c. 718.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/13">Clearly, he totally failed to take account of the possibility of more casinos opening under the existing gambling legislation. He knows that that is the case because, from the figures that he sent to me last night&mdash;for which I am extremely grateful&mdash;in the worst case scenario there will be 249 licensed casinos. Even if we take a more conservative estimate and assume that only half the licence applications are successful, the Minister's cap of 150 will be far exceeded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/14">We also need to take account of the possible impact of the claim for judicial review being brought by the British Casino Association, which has so far not been mentioned. That association believes that grandfathering arrangements for existing casinos introduced by the Gambling Act are unfair and place existing casinos at a substantial competitive disadvantage to the proposed new casinos. If that judicial review goes ahead and is successful, it would significantly change the climate in which the new casino trial is due to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/15">One final change in the gambling ecology that we should be considering also comes from the Chancellor's Budget. By imposing a new high 50 per cent. top rate of tax, the new super-casino's profit margins will be reduced and its ability to contribute to regeneration, wherever it is located&mdash;Manchester or anywhere else&mdash;will be diminished. Surely concerns about the explosion of internet gambling, the failure to provide adequate support for problem gamblers, the likely higher than expected number of casinos, the impact of a possible judicial review and the higher than expected super-casino tax are all matters that a reconvened Joint Scrutiny Committee would want to, and I believe should, consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/16">The second fundamental reason for my decision to vote against the order today is based on my concerns about the remit given to the CAP and the way that it has executed it. Frankly, the panel was dealt an unfair hand, and the process by which it came to its conclusions has led to a range of criticisms, not least, as we have heard, by the Merits Committee. In its report, the CAP declared that the central tenet of its assessment of the bids was its quest to find the best test of social impact. Last week, as we have heard, the Secretary of State wrote to Lord Filkin in response to the damning findings of the Merits Committee. In it she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/17" class="indent">&quot;the criteria by which the Panel would assess submissions were set out in the national policy statement&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/18">However, the Secretary of State must know that the best test of social impact was not included in the statement of national policy. In fact, the remit on which the panel based its decision changed significantly from the one outlined in the national policy statement&mdash;something that the House had the opportunity to debate&mdash;to the one outlined in the terms of reference issued much later by her and not subjected to parliamentary scrutiny. Despite placing the best test of social impact as the panel's guiding principle, the Government never defined it. The panel was left to determine it for itself. It is not surprising that it admitted that seeking the best test of social impact was &quot;a peculiar problem&quot;. It certainly is. One of the UK's leading experts on gambling, Peter Collins, has vehemently argued that the very idea of finding a best test of social impact is an impossible task, not least because there are numerous interpretations of such an ambiguous term.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/19">What is more, the CAP concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/20" class="indent">&quot;After considering all the evidence&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/21">I hope that the hon. Member for Manchester, Central is listening&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/22" class="indent">&quot;no single regional casino proposal emerged as the self evident favourite in presenting the best test of social impact. All had one or another point in its favour&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/23">No one bid stood out for the panel in terms of testing social impact, and yet the panel continued to use it as their guiding principle. It seems odd that it spent so much time pursuing the elusive and undefined social impact, rather than considering the Government's other guiding principle of minimising the harmful effects of gambling, a principle that was supposed at least to be implicit in the panel's terms of reference. So it was not surprising that the Merits Committee said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/24" class="indent">&quot;when the objectives were in tension, the Panel veered towards their terms of reference with their emphasis on the research testing of impacts rather than the minimisation of harm&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/25">What is more, the panel made its decision based upon testing the effects of the new regional casino assuming it to be a pilot, whereas it seems increasingly likely&mdash;if the Chancellor has his way&mdash;that there will only ever be one regional casino.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/26">There are many other concerns; for example, the British Casino Association highlights the panel's failure to consider the existing gambling landscape during its decision-making process. The association argues that</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/27" class="indent">&quot;the location and proximity of existing casinos will dilute the likely impact of the new casinos and render any social impact test more complex and less certain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1569.0/28">Many people find it somewhat bizarre that the casino advisory panel recommended the location of proposed new casinos in areas where in many cases there is already a large number of casinos&mdash;for instance, Manchester already plays host to 10 casinos and there are 19 existing casinos near 10 of the proposed new small and large casinos.</p>

	<p pid="a.1572.1/1">I shall certainly give the matter some thought. Like the hon. Member for East Devon, I am well aware of the many reports that suggest that some of the regeneration benefits claimed may be somewhat bogus and may simply lead to a movement of staff from one institution to another in terms of the wider entertainment ecology of a location.</p>
	<p pid="a.1572.1/2">Given that the panel put so much emphasis on social impact, it is certainly odd that the location of existing casinos did not seem significantly to inform its reasoning. As the Merits Committee heard, there have been many other criticisms: inconsistency, a relentless shifting of the goal posts by the panel, chaos in the appeals process and constant changes to the all-important examination in public sessions, which changed from one candidate to the next, with varying amounts of preparation timefor the sessions and presentation time within them. Sadly, the Merits Committee was unable to explore the last issue fully as the transcripts of those sessions have not yet been published. If the Secretary of State agrees to reconvene the Select Committee, I hope that it can have access to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1572.1/3">Concerns have already been expressed about the regeneration aspects of the panel's work. The panel said that the job creation proposals used to assess the regeneration potential of the bids were for the most part</p>
	<p pid="a.1572.1/4" class="indent">&quot;prepared at a time when there was a belief that there would be more than one regional casino&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1572.1/5">If that is the case, how could their estimates have been much help in assessing the bids for what will be a single super-casino? In relation to the choice of Manchester, what assurances do we have that the council will stick to east Manchester? That point was raised by the hon. Member for East Devon. After all, the Secretary of State's letter, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, makes it clear that the council has the choice</p>
	<p pid="a.1572.1/6" class="indent">&quot;to issue the licence to any site within the authority area&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.1574.2/1">We cannot underestimate the shock, anger and disappointment in Blackpool when the casino advisory panel made its announcement. That anger has not dissipated since the announcement was made&mdash;just the opposite. The people of Blackpool are determined to fight for their future, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> and I are determined to fight within this Chamber for their future. On Monday, we accompanied the editor of our evening paper,<i> The Gazette</i>, to bring down and present to No. 10 a petition signed by more than 11,500 people. That shows the strength of feeling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.2/2">That strength of feeling has existed for a long time. Blackpoolers have been involved in this debate forseven years. This was our future. This was the new21st century Blackpool. The people of Blackpool are wonderfully innovative. We put the tower up in the19th century and developed the pleasure beach and lots of other attractions in the 20th century. Let us remember that what we are talking about is a huge entertainment complex including a conference centre, hotels, restaurants, theatres&mdash;everything. This was the big idea for the21st century and I say to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State that we are not giving up on it&mdash;and we are certainly not giving up easily. We are going to argue the case until the end of this debate and beyond, as she well knows.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.2/3">I want to set the record straight about what we, as Blackpool MPs, have been asking for. My right hon. Friend said at the beginning of her address that it would have been wrong for her to present an order in which she had taken out &quot;Manchester&quot; and inserted &quot;Blackpool&quot;. We have never asked for that. We asked for two orders so that the eight large and eight small casinos could be considered separately from the other casino. I say to colleagues in the Chamber whose constituencies have been allocated a large or a small casino, I want them to get them. It is not my fault that we are voting for the whole lot&mdash;I am in the position that I am in. I want Great Yarmouth to get its large casino, which I am sure will be hugely successful for the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase>, and I do not want to vote down Manchester. I want the debate on the regional casino to be properly considered. I tabled my early-day motion, which was supported by my hon. Friendthe Member for Blackpool, South and Opposition Members representing neighbouring seats on the Fylde coast, because this affects not only Blackpool but all of us, given the regeneration potential of the super-casino. I have to say that it seems absurd to talk about a regional casino when there is only to be one. If the Secretary of State will forgive me, I will call it a super-casino, because that is what it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.2/4">I was a member of the Standing Committee that considered the Bill that became the Gambling Act 2005. I can see no relationship between the casino advisory panel's report and what we debated in Committee. I must acknowledge the excellent work of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport on that Committee. When we debated the new casinos, we expressed concern about the proliferation of gambling and the problems that that might bring. However, we also discussed the regeneration potential of casinos. Many hon. Members on both sides of the House backed the Bill only because of its regeneration potential for disadvantaged communities. I will put it even more strongly: they backed the Bill only because a debate had started on the regeneration of our seaside resorts, which, as we all know, have suffered over the past 20 years due to changing patterns of holidaymaking.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.2/5">When we considered setting up the casino advisory panel during our consideration of the Bill, I supported it&mdash;I can say that quite honestly. However, I supported it in the context of the criteria we were considering: eight regional casinos, eight large casinos and eight small casinos. Things changed when the number of regional casinos went down to one. The panel should have been given further guidance on how to examine that new super-casino. It was not the panel's fault that it had to examine a range of criteria as part of its task. How could it determine what was Parliament's priority if the Government did not state what the priority was? When we debated the spread of casinos that would allow the impact of gambling to be properly assessed, we talked about having a spread of geographical locations for each of the categories. However, as soon as there was to be only one regional casino, we could not say, &quot;We'll have part of it in a city, part in a resort and part in the middle of the countryside.&quot; Professor Crow had to try to make sense of the complex remit that he was given, so I cannot blame him for coming up with what he thought was the right answer. However, I can question whether, even within the rules that were set&mdash;by and large he set them for himself&mdash;he came up with the right answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.2/6">My early-day motion, which was supported by many colleagues, highlighted the fact that we needed a proper investigation before we made a decision on the single regional casino. That did not happen. I congratulate the Merits Committee in the other place because, in a short time, it has highlighted serious deficiencies in the casino advisory panel's report. If we in this House had had the opportunity to set up a Committee to consider the report, we could have highlighted other matters that could and should have been properly discussed. Nevertheless, I have to accept that that scrutiny was not performed, except by the Merits Committee, and we should address some of the points that it made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.2/7">I make no apologies for repeating some of the points that other hon. Members have made, because they are very important. How did the panel address the need to minimise harm? It said that</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.2/8" class="indent">&quot;maximising beneficial social impact...whilst minimising adverse social impact&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.2/9">was implicit in its criteria, but it should have been explicit, because that was the concern of so many hon. Members. If it had been explicit, the panel would have looked much closer at destination casinos.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.2/10">In various international analyses, destination casinos have been found to minimise social impact and maximise the benefits. When I go away on holiday, I take some money to spend, I spend it and I come home. If someone goes to Las Vegas to gamble, they will take spending money for that purpose. They will lose the money, but then they will come home and get on with their lives. All the evidence shows that the system would work best with a proper destination casino.</p>
	<p pid="a.1574.2/11">Sadly, Professor Crow, in his evidence to the Merits Committee, said that it was virtually impossible for a resort to be allocated the regional casino because of the criteria within which he was operating. He ruled it out without ever properly considering our case.</p>

	<p pid="a.1576.0/1">In this debate I have tried to avoid any direct competition between Manchester and Blackpool, and I have a lot of sympathy for Blackpool. But will my hon. Friend accept that Professor Crow wrote to the Merits Committee explaining that the panel was fully aware of destination casinos? He gave the example of Dortmund, which was in the middle of a forest and had zero regeneration benefits. One of his criteria was to achieve as much regeneration as possible from the casino, and that could not be done at the extreme end&mdash;such as with the casino in Dortmund.</p>

	<p pid="a.1576.1/1">My hon. Friend highlights how difficult it is for us in the brief time available to try to analyse in detail the casino advisory panel's report. He and I should not be comparing the respective bids of our constituencies; that should have been done in the context of a Committee set up for that purpose, which could have taken evidence and questioned Professor Crow about his assertions. The report was full of assertions, with language such as &quot;I believe that&quot; or &quot;We feel that&quot;. On an issue as important as this, I want more than that. We need an assessment of evidence and as firm a conclusion as possible. We did not have that in the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/2">I disagreed with Professor Crow's conclusions, but he could have had better advice. The Merits Committee pointed out that he addressed the issue of profitability, which did not fall within his remit, although the Committee accepted that it was a matter of common sense for him to consider it. In Professor Crow's assessment of Blackpool, he says that the</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/3" class="indent">&quot;regeneration benefits of the proposal before us are unproven&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/4">But that is true of all the bidders for the super-casino, because we have never seen one. No locality could prove its claims, but why did he say that about Blackpool? From my recollection, he did not say it of any of the others. He appears to have marked down Blackpool on all his subheadings, including methodology and location.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/5">The most condescending and indeed hurtful remark in Professor Crow's report, however, was about the economy of Blackpool. He said that he did not accept that our economy was declining, in spite of the overwhelming evidence given to him by the very large numbers of people who appeared in the public evidence session. He said that he believed that there would be</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/6" class="indent">&quot;stabilisation at a lower level&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/7">He went on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/8" class="indent">&quot;this may well include the management of contraction. If so, this situation should be resolutely faced by the authorities and local businesses alike without visions of external intervention to cure all ills.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1576.1/9">How dare he say that? What we were bidding for was absolutely the most appropriate external intervention in Blackpool. We have an economy that is built on leisure and tourism. Where else should there be a super-casino but by the seaside in Blackpool? Yet Professor Crow says that we should not look for external intervention, but that Manchester was already regenerated.</p>

	<p pid="a.1577.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a perfectly valid point. What depressed me about the report was that on what we saw as the strong points of Blackpool's bid&mdash;it was a destination that people came to and then left&mdash;it was marked down. What nonsense. If we are trying to minimise problem gambling, we should celebrate that here we are pleading for a super-casino in a resort.</p>
	<p pid="a.1577.1/2">Time is passing, Madam Deputy Speaker. Professor Crow did not allow Members of Parliament to speak in the public evidence sessions, and this is the only opportunity that I have to speak on this issue. Although I thank the Secretary of State for extending the time, it is not long enough. We were denied the opportunity in Blackpool by Professor Crow's own decision, and we are now being denied the opportunity here because of the limited time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1577.1/3">I shall make two further points. For Blackpool, this issue is the single catalyst for regeneration. Manchester is a glorious, thriving city. I acknowledge everything that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase>&mdash;he is my friend&mdash;says about his constituency, but I visit Manchester and I see all the new developments there. The excellent report on coastal towns published by the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, which all of us should read, features evidence presented from the north-west. Councillor John Joyce, the then chair of the North West regional assembly, and Keith Barnes, regional director of the Government office for the north-west, gave evidence. Councillor Joyce said that</p>
	<p pid="a.1577.1/4" class="indent">&quot;we believe that now we have changed the North West Regional Assembly and gone into what I call a trinity with the Government North West and also the Regional Development Agency, we are now of the same mind to target those areas where we need to perform better.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1577.1/5">They went on to say in all the regional documents that Blackpool should have had the regional casino. Mr. Barnes, on behalf of the Government office for the north-west, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1577.1/6" class="indent">&quot;If this hearing were in Manchester or Liverpool, you would be able to see outside the number of cranes and transformation of those cities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1577.1/7">As somebody who lives in the north-west, I see that development and celebrate it. However, we have in front of us a combined order that I did not want to see; no scrutiny of the casino advisory panel; a disregard for regional planning guidelines; and no opportunity for us to separate out the order or say to the large and small casinos that we back them and want them to proceed, but want a more detailed examination of a unique opportunity, through the super-casino, to regenerate whatever area it is in.</p>
	<p pid="a.1577.1/8">That decision should have been taken with much more care and consideration, so with huge sadness I have to tell the Secretary of State that I cannot support the order in its current form. It is wrong to present it in that form, and I hope, even at this late stage, that she will withdraw it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1578.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase>, who made a powerful speech. She referred to the early-day motion that she tabled, which was in the Order Paper, and to the fact that a number of north-western Members on both sides of the House had signed it. I represent a coastal town, too, but I suspect that it is as far away from Blackpool as it is possible to be. However, I was happy to sign her early-day motion, because she presents a persuasive case.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/2">I begin by expressing some sympathy for the Secretary of State. Those of us who were involved in the debates during the passage of the GamblingAct 2005 always suspected that she was never that enthusiastic about the legislation. Certainly, the passage of the Bill was dogged by disaster throughout. Almost weekly, the Minister for Sport had to make an announcement of Government policy to the Standing Committee that was almost in direct contradiction to what he had argued the previous week. Then in the Bill's final stages in Parliament, the Secretary of State was forced to reduce the number of proposed regional casinos from eight to just one. That cannot have been easy for her, but I suspect that she must have sighed with relief when the Bill finally received Royal Assent. She could not have anticipated that not so long afterwards, she would be back in the House of Commons having to defend this order, and facing possible defeat.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/3">I currently chair the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, but during the passage of the Bill I was the shadow spokesman, and it is in that capacity that I want to speak. I want to reflect on some of the arguments that I presented at the time, and to say why I believe that the position outlined by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> is entirely consistent with all the points that we made during the Bill's passage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/4">There was much in the Bill that we always supported. We believed that there was a strong case for introducing a regime to regulate online gambling, and we supported the abolition of the 24-hour rule and the removal of the ban on advertising. The problem with the Bill was always regional casinos. They represented an entirely new form of gambling that had never before been seen in this country. They would introduce category A gaming machines, too; the proposal was, and is, that each of the regional casinos should have 1,250 of them. There was a real fear that that would lead to an increase in problem gambling. The Government's problems on that score began when they ignored the recommendation in the report of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase>, who chaired the Joint Scrutiny Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/5">Initially, the Government had proposed no real limit on the number of regional casinos, but my hon. Friend's Committee came up with a sensible scheme, under which we would use an economic mechanism that would limit the number. The Government did not accept that recommendation, but instead, halfway through the passage of the Bill, they had to come up with a cap of eight casinos, which flew in the face of what they had previously argued. It was never entirely clear to us why the number should be eight. It was even less clear why, just a few weeks later, they came back with further caps of eight on the number of large casinos, and on the number of new small casinos. Certainly, in the case of regional casinos, we felt that the figure was too large and should be reduced. In the end, we argued that there should be just one, and the Secretary of State was forced to accept that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/6">In arguing about where that one regional casino should be located, we were entirely happy to accept the Secretary of State's decision that the decision should be given to an advisory panel. However, we have always made it clear that we share the Joint Scrutiny Committee's view that the impact on problem gambling would be minimised if the location werea destination resort. We strongly supported the Committee's recommendation that the regional casino should not be located in close proximity to residential properties. At the time, we said that that should be the overriding consideration, and while we certainly were not in a position to say that it necessarily should go to Blackpool, we recognise the strength of the case that Blackpool made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/7">The Secretary of State said that no one objected to the panel's terms of reference, which is correct. However, they are extremely brief:</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The criteria against which the panel will assess these submissions were set out in the government's national policy statement on casinos...The primary consideration will be to ensure that locations provide the best possible test of social impact.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/9">As previous speakers have said, it was extremely unclear precisely what that meant, and the panel clearly had great difficulty interpreting what was meant by social impact. It was clear to us, however, that the national policy statement, which was issued when it was proposed that there should be eight regional casinos, rather than one, nevertheless set out at the very outset that the Government's first objective was to protect children and other vulnerable people from harm. It was not unreasonable to believe that that would be one of the guiding principles of the advisory panel's work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/10">We were therefore astonished&mdash;at least, I was certainly astonished&mdash;when the Secretary of State announced a few weeks ago that the panel had decided that the regional casino should be located in Manchester, as that plainly was an area in close proximity to residential properties. As I said at the time, I was even more astonished to find that the panel's report stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/11" class="indent">&quot;problem gambling is more a town planning consideration rather than one for us&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">The hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> has sought to argue that Professor Crow has since said that he did accord importance to social impact and problem gambling when making his decision. However, the panel plainly states that it did not consider that that was a matter for it. Its interpretation of the test of social impact appears to have been to look at the various applications and decide which one was most likely to lead to an increase in problem gambling, and choose it, because it would offer the best test, which is an entirely perverse interpretation of the way in which most people thought that it would undertake its task.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/13">When the Secretary of State wrote to Lord Filkin after the publication of the advisory panel's report, she stated that minimising harm from gambling was not &quot;the primary consideration&quot; that she set for the panel. That leads us to believe that the panel conducted its own inquiry in the light of its terms of reference, but that the Government set it terms of reference that excluded from consideration what we always believed to be the most important issue. On that basis, the panel's report is flawed, as the Government misled the panel about the issues and criteria that it should have used to make a judgment by excluding what we in the House had always considered to be the most important issue when determining the future location of any regional casino.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/14">It is on that basis that I continue to believe that the recommendation is flawed. My hon. Friend the Member for East Devon has argued that we do not have a problem with the recommendation for the locations of the eight large casinos, or, indeed, for the eight small casinos. Certainly, it would have been preferable had the Secretary of State separated the two issues and put before the House two orders, so that the 16 locations that are likely to benefit from large or small casinos could proceed without being delayed while the matter was re-examined.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/15">The location of a regional casino is extremely important. There is a real risk that if we get it wrong, that will lead to a significant increase in problem gambling, which is what we have always sought to avoid throughout the consideration of the legislation. If that risks exists, it is worth pausing, as my hon. Friend said, and referring the matter back to a Committee which can take account of the concern about problem gambling, rather than to the advisory panel, which seems to have excluded that issue from its consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1578.0/16">For that reason, I hope the House will vote not against Manchester, as some have suggested, but in line with the recommendation in the House of Lords that the matter should be referred back to a Scrutiny Committee. Whereas in the House of Lords it appears that the Government's belated acceptance of Baroness Golding's amendment will change nothing, the proposal should be considered by a Scrutiny Committee, and the order should be laid and permission given only after that Committee has had a chance to report.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-28a.1582.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" speakername="Iain Duncan Smith" colnum="1582"  time="017:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/debtext/70328-0017.htm#07032878000851">
	<p pid="a.1582.0/1">I want to keep my comments brief. Over the past few years, I have found myself coming down firmly against any further extension of gambling in this country. I set up an organisation called the Centre for Social Justice and I am now engaged with the social justice policy group, which has been taking evidence on this issue. We have commissioned an inquiry into gambling, which will report in May, but some of the early findings make very worrying reading, suggesting that problem gambling is to get worse and will be worsened by the current process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/2">I have great sympathy for those who have put in a bid, but speaking as a London MP, I can honestly say on record that I am extremely happy that London did not get any regional casino. Watching various Members legitimately trading comments about which was the better city, one could begin to see how divisive the process has become.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/3">One of the biggest and most worrying issues raised by our sub-group is the connection between debt and family break-up. I did not used to be so aware of it, but I am now, as the report shows that debt is the single biggest cause of family break-up. Family break-up in the United Kingdom is at record levels and when compared with every other country. We know that many of the problems in inner-city areas result from dysfunctional and broken homes and that one of the main drivers of debt is gambling, particularly among the lower socio-economic groups. I shall come back to that in a minute.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/4">Putting aside my objections to the increase in gambling that this order will continue, I would have to say with respect to Members representing Manchester that if we had to locate a super-casino anywhere I cannot think of a worse place than Manchester. There are already a number of casinos&mdash;10, I believe&mdash;and I am not aware that they have contributed massively to regeneration in that city. Let me go through some of the relevant figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/5">We know that Manchester has the highest number of robberies and the second highest level of vehicle crime among the four towns in the top 10 in that region. The same four make up one of the highest-crime cities. We know that 50 per cent. of the population are economically inactive and totally dependent on the state; that life expectancy for men is seven years less than the national average and four years less for women; that unemployment in the area where the casino is to be sited is 5.6 per cent. of the working age group compared with 2.8 per cent. in the country as a whole; and that 13.3 per cent. of the population of working age are on incapacity benefit compared to4.5 per cent. in England and Wales as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/6">I make those points because our findings have shown an intriguing and worrying feature: problem gambling and socio-economic disadvantage are hugely linked. The figures boil down to the following characteristics of a typical profile of a problem gambler: someone who is male; who has a parent who is or has been a problem gambler; who is separated, divorced or a product of a broken home; who is likely to be unemployed, in poor health and poor housing; and who has low educational qualifications. The order's objective is to place a super-casino right smack bang into an area inhabited by people with all those serious problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/7">I simply cannot understand what this so-called independent committee was doing when it looked into the matter. It clearly failed to take into consideration any of those points. If we had spent a little longer and asked the many people who are now really worried about the increase in problem gambling in Britain, we might just have begun to realise the difficulties that are going to erupt as a result of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/8">We also know from the report that we are working on that there is a close correlation between problem gambling and other addictive activities such as drug and serious alcohol abuse. I remind the House that, right now, the UK is in the grip of an alcohol epidemic. We have a very high number of alcohol abusers and it is rising. We know that the connection between children who imbibe serious levels of alcohol&mdash;last year about5 per cent. of children under 13 admitted to binge drinking once a month&mdash;and drug addiction is almost certain. We know that gambling, alcohol abuse and drug abuse are closely correlated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/9">I am particularly concerned about the sort of organisations that get involved in this level of gambling, and I must say to colleagues on both sidesof the House that I cannot conceive of why we would want to get too close to many of them. The reality is, as we have seen from the behaviour of members of the Government, how insidiously corrupting so many of the people involved in this process ultimately become to those who are legitimately trying to seek some form of regeneration. We have seen that in relation to the proposals for the dome, and I guess that we shall see more of it as time goes on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/10">The connection between problem gambling and other addictions is deeply worrying. More worrying in regard to the report that we have produced is the way in which the most vulnerable, including the very young, are affected. The recent BMA report suggested that age is now a determining factor in this addiction. The group most likely to experience problems with casino-based gambling consists of single unemployed males under the age of 30. Adolescent gambling in the UK is also a grave issue for concern. We have not begun to tackle the problems surrounding internet gambling, even as we begin to expand the whole idea of gaming through these centres. The BMA report mentions a number of studies that identify a figure of between 5 and 6 per cent. of pathological gamblers among adolescent fruit machine gamblers, and states that that figure is three times higher than that identified elsewhere in the adult population.</p>
	<p pid="a.1582.0/11">I am now more opposed to this headlong rush into expanding gambling than ever before; I am very worried about it. Many decent, reasonable colleagues in the House are grasping at the idea of regeneration and at the huge promises that have been made, yet there is absolutely no evidence that these casinos will add anything constructive to the lives that people should and could be living, particularly in areas such as Manchester, which have serious levels of deprivation. Such a casino would be a disaster for that area. I wonder what has happened to us if we are genuinely considering regenerating and rebuilding our cities by placing this kind of nonsense in their midst to attract people into the most destructive behaviour in the most destructive areas. I shall vote against the order tonight because I now genuinely believe that this expansion is wrong in any cause.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-28a.1584.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" speakername="Anthony D Wright" colnum="1584"  time="017:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/debtext/70328-0017.htm#07032878000852">
	<p pid="a.1584.0/1">I want to return to the order before us today. This is not just about Manchester and Blackpool; it is also about the other 16 casinos&mdash;eight large and eight small. Great Yarmouth is to have one of the large ones, and I will certainly support the order.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584.0/2">Like many of my colleagues, I was a member of the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee, and I endorse the view of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">the Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> that it was a good experience of looking at legislation. I want to put on record that my concerns related to the fact that the Committee was looking at resort casinos. The view was held universally across the Committee that we expected that to be the case. Contrary to the opinions expressed by Opposition Members, it was the pre-legislative scrutiny Committee that came forward with the proposal for the eight regional casinos, determined on a regional basis, that was put to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584.0/3">I want to talk about the positive aspects of the order, and about the opportunities that I envisage for constituencies such as Great Yarmouth. Regeneration is already taking place there on the basis that we have received the go-ahead for the casino and for a new harbour scheme. Other people are now investing in the town, and we can already see a great renaissance there, compared with 10 years ago. Huge amounts of regeneration money from the Government is supporting the private sector money that is coming into the town. We see the casino as an opportunity in that regard, but the bids that are coming in illustrate that this is not just about the casino; it is about the other facilities that will be added to those attractions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584.0/4">On the Blackpool and Manchester issue, I have a great deal of respect and admiration for my hon. Friends the Members for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) and for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden). I understand their concerns and reservations about the order. I, too, would feel pretty aggrieved and I would certainly have wished the casino to have been in Blackpool. What I get annoyedabout, however, is the political opportunism of the Opposition&mdash;certainly the official Opposition. They see an opportunity to give the Government a bloody nose. What they will actually do, however, is delay at best, and scupper at worst, the chances of others towns such as Great Yarmouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584.0/5">It is great that the Opposition have had yet another change of heart. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">The right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> has indicated his opposition to gambling as a whole. I would therefore question the Conservative party's acceptance in 2001 of &pound;5 million from Stuart Wheeler of IG Index. Given the Conservatives' new view, perhaps they will donate that &pound;5 million to the Responsibility in Gambling Trust, run and chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">the hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase>. Once again, double standards are being seen in the Chamber. I would like to think that Members would support the order, and accept the proposals considered by the other place to set up an independent committee to consider such matters in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584.0/6">I reiterate that if the order is voted down, there is no surety that it will come back to the House. If we consider the previous initial evaluation, and the points awarded, we see that Great Yarmouth was awarded54 points, Manchester 57 points and Blackpool65 points. In the final evaluation, however, Great Yarmouth was pushed to the side to top the large casino ratings, while Blackpool was overtaken by Manchester. A number of other towns and cities up and down the country also had a different initial evaluation. Canterbury, for instance, initially received 51 points in the large and small casino ratings, but got nothing in the second evaluation. What would stop those towns and cities challenging the premise that towns such as Great Yarmouth were above them in the ratings? That question suggests to me that rejecting the order at this stage would set a dangerous precedent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1584.0/7">I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood that I support the view that Blackpool would have been the best choice. Perhaps I say that because I also represent a seaside resort, but the evidence taken by the Joint Committee of which I was a member also supported that view. Although she will understand the reasons why I cannot vote with her tonight, I am sure that Blackpool will come back from this and still be one of the top holiday destinations in the UK.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-28a.1586.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" speakername="John Greenway" colnum="1586"  time="017:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/debtext/70328-0017.htm#07032878000853">
	<p pid="a.1586.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase>, who was a distinguished member of the Joint Committee. As Great Yarmouth has been allocated a large casino, I can understand that he wants to see that development go ahead. I remember the visit to his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/2">I must confess, however, that I am disappointed and somewhat dismayed at the direction that policy on casinos has taken. It was my wish that the publication of two unanimous reports by the Joint Committee, on both the Bill and casinos, would enable both Houses to proceed with the implementation of the GamblingAct 2005 by consensus. If we are to have a policy that will last for 40 years, as the previous one has done, genuine cross-party agreement is critical.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/3">It is also important to understand that today's vote is not a rerun of the vote for or against the Act, but simply a vote on the order, and on whether we yet have sufficient information on which to make a judgment about the panel's selection. Some of us have been dealing with this matter for more than five years. The Minister for Sport and I probably agree about the need for closure: this issue has gone on long enough, and it is time for us to draw a line under it. I have spent most of the past five or six weeks suggesting that that is what we should do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/4">However, I must make some criticism of my party. It was a huge mistake to insist on having just one pilot regional casino. I do not see how a research project, as recommended by the panel, can have only one pilot. The tensions that exist now stem from that judgment. There was an opportunity to have more than one regional casino, but the House seems to lack the necessary courage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/5">I hear what my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> says, and there are clear objections to expanding gambling in any way. However, resort-type destination casinos have been developed in other jurisdictions, and it is clear that we have missed a golden opportunity to regenerate places such as Blackpool, Cardiff and Glasgow, all of which were big bidders for the one available licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/6">I accept that problem gambling is an issue, and I shall say a little more about it later in my speech. The Minister and I get on extremely well, having worked together on many matters involving gambling and sport, but alarm bells rang loudly in my mind when I read the Merits Committee report. There is an obvious tension between ensuring that the statutory objective to protect children and the vulnerable was paramount in the panel's recommendations, and the panel members' apparent belief that they had to recommend a location that would provide a strong test of social impact. They interpreted that to mean that they could measure the problem gambling that resulted from establishing the casino. That complete contradiction flies in the face of what we have tried to do in promoting the Gambling Act 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/7">That was of real concern to the Joint Scrutiny Committee, which recommended that the super-casino should be a resort destination casino drawing its clientele from an extremely wide area and providing a national&mdash;or, indeed, international&mdash;attraction. As a result, in our casino report published in July 2004, we recommended that the generic term of reference &quot;regional casino&quot; should be dropped and that the casinos should be called &quot;destination resort casinos&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/8">At the time, that suggestion was dismissed perfunctorily by an official of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. I am not even sure the extent to which Ministers considered it but, given that the Crow panel has said that a destination casino could not provide a social impact test, it seems to me that by calling them &quot;destination resort casinos&quot; from the start we could have avoided the problem that we have now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/9">I make no judgment about the competing claims of all the possible locations for the regional casino. I am not looking for more work, but I am pleased and relieved that the Secretary of State has said that she is willing to reconvene a Committee. I may not be invited to be a member, but there needs to be a bit more clarity about what the Committee would be asked to do. What are the terms of reference? How will they be determined? Tony Banks, who died, and Richard Page, who retired, were members of the previous Committee. I am sure that we could fill those vacancies&mdash;the enthusiasm that the debate has revealed for the topic suggests that there would be several volunteers. However, if we reconsider the matter, I cannot believe that we would expect to settle the issue by simply having one regional casino.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/10">If the order is approved as it stands, we should realise that we would approve a location in Manchester, where, according to the panel's admission, there is a risk&mdash;some would say a serious risk&mdash;of problem gambling. My concern is that that is the opposite of the statutory objective to protect children and the vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/11">The tax rate of 50 per cent. that the Chancellor announced last week calls the regeneration opportunity into question. The Joint Committee constantly asked what the tax rate was likely to be. It is critical in the equation for whether such projects make sense. The tax rate is bound to have an impact on what can be done in some of the small and large casino locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/12">A couple of colleagues referred to the fact that I chair the Responsibility in Gambling Trust. One of the issues that weighs heavily on colleagues' minds when considering whether to support the order is the potential for increased problem gambling. The trust has made huge strides in the past year since I became chairman in commissioning education, public awareness, research and treatment projects relating to gambling addiction. Time does not allow me to say much more about it, but I promise hon. Members that they need have no concern about the provision of help through counselling services, public information and education for the people who patronise the new casinos. We have achieved &pound;3 million funding in the current year and we have been promised &pound;4 million and &pound;5 million from the industry for the next two years as a result of a seminar that the Minister kindly addressed. I am optimistic about the future, although I am sure that the tax rates that the Chancellor announced will create some difficulty in our funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/13">With a heavy heart, I believe that we need to examine the panel's comments more closely before we can conclude the matter. I hope that the reconvened Committee, which the Secretary of State announced, will enable us to do that and devise the right recommendation. If there is to be only one regional casino for the whole of the time that most of us are in Parliament&mdash;that is a considerable time for most hon. Members present; I have been here for 20 years and will probably not stand next time&mdash;we must make the right decision. What is wrong with taking a little longer to ensure that we get it right?</p>
	<p pid="a.1586.0/14">If any colleagues put any constituents whom they know to have gambling problems in touch with the trust, we will do our best to help them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1588.0/1">When I was a child in the 1960s, my parents used to take me to Blackpool, where trains arrived at the old central station every three or four minutes and when Blackpool could still attract the cream of stage, screen, TV and radio at the north pier shows and throughout the constituency. That was the golden age&mdash;if there was ever one&mdash;of the British seaside. However, like so many other seaside towns, Blackpool&mdash;perhaps more than others because we were always the biggest and, we argued, the best&mdash;suffered from slow decline and the gradual change in the structure of holidays.</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/2">Dean Acheson once said of Britain after Suez that it had lost an empire and not yet found a role. Much of that truth is embodied in the predicament of British seaside towns today. The report that the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> chairs, recently produced on coastal and seaside towns provides eloquent testimony to that. It also eloquently outlines some of the resolutions that I and other hon. Members who represent seaside towns, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase>, who spoke so valiantly earlier, urged on the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/3">That is why, for the past six or seven years, Blackpool has put all its feelings and every sinew behind the proposal for a resort casino. We did that not because we believed the insulting words of Professor Crow that it was a hand-out or a cure-all that would be dropped into our laps, but because we saw it as a catalyst. The mayor of Blackpool wrote only this week</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Blackpool's proposals for its regional Casino would bring an estimated 2500-3400 jobs and &pound;200-450m of capital investment associated conference/exhibition; leisure...and hotel uses in a small economy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/5">With all due respect to my hon. Friends from Manchester, I have to repeat what the mayor went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Manchester's bid anticipates only 2,700 jobs...in a much larger economy with many alternative drivers for regeneration.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/7">That is the key. The regeneration and job-creation boost in Blackpool would be proportionately much greater than in Manchester. That was one of the factors about which the House of Lords Merits Committee specifically talked about. There we have it. That was our pitch. Of course, any panel was bound to disappoint someone. Of course, as Blackpool MPs, my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood and I spoke up for our constituencies. How could we not have spoken up for the people of Blackpool who have given such tremendous support to the bid over the past six to seven years?</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/8">There were 11,500 signatures on the petition. Those were from people not just in Blackpool, but across the north-west. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> is entering the Chamber. May I say that 400 people from Manchester signed it? The reason was that they saw the Blackpool bid as a bid for the whole of the north-west. Obviously, we were going to be disappointed whatever happened. However, what has fuelled the anger, the sheer determination and the dogged persistence since <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase> in this House, in Blackpool and in the north-west has been the lack of coherence and accountability that went with the process and with Professor Crow's report. From the moment it was announced, there was criticism that the various elements of it did not add up. Crow failed to make himself available to a press conference. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood has already referred to his sneering remarks about managed decline. I sometimes wonder whether there may not be an afterlife for Professor Crow as a motivational speaker somewhere. I do not think that Churchill in 1940 or Mrs. Thatcher in the Falklands in 1982 would have thanked him for his observations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/9">We hoped that we could turn to the Department for a review, but we could not. Why not? Because there had been no detailed scrutiny of the measure. The Secretary of State brought the measure and the panel's recommendations to the House six and a half hours after that report was received and said that she was minded to accept it. In a subsequent meeting, Members of both Houses, including members of the Joint Scrutiny Committee, who did such an excellent and eloquent job, asked her to review the situation before laying the order. She did not. It was left to the Merits Committee to drag a reluctant Professor Crow to the House of Lords, where the Committee echoed all the misgivings that had been put to it already.</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/10">In a letter to their colleagues about the matter, Baroness Golding and Lord Lipsey said that it was a case of &quot;sentence first, verdict afterwards&quot;. Indeed, the Merits Committee brought out strongly how that had happened. It said about Professor Crow and the regional casino that a number of respondents said that</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/11" class="indent">&quot;to minimise the opportunity for 'casual' problem gambling the regional casino should not be located in close proximity to residential properties.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/12">That was supported by Professor Collins' memorandum, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/13" class="indent">&quot;an increase in problem gambling is likely to be inhibited...if casinos are located where they are unlikely to encourage people to gamble on impulse.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/14">The Merits Committee pointed out the lack of experience of members of the panel in the effects of social impact and regeneration. It said that in essence the panel was selecting candidates for research projects, and then said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/15" class="indent">&quot;The House may wish to assess whether the...needs of the...process may have over-dominated the Panel's recommendations to the exclusion of more common sense issues of where there would be least harm or where the regenerative power of a regional casino might matter most.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/16">Finally, it said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/17" class="indent">&quot;The Panel's interpretation of their sift criteria did not give high priority to the prevention of harmful effects to the community from gambling.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/18">In effect, the Merits Committee shredded Professor Crow's report, but with an elegant turn of phrase, as is the case in the House of Lords. It said at the end that it drew the order to special attention of the House on the ground that it gives rise to issues of public policy likely to be of interest to the House and</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/19" class="indent">&quot;may imperfectly achieve its policy objectives.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/20">When I read that I was reminded of the famous remarks of Emperor Hirohito when he had to go on radio at the end of the second world war to announce the defeat of Japan and said that the turn of events had not necessarily turned out to Japan's advantage. That was the basis on which the House of Lords talked about Professor Crow's report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/21">We hoped that there would be scrutiny in the form of discussion between the Department and the panel during this period, but in all the written questions that I have put to the Department on the issue I have seen no evidence of that. Indeed, the written responses glorify in the fact that there was very little communication between the Department and Professor Crow's panel, either before or after. Yesterday, in reply to a question asking how the panel reached its definition of social impact and what discussion there had been, I was told that there had been no discussion between the Department and the chairman of the CAP since the publication of the panel's report on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase>. Does that mean that the DCMS was entirely satisfied with the processthat the House of Lords Committee had said was narrow and flawed, or does it mean that it was so entirely hands-off that it abdicated all responsibility for the process?</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/22">Professor Crow's report rejected all the advice of regional planners, all the implications, all the matters that my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood referred to from the regional assembly and the regional development agency. This was at a time when the regional spatial strategy had been a key part of the DCMS's original strategy. It was one of the matters that dictated the timetable for this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/23">This is not just a Blackpool matter; it is a north-west matter. We in the north-west have all worked together on this. It is not an anti-Manchester matter at all. I rejoiced when Manchester got the Commonwealth games and did such a fantastic job with them. My hon. Friend and I, as secretaries of a departmental Committee, wrote a strong letter to the chief executive of the BBC urging that it should move to Manchester and Salford, so let it not be said that this is an anti-Manchester thing. We did not see this as a parochial decision. But if, on the basis of this precedent, independent planners are allowed to drive a coach and horses through the planning recommendations in regions, what does that do for the process of regeneration and for regional strategies?</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/24">All along, I believe that those of us who have been concerned about the order have tried to put forward alternatives. I have no desire to block large and small casinos and they would have to be reconsidered, as has already been said, in any order that came back. We suggested splitting the order. None of this has been properly taken on board. I have better reason than most in the House to know that the Secretary of State has worked hard over a long time to try to accommodate all the various elements of the twists and turns of the process. However, I say to her very gently this evening, as was said in the House about a Minister on another occasion in 1940, that she must not allow herself to be turned into an air raid shelter to shield the bad advice and incoherence of officials, advisers and unelected planners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/25">That brings us to the heart of things. The reason why the debate has taken off is not just the fair play issues and affection for Blackpool, but that the matter goes to the heart of Government and parliamentary process, and is a key question for us as Members and Ministers. We have always had advisory panels&mdash;good and bad&mdash;and the Government do not have to accept their recommendations, as we saw only last week with the recommendations in the Lyons report on the bed tax. The debate has generated such concern because it taps into a vein of feeling across the House&mdash;that we are in danger of acting as technocrats and not as politicians or representatives. It gives me no pleasure this evening to point that out to the Secretary of State and to Ministers&mdash;nevertheless, it has to be said. I and many of my colleagues who have grave doubts about the process do not believe that the order or the recommendations of Professor Crow represent either our party policy or Government policy on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/26">A few days after the decision was made Steve Richards wrote about its implications in <i> The</i><i> Independent</i>. He did not talk about the rights and wrongs of the Blackpool case, but about the process. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/27" class="indent">&quot;My concern is with the way decisions are made and who is held to account. Here was a classic example of an increasingly common phenomenon in which politicians are accountable despite having given their powers away to an anonymous panel.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/28">That is deeply and grossly unfair to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. It is her Department and her Ministers who have been receiving the anger of my constituents&mdash;not Professor Crow, who has gone back to the anonymity from which some of us thought he originally came. In those circumstances, it is right for me to say that I am genuinely grateful to my right hon. Friend for everything she has tried to do to accommodate the concerns of Blackpool and of people who are anxious about the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/29">I welcome the fact that there will be some form of scrutiny process, which was one of our central demands. However, as we have heard, that is something for tomorrow. I am talking about something for today&mdash;something that reflects on what has brought us to today. Ministers are not in this place simply to be messengers or rubber stamps, nor are we. I am grateful to the Secretary of State and to our Chief Whip for giving us time to debate the order properly, albeit not as lengthily as we wanted, but I am in no doubt about where my duty to my Blackpool constituents lies&mdash;it is to continue to stress my strong concern about the way in which the order was tabled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1588.0/30">Parliament will decide. The Secretary of State has said that. Let us take her at her word and send back the order, and in doing so exert the power and reputation of the House to do the job for which we were sent here.</p>

	<p pid="a.1592.2/1">This has been at times a passionate debate, with heartfelt contributions from both sides of the House. I am sure that over the past few weeks many hon. Members&mdash;like me&mdash;will have been bombarded by letters, reports and e-mails from Manchester, Blackpool and a whole host of organisations that are lobbying for and against different locations. However, the debate tonight is not about one location or the other; it is about getting the right decision. It is about Parliament getting the right decision and having the opportunity for full and proper scrutiny of the casino advisory panel's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592.2/2">There is one sentence in the Lords Committee report that resonates not only around the House, but among the many organisations that have concerns about gambling. The report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1592.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Adding maximisation of profit into the consideration...seemed to have a greater weight on the Panel's recommendations than minimisation of harm.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1592.2/4">The Government cannot feel comfortable reading those words when reducing harm and protecting the vulnerable were a crucial element of the GamblingAct 2005and central to their aims.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592.2/5">We heard a number of contributions. In his opening remarks, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> raised the interpretation of the casino advisory panel remit, the concerns of the Church, the uncertainty of the outcome of the regional casino in terms of regeneration and social impact, the casino advisory panel methodology and the changing and shifting of the criteria as the process went on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592.2/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">The hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> raised issues about the Secretary of State's last minute offers to her Back Benchers. Those offers do nothing to address the issues relating to the scrutiny of the order. He also spelled out the fact that, despite the Government's intentions to try to do something about the huge concerns over remote and internet gambling&mdash;I have heard Ministers address this matter before&mdash;clearly we still have no progress on that. Indeed, it is going to be difficult for any Government to do anything about remote or internet gambling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592.2/7">We heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1703" name="John Whittingdale">the Member for Maldon and East Chelmsford (Mr. Whittingdale)</phrase>, who has spent a considerable amount of time on the issue. He pointed out that the Government's problems began some years ago. There is a sense that, because the issue has gone on for years, the Government simply want the decision over and done with, thus denying Parliament the opportunity for proper scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592.2/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1385" name="Jeff Ennis">The hon. Member for Barnsley, East and Mexborough (Jeff Ennis)</phrase> spoke highly of the pre-legislative scrutiny process but said, with some sorrow, that he could not support his Government tonight. He was joined by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">the Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase>, who added their considerable insight to the debate. My hon. Friend pointed out the important difference between a destination casino and a casino that relies on ambient gambling, and the important difference in the impact that they have on local people and on the harm that gambling can do. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase> pointed out early on that the Secretary of State had a choice tonight: she could have split the order.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592.2/9">The hon. Members for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble) and for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden) delivered particularly passionate speeches, endorsing the message that we have heard from both sides of the House, which is &quot;stop and look again&quot;. The comments made by the hon. Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood were particularly fair and measured, bearing in mind her interest in a casino for Blackpool. She asked only for proper scrutiny, as she went to some lengths to explain. I am not quite sure what the Government Whips were promising her during the debate, but good for her for sticking to her guns, not just for her local constituents, but for Parliament. In contrast, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1705" name="Tony Lloyd">the hon. Member for Manchester, Central (Tony Lloyd)</phrase> persisted in telling us about Manchester's needs. The debate this afternoon is not about the needs of the people of Manchester; it is about&mdash;I say it again&mdash;proper parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.1592.2/10">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> rightly pointed out that there is some uncertainty<i> &mdash;[</i><i> Interruption.</i><i> ]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.1594.2/1">I am not aware of the shadow Chancellor recommending anything. None of us are recommending anything. We are simply asking the Government to stop. What on earth is the rush? The Government have spent so long considering this issue that I fail to understand why they need to rush ahead now. If they were intent on listening to Parliament, they would listen to what they have heard tonight and in the previous few weeks: Parliament wants more time. There is no reason at all why they should not give Parliament more time. The Secretary of State and her Ministers could then be satisfied that Parliament had scrutinised the matter and that the decision was robust. Hon. Members, not least Labour Back Benchers, would then be a great deal happier.</p>
	<p pid="a.1594.2/2">I urge right hon. and hon. Members, especially those who signed the early-day motion calling for more scrutiny, to vote against the order. Nothing that has been said in the debate has given any Member who signed the early-day motion a reason to change their mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1594.2/3">I reiterate that this is not about Blackpool or Manchester. It is not about the Secretary of State, or about voting with or against the Government. This is about Parliament. It is through us that Parliament can make the right decision that is based on proper scrutiny. We are in uncharted territory in which we face massive changes to gambling legislation, as the Government would admit. We will not and cannot support the order. I urge hon. Members on both sides of the House, especially Labour Members, to join us in doing what is, without doubt, the right thing and give us proper parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="a.1595.1/1">I think it is outrageous to attack their integrity. Professor Crow's integrity has been attacked this afternoon, and I think that is disgraceful. The panel took evidence around the country for 16 months, in every area in which there was to be a casino, whereas the Committee in the other place took 16 hours. The arguments against the order have been predicated on a report of a Committee that interviewed two witnesses for 16 hours. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman read the 150 pages of written evidence to the Committee, because he would find that different views were expressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1595.1/2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said earlier that this had been a transparent and open process delivered by a panel of professionals. When she made a statement to the House some eight weeksago on the issue, the hon. Member for East Devonsaid</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-28a.1604.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="1604"  time="019:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/debtext/70328-0020.htm#07032878001419">
	<p pid="a.1604.2/1">The Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase> will probably be feeling a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, because it was almost a year ago that I called an Adjournment debate in the House on the same subject, and the hon. Lady was answering on behalf of the Government, as she will this evening. My reason for holding the debate last year was to raise local concerns about the performance of the local ambulance service, the then Gloucestershire ambulance trust, which has since merged to become part of the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/2">Last year's debate followed a specific set of local incidents that highlighted the lack of ambulance cover in the Forest of Dean, which was of great concern to my constituents. We focused in particular on the trust's use of a matrix system to allocate resources, the result of which was to take ambulances out of the Forest of Dean and other rural parts of the county, and to focus on the urban centres of Gloucester and Cheltenham.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/3">Since then, one of my towns, Cinderford, has been given a higher priority in the matrix, which is a positive feature. Unfortunately, however, that has not improved ambulance response times in my constituency. In last year's debate, I expressed my concern about the impact of the merger on the services that would be delivered in rural areas, and the Minister said that the merger was occurring</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/4" class="indent">&quot;against a background of weak performance in relation to response targets from all three trusts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/5">Most importantly, she went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/6" class="indent">&quot;We are confident that, while recognising the local issues, larger trusts will deliver a better, more responsive, more efficient service, which people have a right to expect.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2006-02-07.229"><i> Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 7 February 2006; Vol. 442, c. 229-232WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/7">Unfortunately, the position has got worse since then. In my constituency at that time, about 48 per cent. of category A responses&mdash;that is, calls dealing with life-threatening cases&mdash;hit the Government's eight-minute target. A few months later, at the time of the merger, that figure had gone up to 53 per cent. That was still pretty appalling, but at least it was better. Since the merger, the performance has worsened, and the figure is now only 45 per cent., which is unacceptable. When we compare the performance in my constituency with that of Gloucester and Cheltenham, we find that 85 per cent. of the responses in Gloucester and 82 per cent. of those in Cheltenham are within the target eight minutes. That disparity is unacceptable. My constituents pay their taxes just as those in the urban areas of the county do, and they deserve excellent services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/8">The concerns that I raised last year have turned out to be closer to reality than the assurances that I received from the Minister. My reason for raising the issue again, a year later, is to keep up the pressure on the Government and on the new ambulance trustto provide better services for my constituents. The Minister will be aware that I raised the matter at Prime Minister's Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-21">21 March</phrase>. In response, the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/9" class="indent">&quot;In fairness to the ambulance and paramedic services in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, I think that he will find that they will tell him that they have improved considerably over the past few years. Massive investment is going into our ambulance services and paramedics, although of course we always have to improve on it.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-03-21.810"><i> Official Report</i>, 21 March 2007; Vol. 458,c. 810</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/10">Unfortunately, performance is not improving, and I have written to the Prime Minister to point out that fact. I suggested that he might like to use the opportunity presented by this debate to set the parliamentary record straight, and the Minister now has the opportunity to do that. The Prime Minister's answer did not accurately characterise the situation. I am sure that that was inadvertent and due to the briefing that he had received, but it clearly did not accord with what the ambulance trust has said.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/11">To be fair, the ambulance trust is grappling with one of the issues that the Minister and I discussed in our debate last year, namely, the growth in the emergency call volume, which is rising by about 10 per cent. a year, and in the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust by about 13 per cent. I am not clear&mdash;and, to be fair, I do not think that that trust is either&mdash;about exactly what is driving those increases. It cannot be the case that we are suddenly experiencing many more emergencies. Indeed, I have received anecdotal reports from the paramedics that my constituents in the Forest of Dean are quite reluctant to call 999. On the whole, when they do so, they have a serious problem. They do not tend to call an ambulance at the drop of a hat or in inappropriate circumstances. The evidence that I have seen suggests that that happens less in my constituency than in the urban areas. I would like the Minister to tell the House why the Government think that the call volume is rising. If it carries on rising at 10 per cent. a year without any increase in resources, it will be difficult for the ambulance service to cope.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/12">Anecdotally, paramedics have suggested to me that the change in out-of-hours services&mdash;whether real or perceived by constituents&mdash;has led to an increase, particularly at night, in parents with sick children and people looking after elderly relatives in distress calling an ambulance because of the lack of a speedy alternative response. I would be interested to know whether the Government think that that analysis is accurate, and what they propose to do nationally to address the growing call volume.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/13">Because of the difficult geography of Gloucestershire, with the River Severn running through the middle of it, the interaction between the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust and those operating in Wales is also an issue. In my constituency, Sedbury, which is the other side of the River Wye from Chepstow, is quite a long way from where the ambulances are based, and also has a significant number of emergency call targets missed. The area is difficult to cover from the rest of Gloucestershire, and I would be interested to know the extent to which liaison between the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust and the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust is possible and can be increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/14">To inform myself better, I spent a 12-hour shift with a paramedic crew last year. Watching their performance on the front line, I was impressed by the skill with which they handled calls, and by the effort that they put into responding quickly and safely to them. They are put into a difficult position when, through no fault of their own, they turn up after a significant period of time&mdash;between 20 and 50 minutes&mdash;and have to bear the brunt of the dissatisfaction of understandably distressed relatives or patients who expected the call to be answered more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/15">Another issue raised last year was the extent to which savings would result from a merger of the three ambulance trusts, and whether that money would be available to invest in front-line services. The Minister will be aware that deficits in the NHS were a significant issue last year. My understanding is that some of the savings from management reductions, rather than being invested in the front line, have effectively been used to plug deficits. Will the Minister comment on that?</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/16">The change undergone by the ambulance service has also had an impact on the feelings of ambulance staff, particularly in Gloucestershire. The evidence of meetings and letters, and of a blog that they have set up, suggests to me that a number of them are unhappy and disillusioned with the way in which the system is being managed. Let me share with the Minister one or two quotations from the staff blog, which, if she is interested, can be found at greatwesternambulance.blog.co.uk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/17">One contributor to the blog recognises that</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/18" class="indent">&quot;The expected &pound;1.6 million saving that we&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/19">the paramedics&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/20" class="indent">&quot;and the public were told would be re invested into front line services, has disappeared into the PCT&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/21">deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/22">Another contributor refers to being</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/23" class="indent">&quot;Fed up with driving from one end of the county to the other&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/24">rushing from job to job. A particularly interesting quote relates to the matrix system of allocating resources. Its contributor says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/25" class="indent">&quot;We were doing so well before the matrix came along then it all went down hill like Keanu Reeves on roller skates. It's never been any good since. Go back to the system that worked...Why do we have a two tier service? City and Town residents get a marvellous service, even the ones that like their alcohol. But live in any of the rural areas and you're forgotten and not cared about. Waiting half an hour to an hour for an Ambulance to arrive is not acceptable so why allow it?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/26">Finally, a contributor to a discussion about improving ambulance response times by implementing a satellite navigation system, asks:</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/27" class="indent">&quot;So Sat Nav makes you drive 20 plus miles in under8 minutes??&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/28">There is a certain amount of disappointment among the staff, and that is very worrying. In an organisation undergoing significant change, where staff deliver front-line care, it is very important for management to take people with them as they introduce that change. Otherwise, the organisation will not be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/29">My constituency is a rural part of the county. My constituents pay as much in tax as people in cities and towns but get a significantly inferior service. However, they are reasonable people: they know that it is difficult to deliver certain public services in rural areas, and they understand the challenges involved. Even so, the general view is that the disparity between the provision in Gloucester and Cheltenham and the provision in my constituency is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/30">On a positive note, over the first few months of this year the ambulance trust has introduced emergency care practitioners. I have talked about them before&mdash;I am due to meet some of them in my constituency next week&mdash;and it will be interesting to see whether they can help turn things around. They should enable faster response times by being based more locally in the forest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/31">Last week, an interesting article entitled &quot;On the Road with New Wave Medics&quot; appeared in my local newspaper <i> The Forester. </i>The reporter, Jenni Silver, found that emergency care practitioners could speed up response times, and she wrote that the presence of a practitioner</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/32" class="indent">&quot;twice...helped ambulance bosses reach their target times for Category A calls, and both times the ambulance wasn't needed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/33">The emergency care practitioners were able to assess the situation in a way that allowed better management of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/34">Obviously, I very much hope that that innovation will improve matters. The use of emergency care practitioners has only just started, so we do not yet know what effect they will have, but the article also discovered that ambulances from the Forest of Dean were</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/35" class="indent">&quot;having to wait outside Gloucestershire Royal Hospital for up to two hours to drop off patients on a Sunday.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/36">I accept that a Sundays is not necessarily a peak period, but the article shows that accident and emergency units at the hospital are running at capacity, and that there is little slack in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/37">The ambulance trust is also trying to use the fire and rescue service, and others, to deliver community responders. The scheme has been running for some time, and does not seem to have improved performance to any great extent. I support the idea, but my caveat is that it must be in addition to the existing service. It should not be used to replace ambulance cover where that is appropriate, and nor should it be used to massage the figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/38">I turn now to performance measurement. The current system for measuring response times is misleading because it overstates, rather than understates, the ambulance trust's performance. That may be surprising, given the appalling performance that I have outlined but, at the moment, the clock starts running when three pieces of information have been received&mdash;the nature of the complaint, the address of the patient, and a contact number.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/39">Sometimes, all those pieces of information will not be gathered until the ambulance has arrived. Last year, there were 45 incidents in the Forest when, according to the statistics, an ambulance responded before it was recorded as having been called. The statistics may look pretty appalling, but they actually show an artificially improved reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/40">Next year, the call-connect system will be introduced, with the clock starting the second that a call is received. That will lead to an immediate downturn in the statistics, but they will give a more accurate representation of the trust's performance. Most constituents start measuring the wait for an ambulance from the minute that they get through to the call centre after dialling 999. Although the new system will provide more realistic figures, the performance will look even worse than it does at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.1604.2/41">It is clear that ambulance coverage in the Forest of Dean is not good enough. The matter was raised last year with the Minister and, despite the assurances, the service has gone backwards. There appeared to be some significant problems with staff being taken through the changes. My constituents deserve, from the taxes that they pay, equitable service with the rest of the county. I hope that we will experience a dramatic improvement in performance in the next year, otherwise I assure the Minister that, with the leave of Mr. Speaker, we will be back at the same time in the same place to discuss exactly the same subject next year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2007-03-28a.1608.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="1608"  time="019:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070328/debtext/70328-0021.htm#07032878001420">
	<p pid="a.1608.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> on securing the debate. I do not know whether it is good or bad that the same Minister who replied last time is here again today. Obviously, I was keen to read the previous debate to ascertain what had changed between then and now so that I could provide as good a response as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1608.0/2">The hon. Gentleman raised several specific issues, which I shall try to tackle, but I shall ensure that information on some questions is provided by those responsible for the services in his area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1608.0/3">I pay tribute to the staff in Gloucestershire, especially the staff of the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust, for the hard work they put into delivering local services. I listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the comments on the blog site. Clearly, it is important to listen and I hope that those who manage services are examining the site to ascertain whether their substantial engagement is being shared and understood by those who deliver the services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1608.0/4">Clearly, since we last debated the matter, considerable investigation and planning of different ways in which services could be provided to deliver a better service across the piece has taken place. The specific challenges that the Forest of Dean presents have been better appreciated. Providing a better service for the future is also being considered&mdash;I shall go into that in more detail shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1608.0/5">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's point that some of the timings appear to have gone in the other direction since last year. However, having examined the previous debate in preparation for today's debate, I believe that efforts have been made to tackle the problem. Although the current figures clearly need to be improved, I hope that I can give some examples that will reassure the hon. Gentleman and his constituents that the direction is now the right one.</p>
	<p pid="a.1608.0/6">Ambulance trusts are the first and often the most important contact for the 6 million people who call 999 each year. The range of care that they provide is clearly expanding to take health care to patients who need an emergency response, and to provide urgent advice or treatment to patients who are less ill and care to those whose condition or location prevents them from travelling easily to access health care services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1608.0/7">We all appreciate that the sort of services that ambulances provide&mdash;and others such as emergency care responders and community care responders&mdash;are a long way from those that were available 20 years ago. People who need treatment want it to start as soon as the ambulance arrives. They do not necessarily want to wait until they get to hospital for treatment. That is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1608.0/8">Clearly, resources are also important. Spending on ambulance services has increased, with ambulance trust expenditure reaching &pound;1.45 billion in 2005, compared with just under &pound;620 million in 1997. That is a rise of 135 per cent., which has helped improve services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1608.0/9">The Government have set a standard that at least75 per cent. of all ambulance trust 999 calls from patients with immediate life-threatening conditions should have an ambulance respond to them in eight minutes. I am pleased to tell the House that the planned resources for the Forest of Dean area for 2007-08 will mean an increase in staff from 29 to 39 full-time equivalents. There will be an increase from three ambulances working 24/7 in 2006-07 to four daytime ambulances and two night-time ambulances in 2007-08. Six emergency care practitioners will also be provided. I hope that that shows that what I said in the previous debate about planning and using resources is happening. The plans will take effect from the next financial year, despite some of the challenges posed by deficits in the area. As we know, performance has improved over recent years, but we cannot be complacent. We also know that 98 per cent. of patients are overwhelmingly satisfied with the care that they receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1608.0/10">I appreciate the hon. Gentleman's concern that response times in his constituency to immediately life-threatening calls are currently too low. The Department collects data at trust level rather than by geographical area. Ambulance trust directions issuedin July 2006 required each trust to ensure that information in respect of its performance is recorded, collated and published for the trust and each of the trust's local areas. That ensures a level of not only transparency but accountability, which is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1608.0/11">Our latest published figures for the trust indicate that, as at 2005-06, 74 per cent. of immediately life-threatening calls were met by the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust, but as the hon. Gentleman has said, the response rate in the Forest of Dean has been low. It appears that it has gone in a slightly different direction from the lower figures that he mentioned in the previous debate. However, there are plans to raise performance across Gloucestershire to the national target levels by September this year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1610.0/1">I am sure that those responsible for services in the area are mindful of that. That is why I would like to explore as part of my contribution what is taking place not just in the Forest of Dean but in the area as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/2">The hon. Gentleman said that the new system under call-connect will give a greater sense of what is or is not happening at the most local level. Changes to clock start will be implemented from <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April 2008</phrase>. That is important. It will mean a better experience for patients, shorter waits for the phone to be answered and help to arrive and, I hope, improved outcomes, meaning more lives will be saved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/3">Ambulance trusts have embarked on a programme of service improvement. I understand that the Great Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust is changing its resource deployment. I mentioned earlier the increases in staff, ambulance provision and emergency care practitioners for the Forest of Dean, but of course that is being looked at across the trust as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/4">In rural areas the trust is moving to embedding ambulance practitioners within the Community, and I am advised that the Forest now has dedicated emergency care practitioner resources in Lydney. A second scheme is due to commence later in 2007 in Cinderford. Deployment of that type of resource allows for increasing numbers of patients to be treated nearer to home, avoiding long and unnecessary journeys to hospital. It also enhances the quality of the experience for the patient. Emergency care practitioners are also able to forge closer links with local general practitioners and community health teams further to enhance emergency and urgent care in communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/5">The changing model in urban areas will see increased use of ambulance practitioners as solo responders, deployed proactively to identify priority locations. That increase in solo capacity will reduce the need to utilise Forest-based resources in the urban areas. That point was of concern to the hon. Gentleman in the previous debate. I think that that has been taken on board as a way of improving and modernising services. That will support the improvement required in the Forest, as well as in the high-activity areas. That model has commenced in the past two weeks and has produced the anticipated improvement in response times, with Gloucestershire reporting over 75 per cent. for three consecutive days last week. Clearly, we cannot be complacent about those figures and we must recognise that there are still issues around the low performance rate in the Forest of Dean, but that indicates a step in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/6">Resources are important. To support trusts with improvements such as those, the Department made&pound;25 million in capital available to trusts this year to enable them to fund service delivery and infrastructure changes to go further and faster in improving performance. Underpinning all that is a developing work force who are being used to the best effect, and who are at the very heart of realising true transformation in the way care is delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/7">Driving that forward requires a different blend of skills and experience. For some staff, that will involve change, but it is about recognising the changes that are necessary to deliver the best service for everyone, not forgetting that sometimes staff may need those services and will want the best for themselves as patients, as well for the patients whom they serve. But again, contributing to that draws on the creativity of front-line staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/8">Community responders are clearly also a way of saving lives. New ways of working and modernisation can contribute to further improvement. Community responders are trained in basic life support and first aid and equipped with defibrillators. With emergency care practitioners, they can do more faster, and in some cases better.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/9">In order to improve first response performance, the trust has launched two community responder schemes at Coleford and Lydney in partnership with Gloucestershire fire and rescue service. I am informed that those schemes went live on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-06">6 December 2006</phrase>. They are trained in special access techniques such as line rescue, which further enhances the joint capability within the Forest. I understand that community first responder teams have also continued to expand with a further 15 responders being trained this month. The two teams that I mentioned in my last speech have gone live in Cinderford and Newent, so I am pleased that something that I said last time round has actually happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/10">The trust is also concentrating on business and leisure facilities, as well as schools, in order to embed life-saving skills and automatic external defibrillators into these environments. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that that is a good way to consider how we can differently provide better services for the future, particularly in places such as the Forest of Dean. Community defibrillation officers in the former Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire area were awarded funding of &pound;90,000 over a three-year period, and received 201 automated external defibrillators.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/11">The reconfiguration of ambulance trusts has meant that we are in a position to start accelerating planning and delivering a better service. It will give trusts the capacity and capability to improve standards and deliver world-class services. However, delivering change on the scale that is needed takes time. NHS ambulance trusts have more money than ever before with 135 per cent. more resources than in 1997. Now that the new management teams and structures are in place I am confident that services will improve. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will look in detail at what planning has already been provided for and what changes are already happening, and keep them under close scrutiny to ensure that they deliver the outcomes that he cares so strongly about.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/12">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the matrix system, which also came up in our last debate. That has proved helpful, but parts of it have clearly acted against some of his concerns, particularly about rural areas. An improved computer-aided dispatch system went live today and automatic vehicle location systems will come on line in June. That will provide better real time evidence about the volume of calls and the demands on different services, which will allow the planners better to match what is needed in different parts of his trust's area. Additional response cars have been provided in Gloucester and Cheltenham to support the matrix system and prevent resources from being constantly called out of the Forest of Dean. Again, that was a concern in our last debate, since when progress has been made, which I am pleased and reassured about.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/13">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree that improvements have been made at both national and local level. The dedication and skills of ambulance staff have made that possible and their continued efforts will turn into reality the improvements that we aim to continue to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="a.1610.0/14">I encourage the hon. Gentleman to continue his support for his local NHS services in their commitment to deliver and maintain high quality service, and join with those who have to make the positive argument that change is not always bad. It is often for improved services and opportunities for staff to engage in a way that they may not have been allowed to do or able to do in the past.</p>
