<p>I have a communication to make to the House. I have received, on the occasion of the death of Sir Winston Churchill, many telegrams expressing profound admiration and respect for him and sympathy for his family and for this House in the loss which we have suffered. They come from my brother Speakers of the Commonwealth; from the Speakers and Presidents of Upper and Lower Houses of Legislature, and from organisations and individuals from many and varying parts of the world. They are expressed in various languages. <br/>
In particular, I should tell the House that I have received, among others, messages from the President of the Chamber of Representatives of Belgium; from the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons; from the President of the Danish Folketing; from the President of the German Bundestag; from the Presidents, respectively, of the First and Second Chambers of the States General of the Netherlands; from the Speaker of the Knesset; from the Speaker of the Althing; from the Presidents, separately, of the Italian Chamber of Deputies and the Italian Senate; from the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Japan; from the Speakers of the Senate and House of Representatives of Kenya; from the Speaker of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea; from the Speaker of the Lebanese Parliament; from the President of the Chamber of Representatives of Morocco; from the President of the Norwegian Storting; from the President of the Turkish National Assembly, and I think I ought to add in this context, from

the President of Westminster College, Fulton, Missouri. <br/>
If time allowed, I should wish to read all these messages to the House, but that cannot be. So that they may be available to hon. Members, I will have the messages from the various Parliaments printed in the OFFICIAL REPORT. Even before I have been able to answer those messages, I should like to express, on behalf of the House, our deep gratitude for the thoughts which inspired the sending of them and for the sentiments to which they give expression.</p>

<p>Does my right hon. Friend recognise that not everybody, certainly on this side of the House, agrees with the need to suspend business for the whole of this week? Will he give an undertaking to the House that he and the Government are considering ways and means of regaining the time which the House has lost?</p>

<p>I should have thought that it would have been the wish of everyone in the House that the House should be suspended for this week. The contribution to this week is being made, in a sense, by the Government with three days' business, by the Opposition with one day's business today, and by back benchers through the loss of time on Friday and through Questions.</p>

<p>There are precedents for this. It has been found to be impossible so to adjust the roster as to start afresh and take this week's Questions next week. For that reason, the Questions this week are, in this sense, lost, unless hon. Members wish to put them down for another day.</p>
