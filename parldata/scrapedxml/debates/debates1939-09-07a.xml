<p>asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education how many children of school age are still in London; whether arrangements are being made for some kind of education for them in the schools; and whether it is proposed to give parents another opportunity to agree to the evacuation of their children at an early date?</p>

<p>I am not yet able to give the information asked for in the first part of the question. As regards the education of children remaining in London, the present position is that all schools in London and other evacuation areas remain closed for the time being. The question of making further arrangements for the evacuation of children is under consideration. It would be premature to give a more detailed answer at this moment, but hon. Members can rest assured that the whole matter is being actively considered.</p>

It is desirable that the scheme having been started should be retained, and I have been discussing with the Secretary of State for Scotland whether a broadcast should not be made on this matter this evening.</p>

I am glad to say that the scheme in general has worked smoothly and I should like to pay a tribute to the local authorities of both the sending and receiving areas, the transport authorities and all the voluntary workers and individual householders to whom is due the success of the arrangements for the assembly, transport and reception of the evacuated persons.</p>

<p>
On the assumption that by the cost plus system my hon. Friend means contracts by which the purchaser undertakes to pay the actual manufacturing cost of an article, whatever that cost may be, plus a profit calculated on a percentage of that cost, the answer to the first part of the question so far as this Ministry is concerned is" None." It is not, however, practicable to put all contracts out to competitive tender since many technical military stores are outside the sphere of normal commercial production and in a number of cases the demand of the Government equals the whole manufacturing capacity so that competition is excluded.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. The ship in question attempted deliberately to ram and sink a Government patrol launch, which was therefore obliged to fire on the ship in self-defence.

<p>Actual hostilities in the Far East during recent months have been on a very restricted scale, though operations of some importance appear to have been in progress since the beginning of May between Soviet-Mongolian and Japanese-Manchurian troops on the north-west frontier of Manchuria. In an aide-m&#x00E9;moire addressed on 5th September to the representatives in Tokyo of Great Britain, France, Poland and Germany, the Japanese Government have stated that they intend to concentrate their efforts on the settlement of their dispute with China. This communication goes on to say that the Japanese Government will be prepared to do their utmost to protect the lives and property of the nationals of belligerent Powers, should the latter decide to withdraw the armed forces, naval and military, which they at present maintain in those parts of China in Japanese occupation.<br/>
The conversations which His Majesty's Ambassador at Tokyo has been conducting on the subject of Tientsin are for the moment in suspense. His Majesty's


Government have, however, made it clear that they are not only willing but anxious to continue the conversations in the hope that agreement may yet be reached on all outstanding points. Meanwhile the situation at Tientsin is unchanged except in so far that it has been more complicated by floods. As regards the four Chinese nationals accused in connection with the murder of a Chinese official at Tientsin last April, His Majesty's Government have decided that, having regard to the decision of the High Court in London and to the notification previously made to the Chinese and Japanese Governments, these men could no longer be detained by the British authorities at Tientsin. Appropriate instructions were accordingly sent some days ago to His Majesty's Consul-General and the men have been handed over to the officials of the local Chinese court.</p>

<p>Except for a few posts the Ministry is now fully staffed, and all its divisions are in operation; but it has been in existence for less than a week, and I trust that neither the House nor the public will expect it to be in full working order in so short a time. It is organised in 14 divisions, gathered into four groups, the first dealing with news and Press relations and the censorship; the second with the application of publicity on a geographical basis, covering home, the Empire, U.S.A. and other foreign countries respectively; the third with the production of publicity in the form of films; wireless; literature and art; posters, advertisements, periodicals and pamphlets, etc., respectively, and the fourth with administration and co-ordination. Each division is under a Director, one with the rank of Deputy-Director-General; and the Directors, with the Director-General and Deputy-Director-General, who rank as the Permanent Secretary and Second Secretary respectively of a first-class Government Department, form the Executive Council of the Minister. The Minister is also responsible for publicity in enemy countries, which is dealt with in a separate branch of the Ministry. The Minister is also assisted by an Advisory Council, consisting of representatives of the several political parties, of the newspaper world and broadcasting, of business, of the Trades Union Congress and the cooperative movement, and other general or particular interests. The work of the Ministry at home is organised in a system of regions, corresponding with the regions under the Home Security Scheme, each under a Chief Regional Information Officer. I will circulate in the Official Report the names of the members of the Advisory Council; the members of the Executive Council and their chief divisional assistants; and the Chief Regional Information Officers.</p>

<p>The House will, I am sure, realise that it is impossible for me to give more than a general indication of the present situation and of the state of our defences. There is necessarily a number of matters to which, in the public interest, it is impossible for me to refer.<br/>
With that necessary preamble I will give the House a resum&#x00E9; of the position. In the East the Poles are fighting hard against a strong and ruthless enemy, who is relying on the weight of numbers and material to crush all opposition. The Polish soldier has ever shown himself to be a courageous and determined fighter; and, to-day, he is worthily maintaining this tradition. Against overwhelming superiority in the air, outnumbered and outgunned, he is contesting every yard of the German advance.<br/>
The Germans have often stressed the need for a short war and a quick decision. In pursuance of this idea the German plan appears to be to concentrate their first main effort against Poland, and as the House is aware, that country was invaded just over a week ago without any formal declaration of war. In spite of the human and material losses which they have already suffered, the morale and courage of the Polish people remain unaffected. His Majesty's Government and the French Government have to-day signed an agreement with the Polish Government for the provision of further financial assistance to Poland to enable her to replenish her resources.<br/>
In the West, France has, like ourselves, mobilised her forces with complete efficiency and smoothness, and they are now in contact with the enemy on their common frontier. Certain information has been published of what has taken place, but, for obvious reasons, no details can yet be disclosed. The outbreak of war has found the same spirit, determination, and solidarity among the French people as is evident here. The understanding between the two countries is complete, and the arrangements, which have now been put into force, for co-operation in all the activities concerned with the prosecution of the war are working smoothly and well.<br/>
In this country the defensive military dispositions of our Army, which cover a very wide field, were made in good time, owing to the precautionary measures which it was decided to adopt during the period of tension.<br/>
The manning of the Anti-Aircraft and Coast Defences was efficiently carried out. Within a short time of calling out the units, guns and searchlights were fully manned. Since a large number of the A.A. units were in camp and away from their home stations, this reflects great credit on their organisation.<br/>
The guarding of vulnerable points has been taken over by the National Defence companies supplemented by personnel of the Territorial Army. The personnel reached their posts with the minimum of delay and under trying weather conditions.<br/>
The mobilisation of the remainder of the Army has been carried out with the greatest smoothness. The morale of all ranks is high. In particular, the spirit of the reservists recalled from civil life, some of whom have already this year been called up for training, is excellent.<br/>
I should like to make special mention of the women of the Auxiliary Territorial Services, who are performing many tasks under arduous conditions and thereby relieving soldiers for fighting duties.<br/>
Turning to the naval side, the most important feature up to the present has been the development of German U-boat attacks on our shipping. The sinking of the "Athenia," with its scenes of death and terror, virtually opened the war, and no denials or inventions on the part of Germany will convince the public of German innocence of this crime which has profoundly shocked and horrified the world.<br/>
Apart from the case of the "Athenia," there have been attacks on other British merchant ships by German U-boats, and three or four ships have been sunk.<br/>
On our side, the Admiralty have taken immediate counter measures. British destroyers and other anti-submarine craft have been very active, and large reinforcements of anti-submarine and escort vessels are rapidly becoming available.<br/>
As my right hon. Friend the First Lord has already informed the House, steps are being taken to establish a convoy system at the earliest possible moment. This method of protection can obviously only be instituted after the outbreak of war, and it takes time to bring it fully into operation, but the House can be satisfied that it is being applied with the


utmost possible speed and vigour. Most of the ships which have been attacked hitherto are vessels which commenced their voyages before war had broken out, and naturally, for them the full scope of our defensive organisation could not immediately provide.<br/>
While a certain proportion of weekly losses must be expected&#x2014;and I do not minimise the threat to our shipping&#x2014;I think the House and the country may rest assured that the Navy, with all their war-time experience of handling this problem, and with the added advantage of the methods of submarine detection and destruction which have since been developed, will increasingly bring the problem under control.<br/>
I should next like to pay my tribute to the very gallant attack which was made by units of the Royal Air Force on certain German warships off Wilhelmshaven, during which at least two hits were secured on one of the so-called pocket battleships.<br/>
It will be realised that the objectives attacked, namely, the German Fleet bases at Wilhelmshaven and at the entrance to the Kiel Canal, are probably among the most strongly defended points in Germany. The manner in which the Royal Air Force attacks were pressed home, despite the strength of the defences, is worthy of the highest praise.<br/>
I should also mention the weather conditions prevailing on the afternoon of the attack. Visibility was extremely poor, and the final stages of the attack are stated to have been carried out in a blinding rainstorm. A high degree of navigational skill was thus necessary to enable the attack to reach its objective at all, and the fact that hits were registered demonstrates the ability of the Royal Air Force to carry out its attacks under conditions of great difficulty.<br/>
Finally, I think it right to stress the fact that a high proportion of the officers and men in the squadrons concerned have entered the Royal Air Force and received their training since expansion began. The House may also be interested to learn that those who took part in the attack included a number who came from the Dominions.<br/>
As the House knows, extensive reconnaissance flights have been carried out

over Germany on three successive nights during the last week by units of the Bomber Command. More than 10,000,000 copies of Notes to the German people have been distributed over a wide area of Northern and Western Germany, including the Ruhr. Although on each occasion the enemy defences were set fully in motion, no contact was secured by enemy fighters and all our aircraft returned safely.<br/>
The activity of the Fighter and Coastal Commands, if less conspicuous, has been no less intense. From the early stages of the emergency all squadrons of the Fighter Command have been at their war stations and in a state of instant readiness.<br/>
The Coastal Command has also been busily engaged in extensive reconnaissance over the surrounding seas in order to locate and destroy enemy submarines.<br/>
I now wish to say something of the organisation of the Home Defence Services, which is being rapidly completed.<br/>
The Regional organisation is functioning well. There is still some shortage of whole-time personnel, but this is chiefly now to be found in country districts.<br/>
The enforcement of the blackout is proceeding satisfactorily. With the help of the Air Force Reconnaissance every night, it has been possible to discover lights irregularly showing, and action is at once taken to deal with the offenders.<br/>
The Government decided last Thursday that the plans for evacuation, mainly in respect of school children, young children, and their mothers, should be put into operation.<br/>
Evacuation started on Friday morning; in a number of towns it was completed by Saturday; in London, where the problem is exceptionally large, it was completed by Monday. The operation has now been substantially completed and has covered, not only those towns for which plans had been worked out beforehand, but also a number of other vulnerable areas. So far approximately 1,475,000 children and mothers have been evacuated in the country as a whole.<br/>
The arrangements for evacuation and transport were carried out without a hitch, and those responsible for reception in the receiving areas have displayed remarkable enterprise, efficiency, and good will.<br/>
The process of assimilating this large increase of population in the receiving areas will take time and calls for tolerance and mutual understanding. Schools are to be reopened in the receiving areas as quickly as possible, and both public authorities and voluntary effort will be busily occupied with measures for the welfare of the children and for the assistance of the householders who are so generously providing homes for the mothers and children.<br/>
Over 200,000 hospital beds are to-day ready for air-raid casualties. Of those, 56,500 are in the London region, 15,500 inside the county and 41,000 outside the county. The beds in any region would, of course, be available to meet the needs of any other hard-pressed area.<br/>
Over 11,000 trained nurses, 4,000 assistant nurses, and over 50,000 auxiliary nurses have joined the Civil Nursing Reserve for service in hospitals and first-aid posts; but more of both trained nurses and auxiliaries are needed, especially women who can give whole-time service in any part of the country.<br/>
Nearly 2,500 doctors have accepted enrolment in the Emergency Medical Service, and acceptances are being received daily.<br/>
The Auxiliary Fire Service was mobilised, quickly and, on the whole, smoothly, and, in the main, the available fire-fighting units are being kept permanently manned and ready for action.<br/>
In London, for example, there are over 1,800 fire pumps ready for action, as against about 125 in peace time.<br/>
I hope that the statement I have made will show the House and the country that our war effort in its many aspects is rapidly gaining momentum. I know that it has behind it the full weight of all the people of this country, who are united in their conviction that no nation ever went to war in a higher cause.<br/>
We are greatly heartened by the knowledge that, in the straggle for the defence of liberty and free institutions and the preservation of all that makes life worth living, we can count on the support of the oversea members of the British Commonwealth.<br/>
Of their own free will and under no form of compulsion, save the moral com-

pelling force of right and justice, these self-governing nations have declared their intention of co-operating in a cause which is no less precious to them than it is to the people of the Homeland.</p>

<p>May I first, on behalf of Members of the House, thank the right hon. Gentleman for his statement. May I thank him also for his statement yesterday that it is his intention at regular and, I hope, frequent intervals to keep the House fully informed of the war situation. May I, however, express my regret that the circumstances of his statement to-day make it impossible for anybody to speak upon it, and express the hope that next week the statement will be of a character which may enable something, perhaps a little wider than supplementary questions to be put. I would like to put one or two questions to the Prime Minister which I should have preferred to put as statements, and if they are a little complicated I hope that Mr. Speaker will forgive me.<br/>
May I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he is aware of the state of the Press last evening; whether he is aware of the growing uneasiness in this House and outside it regarding the lack of information concerning the war; whether he is aware that yesterday we had a situation on a much smaller scale then, but very similar in principle to, that of last Saturday in this House; whether he is aware that wild rumours of a most fantastic kind were flying round this House; whether, in order to avoid that kind of situation and to maintain the spirit of the people, who are as brave and as keen as he and his Government, he will give us here and now a specific pledge that he on his part, without in any way making statements which ought not to be made in the public interest, which would be a crime, he will unbosom himself to the full when he speaks to us and the country in future; and that, whether things be good or bad, he will tell the country early; whether he is not aware that, had that magnificent statement he made about the Keil incident been published on the day of that achievement, it would have heartened our people; whether he is aware that if he tells them of a situation which appears like a temporary reverse it will not dishearten them but will make them more resolute? I put this very complicated question


because I feel that now, before things go far, the people of our land should know that nothing is to be withheld from them and that they are to be trusted with the truth, however distasteful it may be.</p>

<p>I think I can give a fairly simple answer to the right hon. Gentleman's complicated question. I am sure that he, and the House generally, will recognise that when we are bringing into instant operation a somewhat complicated machine there is apt to be a little creaking at first, but I can tell him that we fully appreciate the considerations he has put before the House, and that we had that very subject under discussion this morning at a meeting of the War Cabinet. He can take it from me that we will endeavour to deal with it in exactly the spirit which he expressed in his questions. We do not want to keep the public in the dark. On the other hand, we do not want to give them inaccurate information. Very frequently it is not possible immediately to be certain what the facts are. Of course, that does not necessarily exclude our saying something which, without giving all the facts, might give some of the facts about which there is no dispute whatever. We do not defend on its merits what has happened. We say that we agree that it might have been better done, but that these things have got to be found out by experience and that we hope to do better in future.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
This Bill comes to the House from another place, where it passed through all its stages yesterday. In regard to this Bill, as in the case of another recent Bill dealing with war damage, we are greatly indebted to the Uthwatt Committee for the labours which they undertook over a considerable period of time, and for their advice and recommendations, which have resulted in this Bill. I am sorry that hon. Members will not have had very much time to read the recommendations of that committee, as they were published only a few days ago, but fortunately this is a Bill which is not likely to excite any contentious interest. I propose to summarise what the Bill seeks to do and shall do so on the assumption that the House consists exclusively of laymen. It is a Bill to relieve bailees of their obligations. For the benefit of my lay colleagues, let me describe roughly what a bailee is. I should say that a bailee is any person having in his possession the goods of another person for whatever purpose. I except burglars from that category, and so perhaps I ought to have said "lawful possession." This Bill relieves such persons of the liability of bailees in respect of goods in their possession which suffer loss or damage as a result of war. War damage is very widely defined in Clause 8, as the House will see. It is defined as loss or damage
<q>caused by or, in repelling, enemy action, or by measures taken to avoid the spreading of the consequences of damage caused by or in repelling enemy action.</q>
At Common Law bailees are liable only for negligence. Provided that they act carefully in regard to the goods in their possession, there is no liability at Common Law. Certain exceptions to the Common Law which limited even the obligations of a bailee in regard to negligence were made in the Innkeepers Liability Act and by the law in relation to common carriers.

Apart from the Common Law, bailees remain liable, even where they have not been negligent, in respect of express terms in contracts of bailment that are made. An example of that is that a bailee may by contract make himself liable where he detains goods after the conclusion of the contract of bailment, or if he departs from the terms of the bail. The express contracts that exist between people who lend goods, or warehouse them, or perform other acts of bailment, impose such obligations as that the goods should be kept insured, that they should not be moved from place to place, and that the bailee should make himself responsible for all risks.<br/>
It is quite clear that most contracts of bailment&#x2014;perhaps the commonest cases are hire-purchase agreements&#x2014;were made in circumstances in which nobody contemplated that the hire-purchaser, the bailee, would render himself liable to compensation for war damage. The Bill excludes war risks from the contracts of bailees, except in cases where it is expressly provided for in the contract that the bailee is to remain liable. Even where there is an express term in a contract that the bailee will stand war damage, we propose to make two exceptions, which will cover the vast majority of the cases of bailment. They are to be found in the proviso to Sub-section (1) on page 2.In all hire-purchase agreements to which the Act of 1938 applies, or hirings for less than &#x00A3;20 a year, even if there is an express term in the contract saying that the bailee is liable for war damage, this Bill will relieve the bailee from all such liability.<br/>
Clause 2 deals with the similar situation arising in the case of people who have goods on sale or return. Goods under &#x00A3;25, as the House will see from the proviso, are in no circumstances to be subjected to liability for war damage in the hands of the holder of the goods, whether or not he has contracted to pay or insure for war damage. In relation to goods of greater value on sale or return, the bailee equally is not to be liable for war damage unless he has entered into an express contract to cover war damage according to the terms of the contract.</p>

<p>How does that affect people who are storing furniture?</p>

<p>They are covered under Clause 1. If the furniture


is damaged as a result of war damage, the warehouseman is not responsible except in the case where he enters into an express contract to cover war damage. If the furniture has been deposited under a contract made before the War, such a provision would be most unlikely to be in such contract. Clause 3 deals with the case of innkeepers and relieves them of liability. My hon. and learned Friends in the House may think that that is an overlap with Clause 1, but there are certain cases which seem to suggest that the innkeeper is not a bailee, so that it was thought wise to have the provision in for safety. Clause 4 deals with the case of pawnbrokers. The pawnbroker is subject to express statutory provision, and the scheme of Clause 4 is that the loss has to lie where it falls. If by fire pledged goods are destroyed, any obligation between the pledger and the pledgee is dissolved and the pledger of the goods will only be liable to pay any loan which he may have had if he comes along to redeem the goods.<br/>
Clause 5 deals with the somewhat curious situation of the person who has dutiable goods in store on which he owes duty. The first Sub-section relieves the owner from liability to duty where the goods are completely lost before the duty is paid. Sub-section (2) deals with the case in which goods are damaged in store, and two sets of circumstances have to be envisaged. The first is the class of case where the goods are subject to an <i>ad valorem</i> duty. That case did not present the Committee with very much difficulty. In the case of an <i>ad valorem</i> duty the owners are to be charged only on the value of goods undamaged, which seems a simple and fair way out. Much greater problems presented themselves to the Committee when they came to consider how to deal with goods which were charged not on their value but on their weight. It was not practicable to arrive at any simple solution, but the one which is proposed is that the person whose goods they are is to be given an option. He can either pay the duty and take the goods as they are, or he may surrender the goods to the Revenue and not pay the duty. That was the best that the Committee could suggest. Clause 6 is the Scottish application. Clause 7 enables the provisions of the Bill to be enacted by the Parliament of Northern Ireland. Clause 8, to which I

have already called attention, is the interpretation Clause. I hope that the Bill is non-contentious and fills a gap.</p>

<p>I have not had an opportunity properly to read the Bill or to appreciate (fully everything that it contains, but I should like to ask the Solicitor-General a question. The Bill relieves a bailee of his contractual liabilities, but how far does it relieve him from the consequences of his own actions? One can conceive of cases in which goods would be exposed to war damage through the negligence of the bailee. It is possible to think of circumstances in which a bailee would not take the precaution which he ought to take to protect goods against war damage. What would be the position of a bailee in such circumstances?</p>

<p>At the moment I am not certain what the situation is in the case which the hon. Member envisages. Practically all contracts of bailment are in writing and, therefore, oust the Common Law relation as to negligence. It is difficult to conceive of a contract of bailment which does not come within the scope of Clause i, that is to say, even in the case of negligence. If the resulting damage was due to war, the bailee would not be responsible.</p>

<p>I would like to ask a question in relation to Clause 4, which deals with pawnbrokers. In many working-class areas pawnbroking transactions are common. Paragraph <i>(b)</i> says:
<q>unless (in a case of damage) the pawner redeems the pledge, he shall not be liable to repay the loan.</q>
That is to say, he shall not be liable but if the owner redeems the pledge and pays the full amount to the pawnbroker, the owner will get a damaged article in return. Are any arrangements made whereby the pawnbroker will submit to the owner a statement of the original character of the article so that the latter may make a claim under war insurance, or is the owner only to have a damaged article in return for payment?</p>

<p>I cannot envisage a case of the kind which the hon. Member has in mind, where difficulties would arise under the War Insurance Act. I am not saying that it is not so, but, if I remember rightly, the Pawnbrokers Act of 1872 provides a method by which, in the case of fire, the value of the article could be ascertained by adding together the amount of the advance, the profit of the pawnbroker and 25 per cent., I think, over. So that Parliament has already fixed a value for the article in pledge, and if it was necessary to claim on the basis of value there is a method already by law by which that value could be obtained.</p>

<p>I would like to follow up the point that I put just now to the Solicitor-General. The hon. and learned Gentleman's view was that, where the goods had been destroyed or damaged by war, the bailee was relieved of all liability in relation to the goods. We have had very short time in which to consider the Bill, but it seems to me that on the face of it there is something of a flaw in the Bill. The bailee should take reasonable care to safeguard against war damage the goods which are in his possession. Obviously there are steps that could be taken in order to give reasonable protection to the goods, and surely the bailee might be expected to take them.</p>

<p>What the hon. Gentleman suggests is a re-writing of the contract. That is the very thing that not only the Uthwatt Committee, but the committee that considered this subject-matter during the last War, thought was most undesirable. At any rate let the contract stand and provide that the loss or damage is due to war, but do not seek so to re-write the contract as to impose on the bailee a totally new obligation. What the hon. Gentleman wants to do is to read into the contract an obligation to do something to protect against war damage.</p>

<p>I want to make it a responsibility for the pawnbroker, where the owner redeems a pledge on goods damaged as a result of war, to supply to the owner, on the redeeming of the pledge, a statement based upon the


pawnbroker's liability, so that the owner would be in a position, if there was an opportunity of making a claim, to make it. It is very desirable that where damaged goods are being recovered and the loan on them is being repaid such an estimate of value should be handed to the owner by the pawnbroker.</p>

<p>I do not think that that would be an appropriate addition to the Bill. It might be a very appropriate addition to the Pawnbrokers Act. Let me try to make clear to the hon. Member what T think would probably be the case. He is assuming that at some time or other the owner of the pledged goods will be able to get compensated by the Government. Suppose that someone has deposited a watch and chain, and the chain is destroyed but the watch remains. The amount advanced on both was &#x00A3;10. As I have explained, I think I am right in saying that there is an easy method, under the Pawnbrokers Act of 1872, by which the owner of the articles can find out their full value. It would mean the adding up of the three figures I have already mentioned. He is able no doubt to obtain from the pawnbroker a receipt for the amount of the pledge. It is not necessary to have a provision in this Bill to enable the owner to obtain that from the pawnbroker. No doubt the receipt would vouch for the fact that the owner did not receive the chain back. It seems to me that that is all the material the owner wants in order to make a claim for what he has lost, and I do not think that any specific provision in this Bill will be necessary.</p>

<p>This is not a question of a watch and chain. It is a very common practice in many working-class districts for people to pledge boots and shoes and clothes and all sorts of things. In ordinary circumstances it is quite possible that if these goods were damaged the owners would not want to have them back, but in present circumstances it may be very difficult to get new boots and shoes and owners may even want to redeem their pledged clothes or shoes, even though they were damaged. It seems to me that it would be simple to insert in the Bill a provision that in the circumstances the broker should provide them

with an estimate with the amount of the damage done.</p>

<p>I beg to move, "That the Bill be now read a Second time."<br/>
This Bill, though formidable in appearance and containing 16 Clauses, many of them of a technical and complicated character, has a purpose similar to that of recent emergency legislation that we have passed affecting the making up of the pay and the preservation of the superannuation rights of local government staffs and teachers. It enables the appropriate authorities to supplement the pay of police and firemen, while they are serving in any of His Majesty's forces, and it makes provision for the continuity of their superannuation and pension rights. The machinery necessary to achieve these results is somewhat complicated, and the first seven Clauses of the Bill are devoted to this.<br/>
Clause 1 enables the authority to supplement the pay up to the figure which the constable or fireman would be receiving if he were not serving in the Forces, and that provision may be continued by the authority for a period not exceeding one year after the termination of the war. That, of course, is to cover any hiatus which may occur between the discharge of the reservist from the Forces and his resumption of his occupation as a policeman or fireman. Under Clause 2 the period of war service, as extended, if necessary, under Clause 1, is to be reckoned for superannuation purposes. Under Clause 3 a man whose pay is supplemented under Clause 1 has to pay the appropriate contributions towards the fund from which his pension ultimately will be drawn.<br/>
Clause 4 is exceedingly complex. It deals with grants to be made either to the widows and dependants of police constables or firemen, or to the men themselves in the case of incapacity as a result of war service. The Clause is complicated because the existing statutory provisions are different in respect of police constables and firemen respectively, and because, in the case of the police forces, there are already three different scales upon which pensions are calculated, those scales depending, in the first instance, on whether the injury is received in the course of the man's duty as a policeman or under ordinary civilian circumstances; and, secondly, if the injury is received in the course of a man's duty as a police officer, whether the cause is accidental or otherwise. It is because there are

these varying scales of pensions, and because the positions of firemen and of police constables are different under Statute, that Clause 4 is so cumbersome. Clauses 5 and 6 merely provide machinery consequential on the preceding Clauses.<br/>
Clause 7 exempts from the provisions of the preceding Clauses certain firemen who have exercised an option which they possess to be treated as local government staff. Those firemen, of course, will be covered by similar legislation which was passed in respect of local government staffs a few days ago. Sub-section (2) of Clause 7 operates so as to take out of certain Clauses of the Bill certain firemen for whom special schemes are already in existence under local legislation. In London, Birmingham, and certain other places there are in existence schemes providing, under local legislation, for superannuation. Clause 7 requires these schemes to be amended so as to conform with the preceding Clauses.<br/>
The remaining Clauses of the Bill do not in any way touch the question of police officers' or firemen's pay during war service, or the question of superannuation and pensions, but deal with quite other matters. Clause 8 provides that a policeman who is on probation at the time he is called up for military service shall continue to serve the remainder of his probationary period when he resumes his occupation in the police force. Clause 9 provides that re-attestation shall not be necessary on completion of war service. Clause 10 is an important Clause. It operates to prevent either a chief officer of police or a constable or fireman retiring in the ordinary way on pension as long as the war continues. Retirement will be possible only, in the case of a chief officer, with the consent of his authority, and, in the case of other ranks of the two services, with the consent of the man's chief officer. I would draw the attention of the Committee to the fact that under this Clause any pension rights which have already accrued are preserved from possible forfeiture during the remaining period of police or fire service.<br/>
Clause 11 is a little technical, but what it in fact provides is that injuries received by police constables or firemen serving on what we may call the home front will result in the man drawing pension at the


highest of the various scales. Clause 12 is a small piece of machinery, and extends to firemen the right, already possessed by police pensioners, to undertake temporary service under local authorities during a war without forfeiture of a pension of which they are already in receipt. Clause 13 brings within the scope of the Bill any police constables or firemen called out under the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces Act or undergoing training under the Military Training Act. The remaining Clauses do not, I think, need any detailed description, but I shall be pleased to answer any questions on any of the Clauses during the further stages of the Bill.</p>

<p>We have not had time, of course, to study the Bill in any proper fashion, but the hon. Gentleman has given an account of it from which I may draw general conclusions. I think there "may be particular points, however, which should be looked at more closely. My hon. Friend the Member for North Camberwell (Mr. Ammon) has had more experience of these matters than I have, and he may follow me to put some questions. One question which I should like to ask is whether I rightly understand that the additional financial obligation provided for in the first part of the Bill will fall partly on local authorities and partly on the police themselves? Will any of it fall on the Treasury? Perhaps the hon. Member will give an answer to that question.</p>

<p>Like every other hon. Member of this House, I have not had very long to look at this Bill. As the Minister says, Clause 4, which is one of the most important Clauses, is exceedingly complicated. That may be the reason why I fail to appreciate all the provisions. The Bill deals with a policeman or a fireman who, while serving in His Majesty's Forces during the period of the present emergency, either loses his life or is so incapacitated by wounds or disease that he incurs that he is unable to resume his service as a constable or fireman. It is provided, in the first place, in the case of a policeman who is incapacitated, that the appropriate authority might increase the amount payable up to a certain maximum. Where the man has died, and it is a question of paying a pension to his widow such pension may be paid if the appropriate authority thinks fit. The maximum is the amount that the man could have received under any scheme if he had remained in his ordinary employment and had been killed or injured in that employment. Why is this part of the Bill left optional? I can see in the earlier part of the Bill, when it is a question of making up a man's salary, that there are good reasons for leaving it optional. We did it with regard to local government officers. Where a man has been incapacitated because of war service or loses his life through war service, surely he or his widow should have an absolute claim to pension, without leaving it to the option of any employing authority. Why has the Bill been drafted in that way, and why cannot we see our way in this case, where the man makes the great sacrifice, to give the pension rights and not leave it to discretion whether or not pension is given?</p>

<p>I understand that the Bill concerns the regular members of the police and fire services and takes no account of the auxiliary services, and that it embraces a question which has been before the House on many occasions known as "war services to count." A man may serve in the Army or Navy, as the case may be, and on his return to civil life the actual service


in the Army or Navy is allowed to count towards his Civil pension.<br/>
No doubt the hon. Gentleman will make that point clear in this connection. If that is so, it will take into account that which would be due to a man in his ordinary progress in the service and what might accrue to him with regard to promotion. If the Bill does not do that, it will not fulfil what it sets out to do, and what the hon. Member, in introducing the Bill, said it would do. The pension fund at present is a limited one. Within a certain time a number of men will fall due for pensions. There is a fund to meet such an emergency, but what will happen if there are increasing and abnormal demands. This is a tripartite contribution, and I should like to know whether the fund will be maintained and kept in sufficient strength by contributions from the Treasury alone, or will there be an increased demand made upon other contributors to the fund? Unless something of the kind is done, it cannot be long before the fund will be bankrupt.<br/>
Does the Bill also mean that dependants of such men who come on to the pension fund will not come under the Ministry of Pensions? Is the Ministry of Pensions to be relieved of responsibility at the expense of funds raised by various authorities concerned with police forces? That is a point of some moment, and particularly will it be so when, we hope before long, things return to normal, and people have to consider their pension rights. There is the question of the person who will not be allowed to retire when he has reached pensionable age until after the war period. In certain departments of the Civil Service a man very often reaches pensionable age before he has been able to put in the maximum period of service entitling him to full pension. I suppose that the man who has reached pensionable age and has been asked to stay on will be allowed to count the extra service for pension, so that he can possibly receive the maximum. If there should be an abnormal number of people coming on to the fund at a more rapid rate than otherwise would be the case, it would throw upon the local authorities a much larger expenditure than would be the case under ordinary circumstances; and I think that the State ought to take over a very much

larger share of responsibility in this matter.</p>

<p>There are two small points which I wish to raise. One is that I think it will be necessary, sooner or later&#x2014;if not in this Bill, then elsewhere &#x2014;to provide for some form of arbitration or some outside authority where local authorities have contracted out of their responsibility by insuring themselves against accident with some industrial insurance company. The contract of insurance cannot possibly coverall the contingencies which are bound to arise, as contemplated by the Bill, and it seems 1o me that the Home Office should take powers, either direct or through some third party, for arbitration to consider the point.<br/>
A further point is the relation of the Minister of Pensions to such cases as these. It is most important that the Minister of Pensions should have full control, if by any means possible, of all pensions which are payable on account of war injuries. The Ministry of Pensions have an unrivalled system of looking after the pensioners, of providing them with artificial limbs, and various aids which are necessary on account of their injuries, and also for their rehabilitation. It would be a disaster if the thousand odd local authorities had to look after war pensions locally, with no centralised arrangement, and I would urge on all the Government Departments concerned that they should see to it that there is a link between the local pensions which are payable, from whatever source, and the Ministry of Pensions, for the purposes of administration.</p>

<p>I can well understand the necessity of passing these Bi11s in emergency, but it is unfortunate that a Bill like this should have to be rushed through. I am very deeply concerned about Clause 4 and the implications that may arise out of it. The hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot) has referred to the permissible character of that Clause with regard the grant of pensions or allowances to the widow and the children under 16. It is obvious that if a man has been a policeman or a fireman and he becomes a soldier and loses his life as a result of the war, his widow and dependants will be entitled to pensions and.


allowances through the Ministry of Pensions, and anything that is provided for in this Clause will, presumably, be a supplementary grant. There are, however, certain local authorities that are in a condition of the most extreme poverty, while other local authorities are better situated. It might easily transpire that one pension was being supplemented by a grant from one local authority while another pension was not being supplemented by another local authority. That would be a very undesirable position of affairs to happen in any part of the country. It seems to me that Clause 4, in particular, and the Bill in general require much more consideration. The Minister has referred to Clause 4 as being very complicated, and it certainly needs more consideration.<br/>
I am also concerned with regard to Clause 8, which refers to a policeman who is on probation. He may have only three months still to serve on probation at the time that he is called up or joins up to serve in the Forces, but according to this Clause, after he comes back he will return to the same position in regard to probation that he was in before he joined the Forces, and will have his period of probation to complete. In many cases the experience that he has gone through in the armed Forces will have fitted him, on return to civil life, for going into the police force, without having to serve any further period of probation. The Clause says that:
<q>he shall serve on probation for so much of his period of probation as was unexpired at the time when he ceased so to serve.</q>
I do not like that provision, and some Amendment ought to be made. I am, however, particularly concerned about Clause 4, and I suggest that the Minister should agree that even after the Bill has passed, he should appoint a small committee of those who have very wide experience in these matters, and authorise them to examine the Bill carefully to see where its weaknesses are and how it can be strengthened, and whether it is possible that, instead of the local authority having this permissive Clause in connection with the grant of supplementary pensions, it could be made obligatory on local authorities. Perhaps the Minister could make a statement of that kind. It might be made a condition in the Act that the local authorities could get a return from the State of the cost of these particular pen-

sions or allowances. I would urge the Minister to consider the setting up of such a committee, to consider whether the Bill will accomplish all that is desired, and to decide whether or not it may be necessary to bring in amending legislation.</p>

<p>I will deal with the points that have been raised, in order that it will not be necessary to raise them on the Committee stage. The hon. Member for Dundee (Mr. Foot) and the hon. Member for West Fife (Mr. Gallacher) both raised the question of Clause 4. That Clause provides, in Sub-section (1), that if a constable is serving in His Majesty's Forces and he loses his life under the conditions contemplated in the Sub-section, it would be obligatory upon the authority to pay a pension to the widow and dependants at the lowest level of the scales which are provided, but they have in the proviso permission to increase the pension beyond that figure. If the hon. Members will turn to Sub-section (4), they will see that the maximum pension which may be granted is the highest of the police scales, when aggregated with the amount of any grant which is also payable to that person out of any naval, military, or Air Force funds, in pursuance of any Royal Warrant or other instrument. The assumption is that in every case the Service pension will be received, and the appropriate authority has to supplement that pension. The maximum would be the highest of the scales at present available, and the minimum would be the lowest of the scales at present available; but what we should find in practice would be that the addition of the war pension would bring practically all the pensioners on to a scale very nearly approximating to the highest scale at present in force. I am afraid this is rather a complicated matter, but that is the position so far as police constables are concerned.<br/>
There is a difference in regard to firemen, who are provided for in Subsection (2), because the Fire Brigade (Pensions) Act does not provide for a widow's pension or gratuity in a case where the fireman dies otherwise than as the result of injury incurred on duty. Whereas the widow and dependants of a police constable receive a pension irrespective of the circumstances under which the death occurs, the widow and dependants of the fireman receive pension


and allowances only if the fireman dies in the discharge of his duty as a fireman. But, where war service is concerned, the appropriate authority may grant the pension appropriate in the case where a man dies on war service in supplementation of any service pension which his widow or children may receive.</p>

<p>Surely, if the authority does not exercise its discretion in favour of the widow, she will be left worse off if her husband has died on active service than if he died while serving as a fireman.</p>

<p>That might be so, if the rates of service pension were lower than the rates of fire brigade pension existing at the time, and it is because of that contingency that this provision is placed in the Bill to enable the appropriate authority to supplement the pension and bring it up to a fair figure.<br/>
The hon. Member for North Camber-well (Mr. Ammon) asked me whether increments of pay would be taken into account in reckoning the supplementary pay which may be granted while these men are on active service. The answer is, "Yes." As regards maintenance of the pensions fund, there again the provisions are somewhat complicated. In point of fact the police authorities do not set aside a separate pensions fund. The rateable deductions are made from the constable's pay, and the pensions are paid out of the general fund.</p>

<p>The Clause deals with rateable deductions to be made from the policeman or fireman while he is serving in His Majesty's Forces. Those deductions will continue to be made if the man's pay is being supplemented, or he is receiving as much as or more than he would have received in his civilian occupation. I do not see how under the Clause the Police Fund is going to suffer. It is going to continue to receive the subsidies that it is receiving at present; therefore, it will not be any the smaller by virtue of anything contained in the Clause.</p>

<p>I beg to move:
<q> That the Additional Import Duties (No. 6) Order, 1939, dated the nineteenth day of July, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, made by the Treasury under the Import Duties Act, 1932, a copy of which was presented to this House on the said nineteenth day of July, nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, be approved.</q>
I have to trouble the House with these Import Duties Orders, which were brought in under entirely different circumstances and, of course, have no relation to the conditions which exist at the moment. I can easily explain why it is necessary to maintain these duties. They were imposed just before the House rose in July, and unless this Resolution is passed they will lapse in a day or two. We have within the last few days passed an Act

which removes from the Import Duties Advisory Committee the authority for the imposition or reduction of duties of this kind and places it upon the Treasury. When that is done it will be necessary to take a general review of the duties which are now imposed, including in particular the complicated system of duties on iron and steel goods many of which have relation to a European cartel which, of course, is likely to be quite inappropriate in war time. It is quite clear that a review of this kind must take a certain amount of time, and there will be an interval before the Treasury will be able to bring forward under their new authority a new plan dealing with orders of this kind.<br/>
It would be unfortunate if these duties, which have been on since last July, were allowed to lapse pending that general review, because the result would be that in a certain number of cases additional duties would have to be imposed on iron and steel products coming from such countries as Sweden, Holland, and Belgium, when it may be to our interest to get them in at the lowest possible rate of duty. It is clear, pending the general revision of these duties which will now have to be taken, that it is wise to keep the whole range of duties as they are now and not by allowing them to lapse to have to increase certain duties which then, after a general review, we shall want to remove. That is the reason why I move the Resolution. It is well to keep the position stable until we have had a general review.</p>

<p>I should like a further explanation. When I saw that we were going to discuss these Orders to-day I thought we were living in a world of bedlam. A little light has been thrown upon them by the right hon. Member, but even so it seems remarkable that we should be imposing additional duties on iron and steel products at the moment. I should have thought that if a general revision of the duties was necessary, it would have been quite easy to undertake that general revision without this particular increase being put on or being confirmed. The only argument the right hon. Gentleman has brought forward is one which I find difficult to follow. He said that if we failed to confirm these Import Duties Orders, it would then be


necessary for the Treasury to place additional duties on steel goods coming from certain countries, and he mentioned Sweden. He said that in the present circumstances it would be an unfortunate thing to do. I may have failed to follow his argument, but it is difficult to see why, if we do not confirm import duties which we no longer need it should necessitate an immediate imposition by the Treasury of a new set of import duties.<br/>
We have, of course, an entirely different situation in regard to imported goods. There are goods which we need and goods which we do not want. If they are goods which we do not want, the President of the Board of Trade has power to exclude them entirely under the Act which we passed the other day. If they are goods which we want in our war economy, it is difficult to see why we should impede their importation by keeping tariffs on, and increasing in some cases the duties, if only for a short time.</p>

<p>I can give the hon. Member a very short answer. The effect of these Orders is, on the whole, to reduce the duties on goods from our principal suppliers, but to increase duties upon two classes of competitors, such as Japan, in one class of goods; and therefore, the general effect of not passing the Orders would be to allow the duties on the larger part of the imported goods to go back to what they originally were, although it is true that would reduce the duties on the smaller part. The main effect of the Orders is to reduce the duties, and if the Orders were allowed to lapse, the duties would be higher.</p>
