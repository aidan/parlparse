As is the case with passports, those costs will be met in the main by fees rather than by a call on public funds. I have said that within our current estimates it will be affordable to set a charge of &pound;30 for a stand-alone identity card issued to British citizens.</p>

	<p pid="b.1117.7/1">I always hesitate to ascribe rationality to the House of Lords in its decisions, but it is legitimate to address the costs issues, as Members of both Houses have concerns about them. We have worked them through carefully. My hon. Friend is right to say that for a stand-alone card &pound;3 a year is the figure that we have in mind, and the benefits of the reform would be massive for the whole country.</p>

	<p pid="b.1117.8/1">For the 38 million people who are likely to have to register for an ID card&mdash;those over 16 and those who have been here for more than three months&mdash;can the Home Secretary tell us what the cost will be of the combined passport and ID card? If the estimate of &pound;5 billion over 10 years is correct, it is on my calculation likely to be in excess of &pound;120.</p>

	<p pid="b.1117.9/1">The hon. Gentleman is wrong. As I have indicated before, the average annual cost of passports and ID cards is unchanged at about &pound;584 million a year. We estimate that the cost per joint passport and card would be some &pound;93. The fees have not yet been set: they can be set only if the legislation is passed by a vote of Parliament on the precise fee regime, but &pound;93 is our combined estimate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1118.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" speakername="Paul Flynn" colnum="1118"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.1118.0/1">Can we define the difference between Bill Gates's suggestion for the near future and what the Government suggest? Bill Gates's suggestion is for a link between the biometric information and one single card, which is a relatively simple matter. However, the Government suggest that there should be a differentiation between the information on one biometric identifier and many millions of others. The process that has been suggested by the Government is many millions of times more complicated and more expensive than what Bill Gates suggests. Can my right hon. Friend give us some information on that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1118.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" colnum="1118"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.1118.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an interesting comparison. I have not studied Bill Gates's proposal in detail, but I understand that he argues that the national identity register, which we are introducing, with its 13 biometric identifiers, would give the assurance that at some point in the future the biometric identifier itself, rather than the card, could provide the identity security that is required. Obviously, my hon. Friend is right to say that it would be simpler if we had one identity system for the whole country for every time that identity needs to be checked, but many arguments have been made in this House and elsewhere about the disadvantages of having one database for everything. Instead, we have one narrow database that enables everybody to secure their own identity, which we think is a major step forward.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1118.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" speakername="Peter Bone" colnum="1118"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.1118.2/1">The Home Secretary has told us that his estimate is &pound;584 million per year, which is a lot of money. However, some hon. Members will be a little sceptical of Government estimates, because in the past they have been woefully out. Would the Home Secretary stake any money on the &pound;584 million being reasonably accurate, or does he think that the figure might go up?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1118.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" colnum="1118"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.1118.3/1">Actually, I think that it is accurate and likely to go down, rather than up. The nearest major IT project in the area was for the passports agency, which was widely criticised five or six years ago. Its IT programme now handles some 40 million to 44 million database files and had the most efficient public service in the country, beating major private sector providers from the consumer point of view, such as Amazon, eBay and Virgin, as the result of a major effective public sector IT investment, changing the quality of life for everyone.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1118.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1418" speakername="Lynne Jones" colnum="1118"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.1118.4/1">According to parliamentary answers I have received, the cost of operating and maintaining the verification services is not included in the &pound;93 charge to applicants. What is the Government's estimate of that particular cost? How much will be met by the public sector, how much is to be met by charges and what are my right hon. Friend's assumptions about the number of people who will want to use the verification services and the charge that they will be asked to bear? I understand that when potential users were offered a charge of 57p, not many were keen.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1119.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" colnum="1119"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew9">
	<p pid="b.1119.0/1">I have just published overall figures for verification and all the other services, but three sources of income will deal with the charges. The first is the fees themselves, which is why I said that fees would make up the giant's share, rather than a call on public funds. The second is a small contribution from public funds, which is the only amount that could be spent on other things&mdash;as is widely alleged&mdash;and the third is income that could be derived from contracts with organisations that use the database. Those are important factors, which is why I was able to tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> a moment ago that I think the figure will end up being less than &pound;584 million, although I think that is a firm and strong estimate.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1119.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" speakername="Alistair Carmichael" colnum="1119"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew10">
	<p pid="b.1119.1/1">Why does not the Home Secretary demonstrate the courage of his convictions by allowing the Lords amendments on costs to stand? Surely, if his scheme is costed and affordable he should have no problem in demonstrating that before bringing it to the House for implementation?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1119.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" colnum="1119"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew11">
	<p pid="b.1119.2/1">We have no problem in demonstrating that and have done so, but the amendment tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> is of a rather more profound nature. It states that there should be a regular report to the House setting out the full cost situation so that the House can debate and consider it as it wishes. That is a rather superior way of doing what the House of Lords was edging towards. The amendment also reflects concerns expressed, fairly, on both sides of the House about whether the cost system is under control. A system of six-monthly reports is a good way of dealing with that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1119.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" speakername="David Davis" colnum="1119"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew12">
	<p pid="b.1119.3/1">The Liberal Democrat spokesman made a good point: few people really believe the Home Office numbers and the House of Lords is trying to find a way of establishing a reliable figure. Let us take things out of arcana such as the billions and House of Commons procedure. If the Home Secretary was trying to pay for a capital project, such as a house extension, and the contractor came to him and said, &quot;I know I've overrun before on money and time. I'm not going to give an estimate because that upsets my subcontractors, but I'll let you know every six months how much I've overrun&quot;, would the right hon. Gentleman accept that contract? The answer of course is no, so why should the House of Commons accept that from him?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1119.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" colnum="1119"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew13">
	<p pid="b.1119.4/1">I must say that I think that the right hon. Gentleman has put it completely the wrong way round. If I indeed wanted work done on my house, as he suggests, I should first make a clear estimate of what I was ready to spend and on what; secondly, I would not tell the bidders how much money was available for them and, thirdly, I would establish a contract to be tendered for on a competitive basis. That is precisely the right way to give us value for money.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1120.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" speakername="David Davis" colnum="1120"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew14">
	<p pid="b.1120.0/1">Let us test the process against some real figures. The right hon. Gentleman cited the passport agency, which nobody in their right mind would hold up as a serious project, so let us try some others. In the green book, his right hon. Friend the Chancellor pointed out that 54 per cent. of Government IT projects fail. Since 2001, four major projects in four Departments have gone seriously wrong; their collective budget was about &pound;9 billion and they overran by &pound;33.9 billion&mdash;nearly &pound;34 billion. Can the Home Secretary name one IT project costing more than &pound;1 billion that was on time and on cost and delivered what it was supposed to?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1120.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" speakername="Charles Clarke" colnum="1120"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-01.htm#60213-01_spnew15">
	<p pid="b.1120.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the passport agency, which has done precisely that. It is a ridiculous state of affairs for the right hon. Gentleman to assert that no Government can ever organise an IT project in the interests of the country. I am perfectly well aware that there are major issues in both the public and private sectors about major IT projects. As somebody originally from the private sector, the right hon. Gentleman will know that that is the case and he is right to say, in terms of his first question, that we should have a proper contractually based tendering process, which is precisely what we have.</p>

	<p pid="b.1120.6/1">Let me begin by assuring my hon. Friend that the Government stand firm behind the principle of the international arrest warrant system and are clear that the UK will never provide safe haven to those guilty of atrocities, but she refers to the process by which international arrest warrants are secured. They can be applied for and granted to private individuals by a district judge, the effect of which is that someone can be arrested and detained with no immediate prospect of any charge being brought. The balance must be right, and the question is whether the prosecuting authority that is required to bring the case should have a role in whether the person is arrested, but I have heard what my hon. Friend has said, as has the Home Secretary, and we will, of course, take her views on board in taking the matter forward.</p>

As I mentioned in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>, the issue is whether there is an inconsistency and whether the authorities that would be responsible for bringing a prosecution should have a role in the arrest. It is important to point out that we may be talking about individuals who are not normally resident in the UK and are not under investigation by the British police, and there could be very real practical difficulties in bringing evidence to this country about whether a prosecution should happen here. My point is simply about whether it is right that the prosecuting authorities have a role in deciding whether an arrest should take place in the first place, given that that would deprive an individual of their liberty for a serious amount of time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1121.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that, if someone from another country comes here and it is found through the great good sense of a district judge that the person may be guilty of war crimes, it is our duty as a nation to prosecute them properly and that, in considering whether the law should be changed, we should weigh in the balance very heavily the great good sense and experience of district judges?</p>

	<p pid="b.1121.3/1">I can say to my hon. Friend that of course the Government remain absolutely committed to the principle that those guilty of atrocities should not find a safe haven in this country. I would also say to her, though, that the duty to prosecute those accused of atrocities falls quite rightly to the public authorities of this country. In hearing what she says and in agreeing with her that the onus needs to be on ensuring that those responsible face up to their actions, we need to consider whether the public authorities that would be responsible for mounting any prosecution should have a role in deciding whether that person should be arrested at the beginning of the process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1122.1/1">First, as the right hon. Gentleman will recognise, the protective services assessment from Her Majesty's inspector of constabulary says that the one viable option to go forward is a regional strategic force. I also emphasise that the Northumbria police force's case said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1122.1/2" class="indent">&quot;There are clear operational benefits of moving to a regional strategic force in particular in relation to the ability to invest in level 2 protective services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1122.1/3">Although the right hon. Gentleman raises an important issue about financing and the equalisation of precepts, I remind him that this is about trying to get improved services for the people of Northumbria, as well as those across the region. We have a working group that is looking at start-up and precept costs, as well as ongoing costs, and we are looking at a number of different models, but this is about not simply having a larger force, but being able to release resources to invest in better policing for the people in the right hon.

	<p pid="b.1122.2/1">The cost of the four regional mergers that the Home Secretary announced last week has been estimated at over &pound;177 million. Once again, the Government are proceeding with restructuring without any idea of the cost, which will fall largely on local taxpayers. When asked about mergers on 25 January, the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1122.2/2" class="indent">&quot;It is not a question of forcing them through&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 25 January 2006; Vol. 441, c. 1426.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1122.2/3">If any of the police authorities in the affected regions object to being amalgamated, will the Minister therefore give an undertaking, in accordance with the Prime Minister's pledge, not to force those mergers through compulsorily? Or is it, once again, a question of the Prime Minister's words counting for nothing?</p>

	<p pid="b.1122.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is entirely wrong when he asserts that we do not have regard to the costs. In many cases, the costs that are coming in look as though they will achieve payback over a period of two or three years, not the 10 or 20 years that was first assessed. As long ago as 1993, his party said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1122.3/2" class="indent">&quot;A large number of separate forces inevitably means that they duplicate facilities and headquarters structures. It is questionable whether 43 separate organisations are now needed to run police operations.&quot;</p>

He will know that post-traumatic stress disorder is increasingly being recognised in the emergency services generally and in the police force particularly and that, in some cases, it can lead to domestic violence, alcoholism and, through that, to other offences. Will he look into what his Department is doing to ensure that those who have post-traumatic stress disorder, particularly in the police force, are looked after and supported to ensure that the consequences of that condition are minimised wherever possible?</p>

	<p pid="b.1123.9/1">The Government did not undertake consultation specifically with ethnic minority communities on the provisions in the Terrorism Bill partly because the timetable for bringing the legislation forward was accelerated in the wake of the July bombs and partly because the Bill goes to the entire community rather than specific communities. However, in order to provide ethnic minority and other communities with an opportunity to express their views on the Bill other than through their representatives in Parliament, the Government have asked the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile, to consider the impact of the Bill specifically on community and race equality issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.1124.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his kind words. The point that he raises is entirely fair. There has been some concern expressed among some non-Muslim ethnic minority communities that perhaps attention has been focused too much on the Muslim community. However, we do not accept that. Clearly we have done much with the Muslim community, but if we have to do more with other communities, we will. My hon. Friend will know that we regularly meet the Hindu Council, the Hindu Forum of Britain, the National Council of Hindu Temples and the Swaminarayan temple at Neasden to discuss matters of terrorism and other matters not least, as he will know, in terms of immigration rules and ministers of religion. However, I take his point seriously. We need to consult all minority communities and, indeed, all communities as fairly and profoundly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1124.2/1">Does the Minister agree that the vast majority of mosques are dedicated to peace and enlightenment, as are the worshippers who attend them? They are precisely the people who suffer the most from the negative perceptions created by extremists. Last summer, the Prime Minister saw a need for the Government to establish powers to close down mosques that fomented extremism. Is that still Government policy?</p>

	<p pid="b.1124.3/1">I totally agree with the hon. Gentleman's opening statement, as, I am sure, does the whole House. Everyone will know, not least because of    the disparity between the last two sets of demonstrations, that in any community, frankly, it is the extremists who do down the moderates far more than anyone else. The hon. Gentleman said it was suggested that we should consider, in extremis, closing down specific facilities. I understand that we have examined that, but found that it would not be terribly practical, or, as he suggests, fair on the remaining members of the community around a mosque. Working with a community to eradicate extremists would be far more fruitful than simply closing a mosque.</p>

	<p pid="b.1124.4/1">One of the things about which members of all communities are concerned is that the Bill's provisions should be applied even-handedly and it should be clear against whom they are targeted. When the matter was debated in the House, I thought the Government accepted that there had to be a clear link between allegations regarding the glorification of terrorism and incitement&mdash;direct and indirect&mdash;or reckless disregard of the effect that glorification could have on someone about to commit a terrorist act. Is the Minister aware that several statements that Ministers have made recently to put distance between the view of this House and the amendments of the other place indicate that the Government might not still be thinking that way? Would he like to give some reassurance on that point?</p>

	<p pid="b.1125.0/1">If my hon. Friend wants reassurance that we think that our proposals on glorification are preferable to the Lords amendments, I can certainly give that reassurance, but I suspect that that is not what he is after. On his first point, it is important not only that we focus our terrorism legislation on terrorists and extremists in all communities, but that we are seen to do so. If there is disquiet in any community because it is thought that that is not the case, we need to hear about it and allay fears, not least in the context of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1634" name="James Clappison">the question asked by the hon.

However, in the broadest sense, we do not legislate just for the sake of it&mdash;we legislate because there are real and present dangers. The right hon.

First and foremost, we must shape and tailor our anti-terrorism legislation according to what is most effective and the advice that we get from security and police authorities.

Our ambition of ensuring that we have mental health services in prisons that are the equivalent of those in the community is critical to ensure that they work on all fours.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128.0/2">To achieve that, we have done a couple of things that assist in that regard. The first is to reduce the difficulties, through an agreement between the Department of Health and the prisons department, by identifying the primary care trust responsible for mentally ill offenders. That has been communicated in a Prison Service instruction and a letter by the Department of Health. Secondly, we are consulting the Royal College of Psychiatrists about ensuring that&mdash;</p>

There are more policemen are on the beat as a result of Government policy&mdash;there are an extra 13,000 officers since we came to government, and we will have an extra 24,000 community support officers up and down the country as well. However, the change has also taken place because thousands of young people are no longer thrown out on to the street at the same time, leading to fights for a taxi and to fighting in the kebab shop. The licensing changes are sensible and there has been a reduction in violence. I hope that that continues in the long term and we will certainly monitor the impact to make sure that that is the case.</p>

Does the Minister agree that there is a role for the Government to play, leading the way internationally by bringing in a law banning such sites within the United Kingdom, even if we still receive the smut and filth from overseas?</p>

May I give him one example? Within the G8, we led the way in pioneering a new international database of child abuse. We have handed the database over to Interpol. It will be possible to put any child abuse image anywhere in the world on the database, which means that we can find the victims and the perpetrators and, working together with our international colleagues, we can bear down on this dreadful problem.</p>

We have also strengthened legislation relating to employment by reforming section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 and by supporting my hon. Friend's initiative on gangmaster licensing.

Where it has been successful, that has often been in areas other than under section 8, which is why we considering strengthening the legislation. Last year, when I launched a migrant workers strategy and a statement with the TUC and CBI, both sides were in agreement that it was in nobody's interest to facilitate the arrival or employment of migrants illegally&mdash;asylum seekers or otherwise&mdash;and that we all need to work to secure a transparent managed migration system, and bear down as heavily as we can on those who employ people illegally, as well as on people who are in the country illegally.</p>

	<p pid="b.1135.1/1">The transfer of Paul Day was brokered by the prison and authorised by the directorate of high security prisons operations unit. Since that date, there have been substantial changes to the way in which such transfers are arranged. A Prison Service order issued in July 2005 that sets out the principles for maintaining order in prisons makes it clear that disruptive individuals must be individually case managed and that, where transfer to another establishment is appropriate, the reasons must be properly documented and accompany the prisoner. All transfers are to be on a permanent basis, and they must be approved at management level.</p>

	<p pid="b.1135.6/1">It can play an important part in local community cohesion. The early evidence from areas in which authorities have participated in the programme shows that it has been successful in challenging some of the attacks on the notion of political asylum that we have heard in recent years. In Bolton and Sheffield in particular, the towns have rallied around the individuals who have come to them. The programme has been a positive experience for the receiving community and, of course, for the vulnerable individuals who have benefited from the protection that those towns have offered. I expect that the same will be true when refugees come to Hull under the programme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1138.2/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That, for the purposes of any Act resulting from the International Development (Reporting and Transparency) Bill, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of money provided by Parliament of&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.1138.2/5" class="indent">(2) any increase attributable to the Act in the sums payable out of money so provided under any other Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.1138.2/6">I was delighted that the measure, which was promoted as a private Member's Bill by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> was granted an unopposed Second Reading by the House on 20 January. The money resolution was tabled on 23 January. It is likely to have some expenditure implications for the public purse, which relate to Department for International Development staff and non-staff costs that are needed to complete new policy work on implementing the new work that the Bill requires, and to prepare an annual report to Parliament. No provision is included for the costs of implementation by other Departments as they are considered minimal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1138.2/7">The Bill aims to increase transparency in the provision, reporting and use of aid and to promote coherence in Government policies on international development. To that end, it requires my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to make an annual report to Parliament containing a series of quantitative and qualitative assessments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1138.2/8">The Bill requires extensive reporting on UK development assistance provided both directly to developing country partners and indirectly through multilateral agencies. Data on bilateral aid will be broken down by region and by sector, and data on multilateral aid will be broken down according to the groups of multilateral agencies through which the UK contributes. The report will specify the proportions of aid that go to low-income countries. It will also include data on the debt relief that the United Kingdom provides to developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.1138.2/9">The Bill specifically deals with tracking the UK's progress towards the United Nations target for expenditure on official development assistance&mdash;ODA&mdash;to constitute 0.7 per cent. of gross national income. Much of the financial information that the Bill requires is already reported voluntarily. However, to fulfil the Bill's detailed requirements, the Department would need to develop new financial and management information systems that are capable of producing data, disaggregated to the level of detail that the measure requires. That would require respecification of the management information systems that are currently under design in the Department and incur additional costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1138.2/10">The Bill as drafted would require the Department to prepare regulations prescribing definitions for the terms contained in it. In terms of qualitative assessments, the Bill will, in the first instance, require my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to assess the coherence of UK Government policies on poverty reduction and sustainable development.</p>
	<p pid="b.1138.2/11">The Bill also requires an assessment of the UK contribution towards achieving the UN millennium development goals.</p>

I shall turn now to the part of the Bill in which I know that the hon. Gentleman takes a particular interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.1139.4/2">The last part of the Bill requires an assessment of the UK's contribution to promoting transparency in the provision and use of aid. As I mentioned on Second Reading, the Government agree with the thrust of the clause on transparency, but we believe that, as drafted, it is over-prescriptive. As drafted, the Bill requires the Department to undertake new work negotiating formal bilateral agreements with all countries to which the UK provides aid&mdash;some 130 in 2004&ndash;05&mdash;and to commission and publish independent monitoring and evaluation reports recording the development objectives achieved by those countries.</p>

Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>. The resolution and the Bill would, if passed, require the Department for International Development to report annually, directly to Parliament and in a transparent and accountable way, on its progress towards achieving 0.7 per cent. of gross domestic product&mdash;with which we agree&mdash;and on the effectiveness of its aid programmes in alleviating poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140.1/2">The money resolution is concerned with authorising expenditure for those aims, and I acknowledge that this debate should not extend to the related Bill. However, I would like to place on record that the Conservatives support the general principles of the Bill, and were pleased that it was given an unopposed Second Reading. As I am sure the House is aware, the resolution lays down the maximum charge&mdash;which amendments may reduce in scope, but not extend&mdash;either of the amount of expenditure or of the area of its operation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1140.1/3">We understand and hope that the Government intend substantially to amend the Bill to widen its scope and extent to include many of the provisions raised on Second Reading by Members on both sides of the House. I am pleased that this may be the case, but, as things stand, we have yet to see any Government amendments, so it is extremely difficult to know how extensive the changes might be. I am worried that the Government's delay in tabling their amendments&mdash;required by the rise of the House today in time for the Committee on Wednesday&mdash;makes it difficult not only for there to be proper scrutiny of the money resolution, but for us to table our amendments, as we expect the Bill to be greatly altered.</p>

	<p pid="b.1141.0/2">This debate is vital. The Government are considering extending the Bill to include a provision allowing the effectiveness of British bilateral aid spending to be assessed in more than just the 10 largest recipient countries as specified in the Bill, and possibly doubling the number. As I am sure all Members will agree, the money resolution would greatly strengthen the assessment of aid effectiveness. It would ensure accountability for more than just 44.2 per cent. of bilateral aid spending and would include countries such as Mozambique and Kenya&mdash;which are currently excluded&mdash;as recent allegations demonstrate the necessity for increased accountability and transparency. Such an amendment may involve a corresponding increase in costs, which may or may not be covered by the resolution. Similarly, a proposal to increase the Bill's scope to include humanitarian aid&mdash;to which reference has already been made&mdash;could have a varying impact on its financial implications, particularly as the number and extent of humanitarian aid programmes are unpredictable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/3">I hope and trust that the resolution will authorise general expenditure resulting from the Bill, probably covering issues that I and others have raised, such as independent monitoring and assessment criteria relating to the millennium development goals. However, I think it is still important to consider how such expenditure may arise, and the nature of any proposed amendments is therefore of great importance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/4">While I understand the generic nature of the money resolution, the Minister said that he had an idea of the maximum charge that must not be extended. Can he also tell us whether he expects the estimate for future financial years to be the same as the first-year estimates? Are the costs front-loaded, or will they increase over time as the aid budget grows exponentially towards 0.7 per cent. of gross domestic product? The Minister spoke of plans for expenditure covering only three years. Why should that be the case, given that the 0.7 per cent. will not be reached until 2013, seven years from now? Can the Minister assure us that the cost of the Bill will be financed by the reduction in leakage that its implementation will facilitate, and will not have a negative impact on poverty alleviation?</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/5">As it stands, the motion will not prevent any amendments tabled after Second Reading from being discussed in Committee. However, it would have been useful if the Minister had tabled Government amendments earlier, so that their possible implications could have been discussed during this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/6">Neither the Minister nor any other Member may amend the motion. That preserves its generic nature, and the guarantee that it covers all eventualities. If it has to be altered, the original version must be withdrawn and resubmitted with its scope extended. Such action would hinder the Bill's progress, and Conservative Members do not want that. I trust that the Minister will confirm that there are no circumstances in which such an eventuality would arise.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/7">Conservative Members support the Bill's general principles and therefore, along with the Minister, commend the motion to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1142.1/1">This motion illustrates all too well the weaknesses of the money resolution process, as both <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">the Minister and my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> have illustrated rather well. As is so often the case, the House is being asked to endorse what amounts to a blank cheque. That would be bad enough in the best of circumstances, but in the case of this Bill it is particularly egregious.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142.1/2">The money resolution states that</p>
	<p pid="b.1142.1/3" class="indent">&quot;it is expedient to authorise the payment out of money provided by Parliament of . . . any expenditure incurred by the Secretary of State in consequence of the Act; and . . . any increase attributable to the Act in the sums payable out of money so provided&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142.1/4">If that is not a blank cheque, I do not know what is. Because we normally know from a given Bill's Second Reading its parameters and detailed provisions, we can make a rough estimate of such expenditure; indeed, I seem to recall that on certain very rare occasions, Ministers have been kind enough to give the House some idea of the expenditure involved. However, this is a different case altogether.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142.1/5">As has already been reflected in the contributions made so far, this Bill, unusually&mdash;if I may quote myself, which I am usually very pleased to do&mdash;does at the same time</p>
	<p pid="b.1142.1/6" class="indent">&quot;too much and too little.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 20 January 2006; Vol. 441, c. 1114.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1142.1/7">At one and the same time, it contains too many provisions&mdash;a point commented on by the Minister and criticised by my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness&mdash;and too few. Indeed, many contributions on Second Reading suggested, very positively and helpfully, provisions that could be included in it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1142.1/8">All these issues will have financial ramifications. We are in the absurd position of being asked by the Government to approve a money resolution for a Bill that we know will be amended, both in Committee and on Report, by Ministers and, I hope, by other Members of the House when we are given an opportunity to do so. How can we possibly, on behalf of our taxpayers, sign up to the incurring of &quot;any expenditure&quot; by the Secretary of State in respect of a Bill whose provisions we know will be radically altered by both the Government and the House at large?</p>
	<p pid="b.1142.1/9">This surely is an absurdity and we should not be prepared to accept it. I shall therefore be very reluctant to give my support to such a money resolution, but I should point out that I am looking forward enormously to considering the Bill on Report. It is substantial, containing many clauses, and we know from Second Reading that the House will want to debate many aspects of it, probably at length, and to vote on it, probably repeatedly, in order to ensure that it is absolutely right and achieves the objectives set out for it. So although the money resolution is unfortunate, misdirected, mistimed and wrong, I hope that we can correct all that in Committee and on Report.</p>

	<p pid="b.1143.0/1">With your leave, Mr. Speaker, I shall reply briefly to one or two of the points that have been made. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> may now be aware that Government amendments and amendments from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> are being tabled as we speak. I recognise that Members like to have early sight of Government amendments; nevertheless, all will want the Government to take time to get them right. I hope that Opposition Members&mdash;and, indeed, Government Members&mdash;will appreciate the amendments that are being tabled.</p>
	<p pid="b.1143.0/2">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness asked about the distribution of expenditure and whether some will be front-loaded. Some investment in new systems will indeed be required, so some front-loading will be necessary. He also asked why a three-year period is specified, given that it will take seven years to reach the 0.7 per cent. target. The three-year period relates to the comprehensive spending review period. We will not necessarily be able to speed up progress toward the 0.7 per cent. target; it would take the international finance facility to do that. If the hon. Gentleman is aware of any leakage, I hope that he will inform us of it, so that we can take action to correct it. I can reassure him that I foresee no scenario in which we will have to withdraw the money resolution.</p>
	<p pid="b.1143.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">The hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> asked whether Government time and other assistance might be needed to speed up the Bill's passage. Given that it has the support of Front Benchers in all parts of the House, there should be no circumstances in which Government time is needed to progress the Bill. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman could seek reassurance from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1459" name="Eric Forth">the right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Mr. Forth)</phrase> that he agrees with that assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1143.0/4">The right hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst asked for more information on the distribution of costs. The regulatory impact assessment was, I believe, made available in the Library last week, and it provides some clarity on how the costs are set out.</p>

	<p pid="b.1145.6/1">The Government have decided not to seek to reverse Lords amendments Nos. 19 and 20, which removed clauses 6 and 7 on the procedure for introducing compulsory registration. The clauses dealt with the requirement to register and be issued with an identity card in the second stage of the identity card scheme and for compulsion to be brought into effect by way of secondary legislation made under this Bill and subject to the super-affirmative procedure. We agree that those provisions should be dropped.</p>
	<p pid="b.1145.6/2">It is worth dwelling on the background to the issues. The Home Affairs Committee, in its fourth report of 2003&ndash;04, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1145.6/3" class="indent">&quot;The move to compulsion is a step of such importance that it should only be taken after the scrutiny afforded by primary legislation: the proposed 'super-affirmative procedure' is not adequate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1145.6/4">We decided from the beginning that there is substance to the Committee's point: it is a sufficiently important step from the first stage to the second stage and compulsion to require a vote in both Houses. In the early stages, we decided that the super-affirmative procedure should apply, but many&mdash;not least the House of Lords&mdash;disagreed, and that is the territory covered by the amendments.</p>

	<p pid="b.1145.7/1">The Minister knows that my colleagues and I oppose compulsory identity cards.

	<p pid="b.1145.8/1">On the first point, no. We have made it clear from the beginning that the ultimate aim for the programme was compulsory registration.

I am grateful to the Government for not seeking to reverse the Lords amendments on the deletion of clauses 6 and 7, but I need to be sure of the limit to their agreement. The Government accept that primary legislation will be required to introduce compulsion, but there will be compulsion through the back door under clauses 4 and 5 and designated documents. Can the Minister state explicitly that it will still be a compulsory requirement to provide information to the national identity register in relation to designated documents&mdash;a concept that has so far been undefined, save in relation to passports and immigration or travel documents?</p>

	<p pid="b.1146.5/1">The Sunday press always affects Ministers' blood pressure, but I have never read such an absurd and inaccurate story as the one about driving licences. When I was part of the Department for Transport, we made it clear long before, and during, proceedings on the Road Safety Bill&mdash;which I thoroughly enjoyed&mdash;that all paper licences, which are the most inappropriate and insecure form of such an important document, would need to be replaced by small plastic photocard licences. I can say without fear of contradiction that that is entirely separate from&mdash;indeed, nothing to do with&mdash;what we want to do in the ID cards programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1146.5/2">When we implement the ID card scheme on a voluntary basis, it will in the first instance&mdash;except for provisions made in the Bill&mdash;be for individual private operators to determine what they need for the fulfilment of a transaction involving their services. It is not for the Government to set parameters at each and every turn for private transactions.</p>

	<p pid="b.1147.2/1">My question is germane to both this and the next group of amendments. International obligations for biometric tests in the reading of passports will be imposed on Britain, but does the Minister accept that it would be entirely possible for us to comply with those obligations without requiring additional information to be held on a passport or other document? Our international obligations are thus not a reason for the Government's policy on identity cards.</p>

	<p pid="b.1147.3/1">I accept that, but I would qualify it in part by saying that that is the initial position and the start of a trend in international obligations. In strict terms, on whether we are going beyond the minimum standards that are required at this stage and that are likely to be needed in the very near future, the hon. Gentleman is entirely right, but why should we go for something substandard or second rate, or that is likely to be second rate within five or 10 years? In essence, he is, of course, entirely right.</p>

	<p pid="b.1147.4/1">Will the Minister enlighten the House about whether he has discussed these clauses and amendments with the Information Commissioner, who pretty well condemned the procedures that were outlined on Second Reading, as I stated at the time? Will he explain why the reference to &quot;compulsory registration&quot; has not been removed from clause 9?</p>

	<p pid="b.1147.5/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those questions, which lead me neatly into the second paragraph of my opening speech, in which I want to go into the substance of the choreography or jigsaw, which also refers to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the point made by the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase>. It is very clear from the debate in the other place that their lordships would prefer us to go down the primary legislation route, rather than the super-affirmative route. That is what they seek to achieve in the amendments that they have offered to the House. The removal of clauses 6 and 7 goes part way to achieving that, but to go all the way to achieving that we need to   include our proposal in lieu of Lords amendment No. 21.</p>
	<p pid="b.1147.5/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">The hon. Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> is entirely right: what their lordships chose not to do and what we are not doing in response to them is to eradicate every element or reference to compulsion in the Bill. In essence, all the building blocks for compulsion in the Bill remain. He will know from the debate on Second Reading and the other Commons stages that a number of elements in the Bill refer to the compulsion stage, rather than to the run up to that stage. Given the wording of our proposal in lieu of the Lords amendment, none of the buildings blocks for compulsion that remain can be enacted until the subsequent primary legislation has been passed. That more neatly achieves precisely what their lordships required in respect of the balance between super-affirmative and primary legislation, as is shown in the reports of their debates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1147.5/3">An order under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, however, will not be an Act of Parliament, so the hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that anything other than primary legislation could be used as the vehicle, given the wording that we offer. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Cambridge keeps chuntering. I shall, of course, give way to him, but in my own time and on my own terms.</p>

	<p pid="b.1148.0/1">The Minister refers to building blocks in respect of the inner parts of the Bill. He might recall that, in addressing my remarks to the Home Secretary on Second Reading, I demonstrated the relationship between the Bill, what the Information Commissioner had to say and what I thought George Orwell would have made of the provisions on the building blocks of compulsion. I do not see any change in substance or principle. Does the Minister accept that the building blocks are those of George Orwell's Ministry of Truth?</p>

	<p pid="b.1148.1/1">I certainly do not accept the latter point, although George Orwell&mdash;also known as Mr. Blair&mdash;is one of my favourite authors, so I am with the hon. Gentleman at that level. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Eric Blair, I think hon. Members will find. However, the hon. Gentleman's general point that the key elements of the   secondary phase&mdash;that is, compulsion&mdash;remain in the Bill is entirely fair. The point that he makes within the confines of the debate and these Lords amendments is entirely right: none of them goes to the substance or principle of voluntary, compulsory or any other form of ID card scheme. The debate is only on the narrow ground of whether there should be a super-affirmative procedure in both Houses or primary legislation. I think that everyone at both ends of this place accepts the premise that the step-up to compulsion is of sufficient seriousness to demand a vote in both Houses. We are discussing the technique and process rather than the substance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1149.0/1">I hear what the Minister says but the problem is that amendment (a) in lieu of amendment No. 21 refers to</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.0/2" class="indent">&quot;an obligation imposed by an Act of Parliament passed after the passing of this Act.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.0/3">The Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill will be such an Act of Parliament and it will be passed after this Act. The Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill will give Ministers the power to amend any Act by order, so I cannot see any way in which an order under that Act can be excluded under this drafting of the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1149.1/1">I assure the hon. Gentleman that his interpretation is not accurate. If I need to discuss that with him in greater detail over a cup of tea, I will be happy to do so, albeit probably not today&mdash;let us say about Thursday.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/2">I emphasise that the substance of the debate is on the narrow terms of whether super-affirmative is the appropriate procedure for there to be, as we all agree, a vote in both Houses as a prelude to compulsion or whether we should go back to primary legislation. I referred to the Home Affairs Committee and its report that said that it would prefer primary legislation and that the super-affirmative procedure was not adequate. The House of Lords Constitution Committee, in paragraph 9 of its third report in 2005&ndash;06, equally concluded that</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/3" class="indent">&quot;it would be preferable to separate the two phases in order that the compulsory phase would have to be introduced by primary legislation. This would enable Parliament to ensure that the legislation fully reflected experience gained, especially about safeguards, during the voluntary phase.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/4">We have said on a number of occasions that this is not just about flicking the switch. There has to be a substantive view prior to flicking that switch.</p>

	<p pid="b.1149.2/1">The Minister has clearly attached a new-found importance to an Act of Parliament to make compulsory the requirement for registration. Why did he not consider extending that importance to designated documents, which he currently proposes to do through an order? Perhaps that could also be done through the new Act of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.1149.3/1">I am tempted to go to our next debate,   but I shall resist that temptation before you, Mr. Speaker, exhort me to shut up, move on and stay with the specifics.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/2">The hon. Gentleman, who was on the Standing Committee considering the Bill, is aware of two points. First, as we shall see when we come to the next debate, it is inconceivable that people who have concerns about cost-effectiveness should say to the House that we should ignore the data needed for biometric passports and instead separately introduce additional but identical paraphernalia for ID cards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/3">The hon. Gentleman will also know that I am not a recent convert. I referred to the super-affirmative procedure in Standing Committee&mdash;I am sure he was there; he attended assiduously&mdash;and said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/4" class="indent">&quot;As people will know, the genesis of the provisions is the fact that we regard compulsion to register as the end goal. We regard the step from voluntary to compulsory as a serious one. That is why we sought to put in the Bill a scrutiny process that would allow the House proper time to scrutinise these matters carefully, with due diligence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/5">In response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase>, I added:</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/6" class="indent">&quot;One interpretation . . . is that the super-affirmative procedure could be seen as a rather crude algorithmic loop, in which something starts here, goes there, and modified or otherwise, comes back.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/7">We end up in a lock from which there is no escape route.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/8" class="indent">&quot;If it does not get to where it was headed, it starts again, with no apparent escape from that scrutiny loop. That is an entirely fair point.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/9">I was feeling in a generous mood even then. I continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/10" class="indent">&quot;We put that down the last time the Bill was determined to be helpful to the House in terms of scrutiny. I assure the Committee that we shall take back and consider those comments, albeit with the clause intact&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/11">that is, passed by the Committee&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/12" class="indent">&quot;because that is how these things work.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee D,</i> 12 July 2005; c. 219.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.3/13">We decided, in our wisdom, that we were reasonably comfortable with the super-affirmative procedure. Many hon. Members and, indeed, Members of the other place, advanced substantive arguments for the alternative of primary legislation, and we have now succumbed to that will.</p>

	<p pid="b.1150.0/1">I was not a member of the Committee, so I ask this question for genuine clarification. What is wrong with the scheme is the register, because if we had biometrics and voluntary identity cards, it would be acceptable. If we accept the Government amendment, will some people still be compelled to be on the register because they have applied for a passport?</p>

	<p pid="b.1150.2/1">Will the Minister clarify a matter&mdash;we need to get this absolutely straight&mdash;about clause 15, which will allow public services to be conditional on identity checks? The measure would apply if an individual was subject to compulsory registration. If the Government amendment is accepted, will that measure not come into effect until after the subsequent primary legislation has been passed?</p>

	<p pid="b.1150.3/1">I can give my hon. Friend an absolute assurance about that. The measure is one of the building blocks in the Bill to which the hon. Member for Stone referred. I assure my hon. Friend that it will not be switched on or enacted until the second piece of primary legislation has been passed to bring in compulsion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1150.3/2">We said several times that although the super-affirmative procedure applies to the new procedure, before a move to compulsion takes place we and the House will want to be satisfied that implementation of the initial phase of the identity card scheme has achieved significant coverage of the population so that compulsion would have an impact on only the relatively small number of people who had yet to register for and obtain an identity card. We would also want to be satisfied that there continued to be clear support for identity cards, that no vulnerable group would be disadvantaged, that the scheme had contributed to meeting the aims outlined in clause 1, and that the technology supporting the identity card scheme was working and trusted. All those matters will be reviewed before the introduction of primary legislation to flick on the switch for compulsion. If we go down the road suggested on costs, which we will address later, the six-monthly report to the House that accompanies the review will take us to a point at which we will have all the information that we require when we consider primary legislation on compulsion.</p>

	<p pid="b.1151.0/1">The Minister clearly gave us a list to indicate how the conditions for moving to compulsion would be met. What is his estimate of the approximate percentage of the adult public with identity cards that would be sufficient to justify moving towards compulsion?</p>

	<p pid="b.1151.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an entirely fair point that we will have to consider seriously as we move towards flicking the switch for compulsion through primary legislation. I suggest that there will be plenty of time to discuss that, but I said quite deliberately that compulsion would have an impact on only the relatively small number of people who had not registered for and obtained a card. I suggest that the proportion would be considerably more than half the eligible population, but the House will have plenty of time to discuss such detailed matters as we get closer to that time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1151.3/1">I repeat the assurances that we have already given on several occasions. The stand-alone ID card will cost about &pound;30 and the joint package with the biometric passport will cost about &pound;93. My hon.

	<p pid="b.1151.3/2">We accept in spirit the direction in which the Lords want us to travel, but we cannot in substance and detail accept exactly the form of words proposed, for the reasons that I have outlined. I therefore commend the amendment in lieu to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1152.3/1">May I draw the House's attention to the fact that humble pie is also evident in this group of amendments? I was delighted to see the Minister eating it, although it is pity that he did not eat it in the summer, when we had our interesting discussions during the Committee stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.3/2">We had a lengthy debate about this very issue and at that stage the Government decided that they were prepared to introduce compulsion through secondary legislation. I see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">my hon. Friends the Members for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> and for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace), who were on the Committee with me, in their places today. We drew the issue to the Committee's attention but the Government, in their wisdom, decided that they knew best and that if they wanted to bring in compulsion&mdash;which was clearly their end intention&mdash;they would do it through secondary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.3/3">The problem facing the Government is that they have, as usual, misused the English language. When they say &quot;voluntary&quot;, they mean &quot;compulsory&quot;, and that is why they have got stuck. When they say &quot;may&quot;, they mean &quot;must&quot; and when they say &quot;possibly&quot;, they mean &quot;definitely&quot;. That is why they were given a thorough ticking-off in the other place, where Members of the House of Lords&mdash;not only from the Opposition parties, but from the Government party&mdash;turned up in numbers to persuade them that their original thinking was wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.3/4">I am delighted that the Minister and the Home Secretary have changed their mind. They were sensible to do so and here we are, dealing with something of a concession. However, before we get overexcited, we need to be clear about the value of the concession&mdash;how limited or extensive it is. We shall come on to designated documents in the next group of amendments, but we have already discovered from my intervention that a compulsory procedure will still be required when they are applied for. That is to say that when people apply for their passport, a residential status document or an immigration document they will still be compelled, whether they like it or not, under this Christmas tree of a Bill&mdash;which allows the Secretary of State to take unto himself 61 powers to make further law&mdash;to do things that he requires them to do. It is only in the discrete area of clauses 6 and 7 that the requirement for primary legislation bites. We are grateful for that&mdash;let me not give the Home Secretary and the Minister of State any other impression&mdash;but the problem remains that compulsion is still a big part of the Bill, which is still no more than a Christmas tree, providing various little places for this Secretary of State or his successors to add on secondary legislation giving them powers to tell us what to do.</p>

If the measure is implemented in 2008, only 20 per cent. of a population of broadly 60 million will be relieved of compulsion except by primary legislation.

Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase>, who was listening with great care to Mr. Frattini at lunchtime, that issue will be wrapped up in the next debate when we discuss designated documents. The passport is a designated document, and immigration documents will be designated documents under the secondary legislation that will be introduced under clauses 4 and 5. The European travel document, which is what the identity card will eventually become, is another designated document. Mr. Frattini's point would therefore be more properly addressed in later debates. None the less, I do not wish to inhibit my hon. Friend from pursuing that argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.1154.3/3">I would like to know the width and weight of the Government concession. When will we know the detail of the next piece of primary legislation? Will it be written in English, and will it be yet another piece of legislation on to which the Secretary of State, whoever he then is, can hang further secondary legislation? It is one thing to say that there will be another Bill, but it is quite another thing to introduce a Bill that says precisely what it means. The Identity Cards Bill is nearly 45 pages long, and gives the Secretary of State 61 separate powers, but we cannot divine how the Secretary of State will use the powers that he gives himself and how he will define the documents and the other instruments on which he wishes to introduce secondary legislation.</p>

As someone who opposed identity cards&mdash;I remain opposed to them&mdash;and who voted accordingly, I welcome the fact that the Government have accepted the Lords amendments so that primary legislation will be required before the cards become compulsory. I accept that the Opposition have the right to make their argument, but those of us who are critics of the proposal should bear in mind the fact that the Government have made a substantial concession which I, for one, very much welcome.</p>

	<p pid="b.1155.0/1">I agree, and I have welcomed the concession&mdash;I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was in the Chamber when I intervened on the Minister in the early part of his speech. However, it is a 20 per cent. or partial concession. As I have said, there are still plenty of provisions in the Bill that give the Secretary of State power to compel the citizen to do something. It is right to welcome the limited concession, but we need to be very careful indeed about a Bill that essentially sets up a national identity register, which is a large Government computer into which all sorts of private information will go, and to which various Government agencies will have access. We the citizens will have no knowledge of when that information goes in, what is taken out, and to whom it is passed. Under the Bill's final provisions, we will not be allowed to see an audit trail of the information that has been accessed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1155.2/1">I shall invite my right hon. and hon. Friends to accept the Government's word. There will come a time later this afternoon when many of the problems that my hon. Friend and I still have with the Bill can be discussed&mdash;when we come to discuss compulsion and &quot;must&quot; or &quot;may&quot; in relation to designated documents. The narrowness of the present debate permits me to accept the Government's concession, to welcome their decision to agree to what their lordships say, and, as I said to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1900" name="David Winnick">the hon. Member for Walsall, North (Mr. Winnick)</phrase>, to welcome the sound of the grinding of the Government gears.</p>
	<p pid="b.1155.2/2">I do not want to be unpleasant to the Government, but they should have made the concession last summer.   As I am sure the Chairman of the Select Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase>, will appreciate, the concession would never have needed to be made had the Government written the Bill in English in the first place    and, when they meant compulsory, written &quot;compulsory&quot; in the Bill. But they did not think it was in their political or other interest to do that, so they have arrived at that decision after some delay. It is a pity that they wasted our time, but they got partly to the right answer in the end.</p>
	<p pid="b.1155.2/3">The Bill is essentially about the national identity register, and I mentioned some of my concerns about that. Anything to do with identity cards is but a fig leaf. We need to concern ourselves with the practicalities of the national identity register and its implications for civil liberties, rather than allowing ourselves to be bamboozled into thinking that the Bill is simply about whether we should voluntarily or compulsorily carry an identity card. It is not just about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1155.2/4">When we are talking, as we are, about fundamentally altering the relationship between the citizen and the state, it behoves every Member of the House, Front-Bench or Back-Bench, Government or Opposition, to look carefully at the detail of the Bill and not to buy everything that the Government put wrapped up on the shop front. We need to unwrap it and see what is inside the gift the Government claim to be giving us. When we unwrap it, we will find that there is not much to attract us.</p>

	<p pid="b.1156.0/1">Is the hon. and learned Gentleman concerned not just about the relationship with the state, but about the potential for third parties to gain access to our identity, which is deeply worrying? The contactless chips proposed will, in effect, give out a signal that can be read by anyone with access to an antenna. In Holland, biometric identity documents have already been read. Apparently, it took two hours to decrypt the documents. We all need to worry deeply that we are being forced to carry documents and to send messages from those documents to a database with enormous potential for the theft of our identity.

	<p pid="b.1157.0/1">That is a perfectly good question, but I doubt that the hon. Gentleman will get an answer from this Government. The sum that the Government pluck out of the sky as being lost to the economy as a result of identity fraud, which has gone up from &pound;50 million to &pound;1.5 billion, is misleading because it does not separate out money laundering and all sorts of other criminal activities that come under that aspect of identity fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157.0/2">I end where I began. I welcome the concession. It does not go far enough, but I welcome the little way that it does go. A huge tranche of this country's population will still be compelled without primary legislation to give up to the national identity register information that is private to them, and we will perhaps have further battles on that later, but meanwhile, despite the perfectly understandable concerns of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1370" name="Richard Shepherd">my hon.

	<p pid="b.1157.1/1">I shall endeavour to restrict myself to the particular topics under discussion, although the temptation to enter into another Second Reading debate is rather large. This is a debate dominated by a high degree of irrationality, as the exchanges in the past five minutes have shown. The inability to distinguish between a system in which a private company can check the validity of an individual's identity card and access to the register, with all that that implies about access to the data, has bedevilled this really important project.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157.1/2">I want both the ID card scheme and the register to succeed, because if we do not start to tackle the problems now, whether they be identity fraud for commercial reasons, how to protect the employment rights of low-paid people whose jobs are being undercut by illegal labour or the use of identity fraud for terrorism&mdash;all of them issues that make the case for ID cards&mdash;they will be greater in 10 years' time. Therefore, we need to make a success of the project now.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157.1/3">I welcome what the Government have done. As my hon. Friend the Minister made clear, the change was proposed originally by the Select Committee nearly two years ago, and I would not be a Select Committee Chair if I did not point out that sometimes it would be nice if our reports were acted on when they were first written, not a couple of years later when it becomes convenient to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157.1/4">We were right to talk about new parliamentary legislation for two reasons. The term &quot;compulsory&quot;, which I hope I will come back to on the next set of amendments, is being used in different ways in this debate. It is perfectly clear that, in the first phase of establishing the national identity register, those who wish to have a passport, for example, if it is a designated document, will have to go on to the national identity register. However, leaving aside the issues of principle, at least in that process the individual is making use of a service that is of benefit to them, namely, getting hold of a passport. It is reasonable to assume that there will be a powerful driver for any Government to ensure that that process is convenient, effective and works quickly. We saw a few years ago how quickly the public respond if something goes wrong in an agency such as the Passport and Records Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1157.1/5">The second phase of the process is entirely different, because that will require individuals to register and go through a process of registering their biometrics, and so forth, for which they get nothing back immediately&mdash;for example, in the form of a passport. Getting that phase right and being sure that the system is designed to make the process as user-friendly as possible is critical. When we considered the Bill two years ago, we could not look eight years into the future and know the design of the process. It is right for Parliament to say that it wants not only a yes-no super-affirmative vote, but fresh legislation and an explanation from the Government of the day of how that part of the process, which is frankly much more difficult, will be handled.</p>

The size and complexity of the task is one factor affecting the speed with which such issues can be put right. The CSA is a good example of a problem that is intractable because it is too complex.

Members do not want us to get into a detailed debate about that topic. Although the process must be repeated for millions of people, the inherent issues in national identity registration are simpler than those in the projects that have gone wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.1158.3/2">The Select Committee was right to press for separate legislation from the outset, because however well the Bill is scrutinised by us and the House of Lords, it is doubtful whether it will be perfect in six or seven years' time. Even if this were not a Home Office Bill, it would inevitably require a certain amount of amendment, clarification and adjustment in due course. It would be ridiculous to update this Bill and have a separate super-affirmative resolution on the question of extending it to the final 20 to 25 per cent. of the population.</p>
	<p pid="b.1158.3/3">The change is sensible, because it means that on the crucial step of extending the provision to the group of people who are more difficult to reach, Parliament will be able to take an entirely fresh look at the project's strengths and weaknesses.</p>

	<p pid="b.1160.0/1">I am grateful to the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee. On passports, does he agree that we must consider carefully the arguments about convenience that he touched on a moment ago? The   Government claim that international obligations require us to have on our passports biometric information that will be sucked into, or will be available to be stored on, the national identity register. However, our international obligation is merely for our passports to have digitised biometrics that are readable by the passport officer using a machine at the port of entry&mdash;those biometrics would not be accessible by a national identity register. The Government keep trying to smooth over that distinction.</p>

	<p pid="b.1160.1/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman and I start this debate from different points of view: he is against having a national ID register and ID cards, and I am in favour of them. My hon. Friend the Minister conceded earlier that the proposals go somewhat beyond the strict minimum required by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and other regulations; however, that is not entirely the point. The ICAO requires this sort of development in the passport and that an infrastructure should be set up to collect biometrics.</p>
	<p pid="b.1160.1/2">If we are to go through the process of collecting biometrics because our citizens need that to be done to travel abroad, let us do the job properly and do the other thing that we need to do, namely, establish a decent ID card system and a national identity register. We need that development to enable us to tackle the whole range of identity fraud and to deal with illegal migration problems over the next 10 years, particularly as the EU expands and borders become more difficult to secure nationally. That is a gain worth having. The fact that we need to collect biometric data for passport use does not mean that all we should do is the absolute minimum required by those international requirements, given that the gains of having a decent identity register system are significant. That is where the hon. and learned Gentleman and I have different approaches to these issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.1160.2/1">My right hon. Friend and I disagree profoundly in the Home Affairs Committee, so we have a minority report of one. I know that he is even more strongly in favour of identity cards than the Government. He talked about and gave examples of the ways in which identity cards will resolve various problems, but many of us believe that they are being held up as some sort of panacea on terrorism and identity fraud, whereby if we name a problem, the identity card will resolve it. We simply do not believe that identity cards will be the solution any more than they have been in countries such as Spain, where there has been terrorism.</p>

	<p pid="b.1160.3/1">I am in danger, which I said I would avoid, of being drawn into a Second Reading debate. My hon. Friend played an active role in our inquiries. As he said earlier, we agreed entirely with what the Government are now doing on the point that we are discussing. My view&mdash;and that of the majority of the Select Committee&mdash;is that identity cards will make a significant contribution to each problem that we are trying to tackle. They will absolutely solve few if any problems, but without an identity card system we will be far less well equipped to tackle them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1160.3/2">Anybody who suggests that identity cards or the national identity register are a panacea for all problems is wrong and would be misleading people, but those who say that they have no useful role in tackling identity fraud are also wrong.</p>

	<p pid="b.1161.0/1">I pay tribute to the exceptionally deft and dexterous manner in which the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality and the Home Secretary handled compulsion. It takes special skill to present to the House an unworkable scheme, suffer a defeat on it in the other place and subsequently present an acceptance of a defeat on an unworkable scheme as a remarkable triumph and concession. Ministers should be given due credit for that.</p>

	<p pid="b.1161.3/1">Indeed, Madam Deputy Speaker. Even without that intervention, I should not have tried to highlight the divisions in the Conservative party on the Bill at different stages.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161.3/2">As the Minister has already said, I have been critical of the little-lamented super-affirmative procedure, which was unworkable. However, as one who deeply opposes the identity cards scheme and the identity register and does not want the introduction of any element of compulsion, I almost mourn its passing. The super-affirmative procedure was a secondary legislative procedure and the Parliament Act could not be applied to it. It would therefore have been possible, especially given the requirement to agree a report in both Houses, to block the implementation of a compulsory scheme indefinitely. However, it is not the job of the House to implement law that we know to be bad, even if it sometimes appears convenient to do that. The Lords amendments improve the opportunity for scrutiny through a second primary measure and Liberal Democrat Members welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161.3/3">The hon. and learned Member for Harborough has already made the point that the compulsion that the amendments would exclude is merely express compulsion. The possibility of compulsion by stealth, which we shall discuss shortly, through the designated documents remains. The Government oversell their position when Ministers claim, as they did today, that they have made some great concession that requires the House to revisit compulsion at a later date in primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">My hon. Friend the Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> made a good point, which the Minister and his officials should consider at their leisure, about the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, which is beginning its passage through the House. Hon. Members know that, if enacted in its current form, it would allow the Government to amend primary legislation through using statutory instruments. It therefore remains open to the Government to use secondary legislation to amend the Identity Cards Bill or to introduce compulsion. That worries me.</p>
	<p pid="b.1161.3/5">There are two possible routes that could be taken here. The first is that the Minister could stand up today and state expressly that that is not the Government's intention. The alternative route&mdash;which I believe would be open to the House on another occasion, and I commend it to hon. Members in the light of that&mdash;would be to amend the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill when we have the opportunity to do so. To give the Government the power to amend primary legislation in the sweeping way that is proposed by that Bill seems very wrong.</p>

	<p pid="b.1162.0/1">I shall endeavour to keep to the subject of the amendment, although other issues are involved. I believe that even hon. Members who are against ID cards would agree that they would be effective only if it became compulsory to own one at some time in the future. I welcome the Government's intention to have a separate vote on compulsion in some years' time. In the meantime, providing ID cards only to people who specifically ask for them would only reap certain advantages. A secure form of proving who we are would be beneficial for everyone who wished to have an ID card, but for them to provide their full benefit, we must not only encourage people to take them up initially but make them compulsory later.</p>

	<p pid="b.1162.2/2">People renewing their passport will have to provide their biometric data. Why should we not encourage the take-up of ID cards and ensure that they become compulsory by issuing them along with passports? The two should be issued simultaneously. The Lords amendment would create uncertainty about when and how the second compulsory stage would be brought in, thereby losing that window of opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1162.2/3">Much has been said about the cost of the scheme, although I appreciate that that is not the issue before us at the moment. However, many of my constituents in Hove and Portslade are extremely worried about that aspect of the scheme. It would be even more costly if we allowed several schemes&mdash;such as ID cards, driving licences and passports&mdash;to exist side by side. The Bill obviously merges the UK Passport Service with the new agency responsible for ID cards, which would also work closely with UKvisas and the immigration and nationality directorate. It would therefore be far cheaper to support the Government's proposal to issue an ID card automatically to people who apply for a passport or a driving licence. The biometric technology is there, so we should use it to issue ID cards.</p>

Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> that his argument misses the wood for the trees. He is a tremendous advocate of identity cards and he argues that we do not know what the position will be in eight years' time, but I point to the example&mdash;as I have done before&mdash;of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. When George Orwell wrote that book in the 1940s, he was projecting forward to what would happen in circumstances that he foresaw at that time. I recognise the motivation behind the right hon. Gentleman's argument, but he is completely missing the point. The Information Commissioner made it abundantly clear that the Bill will fundamentally alter the relationship between the individual and the state. He has kept very quiet about the arrangements made and the amendments tabled since our debate on Second Reading. I should be very interested to know his thoughts now, but I doubt whether he has changed his opinion very much.</p>
	<p pid="b.1165.3/3">The plain fact is that this is a matter of principle and the Bill constitutes a fundamental change in the relationship between the individual and the state; whether one calls the Government's approach a flip-flop, a change into reverse gear or a tactical retreat makes no difference to that fundamental point. This is the offence of which I accuse the Government: they are engaging in a cynical exercise to gain more control over the individual, and in a way that is inimical to the liberties of the people of this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.1165.4/2" class="indent">&quot;An identity card scheme of the sort and on the scale proposed by the Government would undoubtedly represent a significant change in the relationship between the state and the individual in this country.&quot;</p>

The plain fact remains that whether one considers the Tampere discussions or the Hague conventions or arrangements made at a summit in The Hague or in any other circumstances, the provisions in the Bill are inimical to the principles and liberties on which this country has been built. We do not have state control or a police state, but this Bill is the beginning of such arrangements.

	<p pid="b.1167.2/1">I shall be brief, so that other hon. Members have the chance to speak. I shall try to stick, as little of the debate has done, to the substance of the amendment. It deals with the simple issue of compulsion. I could go on at great length about the Bill, as I have in the past, but I want to point out that no other country is doing this. No other country is going down this road. I think that in a couple of years the whole issue will be abandoned. The idea that the Home Office, of all Departments, will get this massive infrastructure to work, which nobody else in the world has managed to do, is unreal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1167.2/2">I do not wish to exaggerate the importance of the amendment, because it would not affect everybody. It affects those people who will not be caught under clause 5. The amendment will make a difference because primary legislation, with proper debate and scrutiny in this place, will be needed before a move to compulsion. I would much rather have that than secondary legislation. We should welcome the fact that this step has been taken; it is an improvement, although it does not deal with the aspects of the Bill that concern some people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1167.2/3">I emphasise the point that I made in an intervention: the relationship between the amendment and clause 15, which covers the power to make public services conditional on identity checks. The Minister confirmed earlier that if the amendment is accepted clause 15 cannot come into effect without further primary legislation, and that is important.</p>

	<p pid="b.1169.4/1">The House debated the essence of this issue on Report on 18 October. It rejected proposals similar to the Lords amendments, and I hope that it will reject them now. Although Lords amendments Nos. 16 and 22 rest on changing a &quot;must&quot; to a &quot;may&quot;, which seems a very small change, they risk undermining the basis of the current identity cards proposal, and for those reasons they must be resisted strongly by the Government and by the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169.4/2">We have always been clear that the identity cards scheme is being designed and is intended, eventually, to become a compulsory scheme for all UK residents, and that in the second phase of the scheme it will be a requirement to register, with a civil financial penalty regime for failure to do so. Throughout, we have also been equally clear that linking identity cards to the issue of designated documents is a central part of the scheme in the first phase. That will enable a sensible, phased introduction of identity cards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169.4/3">Once passports and residence permits are designated, when British nationals resident in the United Kingdom, renew or apply for their residence permits they will be entered on the national identity register and issued with cards that will serve as ID cards. That approach is well known and will not come as a surprise to the House. When the Government issued our first consultation document about a card scheme in 2002, one of the options canvassed was a universal scheme linked to passports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169.4/4">When we announced the decision in principle in November 2003, it was made clear that there would be a two-stage scheme and that the second stage would be compulsory. However, on the first stage, we stated in &quot;Identity Cards: the Next Steps&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="b.1169.4/5" class="indent">&quot;By linking the card scheme to widely held identity documents most people will get a card conveniently and automatically as they renew an existing document&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169.4/6">That announcement in principle in 2003 was put into effect when we published the draft Bill, as long ago as April 2004, when we included the word &quot;must&quot; in clause 5(2). Yet again, we made it absolutely clear that, once designated, obtaining a passport would also involve being issued with an identity card.</p>
	<p pid="b.1169.4/7">It is also clear that, other than the biometrics&mdash;an important development in the whole security of card systems&mdash;no information will be required from an individual as part of that process that the state does not already hold in one form or another. To put the compulsory element of the designation of documents another way, it will be compulsory for information already held by the state to be placed on the national identity register. No new information will be required as part of that process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1170.0/1">As I understand it, a fully biometric passport that complies with European Union requirements should have a facial biometric and two fingerprints. However, as my right hon. Friend said at Question Time, he proposes to have up to 13 biometric elements stored on the national register. It is not correct to say that that information is required for the passport and that the Government would therefore necessarily have that information and the full biometrics.</p>

	<p pid="b.1170.1/1">My hon.

Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> are relevant in that respect. However, for a variety of reasons, all Governments are determined&mdash;it was set out in no less a source than the United Nations Security Council resolution last September&mdash;to move to a fully biometric scheme for passports. That is part of the overall world approach, which this Government strongly support, to the most secure system of biometrics to protect us most effectively in a wide variety of ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.1170.1/2">My hon. Friend's point is about biometrics for the passport scheme and not about the ID card scheme, although they are related. We believe, as a Government, that getting properly secure biometrics for the passport scheme is not only in our interests in this country but is part of our international obligations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1171.2/1">I invite the Home Secretary to be quite careful about this. I do not want him to mislead himself or anybody else. Is there not a difference between the international obligation and what the Government require? Under the international obligation, biometric information that can be read by a passport officer's machine appears on the face of the passport. What the Government require us to do is to provide biometric information on the passport that can be read by, and stored in, the national identity register. There is quite a difference of quality and principle that the Government keep eliding.</p>

	<p pid="b.1171.3/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman is right in one respect. We are in an evolving situation as far as the international requirements are concerned. That applies to the EU, the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the UN Security Council resolution. It is equally the case that many countries are evolving their own systems&mdash;whether they go for the number of biometrics that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1418" name="Lynne Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase> mentioned, for biometrics for all 10 fingers and thumbs or the 13 that we will have for our ID cards. It is also true that there are different states of decision in different countries on those points. All is evolving. However, both within the EU and in the dialogue between the EU and the United States that has explicitly addressed these matters, including in the G8 context, the overwhelming view is to move towards the most rigorous form of biometrics for fundamental documents such as passports and visas. That is the point that I am trying to make.</p>

	<p pid="b.1171.5/1">I have seen that report. If one considers different biometrics, one sees that there are different issues for different communities. The biometrics for the face, the iris and for fingerprints and thumbprints give rise to different issues in each case. However, as I know my hon. Friend will accept, the point is simple and straightforward. The more biometrics we have, the more reliable and fraud-proof is the system. For example, it is better to have biometrics for all 10 fingers and thumbs than it is to have them for one.</p>

	<p pid="b.1172.2/1">I need to make it clear that the register will be the record of each citizen's biometrics and a limited amount of other data relating to them, such as name, sex and so on. It will be a basic database for each of those people. The service to which I referred in the letter to my hon. Friend would enable other agencies, whether governmental or non-governmental, to use the data for the purpose of verification. An organisation that wants to use the central data will work via a verification service, which was the distinction that I was trying to draw.</p>

	<p pid="b.1173.2/1">As the right hon. Gentleman says, we can guarantee that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.2/2">Only one question needs to be asked about security: will the system that we are creating be more or less susceptible to fraud than the system that we have now? I argue strongly that the system that we are creating will be less susceptible to fraud, whether we are considering passports that are used fraudulently, or the variety of ways in which identity fraud is committed. Of course we will have to consider fraud under the new system, but we must compare the system that we are establishing with the existing system.</p>

	<p pid="b.1173.3/1">I shall make this intervention as constructively as I can. The simple truth is that the test is not simply whether the system will be better than that which we have now. Given that we will be spending a large sum, we must consider whether the system will be the best that might be available. Plenty of identity card systems do not challenge individual privacy or require massive central databases, but are far more secure than the system that the right hon. Gentleman proposes.</p>

	<p pid="b.1173.4/1">With the greatest respect to the right hon. Gentleman, I do not think that he is correct. The distinguishing aspect of the scheme is the move towards using fingerprint biometrics and other biometrics. To respond to the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, some 30 countries already intend to include fingerprint biometrics on their passports. As I said, the United States is increasing its programme. In my opinion it would be utterly foolish of us not to take advantage of the advances in biometrics to increase our security, and that is the intention behind the proposal.</p>

	<p pid="b.1173.5/1">If the Home Secretary is so confident in his proposal for a central database, why did the Home Office last month invite a number of technology companies and biometrics experts to submit proposals to put biometrics on cards as part of the ID scheme?</p>

	<p pid="b.1173.6/1">We had a substantial discussion with the whole industry about our proposals to ensure that we work as best we can with the most up-to-date technologies. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">The right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> was right to say that the technology is fast moving. Many companies are involved&mdash;many British companies are in the lead, by the way&mdash;and we want to work closely with them. That is an intelligent course for us to follow.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.6/2">My argument is that the ID cards system brings substantial benefits to both individuals and society and that the opt-out proposed by the Lords puts those benefits at risk. Focusing on passports and residence permits means that we can target a manageable number of people each year who will go through the process and minimise uncertainties that would otherwise apply to rolling out the scheme nationally. The benefits of the ID cards scheme will grow steadily as more people obtain their cards. By linking the process with the issue or renewal of a document such as a passport, which around 80 per cent. of the population already holds, there will be a manageable roll-out of the ID cards scheme. That is surely in the public interest. If those hon. Members who say that they are concerned about the cost of the scheme really do want to avoid excessive costs, they should accept the logic of combining the process of issuing ID cards with the issuing of passports or immigration documents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1173.6/3">In practice, of course, the process of obtaining a passport and an ID card will be combined in future, so issuing the two documents as a package will be just as convenient as applying for a biometric passport. When we introduce passports with fingerprint biometrics, the process of obtaining a passport and an ID card will be so similar as to make the need to combine the two quite obvious.</p>

	<p pid="b.1174.0/1">The Secretary of State mentioned costs. Has his Department conducted any studies of the cost implications of the amendment? What extra costs would there be to the taxpayer if the idea of combining ID cards with passports were abandoned?</p>

	<p pid="b.1174.1/1">The Department has not made a systematic, rigorous assessment of the costs that my hon. Friend describes, but we have considered the issue in principle, to see what the overall situation would be. As he implies, if the amendment were passed, the costs would be greater because they would be shared among fewer people and the implementation of the whole ID cards system would be far less assured. If the amendment proposed by the Lords were passed, the effect on both the cost and the roll-out of the scheme would be serious, but detailed costings would take some months to clarify.</p>

	<p pid="b.1174.2/1">Is not the logic of the Home Secretary's argument that, because the cost would be shared by fewer people, there is therefore less desire for ID cards in the country than he suspects? Would it not make more sense to accept the Lords amendments and respect the rights of individuals to choose how quickly the scheme is rolled out and whether they will take part in it, and thereby make it truly voluntary?</p>

	<p pid="b.1174.3/1">I think that I addressed that argument earlier. We have set out from the beginning our intention to move to a compulsory scheme in two phases&mdash;I said earlier what compulsion means in this case.</p>
	<p pid="b.1174.3/2">Let me now deal with the designated documents. First, I confirm again that the Government's intention is to designate British passports issued to UK residents aged 16 or over, so that an ID card must be issued alongside a passport, as a package. Secondly, it is intended to designate residence permits and other immigration documents issued to foreign nationals resident in the UK for more than three months. Thirdly, we intend to issue stand-alone ID cards, but they would be issued on a voluntary basis under clause 8 and would not require the use of the designation power in clause 4.</p>

	<p pid="b.1175.1/1">We believe that there is no problem of that type at all. The immigration documents that we are describing relate to people coming here on the basis of having to indicate their identity to gain residence permits.

	<p pid="b.1175.3/1">No, I want to make more progress and will give way in a moment, as I said.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175.3/2">We do intend to designate the passport. We do intend to designate residence permits and other immigration documents. We do intend to issue stand-alone identity cards, but on a voluntary basis, not a compulsory basis. As we have always made clear, however, we believe that the legislation should be flexible enough to allow for the possibility of designation of other official documents in the future. I have said that I would want to look at the possibility of designation of Criminal Records Bureau certificates in England and Wales. There may be a good case for designating those documents, but we would need to consider issues such as the impact on volunteers, and that would be for future consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175.3/3">In the light of some of the recent publicity, I should make it clear that, along with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, I have looked actively at designating driving licences, but we have decided not to do so. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency already uses the passport database to check, with consent, the identity of people applying for photocard licences. That is more secure for the DVLA and more convenient for individuals, who do not have to send their passport to the DVLA. In the same way, issuing driving licences to people with ID cards will be more secure and convenient, but we have no plans to require people to get an ID card before applying for a driving licence.</p>
	<p pid="b.1175.3/4">I should emphasis that, as my hon. Friend the Minister of State said, mandatory recall of paper driving licences is a measure to improve the security of driving licences and has nothing to do with ID cards. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport is considering the Government's position on the defeat in the House of Lords on the provision in the Road Safety Bill and will announce his intentions in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.1175.6/2">I need to make it clear that there will be no possibility of designating any document until the identity card scheme is introduced. The designation order will need to set out the exact details of the proposed class of document, with any exceptions, and will also need to specify the timetable for designation. Each designation order under clause 4 will need to be approved by both Houses of Parliament under the affirmative resolution procedure. It could not be done for any particular document, including all those that I have mentioned, without a very full opportunity for proper debate and scrutiny.</p>

I should also make it clear at this juncture that there will be the opportunity for Parliament to debate the level of fees to be charged as the identity cards fee regime is also to be set in regulations, subject to the affirmative order procedure. All subsequent changes to the level of fees, apart from increases due to inflation, will be subject to the affirmative procedure, and will thus need the approval of both Houses. I hope that I have shown that it is essential that we have a clear and definite link between an application for a designated document such as a passport and an entry on the national identity register.

However, given that there would be a limited debate if such an order were made, does he not accept that there is a need for a wider debate when the measure returns to the Lords, bearing in mind the principle of the matter and its crucial importance for many of us?

I am ready to facilitate such a debate, and it is a perfectly reasonable request for the hon. Gentleman to make. I can assure him that we would seek to facilitate debate on all those matters. While it is important that Parliament has the opportunity to address them, people must accept that the key point in relation to passports, residence permits, immigration documents and the Criminal Records Bureau check is that the amount of information given by the individual to the state would be the same as it is now. It is not a question of new information coming online for the state&mdash;it is a question of putting that new information, with its biometric assurance, on to a national identity register so that it can work more effectively. Individuals will therefore not give more information to the state than they do at present. That is an important point to grasp.</p>

Member for Haltemprice and Howden, a series of practical questions arise that are subject to active discussion in those circumstances.

	<p pid="b.1178.0/1">I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's generosity. As he will know, of 45 clauses in the original Bill no fewer than 25 provided for order-making powers. He has celebrated the fact that the Government will require the use of the affirmative procedure in many instances in future, and he is perfectly entitled to do so. However, as it is vital that our proceedings are intelligible to outside observers, will he put on the record something that we in the Chamber know? If there is a debate on the affirmative procedure, that does not mean a debate on the Floor of the House. It means a debate upstairs, in a small Committee compromising no more than 30 Members and often substantially fewer. It is important that the public should not&mdash;inadvertently, of course&mdash;be misled.</p>

	<p pid="b.1178.6/1">May I begin by saying that I am sorry that the Prime Minister cannot be here today? I doubt that his absence will have as great an influence on the votes tonight as his previous absence, but at least the Home Secretary and I can draw some pleasure from the fact that the phrase, &quot;Detained in South Africa&quot; has a nicer tone today than it did 20 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.6/2">I wish to discuss the national identity register much more than the piece of plastic or the biometric attached to identity card. The rather arcane subject of this debate is designation. In practice, it is the most controversial and, indeed, the most important debate that we shall hold today, because it will determine whether the ID card scheme is covertly rendered compulsory or not. In 2005, under the heading, &quot;Strong and secure borders,&quot; page 52 of the 111-page Labour manifesto said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.6/3" class="indent">&quot;We will introduce ID cards, including biometric data like fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out initially on a voluntary basis as people renew their passports.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.6/4">I heard what the Home Secretary said about consultation papers and so on, but any reasonable member of the public would deduce that they could choose whether or not to have an ID card when they renewed their passport. That is a perfectly reasonable conclusion to draw, but it is the opposite of what the Government intend. To justify what this Bill does, the Labour manifesto should have said: &quot;We will introduce ID cards, including biometric data like fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out initially on a compulsory basis for a progressively larger portion of the population as people renew their passports.&quot; That is the truth of today's proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.6/5">Faced with that fact, Baroness Scotland, speaking on behalf of the Government, tried to claim that passports are voluntary. That is not the case if someone's work takes them abroad, nor if their parents live abroad, nor if their spouse or partner is from an another country. Nor is it the case if their children travel abroad, fall sick or get into trouble. It is a novel interpretation of &quot;voluntary&quot; if the price of a foreign holiday is a requirement for inclusion in the national identity register. The Lords therefore amended the Bill, quite properly in my view, to remove that creeping compulsion, and make inclusion on the register optional when someone receives or renews a passport. That is what the Government are seeking to reverse, for reasons to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.6/6">The Government may ask why that should be voluntary. If people are already getting a passport, what is the reason for turning down an identity card? There are many good reasons for not wanting to be on the national identity register, which involves a large number of pieces of data about each individual being put on a single Government database, many of them the access keys for other Government databases. That is the important point: it is a central database with access keys effectively to all the other Government databases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.6/7">It is disingenuous of the Home Secretary to say, &quot;We've already got all those.&quot; One of the transitions that has taken place over the past several years under the Government, and to a small extent under the previous Government too, is the removal of barriers to the transfer of information around Government. Those barriers were a protection of the liberties of the individual, and now they have gone. Many have gone for good reason&mdash;to make the Child Support Agency work, to stop terrorism, and so on&mdash;and the Bill will accelerate that process.</p>
	<p pid="b.1178.6/8">I ask the House to forgive me for a political point, but it is one that I care about very much. After the way the Government treated Martin Sixsmith, Pam Warren, Rose Addis and others, seeking information about them and using it to destroy reputations, I would not trust them with data about my life, let alone anyone else's.</p>

	<p pid="b.1179.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman has spoken about bringing together different databases and his concerns about that. Can he give me an example of two pieces of data that are currently held on separate databases that he does not want brought together, and why?</p>

	<p pid="b.1180.0/1">I shall use the examples that I was discussing. When Pam Warren, the rail safety campaigner, was a thorn in the side of the Government, a special adviser, I think, was known to say, &quot;Let's look into her political background, her sex life and other such things.&quot; <i>[Interruption.]</i> A medical database can give all sorts of information&mdash;visits to clinics, visits to gynaecologists and the like. I shall be happy to take an intervention from the Home Secretary, if he wants to tell me that in due course it will not be possible to access medical databases through the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1180.0/2">When people set about trying to create an embarrassing story about somebody, the more detail and the more data they get, the better. Experts in the area have spoken to the official Opposition, and I suspect to the Liberal party as well, of their concern that the audit trail will be loaded on to the database&mdash;in other words, every point of access on the database will be logged and recorded. If those on the Government Front Bench want to challenge that as untrue, I am happy to take an intervention. No. Okay.</p>

	<p pid="b.1180.2/2">In the run-up to the debate there was an independent report about the cost and technical capability of the proposed systems&mdash;an independent report by the London School of Economics. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I expected hon. Members to groan. The Government&mdash;and, to my surprise, the Home Secretary&mdash;have been attacking the individuals who drew up that report. As a result, Howard Davies, the head of the LSE, wrote to the Government saying, &quot;You are wrong to attack individuals who wrote the report. Sixty different people wrote it. It was peer reviewed. It was written by experts on various aspects of ID card technology.&quot; I will return to their views.</p>

	<p pid="b.1180.4/1">Of course such a person would be fined if he were caught, but one of the problems with the proposal is that high volumes of data would be travelling round the system, and it is not good enough to say that there would be a small fine.</p>

Gentleman does, that the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary, Mr. Alastair Campbell and a legion of special advisers are all saints. Let us imagine they believe that.

	<p pid="b.1181.4/1">Since there are only six pieces of personal information on the national identity register&mdash;name, sex, date of birth, place of birth, nationality and address&mdash;how would the collection of those data, which are already collected for passports, make it any easier or more difficult for the kind of revelations described by the right hon.

	<p pid="b.1181.5/1">The primary concern is about a piece of data giving access to other databases&mdash;for example, driving licence number or national insurance number. Such pieces of information are the access keys to other databases. I shall return to that in detail, because there is expert evidence that causes concern among people who know a great deal about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1181.5/2">Earlier, in Home Office questions, the Home Secretary made the dubious claim that the Passport Agency has been a tremendous success, which was sort of reiterated in an unqualified way by the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee. The Home Secretary must have far different criteria for success from me and the rest of the country, who have seen many millions of our money squandered on that. It overran significantly and led to great inconvenience for a large number of people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1181.5/3">As I said to the right hon. Gentleman, four Government agencies have seen projects with a total budget of nearly &pound;9 billion record spectacular failures, racking up a combined overspend of &pound;33.9 billion. Even simple databases are often beyond the Home Office. Why should we imagine that it is capable of setting up the very complex register required by the Bill in an acceptable and workable way? If it goes wrong, that may manifest itself in problems and delays in getting the designated document. How much longer will it take to get a passport if we add the ID card requirements? Once we have renewed our passports, we are required to keep the Government informed of any changes. We will have to tell the Government every time we change our address, on pain of a fine of &pound;1,000, which is quite a lot of money.</p>

	<p pid="b.1182.0/1">I have been listening to the right hon. Gentleman's argument and he makes the point about the alleged unreliability of Home Office IT projects. Does he agree that in fact the process being outlined for what is effectively an evolutionary process for putting data on a database is the proper and valid way to proceed in order to ensure that all procedures are tried and tested before we have the debate on compulsory registration, and that these processes can inform that debate? Should he not therefore be supporting the Government?</p>

	<p pid="b.1182.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a decent point in truth. A large database should be introduced on an evolutionary basis and slowly. However, that could be done on a much more steady basis with a voluntary system. The point here is the strategic problem of the database itself, but I will come back to that in a moment because it is a serious point to take on.</p>
	<p pid="b.1182.1/2">There is also the question of inaccuracy. The Government have tried to persuade the public of the value of an identity card, but they have not considered the consequences if there are erroneous records. Many hon. Members have dealt with personal disasters that have befallen constituents when some data held about them have been wrong. As the Select Committee Chairman will know, the Home Office cannot even ensure that the Criminal Records Bureau database is accurate. At one point two thirds of it was in error, and at the last check it was one third. Those are serious errors in what should be an absolutely accurate record. So what chance with a 40 million person database? So there are many major problems even before one considers the hundreds of thousands of people who will be the victims of false positive or false negative biometric tests, as has been clear from the studies done.</p>
	<p pid="b.1182.1/3">Finally, there is the most important question about the whole issue&mdash;the insecurity of the system. The Government have made, in a way properly, much of the issue of identity theft, particularly with regard to terrorism. Yet their proposal&mdash;a point I referred to earlier&mdash;is to gather the access keys to virtually every Government database in the national identity register, put them on one large computer and then create many thousands of direct access points to that computer. They will have created the most attractive possible target for every fraudster, terrorist, confidence trickster and hacker on the planet. Those people will be able to lift data out and put viruses and false data in.</p>
	<p pid="b.1182.1/4">If the Pentagon and Microsoft cannot keep hackers from penetrating their mainframes, what chance the Home Office? Speaking about the scheme, Microsoft's national technology officer has said that a central identity database could worsen the very problems that it was intended to prevent, such as terrorism and identity theft. He said that</p>
	<p pid="b.1182.1/5" class="indent">&quot;ministers should not be building systems that allow hackers to mine information so easily.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1182.1/6">So, far from protecting the public, the Government will put the individual citizen at risk by creating a culture of complacency that is based on an ill-designed and ill-thought-out scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1182.1/7">Incidentally, this is yet another area where the Government mounted a mendacious attack on the independent LSE report. I will deal with that in detail because it is rather important. The section of the report that highlights the very serious security flaws in the proposed system was written not by an antagonist of the identity card system, but by somebody who favours identity cards, Dr. Brian Gladman, the ex-technical director of NATO, who had an eminent career in the British military ensuring the security of our military computer systems. He himself has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1182.1/8" class="indent">&quot;the UK ID cards programme as now envisaged will create safety and security risks for those whose details are entered into the system.&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.1182.1/9">that from an avowed supporter of ID cards.</p>

	<p pid="b.1183.0/1">I have listened carefully to the right hon.

I struggle to understand why he is against ID cards, but in favour of passports. His main point seems to be that passports are compulsory, so if ID cards are applied to people with a passport, they will become compulsory too. But is he really saying that passports are compulsory?</p>

There is a national identity register. It is a central database system. It has many thousands of access points around the country. It has to do so because that is the way it works. It is different from most other identity card systems around the world. The compulsory ones are largely localised databases, not national, and that is why they cost only about &pound;4 a head, not the sort of cost that this system will engender when we see it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183.1/2">In a moment of frankness last year, the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality admitted that the Government had exaggerated the value of ID cards in the fight against terrorism. He was very honest, he always is, and I give him credit for that. But as Dr. Gladman suggests, the truth may be far worse. The creation of the national identity register may create a mechanism that will actually allow terrorists to operate under the radar more effectively, undetected until their plans come to fruition. All of those are good reasons for individual citizens not to want to put their details on the national identity register.</p>

	<p pid="b.1184.0/1">Will the right hon. Gentleman confirm that the whole purpose of having a clean identity base is to ensure that once someone's identity has been verified by taking the biometric, that biometric can then never be used by anyone else? If someone takes someone's identity to begin with, they would have to continue with that identity for the rest of their lives. Therefore, the purpose of a clean identity base nationally is to achieve what the Conservative party paraded as its policy before the election, namely, an understanding of who is in the country, who is entitled to work, who is entitled to services and to ensure that those who are not, are precluded from working, drawing down on free services or being involved in other such ventures. Is that not the case?</p>

	<p pid="b.1184.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes a point that he adheres to honestly and straightforwardly, but on which we differ, and that is that it is possible for the proposed system to be entirely clear and to have perfect integrity. When we were considering the early stages of this when he was still Home Secretary, I went to see the Metropolitan police, at that point under Sir John Stevens&mdash;I know a favourite of his&mdash;and I talked to him and all his deputy commissioners about their interest in the system. I put to them a question that I subsequently put to his previous advisers, to the Cabinet Office advisers, and to the briefers who talked to us about this at various stages. The question was this: how will somebody be prevented from putting a virus into one of the many thousands of access points in the system to change a piece of data, for example, relating to me, by inserting a little programme that says that every time a question is asked about me, answer yes?</p>

	<p pid="b.1184.5/1">I have not finished answering this question. I will give way to the hon. Lady in a moment. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr.   Blunkett)</phrase> deserves a clear reply because he will know more of the inwardnesses of this than many others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184.5/2">The second point with regard to creating a clean database is that, as the right hon. Gentleman will know, whoever creates it will have to have some originating documents. One of our concerns about this was the prospect that people would come in from mainland Europe and have three months clear, without doing anything, but even if they did nothing for three months, they might come in with documents that were cleared in another part of Europe that is perhaps a little less careful than we are. I will not insult any particular country by picking it out, but they do exist and the right hon. Gentleman knows as well as I do who they are.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184.5/3">Earlier today, we heard concerns about the common travel area and the Irish Republic, and although we do not know what the outcome will be, that issue represents a 5 million-person hole in the system. Given the value of corrupting the system, the size of the system and the fact that all the data will be in one place, people will try to corrupt the system and&mdash;I hate to say this&mdash;the likelihood is that they will succeed. The right hon. Gentleman has asked a good question, but his argument is not right.</p>

	<p pid="b.1185.0/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the disproportionate basis on which people from different communities are likely to be stopped, searched and therefore have their information accessed on the database is another good reason not to introduce such a database? And does he know whether the Minister has conducted a proper race impact assessment and, if so, have the proposals been changed?</p>

	<p pid="b.1185.1/1">I am not aware that such a race impact assessment has been conducted. The hon. Lady is right that the system will be disproportionate in a variety of interesting ways, and it will disproportionately affect minority communities in some respects. Early adopters on the database are likely to be the least risky people. A person who poses a risk to the country at large will not want to sign up for a passport or any other documentation, if they can avoid doing so. For example, an illegal immigrant would clearly not want to sign up for such documentation, and many others would take the same approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.1185.1/2">It looks like the system will not bite for the best part of a decade, so it will not do any good for the best part of a decade. Why are the Government breaking their manifesto pledge to make the first stage voluntary and insisting on this covert, creeping compulsion? The answer is simple: they know that this expensive, cumbersome system will never be popular once it is up and running, and they will therefore contrive every method possible to ensure that the massive majority of the population are already signed up, whether they like it or not, before the question of compulsion is put before Parliament again. Whether the method involves a super-affirmative order or whether it involves primary legislation, 70 to 80 per cent. of the population will be in the system before we re-examine the matter, which will be presented as an inevitable development.</p>

	<p pid="b.1185.2/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is a question of not only numbers signed up, but money spent? Will he accept that the Government, who should be candid enough to acknowledge this fact, are seeking to create a ratchet whereby so much money is spent&mdash;wisely or unwisely; for good or ill&mdash;that the point will come when Ministers have the temerity to argue that not proceeding to compulsion would waste that money?</p>

	<p pid="b.1185.3/1">My hon. Friend is exactly right. The Government want us to face an argument of inevitability. They will say, &quot;We have got a huge sunk cost. The vast majority of the population is on the system already&mdash;why not make it everybody?&quot; That will seem eminently practical and sensible, but the benefits will not have accrued, because, as Ministers know, if the ID cards system is going to do many of the things that the Government claim, it must be compulsory&mdash;carrying an ID card will probably have to be compulsory, too, but we can address that point in five years' time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1185.3/2">Passports will ensure that some 80 per cent. of the population is on the register in a decade. I was mildly surprised by the Home Secretary's remarks about driving licences, because the Government tried to take the power to recall all driving licences in the Road Safety Bill. The Home Secretary has said that that was not to allow further designation for ID cards, and I must believe him, but the Lords did not believe him, and they blocked the measure. That is not an issue now, although it might have been, but it is another reason not to allow the Government the right to enforce this creeping compulsion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1185.3/3">There is a final, serious matter of principle. The way in which the Government have gone about trying to deliver this Bill is of a piece with what they have done to other hard-won rights of the British people. The ID card will make no difference to serious security issues for at least a decade, if ever, and the difference may not be positive, too. Before then, this House will make a serious and considered decision about compulsion. Let us not allow ourselves to discover at that point that we have inadvertently already made that decision. Let us not discover too late that we have sleepwalked into the surveillance state. Let us protect the British citizen's right to choose, and this House's eventual right to decide. Let us reject the Government amendment this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="b.1186.0/1">I shall begin by saying something that will comfort <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase>. Again, I shall quote the Home Affairs Committee report on ID cards, which addressed the question of the use of language:</p>
	<p pid="b.1186.0/2" class="indent">&quot;For most people, to travel abroad and to drive are fundamentals. It cannot be argued that these would be given up voluntarily. To describe the first phase of the Government's proposals as 'voluntary' stretches the English language to breaking point.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1186.0/3">Ministers have got themselves into a little bit of unnecessary difficulty through that choice of word.</p>
	<p pid="b.1186.0/4">In reality, people must accept that if they want a passport, they will have to go on to the national identity register, and the question is whether that is justifiable. As a supporter of ID cards and the national identity register, it seems to me that that approach is right and sensible. It would be nonsense to go through the entire process of collecting one set of biometric data and storing it with all the relevant background information for the purpose of issuing a passport, and then to run an entirely separate exercise in parallel to collect slightly different biometric data and store them on a different identity register in order to have an ID card system. Running the two systems together will be far more convenient for the citizen, and it makes much more sense in terms of building a system that has integrity and security. Furthermore, it will certainly be far more cost- effective. Moving towards ID cards and a national identity register means that using passports as a designated document is the sensible way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.1186.0/5">To be fair, the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden spent most of his speech attacking the principle behind the measure rather than the use of the word &quot;voluntary&quot;. He attempted to argue that we should not require people to go on to the national identity register as part of the process of obtaining a passport because the risks posed by the national identity register are so immense that it is unjustifiable to ask people to go on to it. That basic contention lies at the heart of the entire debate about ID cards, but those fears are misplaced.</p>
	<p pid="b.1186.0/6">The scheme's opponents have failed to make substantive arguments. I know that it is slightly bad form to quote one's own intervention and the response to it, but I shall do so on this occasion. When the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden made a powerful point about the dangers of bringing different databases together, I asked him to name two pieces of data that are kept separately and that he thinks it would be dangerous to bring together. Hon. Members will have noted that he could not name two pieces of data that we should not put together in one place. He mentioned medical records and criminal records, which have nothing to do with ID cards, and names and national insurance numbers are stored together on plenty of databases. He could not establish what would go wrong if two particular pieces of data were stored together.</p>

	<p pid="b.1187.0/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the register will contain extra detail that is not currently held on other databases, such as the footprint of questions put to the new database and when someone last went to a doctor? It will also contain NHS numbers and criminal record numbers, which will be taken from one database and put on another.</p>

	<p pid="b.1187.2/1">When the right hon. Gentleman raised that point, I was dealing with amusing heckling. I shall take up his point in a way that may embarrass my party, but never mind. A previous Chancellor&mdash;he is now Lord Lamont&mdash;became known as our &quot;flexible friend&quot; because of one or two pieces of data in relation to a credit card. The simple point is that it allows fishing expeditions, which people undertake if they are trying to embarrass somebody or to find something that puts them in a difficult position. The easier those fishing expeditions are, the more dangerous it is to the privacy of the individual.</p>

	<p pid="b.1187.3/1">Let me say in passing that two of the suggestions made by Opposition Members about what would on the database are incorrect. The right hon. Gentleman says that there will be fishing expeditions. That is to assume something unjustifiable&mdash;that nothing in the law that we are being invited to pass, nothing in the system of regulation, and nothing in the system of oversight can ever be expected to work. He conjured up an image of huge numbers of individuals with a right of access to the database. First, that is not true. Secondly, those people who will be allowed access to the database for the purposes of crime prevention, for example, would be able to do so if they were not able to access that information in another form. Given that all the information is already on a Government database and can be accessed under existing crime-fighting powers, the Bill gives no significant increase in access to the people about whom the right hon. Gentleman is worrying.</p>
	<p pid="b.1187.3/2">The only new issue that arises is that of the audit trail about an individual registration. That would be subject to exactly the same controls that exist on access to information that is already on the Government database. Throughout this debate, not only today but previously, I have struggled to understand exactly why access to that audit trail by proper and regulated authorities for the purposes of crime prevention is seen as massively detrimental to the interests of the individual. It is not; in fact, it is just as likely to be of value to the individual. Let us take as an example the hypothetical situation of a Chancellor of the Exchequer who had been accused of shopping in Thresher's when he wished to say that he had been in no such place. In those circumstances, the individual would have had access to the audit trail and been able to prove that he had been nowhere near Thresher's on that occasion. The audit trail is of far more advantage to the individual than to any other authority.</p>

	<p pid="b.1188.2/1">My right hon. Friend is going through the arguments in a cogent way that will convince many people. We may be able to introduce more and more safeguards into the system through encryption and so on, but the key issue on legislation of such importance is to ensure that we have the confidence of the British public. We can do that in two ways&mdash;by putting it to them in a general election in which they can vote for that system, or by having them buy into the system through personal decisions. When we put it to them in a general election, they voted for a voluntary system. The Bill does not allow them to have that, and the only way in which we can give it to them is by an individual decision on a voluntary basis, as the amendment suggests.</p>

	<p pid="b.1188.3/2">It has been pretty clear throughout that the Government intended to link the issuing of ID cards and the establishment of a national identity register to passports. That has never been a secret. It was clear at the time of our Select Committee report, when we were working on the assumption that driving licences would also be included. There has been no deception of the public. No danger is brought about by bringing the data together.</p>

The third question is whether the database can, by virtue of its very existence, be hacked into by people trying to get a list of identities that they can use to mimic or fake them in some way. Of all the issues in the debate, that needs to be taken the most seriously. When our Committee heard a wide variety of technical evidence on these questions, I was convinced that there are no insuperable or unknown technical obstacles to designing the database in such a way as to make it free from such attack. There will be a huge responsibility on Home Office Ministers and their team to get those technical questions right, but it is an entirely resolvable problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.1189.3/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. To listen to some speakers, one would think that the national identity register will run live, rather like national rail inquiries on the internet, so that one can go in and access information. That is not how it will operate. There will not be lots of live access points with people interacting with the system and being able, for example, to get viruses into it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1189.3/2">It would be possible to say, &quot;For the elimination of all doubt, let's not do this.&quot; That leads to the conclusion that it would be better not to have a Revenue and Customs computer or any other type of computerised system that could allow for hacking and destruction. The gains of this system, to our society and to individuals, vastly outweigh the risks that can be identified.</p>

	<p pid="b.1189.4/1">Is it not an heroic act of faith to suggest that few, if any, weaknesses can be attributed to the likely design of the system? The history of IT systems in the past 20 to 30 years is one of determined and ingenious individuals circumventing and overcoming such low obstacles as might prevent their being hacked into. That will not give much reassurance to potential Winston Smiths.</p>

The risks to individuals and society of having any type of internet exchange of financial information are vastly greater than anything to do with a national identity register, yet we have not banned internet banking. The vast majority of problems have arisen from individuals volunteering their own information to fraudsters. The existence of a huge variety of very sensitive internet applications that are used with great confidence across the world, day in, day out, should give us the confidence to believe that this important project can be delivered and will work.</p>

	<p pid="b.1190.1/1">I begin by picking up a point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">the    right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> made. I hope that I do not misrepresent him when I say that I understood him to argue that all    the information exists on various Government databases and it is therefore not objectionable to bring it together, and that exceptional access to it would be allowed only for the prevention and detection of crime. If I have misrepresented him, he can intervene&mdash;he does not wish to do that, so I presume that I have not.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190.1/2">I have never been one to allow the facts to get in the way of a good rant, but when I listened to the right hon. Gentleman I had occasion to examine the terms of the Bill. Clause 1(3) sets out the statutory purposes for the maintenance of the national identity register, including:</p>
	<p pid="b.1190.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the provision of a secure and reliable method for registrable facts about such individuals to be ascertained or verified wherever that is necessary in the public interest.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1191.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point, to which I cannot add. Given the constraints of time, I do not intend even to try. However, he brings me neatly to my first substantive point, which deals with compulsion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/2">My noble Friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury put the matter nicely when he moved the amendment in another place. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/3" class="indent">&quot;We seek to replace compulsion by voluntarism. Citizens should not be forced to have ID cards. Compulsion is far too often resorted to by the modern state. That comes from an intensely managerial culture in which regulation rules. That sits uneasily with fundamental rights such as privacy and voluntarism. This Bill is an authentic clash between such rights and managerial efficiency.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 January 2006; Vol. 677, c. 957.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/4">That outlines well the divide between the Government and us on the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/5">I must also reinforce <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the point of the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> about the Labour manifesto commitment, which is worth reading into the record. It states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/6" class="indent">&quot;We will introduce ID cards, including biometric data like fingerprints, backed up by a national register and rolling out initially on a voluntary basis as people renew their passports.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/7">The Home Secretary has already accepted today that the process of designating documents, especially passports, brings with it an element of compulsion. That is why the Government want to include the word &quot;must&quot; in the Bill, while we believe that it should be &quot;may&quot;. I do not understand how the Government can square that circle or perceive their comments today as anything other than a blatant breach of their manifesto commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/8">Approximately 85 per cent. of the population hold passports. If we are to link the identity register and identity cards with the renewal of passports, when we pass the second Bill&mdash;which we shall eventually be allowed to discuss&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">there will be, as the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> said, an irresistible momentum behind compulsion. The argument will be presented that we already hold the information and that it would therefore be such a waste if we did not move to    compulsion. The designated documents mean compulsion by the back door.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/9">I am worried by the way the Government have tried to conflate the sensible case for biometrics for passports&mdash;when we debated the matter in Committee, we stressed that we did not object to that&mdash;and the use of biometrics for identity cards. There are several important distinctions to be drawn. First, passports will hold considerably fewer biometrics than are proposed for identity cards. Passports will not be subject to the same footprint through the database that is to be attached to the national identity register. A much wider range of information will be held under schedule 1 on the identity register than that held in relation to a passport.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/10">Schedule 1 provides for &quot;personal information&quot;, including name,</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/11" class="indent">&quot;other names by which he is or has been known . . . date of birth . . . place of birth . . . gender . . . the address of his principal place of residence in the United Kingdom . . . the address of every other place in the United Kingdom where he has a place of residence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/12">The &quot;identifying information&quot; includes the biometrics and the photograph. Provision is made for &quot;residential status&quot; and no fewer than 13 &quot;personal reference numbers&quot;, which include</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/13" class="indent">&quot;any driver number given to him by a driving licence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.0/14">Surely that cannot be described as akin to the limited information that is held in relation to a passport.</p>

	<p pid="b.1192.5/2">It is worth reminding ourselves of what we compel people to do by insisting on a compulsory link between a designated document and an identity card. We are not considering an innocuous little piece of plastic, but everything that underpins it: the national identity register and its database and the occasions, places and purposes for which it is used. The Government are trying to foist on us a position whereby we will leave a footprint of where we have been, what we have done and why we have had to access public services.</p>

	<p pid="b.1192.6/1">The hon. Gentleman referred to the Labour manifesto, which made it clear that identity cards were to be voluntary. Does he agree that if the Government were so confident about the success of ID cards they would agree to their being voluntary? If they were so good, and if everyone could see how wonderful they were, everyone would sign up for one. Surely this creeping compulsion shows that, despite the Home Office having wanted to introduce them for years, Ministers do not feel very confident about them deep down.</p>

Lady has done me a service, in that she has made my last point for me. If everything that the Government claim about identity cards were true, they would not need to be compulsory because everyone would want them. Clearly it is not, and clearly they do not. That is why the Government want compulsion.</p>

	<p pid="b.1193.1/1">People listening to this debate might be in danger of getting a little confused, because the first 90 minutes have been taken up with a debate about whether the cards should be voluntary or compulsory. I agree that we were right to accept the earlier Lords amendment to require separate primary legislation on this issue. Constitutionally, we now know where we are, and that is a much better way of doing things.</p>
	<p pid="b.1193.1/2">This amendment is also about the argument between compulsory versus voluntary. Here, however, I agree with the Government. I oppose the Lords amendment because it is important to preserve the requirement for the decision on the national identity register to be taken at a later stage. In the short term, very little will happen. When we apply for a passport, we already have to give our name, address, date and place of birth, sex and nationality. Those six pieces of information are then stored on a separate database known as the national insurance register. I waited for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> to reveal why the provisions would have the effect of making secret information more accessible. I waited in vain, however, because he never came to the point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1193.1/3">The Government already have many databases that contain that same basic information. The electoral register, for example, contains our names and addresses. The Inland Revenue possesses the names and addresses, and many more details, of 40 million people, and the national insurance register contains the details of 60 million people. I believe that eBay has a database of 157 million users.</p>

	<p pid="b.1193.5/1">As my hon. Friend knows, we have only four minutes left in this debate, and I have not intervened on others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1193.5/2">A voluntary ID register makes no more sense than voluntary bus fares or voluntary juries. The huge benefits that will come to the citizen, to the Government and to private industry with the introduction of ID cards are to a large extent dependent on it being compulsory for everyone's name to be on the national identity register. The figures in the Home Office benefits overview show that we could draw benefits worth &pound;1.1 billion from the existence of such a register, but that we would draw 100 per cent. of those benefits only if we had 100 per cent. take-up. With only 50 per cent. take-up, the benefits would be less than 10 per cent. of that figure. This is precisely the point that the amendment does not deal with. With a take-up of only 60 per cent., the benefits would be less than 20 per cent. Only when we pass the 80 to 90 per cent. take-up rate will the benefits of this legislation really come to us.</p>
	<p pid="b.1193.5/3">The lion's share of the benefits, in financial terms, will come from fraud prevention and the reduced cost of crime. Only a small benefit will come, in the earlier stages, from the greater efficiency of public services and from more effective control of work permits and visas. If we had a low take-up, we would see significant benefits only in public services and in immigration, although the savings would still be well worth having to organisations such as the Criminal Records Bureau, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, the Department for Education and Skills and the immigration and nationality directorate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1193.5/4">To reduce fraud, however, we need everyone to be in the scheme. As long as we are allowed to present alternative forms of identification, such as utility bills, the people who intend to commit fraud will do just that. It is ironic that hon. Members who were concerned about the weakness of List 99 and the sex offenders register should have missed the point that those weaknesses are in large part due to the lack of any way of being sure of someone's identity. The Criminal Records Bureau has estimated that the time needed to carry out a check would come down from four weeks to three days if we had ID cards. More importantly, the result of that check would be much more secure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1193.5/5">The other point that we have missed is that the largest beneficiary of a full ID card system would be not the Government but the citizen. When someone has their identity stolen, they do not usually lose out financially. It is the bank that loses, and passes the cost on to other users. According to the Home Office, the benefit of ID cards would amount to about &pound;420 million for the citizen, and a similar amount to industry, but only about &pound;240 million to public services. We have only to consider the costs and benefits of the ID card system to see that&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.1203.3/1">I should say at the beginning that the Government support amendment (a), tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> and, should the need arise, the Government will move it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.3/2">The amendments cover the requirement for openness in relation to the costs of the identity card scheme. That is a legitimate request, with which I shall deal head on. It is of course desirable that as much information as possible about the scheme is placed in the public domain. However, it is true to say that that aim has to be balanced by the need to secure best value in an open procurement process and to adhere to the guidelines for such Government procurement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.3/3">We have two legitimate aims, therefore, that pull in opposite directions. We have to seek to resolve that tension and strike a balance. We believe that my right hon. Friend's amendment does just that, with subsection (4) being the crucial element. By contrast, the alternative amendment passed by the other place is heavy-handed and prescriptive and would not allow us to achieve best value in the procurement process. It would of course also be something of a precedent to accept that amendment and we will resist it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.3/4">We have made available a full account of the costs of the identity card scheme and we are pleased this evening to account again for the costs and explain them in some detail. We touched on the issue earlier in the debate, and we heard some inaccurate and misleading comment designed to undermine public confidence in the scheme. Some even claimed that a card would cost as much as &pound;300. I would not pay &pound;300 for an identity card, and nor would I expect my constituents to do so. Those costs, I am pleased to say, are completely wrong.</p>

	<p pid="b.1203.4/1">Does the Minister agree that his   comments would carry much more weight if No. 10 Downing street had not published the somewhat fatuous report on the &pound;1.7 billion cost of identity fraud that was pulled apart by experts on both sides of the argument?</p>

	<p pid="b.1204.0/1">The hon. Gentleman should be cautious about rubbishing the figures that were placed in the public domain, not by No. 10 Downing street but by the identity fraud steering committee, which works under the auspices of the Home Office but brings together a range of partners from the public and private sectors and is engaged in a serious attempt to tackle a real threat. I am sure that the figure placed in the public domain underestimates the true cost of identity fraud. The hon. Gentleman is wrong to suggest that it was a cynical exercise. The group has been meeting for some time and its methodology and the breakdown of its figures were placed in the Library. I urge the hon. Gentleman to look at the detail if he has not done so already.</p>

	<p pid="b.1204.1/1">Does the Minister recognise the public's concern that the costs of the scheme might be better spent on more police officers on the beat and tighter border controls? There is natural suspicion that the costs of any Government procurement scheme, especially one involving IT, are likely to exceed the amount stated, not fall below it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1204.2/1">I have two points to make in response. First, it is not a case of either/or. The hon. Gentleman will know&mdash;the point has been made many times&mdash;that this Government have invested significantly in police on the beat and we are proud to have done so. His main point&mdash;and a mistake made by the Opposition throughout the debate&mdash;is the suggestion that a pot of funds is sitting in the Home Office to pay for the entire scheme and that it can easily be directed to another Home Office priority. The whole premise is that the basis of funding the scheme will be the same as for passports: the costs of running the passport service are predominantly recovered from the fees people pay for their passport. That principle will continue when we introduce a biometric ID card system.</p>

	<p pid="b.1204.3/1">May I draw Members' attention to the Minister's letter of 7 February, which was sent only to Labour Members? In attacking the London School of Economics' report on the costs of the project, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1204.3/2" class="indent">&quot;The LSE also allocated an inflated &pound;1 billion marketing budget and assumed a much higher loss/theft rate than is the case for existing documents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1204.3/3">Was not the Minister aware when he wrote the letter that the Government had received a denial of that point on 5 August 2005 when the LSE responded to the Government response to the LSE report? Surely he was aware that the LSE status report issued in January 2006 stated that it had made no such estimate. Would he care to correct that erroneous allegation, which continues the line of ad hominem attacks that he and his colleagues have made on Simon Davies and his colleagues?</p>

	<p pid="b.1204.6/1">I am answering the hon. and learned Gentleman's point, so perhaps he could give me a moment to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1204.6/2">I am pleased that the hon. and learned Gentleman has attached himself to the parliamentary Labour party mailing list&mdash;I do not know what his intentions are. He will see from my letter that, based on our scheme, the main cost driver assumed by the LSE is incorrect. The LSE assumed a five-year refresh rate for biometric enrolment, but there is no evidence to support that as the main assumption for the scheme&mdash;the major basis on which we have challenged the LSE figures, because they would add enormous costs to the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1205.0/1">Can we get a straight admission from the Minister that the allegation in his letter, that the LSE allocated an inflated &pound;1 billion marketing budget, is wrong? If that is true, where does it appear in any of the LSE documents? There is no point in the Minister trying to avoid the point: is it true or not? He has been told by the LSE that it is not true, so why does not he tell the House what he thinks?</p>

	<p pid="b.1205.1/1">I do not intend to debate the detail of the LSE report. If I need to correct anything, I shall write to the hon. and learned Gentleman, but I can say with confidence that the LSE figures have moved around somewhat. In a discussion with me in the House, one of the authors of the report said publicly that they would have to &quot;revise downwards&quot; some of the figures. It has been quite hard to keep track of the some of the LSE figures, but I do not want the debate to be purely about that point.</p>

	<p pid="b.1205.3/1">I want to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.3/2">My two key points are, first, that the costs of the scheme are both realistic and affordable for the Government and the individual citizen and, secondly, that it is worth making the investment now because Britain does not have a high-standard, comprehensive system of identification. We have published the expected costs of issuing ID cards, and the current best estimate of the annual average running costs of issuing ID cards and passports to British citizens is &pound;584 million, from the start of the ID scheme, including the cost of compiling and running the national identity register.</p>

	<p pid="b.1205.4/1">I am pleased that the figure has been made public, but does my hon. Friend accept that some of us still have concerns about the cost? The biggest problem is the cost of the IT infrastructure. We do not want another Rural Payments Agency problem, where the IT was renegotiated as the scheme was being introduced, so it would be helpful if the Government said that, rather than hiding behind commercial confidentiality, they are prepared to share such information with the House so that we can be sure that the IT consultants do not run off and make a bomb out of the proposal. Does my hon. Friend agree?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1205.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="1205"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-27.htm#60213-27_spnew15">
	<p pid="b.1205.5/1">It is precisely because we do not want people running off and making a bomb at the expense of the taxpayer that we are proceeding as we are. As I said earlier, we recognise the tension between running, and getting best value from, a procurement process and the need to be open and accountable by putting as much information as possible in the public domain. Those are two conflicting aims, but in the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras we begin to see a way to resolve <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">them. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> inasmuch as we want to put information into the public domain as early as possible, but without fettering our ability to secure the cost and keep it down when we go to market. A person would not ordinarily say how much they had to spend before trying to obtain the best price from a supplier, and that principle holds good for this exercise.</p>

	<p pid="b.1206.0/1">It may help my hon. Friend to learn that when I questioned IT professionals who are hoping to take part in the tender, they said that the LSE figures were entirely speculative, bearing in mind the degree of knowledge about the project, but they added that the Government's were too. There is no proper basis for estimating such a project without much greater knowledge about its purpose and its specification. Does my hon. Friend agree?</p>

	<p pid="b.1206.1/1">I note my hon. Friend's point about the LSE figures. On the Government's figures&mdash;the main thrust of his question&mdash;he will know that we commissioned an independent assessment from KPMG. It looked in detail at the business case for the scheme and concluded, in an independent summary that we placed in the Library, that it was &quot;robust and appropriate&quot;. We have not opened up the whole report to Members, so some of the details will have to be taken on trust, but I can assure my hon. Friend that that was KPMG's conclusion and I urge him to refer to the document, which suggests that our figures have some validity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1206.2/1">Will my hon. Friend set out how the Government are approaching the commissioning of the enormous contract for a database that must be pushing at the envelope of IT knowledge? The Government's track record in commissioning computer-based technology is disastrous&mdash;as was that of the previous Government&mdash;so how are they approaching it differently to ensure that we do not experience, as we have in the past, vast overruns and increases in expenses in a programme that is not fit for purpose?</p>

	<p pid="b.1206.3/1">My hon. Friend is right to note that the project is a major undertaking and will require significant sums, and I shall set out in detail how much we expect to spend. I have two points in response to her question. If we said that because there had been problems in the past we would never embrace new technology and never make significant investment in a project that could bring improvements, that would be the wrong approach. However, I assure her that we are basing the delivery body for the scheme on that of the UK Passport Service. It had problems a few years ago, but they were not related to the introduction of the IT system, and it has since emerged as one of the highest-performing public sector organisations and is extremely well equipped to deliver the scheme cost-effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.1206.4/1">I am not against identity cards in principle, so I ask this question in kindness, rather than anything else. Does the Minister agree that there has been a pretty long trail of failures by all Governments in implementing IT and that this Government have had a number of such failures, which he perhaps underestimates? Has he conducted an inquiry into those failures? Will he place in the Library the list of lessons that the Government have learned from the failures of the past, so that we can estimate whether they will be able to handle what is, on all accounts, a very large order of magnitude in changed technology?</p>

	<p pid="b.1207.0/1">I hesitate to ask whether the right hon. Gentleman has experience of such matters. Governments of both colours have had negative experience in that regard, but it is precisely because of some of the past procurement problems that the Office of Government Commerce gateway process has been established. As he will know, that involves private sector expertise at every stage of a major project to consider its readiness and whether the associated risks are adequately addressed. The scheme has been through a series of gateway reviews, and I assure him that that directly builds on experience learned from past failures. Some of the people involved in the process have been involved in other major public and private sector procurement. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Obviously, they have clearly learned the lessons and know exactly what they are doing now. The serious point is that the scheme is being closely examined, and we seek to make as much information from the gateway process available as possible. I take on board the right hon. Gentleman's point.</p>

	<p pid="b.1207.2/1">I do share that confidence. Let me develop the point that I made in response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1614" name="Glenda Jackson">my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Glenda Jackson)</phrase>. It is not correct to say glibly that the scheme is directly comparable to the Child Support Agency. They are not analogous, and we are describing a very different function. Before hon. Members run away with the idea that the scheme is intended to encompass everything, let me say that it is a basic identification scheme that will hold biometric details.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.2/2">Let me refer the House to the experience of the United States since 11 September. The US has introduced biometrics into its immigration system pretty much from a standing start, and they are now used for all visas around the world and for people going through US customs control. Such schemes are workable. They are in use today. The British Government are increasingly using biometrics. We have progressively introduced biometrics into visas, and that process is beginning to be implemented around the world. A biometric is being used in applicant registration cards for asylum seekers, and we are seeking to build on such relevant experience.</p>

	<p pid="b.1208.0/1">May I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the need for greater transparency, which might provide reassurance? He referred to the fact that only a summary of the KPMG report has been published. It would certainly be helpful if the whole report were published, and commercial confidentiality would not be affected in doing so. The OGC gateways could readily be disclosed, at least in summary form. It is welcome that the Government have commissioned a concept viability report on the project, and it could also be made available. I have yet to see it, and it would have been useful to have seen it before the debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1208.1/1">I take on board my hon. Friend's general point. I hope that, after this evening's vote, the discussion will change from one about whether or not the scheme should happen to one about how it will happen. I think that that important distinction will quickly take root in people's minds. I embrace my hon. Friend's point of view. It would not be right to proceed with a scheme of such national significance with any sense of a culture of secrecy. We will seek to put as much information as possible into the public domain, but as he will understand from his experience before first coming to the House, that must be balanced by a requirement to secure best value from what will be a major procurement process. We need to keep those two things in mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.1208.1/2">On independent scrutiny, an independent project assurance group is reviewing cost, project management and IT implementation and bringing together a range of experienced stakeholders. The biometric assurance group, chaired by the Government's chief scientist, Sir David King, will review that specific aspect. So there is independent scrutiny, but I take on board my hon. Friend's point that we should seek to make more information available as and when we can.</p>

	<p pid="b.1208.3/1">I certainly will, Mr. Deputy Speaker, and I apologise for any inconvenience.</p>
	<p pid="b.1208.3/2">I want to stress to the House that the &pound;584 million cost of issuing passport and identity cards includes all the existing costs of issuing passports through the United Kingdom Passport Service, together with the developments that will be needed over the next few years to introduce biometric passports, starting with passports incorporating facial images and moving to biometric fingerprints. About 70 per cent. of the cost of issuing identity cards, alongside passports, is attributable to the introduction of biometric passports. Let me put that figure into perspective.</p>
	<p pid="b.1208.3/3">The figure of &pound;584 million includes the baseline figures for the operation of the UK Passport Service, which in 2006&ndash;07 is expected to be some &pound;397 million. That is the organisation's running cost in carrying out its core responsibility of issuing passports to the British public.   Essentially, the difference between those two figures&mdash;about &pound;200 million&mdash;is what we are debating. That is the extra cost that the identity card scheme will place on the public, and it is the set-up costs of establishing the scheme, which were mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud.</p>

	<p pid="b.1209.0/1">The figure of &pound;200 million represents the non-passport element of the scheme, but is the Minister convinced that that will be the total required to tackle insurance fraud, payments fraud, banking and building society fraud and finance and leasing fraud? It seems a rather small sum if it is intended to tackle all &pound;1.7 billion fraud identified by the Government.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.1209.1/1">I am making the point that that figure relates to the budget for issuing biometric passports and identity cards to the public. The perspective that needs to be taken is that ID cards do not account for the whole of that amount. The hon. Gentleman makes my point partly for me: &pound;1.7 billion is the annual cost to the UK of identity fraud, so the benefits case begins to stack up for the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209.1/2">I will summarise the additional costs over and above those of biometric passports that the scheme would place on the Government, as shown in the regulatory impact assessment. First, the costs include covering the whole resident population aged 16-plus, rather than just the 80 per cent. of British citizens who will have passports by 2008. Secondly, they include recording, matching and storing three types of biometric information&mdash;face, fingerprint and iris&mdash;rather than one, which is the current standard required for the first generation of biometric passports. Thirdly, they include providing an online identity verification service that can validate ID cards and other identity inquiries for user organisations in the public and private sectors. That is what we are talking about this evening, and it is important to apply that perspective to the scale of the costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1209.2/1">The current passport application support system is a 10-year private finance initiative and, as my hon. Friend said, that must be part of the &pound;397 million for the Passport Service's running costs. Is the &pound;584 million for both capital and revenue costs? Will it be a similar sort of PFI scheme?</p>

	<p pid="b.1209.3/1">My hon. Friend asks a fair question. The &pound;584 million relates to the cost in its totality of issuing biometric passports and ID cards and, crucially, of enrolling people. That is where the bulk of the costs of the process would be. It would be an annual cost that the expanded Passport Service would need. She is right to suggest that it is possible that payment for some of the set-up costs of the scheme could be delayed into the running costs of the scheme. That would be a way of financing the scheme that would require the private sector to fund the scheme up front, and the costs would be recovered over a longer period. Those would, quite properly, be issues for the procurement process. Obviously, we will seek to secure the best deal for the taxpayer when we make the decision.</p>

	<p pid="b.1209.4/1">Is my hon. Friend saying that if it is not a PFI scheme, which would have an annual running cost, there will be an additional capital cost to begin with that is &quot;revenuised&quot; into the &pound;584 million? What proportion of the &pound;584 million is for the operation of the verification scheme?</p>

	<p pid="b.1210.0/1">I will be honest with my hon. Friend. Some of these issues have not been decided yet. They will be decided when the procurement phase gets going properly. It is true that there are up-front set-up costs at the start of the scheme that fall to the Home Office. As I have explained, we have decided not to make those costs available at the moment because that would prejudice our ability in the middle of the procurement process. However, I can tell my hon. Friend that those costs will be much less than the annual running costs of the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1210.4/1">The answer is that no such decisions have been made at this point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1210.4/2">As I was saying, the costs do not include the costs incurred by other Government Departments as a way of improving their services to the public any more than they include the costs to private sector companies, such as banks or building societies, that decide in the future to use identity cards as a way of verifying people's identity. Indeed, it would be odd if they did.</p>
	<p pid="b.1210.4/3">Decisions on any future investment&mdash;for example, in IT systems that might be required to make the best use of identity cards&mdash;will be made in due course, and not now, by the organisation concerned on the basis of a cost-benefit analysis.</p>

	<p pid="b.1210.6/2">Public services will use the scheme if there is a net benefit to them. The work that we have undertaken so far shows that there would be a net benefit for many public and private sector organisations. There may be many net benefits to a wide range of organisations and the Government have already published a high-level summary of likely future benefits in the &quot;Benefits Overview&quot; paper, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. It suggests, we believe, conservatively that the quantified financial benefits of the identity cards scheme will range from &pound;650 million to &pound;1.1 billion per year once the scheme is rolled out fully. Our business case is therefore sound and, as I explained, it has been reviewed by the Office of Government Commerce gateway reviews.</p>

	<p pid="b.1211.0/1">My hon. Friend mentioned the benefits review. The figure of &pound;1.1 billion is for the expected benefits of the ID scheme and it includes &pound;570 million savings from the prevention and reduction of ID fraud. Since he published those figures, he has revised his estimate of the total amount of ID fraud from &pound;1.3 billion to &pound;1.7 billion. Has he, or his officials, done any work to estimate whether he should therefore revise the figure for the benefits expected from the scheme?</p>

	<p pid="b.1211.1/1">That is a good point. Of course, we keep the benefits case under review and it changes as the scheme develops and as different organisations see how it might benefit them.

In fact, once the scheme is comprehensive, the benefits may be far greater.</p>

The debate has been happening in the House and in another place and, in those circumstances, one might expect that people would not want to intrude on the debate.

	<p pid="b.1212.0/1">As I said a moment ago, it is a decision for those Departments how and when they engage with the creation of the national identity register. It is up to each Department to make its own business case about whether the investment that it would need to make is justified. At the point at which it makes that decision, it is a matter for it as to whether it puts that information into the public domain. I am saying to my hon. Friend that that is not a crucial element on which our costings rest. We believe that we are delivering something of public benefit that people will want to use, but such information is not a crucial plank on which the costings that we have put before the House are based.</p>

	<p pid="b.1212.4/1">I will make progress now, but I hope to give way before I end my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.4/2">The Home Office benefits will, of course, play a significant part in realising the strategic benefits of the overall scheme, including protecting identity for the citizen, helping to reduce crime, protecting our national security, reducing the problems of illegal immigration and illegal working and enabling more efficient and effective delivery of public services. The running costs of the identity cards scheme will be funded from fees charged to passport and ID card applicants or to users of the identity verification service or from within existing departmental budgets. The fact that the bulk of the costs will be covered from fees means that, as I explained to Opposition Members earlier, without these fees, there is simply not a pot of money that could be diverted to other uses&mdash;whether it is more police officers or more immigration officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.4/3">The published unit cost of the joint passport and identity card package is &pound;93 for both documents&mdash;a passport and ID card. The Home Secretary has also announced that it would be affordable to issue a stand-alone identity card for a fee of about &pound;30, or &pound;3 a year over 10 years. The Home Office agency that will be established to issue identity cards and incorporate the existing UK Passport Service will publish corporate business plans, as well as annual accounts. The full business case will be subject to extensive review&mdash;both internal and Treasury review&mdash;and challenge prior to the signing of contracts on identity cards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.4/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">My hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> urged me to comment on the detail of the Lords amendments. We cannot accept that there should be such an unprecedented review of the estimated costs of the identity card scheme, which would cover 10 years and the consequential costs that could fall on other Departments, before the Bill can come into effect. Such a review would not be necessary. It would be unprecedented that a Bill to fulfil a centrepiece manifesto commitment could be implemented only after a report on cost estimates had been completed, which would be the effect of Lords amendment No. 70. The logic behind the amendment is fundamentally flawed. It would appear to have been motivated by a desire to keep costs down, but, in practice, it would limit our ability to do precisely that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.4/5">I am pleased to say that we are persuaded that we should include a commitment in the Bill to publish regularly&mdash;at six-monthly intervals&mdash;reports to be laid before Parliament, as is proposed in the new clause tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. The measure is sensible, balanced and would not put value for money at risk. As I mentioned, subsection (4) of the new clause would allow the Home Secretary to decide to withhold information that might prejudice the procurement process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1213.0/1">Is it not true that the KPMG report examined cost centres that amounted to only 60 per cent. of the operating costs? Did that not leave a big hole in the assessment? If we are to have such six-monthly reports, by what mechanism may we take the decision that the costs are out of control and thus stop the scheme from going ahead?</p>

	<p pid="b.1213.1/1">I make it clear to my hon. Friend that KPMG had access to the scheme's full business case and that its report went into considerable detail about the scheme.

	<p pid="b.1213.3/1">My hon. Friend has examined the information that the Home Office has put out assiduously. KPMG examined the methodology behind the entire business case in considerable detail. She is right that it considered 60 per cent. of the assumptions underlying the scheme, but it gave the figures to show that the identity cards team produced a clean bill of health.</p>
	<p pid="b.1213.3/2">We are giving a commitment today on the six-monthly reports in response to the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras precisely because we want to be as open as possible and to allow people to get up-to-date information about how the scheme is progressing. Indeed, the reports could be a helpful focus for the Home Office when it ensures that the costs are kept under control. If the costs change in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1418" name="Lynne Jones">the way in which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase> suggests, a public debate on those costs will follow. As I said to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" name="Mark Todd">my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase>, she can be confident that we want to put as much information in the public domain as possible, while respecting the wish to get the best possible deal for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1213.3/3">I hope that the House will disagree to Lords amendments Nos. 1, 68, 69 and 70. As I indicated, we will support the much more sensible and workable amendment that has been tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras.</p>

	<p pid="b.1214.0/1">There is a growing air of scepticism in the Chamber, and the longer the Minister spoke, the more the scepticism became apparent. He said that there would not be a special pot of money to prevent Home Office funds for the police and other necessary forms of security from being spent. However, one is of course always reminded of the Prime Minister's remarks in 1995 when he criticised the <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">then Home Secretary, my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase>, by saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.0/2" class="indent">&quot;Instead of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on compulsory ID cards as the Tory Right demands, let that money provide thousands more police officers on the beat in our local communities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.0/3">What goes around turns around.</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.0/4">The longer the Minister spoke, the more it became abundantly clear not only that members of the public do not read party political manifestos, but that Ministers do not read their own manifestos. No sensible person who read the Government's manifesto could have reached any conclusion about the natural and ordinary meaning of the words other than that the scheme would not be anything other than entirely voluntary. The likely costs of the scheme reinforce the Government's wisdom of writing such words into their manifesto.</p>

	<p pid="b.1214.6/1">The Minister is keen for us to be assured that we will be able to trust entirely the figures that his Department will come up with if the amendment tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> is accepted. However, we must see the situation in the context of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General. He had to report to the Home Office and the public at large that the Home Office had fallen down on its 2004&ndash;05 resource accounts. Let me pick out one or two paragraphs of the report so that hon. Members can get an idea of the context of our debate. The report also addresses <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" name="Mark Todd">the concern expressed by the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> about the absence of proper accounting assumptions in several of the Minister's assertions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/2">Paragraph 10 of the report said that the Home Office accounts for last year</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/3" class="indent">&quot;contained numerous errors and internal inconsistencies. In particular, amounts relating to cash, Exchequer funding and non retainable income due to the Consolidated Fund were contradictory and did not reconcile between the different places in which they appeared in the accounts. There were also material omissions and misstatements&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/4">Paragraph 14 said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/5" class="indent">&quot;Difficulties were encountered in the transfer and cleansing of data, and staff were not trained to use the new system on a timely basis. These problems and delays, together with a lack of understanding of the new accounting system, meant that the Home Office could not use data from its new accounting system effectively to produce a cogent set of accounts to the required faster closing and statutory timetables.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/6">Paragraph 15 cited:</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/7" class="indent">&quot;control weaknesses within key Information Technology applications including access to the system, inadequate segregation of duties, the creation of standing data and the ability to interrogate and monitor changes made.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/8" class="indent">It continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/9" class="indent">&quot;These weaknesses made access to the database by unauthorised staff possible, representing a risk to the integrity of Adelphi data and exposing the Home Office to a greater risk of fraud and error.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/10">Let us go back to paragraph 11, which refers to the second draft accounts, which, unlike the first draft accounts&mdash;which were delivered rather late&mdash;were delivered only two days late. It states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/11" class="indent">&quot;The amounts in the revised accounts had changed significantly from the first draft. In particular nearly every major balance was markedly different. To illustrate the scale of the movements: the amount owed to the Exchequer by the Home Office of &pound;68 million in the September draft accounts became an amount owed by the Exchequer to the Home Office of &pound;112 million in the December draft accounts. This swing is due to major changes elsewhere in the accounts resulting in a change to the cash required by the Home Office.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/12">The Comptroller and Auditor General went on to say that because the Home Office was incapable of implementing its new accounting system, it had been</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/13" class="indent">&quot;unable to reconcile its cash at bank position&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/14">Paragraph 16 continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/15" class="indent">&quot;Bank reconciliations are one of the most fundamental of all accounting controls as they enable payments, receipts and cash balances to be validated to an external source and provide assurance about debtor and creditor balances. They are also a key control for the prevention and detection of fraud.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/16">Other references in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report were equally impolite. In paragraphs 21 and 22 he criticised</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/17" class="indent">&quot;Poor controls and weaknesses in the audit trails maintained over the assignment of access rights; Absence of checks made against Human Resources records to ensure that new users are authorised, and leavers are removed promptly; Absence of controls to detect unauthorised access to the database&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/18">and</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/19" class="indent">&quot;Over reliance on the Home Office contractor to undertake security checks, and a lack of effective processes to address the risks this exposes the Department to&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/20">If that is what the Comptroller and Auditor General says about the Home Office's accounts, it is perhaps not in the least bit surprising that other Departments have not found it convenient to hand over to the Home Office their assessments of the costs, workings, assumptions and accounting practices of their work in preparing for the great day on which the ID cards system is introduced and the national identity register comes on stream. In autumn, just before Christmas, I took the trouble to table written parliamentary questions to all the spending Departments, including the Home Office, to ask what work they had done to prepare for the national identity register and what cost estimates they had made. Even the Treasury said that it had done nothing to prepare for the great event. I suspect that it had done nothing because it did not want to become embroiled in an unquantified, unquantifiable and hugely expensive financial disaster, which the project seems likely to become.</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/21">The least that we can expect from the Government is openness and transparency, but so far no credible reason has been advanced in this House or in the other place&mdash;I have not heard one this evening either&mdash;for preventing the House of Commons from having a right of scrutiny in respect of the huge sums of public money that the Government intend to spend on the ID cards system and the national identity register scheme. Whether we spend &pound;5.84 billion over 10 years, as the Government suggest, or the &pound;19 billion to &pound;24 billion that the London School of Economics report suggests, makes no difference to the principle. The House must know what it is giving the Government permission to spend.</p>
	<p pid="b.1214.6/22">There has been no willingness to be candid about the start-up costs, the capital costs, the transaction costs, the volumes or a host of other necessary details. I am driven to the conclusion that the Minister is not quite clear on what those concepts are. That puzzles and worries me.</p>

	<p pid="b.1216.2/1">May I reiterate the point that there were false expectations of the KPMG report? To be frank, there is no way in which there can be any certainty at this stage about the cost of the project. KPMG produced a fancy consultants' report&mdash;I used to commission such things&mdash;that says, &quot;On the one hand, this; on the other hand, that; and here's the outcome&quot;, but we cannot be anything but completely uncertain about the costs of the project.

	<p pid="b.1217.0/1">It merely confirms that a Government who do not know what they are doing ask a distinguished firm of accountants to produce a report that answers no useful questions and we are no further on. No doubt the public were required to spend several hundreds of thousands of pounds on fees to obtain that rather unhelpful answer. In any event, the end picture is not a happy one for the Government, and it is certainly not a happy one for the taxpayers of this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.0/2">May I put to the Minister a point with which he did not seem to want to get to grips? The letter that he wrote on 7 February was sent only to his own colleagues and is written on House of Commons writing paper. It is interesting that it could not go out on Home Office paper&mdash;first, because I do not imagine that the Home Office civil servants would have put their name to such a letter or allowed it to go out from their Department; and secondly, because it contains a statement that is, to put it at its lowest, highly disputable and that illustrates the Government's conduct of this debate. The Minister says in the letter to his hon. Friends:</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.0/3" class="indent">&quot;The LSE also allocated an inflated &pound;1 billion marketing budget and assumed a much higher loss/theft rate than is the case for existing documents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.0/4">The Minister either knows, or has failed to pick up the fact, that on at least three occasions the authors of the LSE report have made it clear to the Government that they made no such assumption and that they included no such figure in their report. If we were outside Parliament and if, for example, we were considering the concept of express malice in a defamation action, that letter would be evidence of it.

	<p pid="b.1217.3/1">I am very grateful to the hon. and learned Gentleman for accepting my intervention. To be clear about this, he will know that page 3 of the LSE report states that its costs were based on a Kable spreadsheet, which allocates &pound;1 billion to marketing. If it wishes to correct that and say that it is not the case, I would be happy to accept that. I made that point at a meeting with LSE representatives present. On that basis, and on a number of other points, they said that they would be prepared to revise their figures downwards. That is the basis on which we make our point, and I hope that he now has clarification of that.</p>

	<p pid="b.1217.4/1">Let me help the Minister. The claim that he reiterates for the fourth or fifth time was first made in the Home Office response to the LSE alternative blueprint issued in July 2005, which stated that the LSE</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.4/2" class="indent">&quot;had estimated marketing costs of between &pound;500 million and &pound;1 billion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.4/3">In the LSE reply, issued on 5 August 2005, it noted:</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.4/4" class="indent">&quot;The LSE report did not set out an estimate for marketing costs or indeed for any line item of that nature.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.4/5">The LSE's status report issued in January 2006 states that it had made no such estimates and even suggested in a footnote a possible explanation for the confusion. The Minister repeats the error again and again.</p>

	<p pid="b.1218.0/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman's colleagues have repeated in the media and in the House the original assumptions on which the report was based by giving the figure of &pound;300 and saying that the scheme could cost up to &pound;19 billion. Those were the original estimates that were used to justify the headlines. It is entirely appropriate for us to point out where we believe those costs to be inflated.</p>

	<p pid="b.1218.2/1">The Minister said that the LSE revised its costs downwards because of the durability of the card, but that is not the case. It has maintained its arguments on durability, and it had a range of durability estimates. Where it has revised its costs down is in relation to the interviewing process. It originally assumed that everyone would be interviewed to get verification of their biographical details. The Government explained that that was not going to be the case. As a result, the LSE revised those costs, which are a small element of the scheme, downwards.</p>

	<p pid="b.1218.3/1">If I have not reset the Minister's mind, I sincerely hope that the hon. Lady has done so, but I am not at all confident that either of us will have succeeded.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/2">I support Lords amendment No. 70 and want to address amendment (a) in lieu, which the Government intend to support, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras. The hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase> made the eminently sensible point, which came straight out of Lords amendment No. 70, that it requires a detailed estimate not just of the revenue and capital costs, but of the expected benefits. He is right to say that a clause without proposed subsection (2)(b) would not be much shorter than one with it. However, it seems that the policy behind Lords amendment No. 70 is much more rigorous and candid, and it would produce a much more sensible and open understanding of the Government's financial estimates and expectations, than the amendment drafted by the right hon. Gentleman. There is nothing in Lords amendment No. 70 of which the Government should have any fear. Indeed, they have half sold the pass, in one sense, by agreeing to support the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/3">The Government say that the annual running costs are broadly &pound;584 million. Multiply that by 10 and we get the &pound;5.84 billion that people have talked about. For one year, starting in late 2008, the figure would be &pound;584 million. The LSE report, which came out last June, put the figures over a 10 year period in a range of &pound;10.6 billion to &pound;19.2 billion. If the Home Office's annual figure of &pound;584 million is representative of costs over 10 years, we get a total of &pound;5.8 billion. The Government say that the fee will be &pound;93 for a passport and &pound;30 for an identity card, and they imply that the fees are driven from the &pound;584 million cost estimate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/4">So far so good, but if the LSE report is right, the fee for a passport could be between &pound;170 and more than &pound;300, and the cost of an ID card could rise to more than &pound;100. As I understand it, the Government have refused&mdash;they may have changed their mind today&mdash;to cap fees. The implication is that if costs rise, so too will fees. There is plenty of research to show that the acceptability of the ID scheme declines as its costs increase. The opinion polls started off by showing that people were greatly enthusiastic about the scheme, but that support steadily declined as the public came to realise that not only is it not going to assist in the several ways that the Government say it will, but that it will be increasingly expensive.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/5">The Home Office has produced some analysis in an attempted rebuttal of the LSE's figures, but the lines of attack have been about a few specific assumptions. There has not been an open and detailed debate between the LSE and the Home Office. That is a pity, to say the least. I understand that last summer the LSE found some areas on which it had overestimated costs, but also some areas in which it had underestimated costs. In the latest report, which it issued in the middle of January this year, it stands by its original estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/6">Subject to the problem that the Home Office has in marshalling accounts of any sort, it cannot be beyond it to produce a report that contains a detailed estimate of the revenue and capital costs arising from the Bill, and it cannot be beyond it to produce a statement in the format of resource accounts, a statement of cash expenditure, and a statement setting out the material assumptions that were made in preparing the cost estimate. Nor can it be beyond the Home Office to provide the necessary subsidiary detail of the cost estimate, as set out in proposed subsection (4)(a), which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/7" class="indent">&quot;the actual costs incurred in the period from 26th April 2004&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/8">which is when the original Bill was published,</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/9" class="indent">&quot;to the date to which the cost estimate is prepared&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/10">and in paragraph (b), which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/11" class="indent">&quot;the costs that are estimated to be incurred during a period of 10 years after the date to which the estimate is prepared&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/12">or such longer period as the Secretary of State may determine.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/13">All of those are things that accountants have to do all the time. They are all projects which, as the hon. Member for South Derbyshire said, are commissioned by business men and women in far smaller operations than the Home Office and, probably, in far bigger operations. It is not an unusual accounting exercise, and it is extraordinary that the Government are reluctant to undertake it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/14">The Government say that there is a better idea in amendment (a), which the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras has tabled in lieu of the Lords amendments. I shall not cite the entire amendment save subsection (4), which is where the cogency of his argument falls to pieces:</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/15" class="indent">&quot;If it appears to the Secretary of State that it would be prejudicial to securing the best value from the use of public money to publish any matter by including it in his next report under this section, he may exclude that matter from that report.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/16">The amendment leads us down a path of wonderful expectation&mdash;at last, a new Labour Government are going to be candid about their extraordinary project on identity cards and the national identity register&mdash;only to hand over to the Secretary of State the subjective ability to pull the report if he does not find it convenient. I urge the House not to be mollycoddled into thinking that the preceding provisions will ever be delivered if subsection (4) remains part of the right hon. Gentleman's amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1218.3/17">Even if the subject is dull and uninteresting, this is an important area of debate. The supply of Government money from public funds&mdash;from our constituents' pockets&mdash;should be controlled by the House, and the Government should make clear to the House what they intend to do with our constituents' money. They have never provided us with sensible estimates of the capital or revenue costs, still less the benefits, as the hon. Member for Walthamstow implied. Now that the Government are on the retreat on compulsion under clauses 6 and 7, it is time that they went a little further and condescended to do justice not only to the House but to the wider public by providing them with access to their thinking and their methodology on those huge costs. Whether they are &pound;5.8 billion or &pound;20 billion over 10 years, the principle remains the same. We are entitled to know&mdash;we have a duty to know&mdash;and the Government have an obligation to disgorge that information.</p>

	<p pid="b.1220.0/1">I wish to speak to amendment (a), which I tabled in lieu of Lords amendments Nos. 1, 68, 69 and 70.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/2">My amendment would impose a requirement on the Government to report every six months to the House on the latest estimated cost of the ID scheme, if it goes ahead. I do not support the Lords amendments because they deal exclusively with the initial estimate. History suggests that it is not the initial estimates that are the problem but the actual costs. Although the Government support my amendment, I believe that the ID scheme will not provide value for money. It will not bring an end to terrorism, and if a great deal of credit fraud affects the credit card and debit card industry it is not the taxpayer's job to help those commercial organisations. We ought to behave as the Victorians did with cheques. There was a simple law on cheques&mdash;if someone did not sign the cheque and the bank paid out, the loss was the bank's, not the account holder. If we took that robust attitude on debit and credit cards we would be a lot better off. You can bet your boots that those commercial organisations, which want us to bail them out when they suffer from fraud, would quickly find a way of stopping the problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.1220.2/1">I should like to try to make progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.2/2">The Government estimate that the scheme will cost &pound;6 billion. If someone came up to a Member in the Chamber and said that they would give them &pound;6 billion to make the country safer only to be told that ID cards would be introduced, that Member would be taken to the funny farm before they had time to draw breath. I am therefore not very keen on the proposition, to say the least.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.2/3">As I have said, it is not the initial estimate or its nature or make-up that bothers me. IT systems companies such as EDS and Siemens appear to be competing for the title of intergalactic rip-off IT merchant of the decade, and have ripped off the public and private sectors time and   again through their negligence, incompetence and stupidity, usually resulting in massive costs increases for users and huge delays. Our first job as the House of Commons, save to protect the security of the nation, is to control the raising and spending of taxpayers' money It is not overstating the case to say that a considerable number of people are doubtful about the Ministers' original estimates of the cost of the ID scheme. Nobody should suggest that that springs from deliberate deception, but all IT schemes seem to have had substantial cost overruns&mdash;with the exception, I might say, of NHS Direct, which did not involve any outside consultants, was done entirely in house, and worked.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.2/4">I am prepared to accept at face value Ministers' original estimate of about &pound;6 billion. The problem is that if we go on as we usually do, several years hence we will happen to learn from an article leaked to a newspaper or some technical IT journal that the costs have gone into the stratosphere. My amendment will require the Government to report to the House regularly every six months, so that if huge increases are taking place, it will not be too late for us to say stop.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.2/5">The original &pound;6 billion estimate may turn out to be correct, in which case my hon. Friend the Minister and the Home Secretary will have brought about a modern miracle. As I understand it, having demonstrated a miracle, they would qualify for canonisation as saints during their own lifetime. I think that that is unlikely and that we can expect sudden huge escalations in costs, but if we pass my amendment, we will know and be able to take action to stop it before it is too late.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.2/6">People may argue that contracts may have been let. Contracts should provide for termination if they go over certain limits and, ideally, require those who have taken the contract costs over the limit to repay the money that they have already squandered. That is going a little far these days, with the delicate organisations with which the Government deal, but it should be done nevertheless.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.2/7">I do not accept <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the comments of the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> about subsection (4) of my amendment, which provides for the Government to withhold not a report, but any matter in the report if it would prejudice their relations with any of the outside contractors. It would be foolish for us to require of the Government to identify that they are putting X hundred thousand, million or billion pounds in the budget for a particular contract at the point when they are seeking bids from outside organisations. That would be to the disadvantage of taxpayers, and the point of my amendment is to put taxpayers at an advantage and stop them being ripped off, as they have been so regularly and scandalously in the past.</p>

	<p pid="b.1222.0/1">Is not the problem that over the past year or so, and during debates in this place and the other place, the Government have refused to be open and candid, as the right hon. Gentleman thinks that they will be, on the basis of commercial confidentiality? That is ingrained in their DNA. We need to be persuaded that they have changed their mind. They say that they will support his amendment, but their whole way of life in the conduct of the Bill has been to shut up and refuse to give information because they say that that would spoil everybody's confidential commercial arrangements.</p>

	<p pid="b.1222.1/1">The wording is:</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/2" class="indent">&quot;If . . . it would be prejudicial to securing the best value from the use of public money&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/3">The Government therefore could not claim that they were securing the best value from the use of public money after some contract had been let. That covers the hon. and learned Gentleman's point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/4">All that I am doing is giving the House an opportunity for us to do our job. I can commend my amendment both to those who are for identity cards and to those who are against identity cards. For those who are present who are in favour of identity cards, voting for my amendment is a vote of confidence in the accuracy of the Government's estimates and the likelihood that they will prove to be true. There cannot be anyone who is in favour of identity cards who does not believe that the true costs should not be known, and that will also have the effect of bringing pressure to bear on the IT firms to make low bids, because otherwise they will go over the top of the &pound;6 billion figure, and it will maintain a constant pressure both on civil servants and on the contractors to keep the costs low. Those arguments are intended to appeal to those who are in favour of identity cards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/5">If, like me, Members are not in favour of identity cards, instead of a vote of confidence, it is a vote of scepticism. It enables us to put the chocks under the wheel of the ID card wagon if it starts running down&mdash;or running up&mdash;the hill of cost escalation. I am in what might be described as a unique situation in that I can advocate my amendment to those who are in favour and those who are against for them to pursue their totally opposing reasons and attitudes to ID cards by voting for one single amendment, and that is why I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1222.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, whose speech I enjoyed. He has persuaded me that there is more merit to his amendment than I had first seen in it. Had he attached to the report some sort of sanction, as exists in the Lords amendments, I would certainly have been much better disposed to his amendment. I particularly enjoyed his description of the IT companies as intergalactic swindlers, or something to that effect. The thought did just slip through my mind as to what epithets he would apply to the Ministers and civil servants who wrote the cheques and completed the contracts with these IT companies in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.2/2">It will not be lost on the House that the Minister spoke for 40 minutes. For the first 36 minutes of his speech, he did not make any reference at all to either the Lords amendment or the amendment moved by the right hon. Gentleman.</p>

Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> struck the right balance and did not fetter us in seeking best value from the market, and that the Lords amendment was unprecedented in dealing, as Mr. Speaker said, in matters of privilege.

	<p pid="b.1223.1/1">That must have been a good 30 seconds out of the first 36 minutes. It was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1902" name="Neil Gerrard">his own hon. Friend, the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Mr. Gerrard)</phrase>, who made the point at almost 8 o'clock that he had not yet addressed the issue. We will be able to check the record tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223.1/2">In any event, the complexity of the debate rather masks the simplicity of the issues at stake here. The point to be made here is not greatly dissimilar to that which we made in relation to compulsion, namely that if identity cards were as good as was claimed, why was compulsion necessary? If the Government's plans are as well costed and as affordable as they would have us believe, they should have nothing to fear from Lords amendment No. 70.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223.1/3">Whether one takes the LSE report or the KPMG report, or whatever basis one wishes to proceed on, the basic truth of the matter is that no one really knows what the cost of identity cards will be. That is possibly why the Government prefer the amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras to Lords amendment No. 70.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223.1/4">We all know that the acceptability of ID cards to the general public declines as cost increases. The Minister has said that he would not pay &pound;300 for an ID card&mdash;that may yet prove to be a hostage to fortune&mdash;which is not a point of principle, but an entirely pragmatic point relating to cost. Although he will undoubtedly have moved on to greater and higher things in government, I wonder what his position will be when and if the cost hits &pound;300.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223.1/5">The Minister has also told us that the model for financing ID cards follows that of the UK Passport Service, so it is clear that the cost will impact directly on the individual rather than its coming from the Government. Earlier, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> used the expression &quot;plastic poll tax&quot;, which is exceptionally apposite.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223.1/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1973" name="Stewart Hosie">The hon. Member for Dundee, East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> has referred to the Government estimate that the cost of identity fraud and identity theft is in the region of &pound;1.7 billion. However, that figure includes fraud associated with credit and debit cards, the bulk of which takes place online. The introduction of an identity card will make no difference to the incidence of such fraud, because biometrics are useless in relation to online transactions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223.1/7">The Minister has mentioned the UK Passport Service, but the parallel is not valid, because it does not rely on the database or the register. Furthermore, the UK Passport Service does not require the installation of a reader in every public service office, which will include every benefits office, hospital and GP surgery in England and Wales&mdash;the Scottish Executive have more sense than to install such machines. Those costs, which will be significant, make quantification even more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223.1/8">The Minister has said that Lords amendment No. 70 is unprecedented and novel, and he is absolutely right. He has also said that it is outrageous that the Government should have to explain the cost of the measure before they implement it, because this is a manifesto Bill. If that is outrageous, the cost should have been in the manifesto to allow people to form a judgment at the polls&mdash;in that regard, we have seen the worst of Labour party manifestos in the past few weeks. The protection of the taxpayer, which is entirely unprecedented, is appropriate, because the whole Bill is entirely unprecedented. The Bill seeks to rewrite the relationship between the citizen and the state as we have always understood it in this country. If the Government want to take that course, the least they can do is tell us the cost of that step before they take it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1223.1/9">Lords amendment No. 70 is clear. Subsection (2) specifies that the report should contain a detailed estimate of the revenue and capital costs and that a statement of expected benefits should be produced. Subsection (3) covers the extent of the cost estimates.</p>

Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase> skewered the Under-Secretary with her interventions about the KPMG report. She has struck at the heart of the problem with the Government's approach. They constantly overstate and oversell the benefits and underestimate the disadvantages. There is little in the Government's history on the matter that makes me believe that I or my constituents should be prepared to trust them. I therefore hope that we shall not disagree with Lords amendment No. 70.</p>

	<p pid="b.1226.1/1">I welcome the Government's agreement with amendment (a). However, my problem is that large amounts of public money will be spent before we reach the inevitable point at which we have to call a halt to the terrible monster. I am more sceptical than <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> about the Government's figures. Their precision is incredible&mdash;&pound;584 million, not &pound;583 million or &pound;585 million. At least the London School of Economics gave a range of estimates. The Under-Secretary did not make it clear in reply to my interventions whether the figure included set-up costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/2">However, we have information about current expenditure from the United Kingdom Passport Service website. I also obtained information through parliamentary questions and from letters from the Under-Secretary. We therefore know that the cost of running the old-style passports was &pound;219 million in 2004&ndash;05 and that the charge to people who wanted a passport was &pound;35.60. This year, we commence the introduction of biometric passports, which will include only the facial biometric&mdash;a digital image. Yet it will cost the Government &pound;397 million a year and people who purchase the passports will have to pay at least &pound;57.93, which, according to the Government, is the cost of producing the passports.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/3">In getting from old-style passports to the first phase of the biometric passport, which includes only one image, the running costs will increase by &pound;178 million a year. Those figures are probably reliable. However, the jump from the new passport with one digital biometric to the all-singing, all-dancing biometric passport/ID card system database is supposed to entail an increase of a mere &pound;187 million. I cannot believe those figures. I cannot believe that it costs &pound;178 million a year to get from A to B yet it will cost only &pound;187 million a year to get from B to C. That does not include the &pound;93 that will have to be paid. Apparently, 70 per cent. of it is attributable to the passport, working out at approximately &pound;65 for the passport element. I cannot believe that a passport that contains two fingerprint biometrics as well as the facial biometric will be so cheap, given that the Government have already said that the cost will exceed &pound;57.93. Furthermore, the &pound;93 that people will pay for the privilege or otherwise of having their details on the national identity register and being forced to have an identity card will not cover the cost of operating and maintaining the verification services. We have had no breakdown of how much of the &pound;584 million that would account for; it is an additional cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/4">I am cynical about Government computer systems. I recently served on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, which conducted a brief inquiry into the Rural Payments Agency's computer records system. The initial cost of that system was going to be &pound;37.4 million a year, to cover capital and revenue costs. That figure has now risen to &pound;54.3 million&mdash;an increase of 50 per cent. If a database of only 100,000 records is costing &pound;50-odd million a year to run, it does not seem sensible that we are going to have to pay only an extra &pound;187 million a year to run a massive database of 100 million records, which will be interrogated and will have an audit trail&mdash;never mind the cost of the security.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/5">What really frightens me about this scheme is that it will make me feel less secure, rather than more secure. The biometrics will have radio frequency identity chips on them, and people will have a field day intercepting them. So what security are we going to put on to the cards? In America, the biometric passports&mdash;which also have just the facial biometric&mdash;have radio frequency identity chips so that they can be read without contact. There was a furore there when people realised that anyone could intercept that identity information, and an agreement to allow the scheme to go ahead was reached only because a shield was provided in the cover of each passport to stop the signals being intercepted other than when the cover was opened for the passport to be verified at border controls or for Government purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/6">The figures simply do not stack up. They do not compare in any way with the costs of other computer systems, and the proposed system is far more complex than any other that we have seen anywhere in the world. Earlier, the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee quoted from his Committee's report. I should also like to do so. Paragraph 64 on page 23 states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The proposed system is unprecedentedly large and complex. It will contain sensitive personal information on tens of millions of individuals. Any failure will significantly affect the functioning of public and private services and personal and national security. Measures to ensure the integrity of the design, implementation and operation of the system must be built in to every aspect of its development . . . We will make recommendations for addressing this serious weakness later in the report.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/8">The Committee went on to do so. It had been</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/9" class="indent">&quot;concerned about the closed nature of the procurement process&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/10">and stated that it was essential the process be open. It went on:</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Any potential gains from competing providers providing innovative design solutions are likely to be more than offset by the unanticipated problems that will arise from designs that have not been subject to technical and peer scrutiny.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.1227.1/1">It is probably easier for the Government to estimate the cost of providing buildings than it is for them to estimate the cost of providing complex computer systems. I have to accept their assurances that that is included, although I note that there will also have to be two secure facilities for the storing of the computer systems. I am not sure that the time scale that the Government say they have in mind will allow them to procure those facilities. I envisage many problems. It is clear that the Government have not recognised the need for an open procurement policy, as advocated by the Select Committee. The Committee said that the Government must</p>

	<p pid="b.1228.0/1">Has the hon. Lady, in the course of her diligent analysis, considered the extremely difficult problem of assessing the extent to which the wide-ranging powers in the Bill will be used or not used? There is a great deal of uncertainty about the extent to which certain powers will be used, and indeed about whether the whole process will be extended to involve designated documents. As I said in an earlier intervention, the process seems to be endless. Has the hon. Lady seen any calculation that reveals the impact of the powers if they are used? When an aircraft or a ship is being built, it is possible to see that it will end up as a product. Here, we are talking merely about a vague use of powers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1228.1/1">I am prepared to accept the Government's assurances that the driving licence will not be a designated document, but it is clear that the identity card and the operation of the database will go ahead. The Government are determined to use those powers, at least for the time being, until the costs emerge. They might think twice about it after that. We do not know the extent to which other Departments, or even devolved Assemblies and Parliaments, will use the database to deliver services. The costs are not included in the Government's &pound;584 million assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228.1/2">The UK Computing Research Committee has commented on the document on the assessment of technologies needed for a national ID card scheme. It says that the assessment is not objective, because the authors have an interest in supplying the ID technologies. Most independent experts are dubious about the Government's scope and ability to deliver. They include the London School of Economics&mdash;whose work the Government have rubbished without justification, as we learned from the letter from Brian Gladwyn to the Prime Minister&mdash;and the UK Computing Research Committee, as well as other organisations dealing with computing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228.1/3">I do not think we should spend vast amounts of public money on a scheme that is highly dubious, and whose benefits, let alone costs, have not been assessed. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Department of Health on the cost of people gaining access to health services when they were not entitled to do so. The Department had no idea of the cost. We do not yet know whether it will go along with the scheme, but the Minister has said that it would benefit the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228.1/4">I am prepared to bet that the &pound;584 million will prove to be only a fraction of the eventual cost if the Government insist on the scheme. The proposed six-monthly estimates are welcome. However, the Government will perhaps end up spending billions of pounds before realising the error of this approach. Instead, they should opt for the solution that all other European countries are opting for: documents that have biometrics on the card, and appropriate security precautions that are an improvement&mdash;as they will have to be&mdash;on those currently available. The Government should drop their obsession with this ridiculous national identity register, which will be costly, has severe implications for civil liberties and will prove a honey pot for international criminals and terrorists. Rather than protecting our identities, such a register will lead to everybody facing the threat of identity theft.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228.1/5">When I spoke on Second Reading, I expressed concern about the security of biometrics and the ability of individuals to apply for more than one document. That fear remains and the Government have had to react to such criticisms by greatly increasing the number of biometrics to be stored. Originally, they planned to have only iris recognition and facial recognition; now, they have been forced down the route of including 10 fingerprints. Even if the system proves 99 per cent. accurate, there will still be 48,000 false matches in a database of 48 million people. It will not be the ordinary citizen who will apply for multiple ID cards using the same biometrics. However, the system will not be able to know that the same biometrics have been duplicated, but with different identities. Terrorists, money launderers and international criminals will be willing to hack into the system, and they will be patient.</p>
	<p pid="b.1228.1/6">The police computer system is regularly abused from the inside by police officers giving information to journalists; other systems have been hacked into. Staff working in computer centres could be bribed or blackmailed into handing over sensitive data. What will happen, for example, if somebody changes the address on my database record and puts in a request for an audit trail? Such information will then be delivered securely to the alternative address. The implications are horrendous. Chips on the card will allow people to be followed wherever they go, unless the security that nations such as America are building into&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.1229.1/1">As I understand it from answers given to me previously by the Minister, the cards will contain radio frequency identity chips that will send out a signal, which will be picked up by antennae. If they are to be stand-alone cards, the chips will need to be read by a reader at close proximity. However, many experts have expressed doubts about this scheme, in that, if the chips are to be read remotely, the signals could be picked up as people travel from one antenna to another. Obviously, the power of such antennae will be a factor in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229.1/2">The private sector will have readers and access to the verification service, so there will have to be some form of encryption. However, the fact remains that those in the private sector will have access to my identity and will be able to steal it. If the readers are stolen, other people&mdash;depending on the accuracy of those readers&mdash;will be able to steal my identity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229.1/3">If the Government are concerned about identity fraud, they should not go down this route. There are much simpler and less costly ways to address identity fraud. In the US, for example, when somebody wishes to access consumer reference information, they have to obtain the permission of the individual. In that way, the individual will know if someone is applying for credit or carrying out financial transactions in their name. The Government could introduce such measures and ensure better security than will be achieved by this expensive scheme. The Government claim that it will make us more secure and deal with terrorism and immigration, but immigrants will not have to have identity cards. The Government should reconsider and move towards having biometrics on passports, as other countries are doing. They should abandon the database and the costs that will be associated with it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1230.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="1230"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-34.htm#60213-34_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.1230.0/1">It is important that we get this right for two reasons that the Minister gave earlier&mdash;first, because we now have a scheme that will be compulsory and, secondly, because, as the Minister has said, the bulk of the costs will be covered by fees. If costs go up, fees will go up. The cost of the scheme will be borne by our constituents. It is therefore important that we have as much information as possible about what the scheme will mean to the people whom we represent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230.0/2">I do not believe that amendment (a), tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, would do what it is claimed it would do. I suspect that the very reason that the Minister is prepared to accept it is because he knows that it is the dog that will not bark. It will not even growl or whimper. The Minister is bound to like the amendment because it will not provide any ability to stop the scheme in its tracks. We will not have the information that would allow us to make a considered decision until it is too late. The right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said that it was better than the Lords amendment because it allowed us to look at the ongoing costs, but we know that the Minister will be able to hold back information on that under subsection (4). It states that information may be held back if it is</p>
	<p pid="b.1230.0/3" class="indent">&quot;prejudicial to securing the best value from the use of public money&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230.0/4">That is the very basis on which the Minister has held back the full capital cost of the scheme. We are told that it would breach commercial confidentiality and stop us getting the best value. So in his six-monthly reports, the Home Secretary will be able to hold back the very information that would enable us to make an assessment of the costs. Amendment (a) would not do what is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230.0/5">We have heard a lot of hocus-pocus economics this evening. It must be down to my experience in local government, but I always get worried when a report goes into minute detail. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1418" name="Lynne Jones">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase> said, the Minister can pinpoint the cost as &pound;584 million a year. But when we start asking the big questions, everything becomes vague and we are told that for reasons of commercial confidentiality the capital costs cannot be revealed. In my experience of local government, that usually means that no one is quite sure how much the scheme will cost at the end of the day. When I encounter that approach, I begin to be wary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230.0/6">The Minister, again in answer to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak, said that the capital could either be paid in a lump sum or annualised and added on as running costs. He gave an assurance that it would not be more than the annual running costs according to the present estimate, but if the amount was equal to the running costs the annual cost would double. Will that be added to the fees that the public pay for the card? The Minister gave no indication.</p>

	<p pid="b.1231.0/1">I did not say that the set-up costs would be absorbed in the &pound;584 million; they are additional. The baseline for the UK Passport Service is included in the &pound;584 million. I said that the increment&mdash;the additional amount in respect of ID cards&mdash;was in the region of &pound;200 million a year. That is the increment for the annual running costs; the set-up costs will be much less than &pound;584 million a year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1231.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="1231"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-35.htm#60213-35_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.1231.1/1">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak asked how the costs of the scheme would be paid. One of the options was that it would be on an annual leasing basis, but would that be included as part of the cost of the card? If so, the cost of the card would increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.1/2">The right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras said that, due to the six-monthly reports, the amendment would put chocks under the wheels&mdash;the scheme could be stopped&mdash;but there are no sanctions in the amendment, so I do not know how that would happen. Reference has been made to many public sector schemes this evening, and we are all familiar with the Child Support Agency on which &pound;400 million was spent, yet three years on, we are still considering what to do about it. Once the capital investment in the technology was made, it was felt that we had to try to make it work. I suspect that will be the case with the ID card scheme. Once the capital investment has been made, and the scheme is up and running and a large number of people have bought the cards, the argument, regardless of the costs, will be, &quot;Well, we can't drop it now. People have paid for the cards and we've bought the technology, so we've got to make it work&quot;. If that means extra costs, that is what will happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.1/3">The amendment will not put the chocks under the wheels. All it will do is enable us to observe, on a six-monthly basis, the increase in the costs of the scheme. I do not know whether it will cost &pound;24 billion or &pound;5.8 billion, but from my experience of local government, the Policing Board or central Government, the one thing I know is that IT schemes of that nature never run out at the original cost. The amendment will enable us to watch the costs increasing, but we shall be unable to stop the bandwagon rolling. For that reason, I shall not support it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1231.2/1">I shall try to focus on the amendments. I have quite a lot of sympathy for the Lords amendment, although in many respects it is not perfect, so I shall not endorse it. Nor shall I endorse the amendment tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, for reasons that I shall give in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.2/2">The Lords amendment is rather too narrowly written. I tabled a new clause on Report that attempted to set out the kind of things that I would expect the Government to produce before they authorised substantial expenditure on such a project. Unfortunately, that new clause was not selected, but it focused first on the fact that the Secretary of State ought to set out properly the reasons for such a proposal. We have seen a number of documents so far that, frankly, make limited reading indeed in explaining why the proposal is a good idea, why it will produce the sort of benefits that have been vaguely referred to and why we should endorse it. I do not share some colleagues' views that the Bill is a terrible threat to civil liberties. I have never thought that. My instinct is that it might be a terrible threat to our public purse. That has been the focus of my concern throughout.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.2/3">Secondly, I would expect the costs and benefits to be set out in reasonable terms. This is not the time at which one could certainly demonstrate the cost with any authority. As I have remarked in my interventions, frankly, the LSE proposals are based on its own concept of how an ID card system might work. They may be valuable in those terms, but they have no authority since they bear no relationship to what the Government may be attempting to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.2/4">The Government have set out their ideas in such vague terms that, frankly, it would be impossible for a professional contractor to produce anything other than fairly speculative estimates of how much those ideas might cost. That is why I have remarked on the KPMG report. I do not know how much was spent on it, but to be honest, it will do what most consultants will wisely do: it will cover their bases very carefully and certainly not end up by giving a great deal of authority to a figure that most professionals would say could only be speculative at this time. I suspect that, if the full report were made available, one would probably see those caveats written in rather larger type than in the summary. I would expect the costs and benefits to be produced, but when procurement was about to proceed. That was the point of the new clause that I tabled on Report.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.2/5">Thirdly, I would want the assumptions behind any savings to be properly set out. I intervened on my hon. Friend the Minister about the buy-in of other stakeholders in the project. I referred particularly to the private sector, but I could equally have touched on the role of other Departments. Even given the rather vague business case that has been produced to date, the private sector obviously has an important role to play. It is understood that the project may be crucial in reducing fraud in our financial system. If so, one might expect that many of our financial institutions would be putting up their hands now, saying &quot;We wholeheartedly endorse this project, and we wish to see it proceed as fast as possible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.2/6">I drew my hon. Friend the Minister's attention to the fact that those statements of faith have, as yet, not been made. When I questioned officials and IT professionals, they gave a rather sunny and optimistic reason for that and suggested that people were waiting for the Bill to be passed and would then dive in very quickly. They genuinely do not know whether they are buying a pig in a poke, exactly what the project involves and what meaning it may have for their businesses. For that reason, they are most unlikely to put a buy-in together. I would expect the stakeholders&mdash;whether private sector partners or those in other aspects of government, such as the agencies and Departments, which must clearly play a part&mdash;to make a much more coherent statement of the benefits when procurement is about to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.2/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1418" name="Lynne Jones">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Lynne Jones)</phrase> referred to the Department of Health, and that is a very good example. We would expect it to participate in the scheme, but I doubt whether it has even the vaguest idea of how the scheme might apply to what it does.Much of the information will be required at some stage in the future. I do not expect the documents that the Government have produced so far to refer to it in detail, but I would expect there to be a point at which we have an opportunity to review the details before further substantial sums of public money are committed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.2/8">I also want a much more rigorous examination of the risks in the project&mdash;one or two of them have been touched on in the debate&mdash;and how they are likely to be mitigated. Risk mitigation means cost. Dealing with perceived events and working out their likelihood of threatening a project of this kind require steps to improve its security. Such steps may deal only with a one-in-a-million circumstance but, in a project as central as this, a one-in-a-million circumstance may well be what we have to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.2/9">I often remark that our tolerance of error rates for people flying airlines or performing complex surgery is much lower than it would be for someone performing a less critical function. We expect people carrying out high-risk functions to take steps to reduce the risks either through the intervention of technology or additional human support. Those certainly cost money. I am not clear how the risks have been analysed and how costs have been applied to reducing those risks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.2/10">I have described the points that I would like to have seen covered but, unfortunately, the Lords amendment is rather more narrowly drawn. If they choose to consider what happens tonight, they may want to reflect on that should they return the issue to us.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.2/11">I have already referred to the importance of transparency for all our benefit in the project. A number of reports have been pulled together by agencies outside and inside government to assist us in judging whether it is the right thing to do. We have had the KPMG report. Although I would not want to read it in considerable detail, its full publication would have been helpful to us at this time. The Office of Government Commerce gateway process that the project will go through on a number of occasions at various points in its life also provides a useful indication of risk. One of its major focuses is to say what risks have been anticipated in the running of the project and how we might deal with them. From the little glimpse that some civil servants kindly gave me the last time the process was carried out, it is not surprising that it is regarded as extremely high risk with a number of flashing amber lights indicating that steps need to be taken to deal with possible failure in the future. That would not surprise anyone, but it would be useful to have the risks more clearly defined so that we can understand them and can start to put money towards dealing with them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.2/12">I also wish to refer to the concept viability report that the industry has been asked to produce. I believe that it has actually been produced and the Minister told me earlier that it would be published at the procurement point. I would rather see it now, so that I can understand the industry's reaction. Those in the industry that I have spoken to have broadly said that most of them would love to take part in such a project because it looks like serious stacks of money are involved.</p>

	<p pid="b.1234.1/1">Whatever the figure is. The right hon. Gentleman has not been present for this debate, but he will know that I have cast doubt on all the estimates that have been made. That is one of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.1/2">People in the industry are keen, but I think that they share my concern at the rather muddled presentation and the possibility that it will lead to a complex and poor quality specification that will not necessarily get the buy-in of all the critical players. That is at the root of failed IT projects. I shall not go down the route taken by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras, who chose to cast a great deal of blame on IT companies. Of course, they fail and do things wrong. However, the critical thing that normally goes wrong in such projects happens right at the start. It is necessary to get the specification of what is being done absolutely straight before driving the project through with narrow-minded rigour. A critical test is thus the quality of project management, which would indicate whether costs could be managed effectively. However, although I have met one or two of the people involved in the project, I have seen no evidence to date of the rigorous project management disciplines that would be required to deliver a project that was a tenth as difficult as the identity card scheme will be.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.1/3">For the reasons that I have outlined, I take no great comfort from the debate. I have given all these pieces of advice in private, so it is a little sad to find that little progress appears to have been made. I am surprised that the Government have chosen to support the amendment tabled by my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras because while I accept the caveats that have been cited about the possibility of evading various responsibilities due to the amendment, the provision will give rise to a process of terrible Chinese water torture because some poor Minister will have to produce a report every six months. The Minister might well say, &quot;I can't reveal them this and can't tell them that,&quot; but the reports will prompt ongoing repetitive debate on the merits and purpose of the scheme. I am not worried about that, but I am puzzled by the Government's insistence on taking that route to reassure people about the project, rather than the route that I would have commended, which would be a more rigorous attempt to nail things down right at the start. That remains my preferred strategy, so I still hope that the Government will adopt it. I am sad that I will not be able to give the Government my support on these matters tonight.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1234.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1973" speakername="Stewart Hosie" colnum="1234"  time="021:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-36.htm#60213-36_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.1234.2/1">I want to take the Minister back to his opening remarks when he mentioned fraud worth &pound;1.7 billion. Such fraud is central to the debate because it determines whether the Bill is a proportionate response to the problem. I have no doubt that the figure of &pound;1.7 billion was put in the public domain to give the impression that when the ID card system was fully deployed in the public and private sectors, a problem of such magnitude could be resolved, but I question that assertion. I also wish to focus on the fraud because it is the only argument in favour of the identity card scheme that the Government have consistently used from the outset&mdash;they abandoned all their other justifications at various points along the way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.2/2">There are many components to the &pound;1.7 billion figure. Although I will not bore the House by going through them all, I shall outline several because it is genuinely important that I make this case. The Association of British Insurers says that the estimate of financial loss due to identity fraud is &pound;22 million. If the biometric system and ID cards are to tackle such fraud in the insurance system, every insurance policy will have to be linked to a biometric card and its holder. Every time an assessor checks water or fire damage against a policy, the holder's biometric card will have to be verified so that there is a link between the person, the card and the policy. That is the only way in which the scheme could help to tackle fraud in the insurance system, but the process would be expensive, and no doubt the full cost of it would be passed on from the insurers to the citizen.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.2/3">The Association for Payment Clearing Services says that &pound;504.8 million is lost due to plastic cards being used by criminals who are not their rightful owners. It has been said several times that the cost of fraud due to payments made when a card is not present is &pound;150 million. If a person buys a plane or cinema ticket with a plastic card, both that card and the ID card could be presented at the aircraft or cinema for checking to prove that the person had made the purchase. However, if people buy goods by mail order that are simply delivered by a man with a white van, the scheme will provide no assistance whatsoever because goods can be delivered when people are not at home and the man is not going to have a biometric scanner in the cab of his van. That part of the &pound;1.7 billion figure cannot be dealt with by the biometric register or the identity card.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.2/4">According to the Building Societies Association, &pound;3.1 million is lost to identity fraud, but the same applies to building societies as it does to insurers. Every building society account would have to be linked to a person with a biometric profile and every time a transaction on that account took place, fraudulent or otherwise, the person involved would have to verify their card against the central database and the central database against their account. That is the only way in which the proposed system could prevent fraud in the building societies sector, but it would be disproportionate and highly expensive, and the full costs would be passed on to the citizen and the customer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.2/5">CIFAS, the UK's fraud prevention service, says that the cost of identity fraud to the retail sector is &pound;2.3 million. Much of that involves stolen cards being used in corner shops or supermarkets. It is inconceivable that there would be a biometric scanner at every till in Sainsbury's or Tesco's or&mdash;even worse&mdash;at the till in every corner shop. It is unlikely that the biometric register and the ID card could tackle that type of retail without placing a massive cost burden on the consumer and the citizen.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.2/6">The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and the Driving Standards Agency say that the cost of preventing identity fraud&mdash;not of fraud itself&mdash;in their sectors would &pound;2.5 million and &pound;1.2 million.</p>

	<p pid="b.1236.1/1">Well, perhaps the Minister can intervene and tell me by how much that cost of prevention will be reduced and what savings the consumer and the citizen will gain if the new system is introduced. I have paused, but the Minister is staying shtum&mdash;that is okay.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.1/2">The list goes on. The Finance and Leasing Association estimates that</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.1/3" class="indent">&quot;identity fraud arising from the provision of motor finance&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.1/4">costs &pound;14 million. Does the Minister seriously expect an identity card system to stop that sort of fraud? Does he expect every second-hand car dealer that pulls out a set of financial agreements to be signed in a portakabin somewhere to use a biometric scanner before allocating them to the person who has come in to purchase a car? That would be the only way in which the ID system and the biometric register could solve that problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.1/5">It is highly unlikely that anything approaching &pound;1.7 billion will be saved. Earlier, the Minister suggested a lower annual saving. He suggested a range, but even the low end of his forecast would be achieved only if all the measures that I have described were implemented. Such savings could not be achieved within the set-up costs and the ongoing running costs of the system covering passports and ID cards alone that the Secretary of State spoke about earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.1/6">It is certain that the real cost to the citizen will be far higher than the costs that the Government have already specified&mdash;the running costs and the set-up costs, which are still unclear. Those costs will be higher than has been suggested, because if identity cards and the central biometric database are to solve problems of fraud, scanners linked to the database will be required in every shop, supermarket and filling station, and in every bank, building society and insurance broker. The police will need portable scanners in their police cars, and insurance assessors likewise. The costs of all that would be fully passed on to the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.1/7">It is incumbent on the Government to tell us not their set-up costs and the Home Office running costs, but the real and full costs of the measure, including a best-guess estimate of the costs to the private sector. It is incumbent on Ministers to tell us whether businesses will be expected to bear the costs or whether they can pass them on wholly to the citizen, or by how much the Government will have to increase taxes to pay for the scheme if they believe that ending some of these fraudulent measures would be worth while and cost effective. Either way, with a project of such a scale and complexity, we cannot be expected to buy a pig in a poke.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.1/8">I want to support a robust announcement of the costs&mdash;the detailed development and running costs, including those in the private sector&mdash;but that is not an option in either amendment. However, Lords amendment No. 70 is more robust, not least because amendment (a) in lieu has the 10-year rule, which would allow large hikes in capital expenditure or early revenue to be averaged out and hidden over the 10 years for which the figures are reported. If we vote on that&mdash;it is not yet clear that we will&mdash;the Scottish National party will back the Lords amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.1/9">I hope that the Minister and others on the Labour Benches will take cognisance of the feeling on the subject. We need genuine detailed information up front. We need no obfuscation. We need to be clear of the set-up costs, not just for the Home Office, but for the whole scheme, and of the running costs not just for the Home Office, but for every Department. In the private sector, we need best guesstimates so that we understand exactly what the cost to the citizen and consumer will be if the identity fraud played up by the Government is genuinely to be tackled.</p>

It was on the cost of ID cards per person. The answer from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State was that the cost of a stand-alone ID card would be &pound;30 for 10 years&mdash;&pound;3 per person per year.

The Home Office has estimated the benefits. Estimates are bound to be rough, but no one has seriously challenged its figures. In fact, they have hardly been mentioned.

	<p pid="b.1237.3/1">As someone who certainly read the setting out of the Government's position&mdash;such as it was&mdash;there is no evidence from any private sector source on the supposed savings and benefits that may be achieved. A figure is named, but no one sets out any evidence on how it was calculated, based on real experience.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1237.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" speakername="Martin Linton" colnum="1237"  time="021:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-37.htm#60213-37_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.1237.4/1">I am happy to provide my hon. Friend with the answer. Although the figures are published by the Home Office, they are taken from APACS, CIFAS, banks and all the financial institutions that have provided estimates to the Home Office, and it has reprinted them. Hon. Members may cast doubt on those, but the figures have been arrived at by the people who will make use of the ID system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237.4/2">The combined effect of all the estimates, including those from Departments, is a benefit of up to &pound;1.1 billion. I am sure that hon. Members can work out that the figure of &pound;1.1 billion divided among about 38 million ID card holders is a benefit of &pound;29 a person. So there is a cost of &pound;3 and a benefit of &pound;29. <i>[Laughter.]</i> Hon. Members may laugh because so many figures of billions of pounds have been poured over the House. The simple truth is, however, that the best estimates show that that is the value of the ID card.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237.4/3">There are those whose main concern is civil liberties and the police, although they will have no additional powers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1238.0/1">The Bill does not give the police any extra powers. However, does my hon. Friend agree that although the police will not be allowed to stop someone and request an ID card on spec, the Bill does not stipulate that they cannot stop someone and ask for biometrics on spec? I hope that he can he confirm that they cannot do so under the Bill, as it would result in an electronic form of the sus laws which, we all know, disproportionately affect black and minority ethnic people?</p>

	<p pid="b.1238.1/1">That is my understanding of the Bill, and I would not support it if I thought that it was a device to give the police powers to stop people in the street and ask them for their ID cards. From the very beginning of this debate four or five years ago, it was made clear in the Government White Paper and the consultation document that the Government did not want to consult on&mdash;indeed, they did not even countenance&mdash;the introduction of an ID card that people must carry at all times. Some European countries require the carrying of ID cards, but that option was excluded from the start. I do not believe that the police should be able to stop people and ask them for details of biometrics or anything else for which they cannot already ask.</p>

	<p pid="b.1238.2/1">My hon. Friend said that some people were concerned about civil liberties. There are anxieties that the amount of information on the register that is limited under schedule 1 to name, date of birth, place of birth, gender and address will creep up and increase. Can he confirm that before additional information is included in the register primary legislation must be introduced?</p>

	<p pid="b.1238.3/1">That is my understanding. Only six items of personal information will be included on the register&mdash;name, address, date of birth, place of birth, sex, nationality and, for people from overseas, information about their work permit. The legislation does not allow any further information to be added to the register. I believe one or two items should be added to ID cards, including organ donor information and medical information which, in an emergency, could make the difference between life and death. However, even that information, which could save someone's life in hospital, cannot legally be added to the register.</p>

	<p pid="b.1238.4/1">May I clarify something in response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1447" name="Dawn Butler">the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Ms Butler)</phrase>? I can confirm that the Bill does not extend police powers, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> rightly said. It would only provide power of identification in the case of arrest, but obviously the police already have such a power. The Bill does not create the situation feared by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South, but it would ease police bureaucracy in the case of ascertaining identity.</p>

	<p pid="b.1239.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239.0/2">The total quantified financial benefits are estimated by the Home Office&mdash;anyone is welcome to challenge the figures, but it is significant that in six hours of debate few Members have chosen to do so&mdash;to be &pound;1.1 billion. That figure, as I said, was agreed with the banks and the organisations that will use the scheme. More than half the expected savings are expected to come from savings on ID fraud alone, and they will amount to &pound;570 million. The more efficient running of public services will account for &pound;385 million&mdash;&pound;85 million from the reduction in crime and only &pound;39 million from the reduction in immigration offences.</p>

	<p pid="b.1239.1/1">The database will be an active database containing the audit trail and a record of every time the verification service is used. Does that not cause my hon. Friend concern? With reference to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1447" name="Dawn Butler">the question from our hon.

	<p pid="b.1239.2/1">As I understand it, the organisations that seek verification from the register will be able to do so only with the consent of the individual, and they will get verification only of the details that they give. Only the police and the security services, when investigating a crime, will be able to get the audit trail. I am happy to be corrected by my hon. Friend the Minister if that is wrong. The audit trail is available for the investigation of crime.</p>

	<p pid="b.1239.4/1">I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will intervene if I am wrong. At the very least, the subsection that the hon. Gentleman quotes is an indication that the schedule could not be changed without the approval of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239.4/2">All hon. Members must know someone who has had their card stolen and their identity stolen, perhaps by someone going through rubbish and picking out their credit card numbers. That is one of the fastest growing crimes. Quite apart from the effect on the individual whose identity is stolen, the average time taken to sort out the financial problems caused by identity theft is 60 hours, and in some cases goes up to 240 hours. Individuals who are victims of identity crime may be compensated by the banks, which are held responsible, but the banks must recover their costs from us in bank charges. The average person in the UK pays at least &pound;25 or &pound;30 a year through bank charges to cover the cost of ID fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.1239.4/3">Wednesday sees the introduction of chip and pin to make savings on fraud, but the savings to be made from reducing ID fraud through the ID card are far greater. If those who make the cost argument were to succeed, they would have to argue that the cost of the card is nearly 10 times higher than the Home Office says. All the indications are that the costs of ID fraud are rising. The benefits of curbing it are likely to be higher. The Minister announced from the Home Office this week that the cost to the country of ID fraud has increased from &pound;1.3 billion to &pound;1.7 billion.</p>

	<p pid="b.1240.0/1">In the time assigned to me, I shall make two points. I am delighted to say that having been a critic on the basis of the costs of the exercise, I find myself in agreement with my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. We will look carefully at the figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.0/2">My second point is about a matter on which I feel strongly. I am sure that my hon. Friends the Ministers will listen, as I have lobbied them in the past. It is a great shame that we have not reached the Liberal Democrat amendment on accessibility. There is an issue that is not financial in terms of costs and benefits, but concerns how individuals can be persuaded to take up biometric passports, and ID cards in due course, and that relates to the need for people to be able to get easily to places where they can give their biometric details. I would argue strongly that only one body meets that requirement, and that is the Post Office. I have lobbied Ministers on this and I make no apology for finishing this particular set of debates on that&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.1254.2/1">This is not the first time that I have debated local government finance in Poole; it probably will not be the last, since we have a perennial problem with the shortage of funding from central Government. It does not seem to matter what system is invented by the people in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, we always seem to come out very much at the bottom end of the table. So whether it is the standard spending assessment, the formula spending share or the new system, Poole does not seem to be doing very well out of the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254.2/2">This year, the total Government grant increase is the minimum, which is 2 per cent. The unitary authority average, against which I shall compare during this short debate, is 2.8 per cent. Our total formula grant will be &pound;22.8 million, which provides funding of a little under &pound;167 per head. The unitary average is &pound;330. That difference is worth nearly &pound;22.3 million&mdash;a substantial sum that could make a significant difference to the quality of services delivered to my constituents in Poole.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254.2/3">I will not go into too much technical detail&mdash;not least because the new funding system, with its four blocks, is a little more difficult break into and break down when trying to find out the reasons why the grant is at a certain level&mdash;but the finance officers in Poole certainly feel very disappointed with the new system, which they think is complex and rather less transparent than the older system. The Minister might acknowledge the fact that the Local Government Association and others have criticised the new system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254.2/4">None of the 150 education or social services authorities is receiving what the formula grant needs and resources calculation determines: 70 of them are at the floor and gaining more&mdash;including Poole, which is getting an extra &pound;323 per head&mdash;and 80 are having their grant reduced or dampened to ensure that they all receive a minimum grant increase. That fact indicates that the formula system does not work, and there are real concerns about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254.2/5">What special issues do we have in Poole? Wages are certainly low. The average weekly wage for full-time workers resident in Poole was &pound;448.50&mdash;86.4 per cent. of the average for England&mdash;but that contrasts with house prices, which are particularly high. The average selling price of all houses sold in Poole in 2004 was just over 10 times the average annual full-time income. That big gap has a great impact on the local authority's finances and recruitment. The population is ageing. Compared with the rest of the country, a smaller proportion of Poole's population is found in all five age bands under 50 and a greater proportion in all age bands over 50, across both sexes. Currently, about 54,500 people in Poole are aged 50-plus, which represents 40 per cent. of the population. Although, when one looks at the Sunday papers, one occasionally sees fabulous houses for sale at extortionate prices, that is not typical of Poole. It might be typical of one or two areas but, along with the areas of wealth, there are areas of great deprivation, including some wards that show up as being very deprived.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254.2/6">We have a pretty good local authority. Under the    revised comprehensive performance assessment methodology this year, the council has been assessed as a three-star authority. Last year, it was rated as &quot;good&quot;, which is the second highest rating. Under the new methodology, the &quot;direction of travel judgment&quot; concludes that the council has</p>
	<p pid="b.1254.2/7" class="indent">&quot;improved well over the last 12 months. It has made some significant improvements to services important to local people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.1254.2/8">The council offers good value for money, with costs generally below average.</p>

	<p pid="b.1255.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the continuing poor settlement year after year along with exactly the same cost pressures, such as the increasing wages that are a big component of local government expenditure, inevitably means that there have to be cuts in sectors in which costs are rising steeply? For example, there are cuts across the board, including cuts in social and respite care in social services. Does he share my concern that our constituents will lose out big time if this continues year after year?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1255.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1764" speakername="Robert Syms" colnum="1255"  time="022:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-41.htm#60213-41_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.1255.1/1">I agree with the hon. Lady with whom I share representation of the borough of Poole. Both the Conservative and Liberal groups have a common front in trying to get a better grant for Poole. Both parties feel that we are not being very well treated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/2">The council is looking to make significant efficiencies in next year's budget, and it is expecting to make them beyond the Gershon review. I am fortunate to be able to say that, although the council's final decision will be made on 16 February, it is looking as though there will be a 3.5 per cent. increase. Such an increase takes a lot of hard work and one way that the council was able to introduce an increase of that level despite bad funding from central Government is by keeping high vacancy levels and controlling staffing to increase its balances. It keeps control in that way. It is very much aware that our profile of an elderly population means that many people on fixed incomes find it difficult to meet a substantial part of their budget, so it is doing all that it can to minimise the tax burden on local people.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/3">Poole people get significantly less Government funding and there are the whole range of costs that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> mentioned. We expect annual pay settlements to go up by 3 per cent. and there are additional recruitment and retention pressures. The changes to advance corporation tax have had a big impact on local authority pensions, and Poole local authority workers are mainly part of the Dorset pension scheme that has suffered and requires more money. Waste management, street cleansing, licensing, highway maintenance and the EU hazardous waste directive present further costs, and the council is also looking at paying, with an increase this year, about &pound;1.2 million in landfill tax that eventually goes back to the Treasury. They are very real costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/4">Let us contrast and compare where we are. Fortunately, Poole is not at the bottom of the list of all-purpose authorities. That place is taken by Wokingham, which is preceded by Windsor and Maidenhead, Rutland and then Poole. Poole's formula grant per head is &pound;166.53. Of course, there are no doubt different circumstances in the all-purpose unitary authorities, but let us consider a few boroughs that may have a similar profile to Poole. For example, I know that my colleagues in Bournemouth next door do not think that they are very well funded, but it receives &pound;293.61, which is &pound;127 more than Poole. Some of the streets in Poole stop where those in Bournemouth start, and there are probably slightly more people on benefit in Bournemouth because there are more hostels there. However, the difference is substantial when it is sometimes difficult to tell whether one is in Poole or in Bournemouth.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.1/5">I guess that Torbay's profile&mdash;it is a seaside and retirement area&mdash;is not dissimilar to that of Poole. The formula grant per head in Torbay is &pound;328.01, which is &pound;161 more than Poole. I suspect that Brighton and Hove faces many issues similar to those faced in the Bournemouth and Poole area, but it gets &pound;385.29. We are very much adrift from many comparable authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1256.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. I know how hard he works on behalf of his constituents, and he is raising an important issue. Has he not just highlighted the fact that one of the big problems with local government finance is that the system is simply not transparent? No one really understands how the Government work out the formula funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.1256.1/1">Order. I must urge hon. Members not to widen the debate, which is quite clearly on local government funding for Poole. If Adjournment debates get extended due to general interventions, the Minister replying to the hon. Member who has secured the debate sometimes ends up with insufficient time to do so.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1256.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1764" speakername="Robert Syms" colnum="1256"  time="022:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-42.htm#60213-42_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.1256.2/1">Of course the problem that my hon. Friend highlights applies to Poole. When local authority officers in the borough of Poole examine how the grant is calculated, it is difficult for them to work out why we do so badly. If we had a better idea of how the grant was calculated, perhaps we could more effectively make representations to try to put the situation right.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256.2/2">Let me touch on this year's dedicated schools grant. The Minister's constituency goes across two London boroughs: Tower Hamlets and Newham. The dedicated schools grant for Tower Hamlets is &pound;5,610 a pupil and Newham receives &pound;4,526 a pupil. Poole receives a dedicated schools grants of &pound;3,349 a pupil. A secondary school with 1,600 pupils in Tower Hamlets would thus receive &pound;8.976 million, while such a school in Poole would receive &pound;5.3 million. I know that there are specific problems in Tower Hamlets, such as linguistic problems, and I do not wish to do down the Minister's constituency, but the gap is large and I hope that the Government will start to do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256.2/3">The precept of Poole borough council is not the only worry. Dorset fire and rescue service has concerns, especially about the way in which the new pension arrangements have been worked out. Although it welcomes the new pension arrangements, it thinks that there is a shortfall of &pound;950,000. I have received a long letter from Dorset police. It is the second lowest funded authority in the country and has one of the highest precepts. It has real problems and estimates that a &pound;1 million pension shortfall will have to be met by council tax payers. There is pressure from all directions on my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256.2/4">We in Poole have done our best over the years to make our case. Delegations have been to see Ministers, and Baroness Andrews cordially received me, the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole, Dr. Brian Leverett, who is the leader of the council, and Mr. Mike Brooke, who is leader of the Liberal Democrats on the council, when we went to lobby her. We invited her to come to look at Poole so that she could see that we needed more grant. I hope that the Minister or one of his colleagues will come to Poole to see our problems and not only the wealthy parts, but some of the deprived areas, because we do not think that they are being addressed by the grant that we are receiving.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256.2/5">There is a sense of grievance in Poole. What we get puts us very much at the bottom of the league, although that does not mean that all our outputs are bad, as can be seen from our provision for schools and the way in which the council conducts its business. The council has been a good authority for several years and has attracted good officers. However, a council has to work much harder when its funding is low. When Poole's situation is compared with that of Bournemouth and other south-coast authorities with similar problems, one sees that we are badly treated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1256.2/6">I know that the grant is fixed for this year and that nothing can be done about it following last week's votes. However, I hope that the Minister will reflect on what I have said. Poole will come back next year to make further representations to try to improve our support. Poole deserves more support for not only the people who work hard for Poole council, but the services that the council provides.</p>

Gentleman has a respected reputation for effectively and assiduously representing his constituents. Let me give the hon. Member for Poole the only aspect of my response that might offer him some respite from the rest of my speech: my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government has accepted an invitation from Poole to meet the authority next month. That will offer local MPs and local authority members an opportunity to make direct representations, in addition to those made between the initial announcement of the local government finance settlement and the most recent announcement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1257.1/1">I thank the Minister for that. The Minister of State will get his ear bent, but the visit will be worth it none the less.</p>

	<p pid="b.1257.2/1">Before this debate, having seen that the hon. Gentleman had secured it, my hon. Friend the Minister of State advised me that I ought to offer the information about his visit in the spirit of solidarity. We are confident in the decisions that we have made, but we want to engage with local authorities to ensure that we explain our decisions and reconcile them with strong local feelings. I am sure that my hon. Friend looks forward to the opportunity to engage with local representatives next month.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/2">The debate provides a useful opportunity to discuss this year's local government finance settlement and to look at the consequences for Poole, but let me start by commenting on our decisions on the funding of local government revenue expenditure for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, which were made following consultation. I appreciate that many of the points raised in the debate by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> were made and reinforced by the delegation from Poole that met Baroness Andrews on 11 January. Let me assure hon. Members that the points raised were taken into account in reaching our final decisions on the settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/3">Total revenue grants to English local authorities will be &pound;62.1 billion in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;65.1 billion in 2007&ndash;08. That represents increases over the next two years of 4.5 per cent. and 5 per cent. respectively. Of those totals, &pound;24.8 billion and &pound;25.6 billion will be grant that is distributed as formula grant, which provides above-inflation increases of 3 per cent. and 3.7 per cent. respectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/4">To get a fuller picture of the Government grant available to Poole, we should include in the comparison the dedicated schools grant, since funding for schools was included in the formula grant in 2005&ndash;06. Including schools funding, Poole will receive grant increases of 5.8 per cent. in 2006&ndash;07 and 4.3 per cent. in 2007&ndash;08. In total we will provide specific grants amounting to &pound;37.3 billion and &pound;39.4 billion over the next two years. That is a key element of the overall picture, particularly as those specific grant totals include funding for schools&mdash;the Government's No.1 priority. We have also been able to provide a two-year settlement for the supporting people grant programme, with &pound;1.685 billion allocated for 2006&ndash;07, and we have so far announced allocations of 95 per cent. of the grant for 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/5">For the first time, in 2006&ndash;07 we have announced two-year grant allocations for every local authority in England. We have put a premium on stability and predictability of funding. That builds upon the work we have been doing over the past few years in freezing grant formulae and allocating specific grants in advance. We have now announced two-year individual allocations of formula grant for every authority; and more than 90 per cent. of all specific grants that can be allocated in advance have been allocated for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/6">The first full three-year settlement will be introduced alongside the next spending review round, with which all hon. Members are familiar. In the interests of further stability, we have made grant floors a permanent part of the grant distribution system. Floors guarantee a minimum year-on-year grant increase and curb the volatility of grant levels for individual local authorities. Poole has benefited from the grant floor in both 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, which has ensured that it will receive a reasonable increase in grant in each of these years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/7">The hon. Gentleman was concerned about the calculation of the formula grant. This year, we have reformed the grant calculation system. The new system has the advantage of removing the old assumptions about spending and tax from the calculation of grant. As a result, it devolves more accountability to local authorities. Many authorities have said that they find the new system difficult to understand. I readily concede that it is still complex. However, in the past we have found that local authorities were concerned that simplifying the grant calculation would, in their view, reduce the fairness and the responsiveness of the system. Our policy therefore is to make the system simpler.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/8">For the present, the new system is simpler in principle. Grant distribution is now determined by four things: a relative needs formula, an amount relative to the resources that can be raised locally based on the property profile, a central allocation per head and grant damping. The relative needs and resource elements should be broadly familiar to the hon. Gentleman, since the system has long contained formulaic estimates of relative need and relative ability to raise council tax.</p>

	<p pid="b.1259.2/1">Order. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">The hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> should refer to the Minister in the third person. I repeat my ruling about the purpose of this Adjournment debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1259.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="1259"  time="022:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-43.htm#60213-43_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.1259.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am grateful for your protection. If the hon. Gentleman wants to drop me a line on that specific question, I am sure that we will be able to provide a detailed answer. As the hon. Member for Poole said, sometimes the point is not simply to make representations in respect of this particular year; it is to lay foundations for arguments for subsequent years. This is an ongoing dialogue with local authorities. The Minister for Local Government's visit to Poole next month will be part of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259.3/2">The central allocation makes explicit what was always implicit in the system&mdash;that after taking account of differences in relative needs and resources, some of the grant is allocated on a per capita basis. We regard stability as a key issue in local government funding. I have already made it clear that the grant floor is a long-term part of the funding system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259.3/3">The hon. Gentleman raised issues about the funding formula. To work out each council's share of formula grant, we need first to calculate the relative needs formulae, which include information on the population, social structure and other characteristics of each authority. Each of the main services provided by councils has its own relative needs formula. There are seven formulae in all for children's services, adult social services, police, fire, highways maintenance, environmental, protective and cultural services, and capital finance. The formulae assess the relative need for a particular service in each area based on the characteristics of the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259.3/4">The hon. Member for Poole suggested that the funding formulae do not recognise the significant pockets of deprivation within Poole. However, most of the funding formulae take account of the relative levels of deprivation in each area. For example, in calculating Poole's relative need for children's social care, we take account of the proportion of local children in income support households and the proportion of working age adults who claim income support. To calculate the relative needs formula for environmental, protective and cultural services, we take account of rates of incapacity benefit, income support and other unemployment related benefits in each area. It is wrong to say that the funding formulae ignore deprivation factors in Poole or elsewhere. In fact, our formulae take detailed account of the relative levels of deprivation in each local authority area.</p>
	<p pid="b.1259.3/5">The hon. Gentleman suggested that the higher than average number of ageing people in Poole places a greater strain on social services. However, that is taken into account in the older people's social services funding formula, which is based on the number of pensioners in each area, their levels of deprivation and the proportion of very old people living in each area. The Government are committed to ensuring that local authorities can deliver effective local services without needing to impose excessive increases in council tax.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1260.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="1260"  time="022:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-43.htm#60213-43_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.1260.0/1">I, too, am grateful for the proposed visit by the Minister for Local Government. Is there any work on the methodology of the area cost adjustment to take account of the special characteristic in Poole and Dorset of high house prices and low average salaries?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2006-02-13b.1260.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="1260"  time="022:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060213/debtext/60213-43.htm#60213-43_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.1260.1/1">I can assure the hon. Lady, notwithstanding representations that she has made with local colleagues, as well as representations by the local authority, that there is an ongoing assessment of the area cost adjustment and all the factors involved. In reaching the local government financial settlement for each area, the Department bases its calculations on all the evidence presented by its own sources and, indeed, by local authority sources. As I said in response to the hon. Member for Poole, a dialogue is under way. There is continual assessment and reassessment, and any evidence or information that is presented is taken into account and assessed. Conclusions are reached by civil servants, and final submissions are made to Ministers, who make announcements to the House. We are open to representations and so on. Some people may think that certain factors are not taken into account, but I can assure the hon. Lady that all representations are considered very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.1260.1/2">We have worked closely with the Local Government Association to look at the pressures that councils will face in the next two years, and the ways in which central and local government can manage those pressures. We accept that there are pressures on councils, especially waste management and social services, which is why we have provided an extra &pound;305 million in 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;508 million in 2007&ndash;08 in formula grant above what was previously planned. We are satisfied that the settlement following the spending review 2004, coupled with the significant extra investment that we have made in recent years, is sufficient to fund all the cost pressures that local authorities face in delivering services over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1260.1/3">We have agreed to work jointly with local government in a number of areas. We will work with the Local Government Association to take account of pressures, and we will focus on pay, adult social care and waste in the context of the 2007 comprehensive spending review. We will introduce a strengthened new burdens procedure, and we have reaffirmed our commitment to discuss new burdens with local government as well as the measures to mitigate them. I understand the concerns of people in Poole, particularly of pensioners on fixed incomes and others on low incomes who are worried that the settlement may impose another large increase in council tax for the next two years. There is no need for them to be anxious but, given the average 3.4 per cent. increase in formula grant until 2007&ndash;08 that Poole has received since 1997, residents are right to express dismay at the persistently high council tax increases imposed on them and the proposed increase for the forthcoming year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1260.1/4">Given the Government's significant extra investment in public services and the scope for efficiency improvements, it is unacceptable for local authorities to set large increases in council tax. The average council tax increases in both 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, as we have said, should be less than 5 per cent. We have made it clear that we are prepared to use our powers to cap any excessive council tax increases, and we have done so in the past two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1260.1/5">In conclusion, I can assure the hon. Member for Poole, his colleagues and his constituents that I understand fully the points he has raised today. We have provided a good settlement overall, and, given the significant investment in local services, we believe local authorities can and should deliver council tax rises below 5 per cent. in 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08. I will alert my hon. Friend the Minister of State to matters raised in this debate before his visit to Poole next month.</p>
	<p pid="b.1260.1/6" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.1260.1/7" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at thirteen minutes past Eleven o'clock.</p>
