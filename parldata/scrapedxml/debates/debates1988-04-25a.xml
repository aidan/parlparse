<p>The Minister will know that the Welsh Office had agreed that the three units would be located at Cefn Coed hospital, Swansea, Bridgend and Cardiff. Why will the 750,000 people residing in south Wales presumably now be denied the response that the unit can go ahead in 1990? Is it not time that such a Cinderella service was not accepted by the Government, and that the unit was set up urgently at Cefn Coed?</p>

<p>It is a shame that the hon. Gentleman does not accept that the programme was long overdue and that the Government should take credit for putting it in action at all. The fact that there is disagreement over the positioning at Cefn Coed was mentioned at the time of the original announcement.

We have had our report from West Glamorgan health authority and we expect the reports from the other two health authorities very shortly.</p>

<p>I welcome the increase in the number of factories that have been coming into Gwent, for example. over recent months, and I see that the Secretary of State has been eager to give some publicity to that event. Will he take account of the fact that the increase in applications is partly because many of the industrialists think that the terms that they are being offered now are better than those that they will get later? Will the Secretary of State give an absolute guarantee that if after an interval of, say, three months&#x2014;I am sure that that will be long enough&#x2014;he finds that the figure is not being sustained, he will revert to the present system?</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State realise that the Margam project is being dangled before the people of Wales as if it were a puppet on a string? Is this not in line with the right hon.

<p>The survival of the Welsh language is a continuing miracle. It is a great treasure that we all hold in trust. It is also the most dangerously divisive and explosive issue in Wales. The window of opportunity for legislation is now wide open. This year, for the first time this century, the National Eisteddfod is coming to the most Anglicised part of Wales&#x2014;Newport. This would have been inconceivable 21 years ago, which was the last time that the House legislated on the language. We must now seize the opportunity which is provided by the evidence of goodwill towards the language from all parties and areas of Wales. Will the Minister assure us that the Government will not delay until they are pressured into action, as they were on the fourth channel? They should build now on the burgeoning, but perhaps fragile, goodwill towards the language by acting swiftly to secure the health and survival of yr hen iqith.</p>

<p>When the Secretary of State meets the chairmen of the health athorities, will he raise with them the problems of the delays in cervical smear testing and the reporting of the results?

A Government motion relating to the report on short speeches is at present on the Order Paper, and I hope that this can be decided upon by the House in the near future.</p>

<p>With regard to the hon. Gentleman's second point, as I said on Thursday, I hope to be able later this week to table a motion setting up the new Procedure Committee. The hon. Gentleman asked about the outstanding reports of the Procedure Committee. I am having discussions with hon. Members in all parts of the House about the best way forward. The Procedure Committee concluded, and I agree, that it would not be practicable or right to recommend radical changes that would be opposed by a large body of opinion in the House. Therefore, I am trying to get as much support as possible for change. I hope to arrange a debate in the near future.</p>

That goes for all Governments. Before rushing into the timetabling of Bills, will the right hon. Gentleman consider that some of us believe that the Opposition have to oppose Bills when they think that those Bills are wrong? If that means that sometimes hon. Members, and especially younger hon.

<p>With permission, Mr. Speaker, I wish to make a statement about the European fighter aircraft.<br/>
In the summer of 1985, we agreed with the German, Italian and Spanish Governments on the essential characteristics of a European fighter aircraft, or EFA, and on arrangements for a phase of project definition to explore the technical content and cost of a programme to develop such an aircraft. Project definition has been completed successfully, and the four nations have now to decide whether to embark on full development of the aircraft. I am very pleased to say that the Government for their part have decided to do so, subject of course to similar affirmative decisions by our three partners, which I understand should be made shortly, and subject also to final negotiation of acceptable contractual terms and conditions.<br/>
EFA is needed by the Royal Air Force to replace its air defence Phantoms and ground attack Jaguars at the end of their lives and to complement the Tornado F3 air defence aircraft. The Warsaw pact is well equipped with modern high performance fighters, and an agile aircraft with the characteristics of EFA is essential to maintain effective air defences beyond the late 1990s. EFA will also have a secondary ground attack capability.<br/>
The specification for EFA which has emerged from project definition has been rigorously and realistically examined in comparison with a number of possible alternatives. After an exhaustive investigation, I am in no doubt that EFA is the best and most cost-effective option to fulfil this essential military role. The prime contractors will be the Eurofighter consortium for the aircraft as a whole and the Eurojet consortium for the EJ200 engine. British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce respectively will play key roles in these consortia, drawing on invaluable experience gained during the experimental aircraft programme and the XG40 engine demonstrator programme, both of which have been partly funded from the defence budget. Overall the United Kingdom will have a 33 per cent. work share in the development of the aircraft. This will open up major opportunities for British industry, and I estimate that the development task alone will give direct long-term employment to between 3,000 and 4,000 people in the United Kingdom.<br/>
The cost to the United Kingdom of full development will he some &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;7 billion. This will be accommodated within the planned defence expenditure totals published last autumn by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.<br/>
The EFA programme is of vital importance to the United Kingdom aerospace industry. Although the technology involved is highly advanced, it is based on concepts proven during project definition and by the various demonstrator programmes to which I have referred. We have insisted that the prime contractors accept a very tight commercial package and the contracts that we are drawing up will place the technical and financial risks firmly where they should be, on the industrial consortia rather than on the Governments. All subcontracts for the aircraft's equipment will be subject to competition.<br/>
EFA will fulfil a vital defence need in the best and most cost-effective way. It will continue the trend of successful European collaboration in aerospace. It will ensure that our industry remains in the forefront of this technology to the end of the century and beyond, while ensuring the best possible value for money for the taxpayer. I commend the Government's decision to the House.</p>

<p>The right hon. Gentleman's statement, after all the doubts and delays of the past, will be greeted with some relief within the Royal Air Force and in Britain's aerospace and defence industries. There will also be relief that on this occasion at least the Government have been forced to support British and European industry and technology as they did not do in the case of Nimrod and Westland. What will be the total cost to Her Majesty's Government of the whole project? take it that the &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;7 billion will not be the project's total cost. What will be the unit cost per aircraft to the United Kingdom?<br/>
Will the Royal Air Force get the 250 aircraft that it needs? Will the Secretary of State give the House that assurance? How many aircraft will be ordered by our European partners? We need to know that, because it affects the budget and unit costs. As the defence budget is under so much pressure, what projects will be cancelled and what commitments dropped to pay for the costs of this aircraft? Clearly, in view of the Government's nuclear obsession, no nuclear project will be dropped or cancelled.<br/>
Is the Secretary of State aware that there is considerable public concern as to whether he and his Department are capable of managing such a complex project in view of the appalling record of successive Tory Defence Ministers on early-warning aircraft, radars, torpedoes and missiles and including the appalling record of the Secretaries of State for Defence since 1979? Will he now satisfy hon. Members on both sides of the House that he has the will on this matter to put his own house in order and not waste even more taxpayers' money?</p>

<p>I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman's welcome for this decision. I agree that it is good to feel that the project is coming under way. The total cost has still to be defined absolutely, but I would expect it to be of the order of &#x00A3;6 billion to &#x00A3;7 billion when it is completed. There is no change in the United Kingdom's declared production offtake, which remains 250 aircraft. It is too early in the project to forecast with certainty the eventual size of the United Kingdom purchase, or indeed, other partners' purchases of EFA.<br/>
It is inevitable when anything is spent on defence that something else must make way for it in the programme. However, after exhaustive discussion, I am certain that this project is affordable within the defence budget. As a matter of interest, it is likely to be considerably cheaper than the Tornado programme, which we are already accomplishing successfully.<br/>
The right hon. Gentleman shows some courage in raising the management of those projects. As he knows, we have followed a policy over the past few years of a major change in the procurement process under the leadership of Mr. Peter Levene and the Procurement Executive. In the type of project that we are drawing up nowadays&#x2014;EFA, is a typical example&#x2014;the responsibility is placed firmly on the main contractor. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman will not object to my mentioning that all the cases that he


has cited of things that have gone wrong involved, in almost every case, contracts placed and drawn up under the previous Labour Administration which we have had to put right.</p>

<p>I have heard such views expressed at times, and I know that my right hon. Friend knows a great deal about that matter.

<p>The Minister will know that the unit cost will depend upon each country taking the number of aircraft in which it declares an interest.

<p>There is no procedure in existence to tie any of the countries to a future decision at the time of the next stages.

<p>As the hon. Gentleman will, I think, appreciate, we would never discuss unit costs of an aircraft of this sort publicly, for obvious reasons. I can tell him, however, that the greatest possible care and effort has been made to compare all the possibilities, including any aircraft which are available elsewhere and which could play a comparable role.

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I know that all those concerned in the various British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce and many other factories in British industry will take this as a very encouraging development. Like my hon. Friend, I hope that those who have seen fit to cast doubts on the likelihood of the project's proceeding will now feel that they were wrong.<br/>
As for the work share, I believe that, together with subcontracting and business for many firms of all sizes, the project will employ many thousands before it is finished. In answer to my hon. Friend's question about French participation, we would always be willing to collaborate with France in any parts of such a project, but I do not think that at this stage we will wish to interrupt the progress of the four-nation plan to bring in another partner.</p>

<p>Does the Secretary of State recognise the potential importance of the project to Ferranti?

<p>That point is certainly very much in our minds as these matters are decided. Contracting for the EFA, for all sorts of reasons, will clearly be on a basis of the best bid being accepted, but I am glad to say that British companies are well represented in all the alternatives.</p>

<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who has played a prominent role in pressing for the aircraft. I am sure that he feels very glad about the decision.<br/>
As for export opportunities, we certainly hope&#x2014;all the partners hope&#x2014;that by the mid to late 1990s there will be a considerable market for this type of aircraft. We also hope that the EFA will be very well placed for overseas sales.</p>

<p>My right hon. Friend's welcome announcement is an endorsement of industry in Britain, and a commitment to the defences of Britain and of NATO. The Jaguar and Phantom aircraft will require replacement in about the mid-1990s. Is the EFA project on line and on time for that?</p>

<p>Yes, I can confirm that we aim for EFA to come into service in the late 1990s, which should be just about the right time. My hon. Friend is absolutely correct in saying that it is because we have extremely capable industries in Europe, which can without any difficulty or doubt embark on such a complicated project, that we are able to make progress of this sort. I think that it is very important from the point of view of Eurospace industry that the project should be successful and I am sure that it will be.</p>

<p>Does the definition of the plane include evading radar, in which case, would it not be cheaper to buy single-engined Cessnas of the type that flew into Red square in Moscow and to put the investment into civilian aircraft, in which this country is lagging behind, to the extent that British Airways is almost totally dependent upon Boeing? Why are those huge sums so readily available for such a project when the Lucas Aerospace shop stewards committee had the greatest difficulty in applying their technology, for example, to kidney machines? Why cannot the National Health Service, education and social services have that sort of money put into them to create jobs?</p>

<p>I am sure that people in British industry who are hoping and expecting to get a lot of work for many years out of the project will note that the hon. Gentleman is pretty hostile to the whole idea. With regard to spending the money on other things, I do not see a great benefit in having the most marvellous kidney machines or whatever in this country if the country is unable to defend itself when it needs to.</p>

<p>I welcome my right hon. Friend's statement, which will greatly reassure many of us in the north-west. Will he outline the mechanism for work sharing that will be used on the project to reflect the number of aircraft that each nation decides to buy, when it decides to buy them and, more specifically, to reflect the occasions when a country such as ours finds exports on its own? That country may find that, if there is a set percentage from the outset, a lot of the work is carried out by other member countries.</p>

<p>I appreciate my hon. Friend's point about work share. At present, we are talking about the work share in the full development phase. That is based on the declared numbers now, which gives the United Kingdom a 33 per cent. share of the work in that full development stage. In future, when we come to decisions on production investment and the production stage, the work share will be defined on the basis of the aircraft ordered. One of the great benefits of such a collaborative effort is that, in the overseas sales, all the partners benefit from the production of the aircraft. That is why costs are containable in this high-technology project. It means that


everybody benefits from the export sales made, although the country that does the exporting has a greater benefit than any other.</p>

<p>On the regional implications, we expect each member country to have its own policies on those matters. As far as we are concerned, as the hon.

It is fair to say that Opposition Members have frequently advocated projects such as the EFA, and have done so genuinely.

<p>Will the Minister take this opportunity to refute the untrue allegations made by

Conservative Members that we have opposed the project? If any confusion has been caused, it is because of the Government's procrastination in making up their minds. That is why we welcome the fact that the programme is going ahead.<br/>
In his statement and in answer to questions, the Secretary of State said that the plane will come into operation in the late 1990s. On 8 December and 26 January, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence Procurement said that the plane would go into service in the mid-1990s. Are we to understand that there has been a five-year slippage since January, or is the plane due to go into service in the mid to late 1990s?<br/>
Will the Secretary of State be a little firmer on the radar issue? When will the suite for the aircraft be ordered? Will we be in the ridiculous situation that we were in with the Tornado and type 23 frigates? There was a first-class vehicle with no radar, no combat capability, and no command and control system, because of the Government's appalling mismanagement of our defence economy.</p>

<p>I note what the hon. Gentleman says. I hope that his voice is the real one from the Opposition about welcoming the project. He should have a word with the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Cryer), who appears to he deeply hostile to the project. Perhaps I could leave it to them to sort it out between themselves. <i>[Interruption.]</i> No problem.<br/>
As regards the date, I said the mid to late 1990s. Perhaps I was being unduly cautious. I hope that it will be ready for service about the mid-1990s.<br/>
As I said earlier, when the Government decide which consortium is to produce the radar, responsibility will be firmly placed on one main contractor. It will be required to provide the radar to specification and on time before it gets paid. That is the incentive contract, which is our real security for procurement decisions from now on.</p>

<p>May I raise a point of order that arises out of Question Time, Mr. Speaker? I understand that you called the Secretary of State for Wales to order because he used the word "hypocrisy" or "hypocrite". Of course, all efforts to raise the standard of language that is used by Ministers of the Crown are highly commendable; we understand what an arduous task you must have in that respect. But is your ruling unduly restrictive?<br/>
I recall a famous occasion&#x2014;it was a bit before my time, but it happened in the House&#x2014;when Mr. Lloyd George was dealing with the leader of the Social Democrats of the day, who crossed the Floor and assisted the Conservatives at the time. Lloyd George said that he objected not so much to his crossing the Floor but to the "slime of hypocrisy" that he left behind.<br/>
Ruling that out of order is a restrictive method of reply and use of language. There are many occasions, particularly when dealing with this Administration, when we must use the word "hypocrisy" to be accurate.</p>

<p>As the Bill stands, part VIII is entitled "Limitation of Charges Etc" and clause 104, the first clause in that part of the Bill, sets out the arrangements under which the Secretary of State for the Environment will have powers retrospectively to control, cap or reduce the poll tax of every local authority in England. Later on there is an exemption for authorities with budgets of less than &#x00A3;15 million a year. However, that is a sweeping. general central power given to Ministers under these proposals. Again, we see exploded the Government's claim that poll tax is a tool to make local government accountable to the electorate. Here we have the Government taking powers to ensure that, whichever way the electorate votes or whatever it decides about the local authority decisions in its area, the Government can countermand those decisions.<br/>
Under these proposals, the Secretary of State will have the power to order councils to reduce the level of poll tax. even after they have started to collect it and have implemented a budget based upon it. That will not only add to the financial and administrative burdens placed upon local authorities, but will throw budget strategies into chaos and further increase the powers of central Government over those communities. The implementation of these powers will cause huge disruption, whenever and wherever they are used.<br/>
What is clear in this part of the Bill is that the poll tax is not about local accountability. It is about cutting the spending, the services and, above all, reducing the independence of local government yet again. We suspect that it is especially aimed at elected Labour authorities. Implicit, too, in those proposals is the idea that accountability is all right and will be satisfactory for authorities with small budgets of under &#x00A3;15 million. However, different parameters apply to authorities with budgets in excess of that arbitrary figure.<br/>
The inclusion of these powers gives the game away. Repeatedly, the Secretary of State has said that the poll tax will improve accountability and the responsibility of voters. He has argued that more people will vote as a result of the poll tax. I hope that he is right at least in that aim. I want more people to vote in local elections. However, what is the point? The point is totally undermined by the fact that, however those people may decide to vote on the level of their budget or services, the Secretary of State is reserving the right to himself to change the implications of their vote, and he is doing so on arguments which, frankly, do not bear scrutiny.<br/>
As the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy has pointed out, community charges, which are to replace domestic rates, will change rapidly from year to year and will bear little relation to local spending. That has been pointed out to Ministers in Committee over and over again. Changes in grants and changes in the national business tax made by Ministers could, and almost certainly will, have serious repercussions on the level of poll tax. Again, we may see fluctuations and major changes which do not result from decisions taken at local level. Therefore, the ability of local authorities to adjust their income to take account of such changes is threatened by those proposals.<br/>
The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy also pointed out,
<q>that community charges</q>
&#x2014;that is the poll tax&#x2014;
<q>will be heavily dependent on variations in population and changes in the Government's assessment of a Council's need. This will considerably weaken the link between charges and council spending.</q>
It has been pointed out previously that changes in spending, up or down, in local authorities can be affected by a variety of factors. They do not necessarily have anything to do with either competence, or, for that matter, incompetence, profligacy or efficiency. Changes in expenditure, up or down, are determined by a variety of often very complex factors and decisions.<br/>
Let us examine the implications of all this in a little more detail. Councils normally begin working on their budgets in the autumn. They come to their budget-making meeting in the early part of the year. They announce their budget and they fix a poll tax by 1 April, which is now the legal requirement. Election campaigns then begin. Elections take place in the first week in May. After these elections, after an authority has set and announced its budget, fixed its poll tax, and fought and won an election &#x2014;in other words, it has gained the approval of the voters &#x2014;the Secretary of State decides that he will overturn the whole procedure. He decides to designate the authority under the provisions of clause 8 of the Bill. The whole thing becomes a farce. The determination of the budget,

the setting of the poll tax, the putting of all the arguments to the local electorate are all a farce, because Ministers can then overturn and undermine the whole procedure, which includes the decision of the electors themselves. That is done by enforcing a retrospective change in the poll tax and, therefore, in the budget and the programme of the authority. First, this is done in the name of accountability and, secondly, of improving efficiency.<br/>
It beggars belief that these proposals can be put forward in that way, because they will do exactly the opposite. They will undermine accountability and they will cause disruption, inefficiency and ineffectiveness in the administration, not just of finances but, more importantly. of important local services. That was wonderfully summed up by the Minister for Local Government in Committee who, when talking about those powers, stated:
<q>As I have already described, such procedures will enable us to use our charge capping powers to bring rapid relief to hard-pressed charge payers faced with excessive demands from authorities which, for some reason, seem quite irrationally to have no regard for the interests of their electors." [<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E</i>, 17 March 1988; c. 1484.]</q>
It is difficult to find a better example of doublespeak.<br/>
The decision of the electors as recorded in the ballot box&#x2014;presumably a decision that displeases the Minister and makes him decide to invoke his powers&#x2014;is described by the Minister as
<q>irrationally to have no regard for the interests of &#x2026; electors.</q>
What if the electors have chosen an authority of their persuasion and a council programme to their liking? That can hardly be described as irrational. Voting for a council of their choice is the conscious decision of people in a democratic society&#x2014;but not a bit of it under this Government because that choice can and no doubt will be cynically set aside by central controls as it has been under the rate-capping proposals. At bottom, the proposals are yet another major central power for Ministers over democratically elected local government. They give Ministers the power to act in defiance of decisions of the local electors and against their express wishes as recorded in a secret ballot.<br/>
The Labour party is unwilling to accept such proposals or that such powers should be given to Ministers. That is why we have tabled the amendment to delete the whole miserable clause from the Bill.</p>

<p>Like the Opposition Front Bench spokesman, I too am sorry that these provisions are in the Bill, but, unlike Opposition Members, that is not because I regard the provision as wrong, but simply because the antics of the lunatic few on the Left have made the clause necessary. We should focus on that. We should be sorry for the fact that the clause is here, but we should consider why it is necessary and, if the clause is ever to be deleted, we should focus attention on the fact that local government must try to put its house in order. If local government goes on making community charge capping necessary, that is real proof that we have weak local government in this country because, by definition, local government which does not co-operate with the Government of the day is weak. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I shall explain exactly what I mean in a moment.<br/>
If one is to have a successful democracy in any country, one needs strong local government. I am not against strong local government but, because of the way in which it is behaving at the moment, I do not believe that it is


strong. The evidence about why the community charge-capping clauses are necessary is overwhelming. At the moment, at least 10 councils are overspending by more than &#x00A3;100 per head. Indeed, two are overspending by over &#x00A3;200 per head and one by the gross amount of over &#x00A3;300 per head. If such sums of money are charged over and above the average community charge in future, any responsible Government, of whatever political colour, is duty bound to act on behalf of the country as a whole.<br/>
The hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) suggested that the clause may be aimed at Labour authorities. I hope that it is because that list of 10 councils which are high-spending are Labour authorities which must be called to account.</p>

<p>When is the hon.

<p>I am coming to the point that the hon. Gentleman has made. I am grateful to him for raising it so that we can talk about it in a minute. However, before I come to that point, I want to mention something else that the hon. Gentleman said in his opening remarks &#x2014;that the clause gives the game away. Indeed it does, but the game that it gives away is that the Labour party has not the slightest intention of learning the lessons of the past; nor does it seem to have the slightest intention of co-operating. That underlines the fact that this clause is absolutely necessary because Opposition Members have given the game away about their future intentions.<br/>
The opposition to the clause is predictable. It starts by saying that the provisions are a restriction of local freedom. They are not, and I shall explain in a moment why I take that view. It suggests that the clauses are not necessary if local accountability works properly. Earlier in the Report stage, I made the point that exemptions and rebates were not the avenue down which we should go. I believe that community charge capping is the quid pro quo for exemptions and rebates because it is they that undermine local accountability.<br/>
The Opposition are revealing that they have a totally flawed view of the role of local government and an even more flawed view of local government's relationship with central Government. They are also revealing that, despite

harping on certain minorities, they intend to do their level best to ignore the need to protect the minority of voters in a Left-wing Labour authority. Such a minority needs thought and protection as much as any other minority.<br/>
If one thinks through the real role of local government, one comes to the inescapable conclusion that community charge capping is absolutely inevitable. If one thinks about local government and how it arises, one realises that it comes from two different things. It comes first from a feeling of "localness"&#x2014;I shall say something about that later&#x2014;but also from the need to organise national services on a local basis. The first of those roles&#x2014;the expression of a local view&#x2014;is the truly local role of local government. with which no Government should seek to interfere. It is the second of the roles in which central Government becomes involved&#x2014;the need to deliver national services on a local basis. Central Government must oversee that and can dictate its standards to local government.<br/>
That point enables me to answer the point that the hon. Member for Copeland raised. Local government's form. powers and finances all derive from here in Parliament. If Government can define those things, Government can limit them; that makes community charge capping inevitable. In reply to the hon. Gentleman, I should say that no party in this country believes that local government can be absolutely free of obligation. We in Parliament insist that local government must empty dustbins and provide free education for every child over the age of five.<br/>
Would the hon. Member for Copeland defend the ballot box locally if a group of local electors voted in a county council that was pledged not to provide education until children were six? Would the Opposition argue that that is a matter for the ballot box locally, or would they, like me&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>If a group of councillors fought a county council election on the promise that they would provide nursery education for the under-fives and that resulted in a higher poll tax, I would defend it. That is what the hon. Gentleman is trying to stop today, but that is where there should he free choice. If people want to vote for free school education outside the statutory system, they should be able to vote for it. if they are prepared to pay for it. Yet that is what the hon. Gentleman will not allow.</p>

<p>That is a fascinating smokescreen. The hon. Gentleman's silence on my point proves exactly what I was saying, which is that the Labour party, like us, believes, properly, that there are certain things that Parliament can force local authorities to do, such as educate everybody over the age of five. That is absolutely right. All parties believe that there are some things that local government must do. Equally&#x2014;this is the other point behind the smokescreen&#x2014;every party has several things which it believes local government should or should not do, with which other parties disagree.<br/>
Instead of the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) lecturing me on education and the under-fives, let us consider grammar schools or parents and children being able to opt out. If I understand Opposition Members, they would compulsorily require local government to get rid of grammar schools and they would prevent parents from opting out of the state system.


That is the Labour party, properly, choosing its policies. But equally it must be absolutely right for the Conservative party to decide what it believes is a priority, and it wishes local government to behave responsibly on finance. Faced with the evidence of local authorities not behaving responsibly, this party believes that it must act.</p>

<p>I cannot think how the hon. Gentleman reaches that conclusion from what I said. That is not the point. If, while acting in a financially responsible way, a local authority wishes to exercise discretion and go beyond its statutory obligations, that is a matter for it. I am merely arguing that there will come a point beyond which a local authority cannot go.<br/>
The Conservative party is saying that financial responsibility is a key element in strong local government. That is why, at the beginning of my comments, I said that at present we have a financially irresponsible group of councils which are therefore democratically weak. If we can establish strong finances, it then lies with the Government to provide limits, and those limits will be enforced through capping. That is proper and inevitable.<br/>
The limits are set in four ways. Central Government have no choice but to take into account the national economy. When 27 per cent. of public expenditure is spent by local government, no central Government in Whitehall can ignore it. If several local authorities intend to flout the interests of the national economy, capping becomes absolutely inevitable and is absolutely right. The same is true for the local economy.<br/>
The hon. Member for Rother Valley (Mr. Barron) asked me about local discretion on nursery education. That is all very well, but the spending power of the local community must be taken into account and the council must not take more than the community can afford to give. One must accept that if a borough has a vastly high community charge, it will drive people out selectively.</p>

<p>No. As I said earlier, there is the question of a minority. The Labour party is for ever lecturing us about its views on minorities.

<p>I have been following the logic of the hon. Gentleman's argument carefully and if I understand it rightly, having found it, the hon.

Does the hon. Gentleman accept the other side of that logic&#x2014;that if central Government of a different colour decide that a local authority is not maintaining services to a required standard, they can direct local government to spend more on those services by virtue of the same sort of mandate?</p>

<p>If the hon.

Naturally&#x2014;that is the role of central Government. As I said earlier, local government arises from two wholly separate areas: the local feeling of differentness and separateness, which cannot be fettered, and the national provision of services on a local basis. A Government must involve themselves in that latter area.</p>

We are debating this clause for one reason only, and that is the antics of the militant few. Without them this clause would not have been necessary. The Labour party has made the whole Bill necessary and has made community charge capping necessary. Sadly, I see no chance or intention of the Labour party changing what it has done in the past. If its current campaign of misinformation and calls to defy the law are anything to go by, the Labour party has no desire to help, and no chance of helping anyone. All it will do is harm services both locally and nationally. All it will do is damage local government and make it weaker than it is at the moment.

<p>If anyone is undermining democracy it is those who have contempt for the electorate. The hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) has spelt out&#x2014;as have Ministers in Committee and in the House&#x2014;the way in which he believes that choice should be available only if it conforms with his opinion. Nothing but contempt is displayed by using words such as irresponsible, irrational and excessive when talking about the right of people to vote to choose the level and quality of service that they wish to have.<br/>
The Bill and clause 104 illustrate admirably the duplicity that exists in the thinking and attitude towards the poll tax. Only a week ago in this House&#x2014;one can read this in <i>Hansard</i>&#x2014;the Secretary of State for the Environment said:
<q>Everyone should have the right, through the ballot box, to influence the level of service that is provided and the price that they must pay through their taxes. That is the essence of accountability and of responsible democratic control of the services provided by local authorities"&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 18 April 1988; Vol.131, c. 582.]</q>
I cannot think of anything that undermines the principle laid down by the Secretary of State more than the idea of the icy fingers of poll tax capping.<br/>
The notion that people can choose what they want so long as they are not able to vote to spend the money to provide for their choice is not only duplicity, but runs extremely close to absolute contempt for the representative democratic system of our country. The Government, having taken control of the unified business rate, having changed the proposals in the Bill&#x2014;as my hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) has said&#x2014;regarding the distribution and organisation of the grant system so that equalisation between communities and the way in which we can protect those that have a low resource base is destroyed, and having lifted central control to 75 per cent. of all local government spending, now propose to lift it to 100 per cent.<br/>
When the Rates Act 1984 was debated, statements were made that were similar to those made today by the hon. Member for Spelthorne. The Government spoke about minorities being oppressed by the majority. They talked about people who lived in the high-rated areas of particular authorities having to pay for services voted for

by those who did not pay or, according to them, did not pay sufficient into the coffers. They talked about people needing to feel the pain of expenditure on the services that they received. They devised a tax that they claimed, in its early stages, met the criteria that everyone would pay something and that people would feel that they were paying towards the expenditure on the services that they received. The Government went further and called that tax a charge that would be levied on the services delivered to the people who had voted for them.<br/>
Today, as at other times, we have reflected on the Prime Minister's decision, announced in October&#x2014;it was not in the manifesto&#x2014;that the Government would not allow people to vote for what they believed to be right and that they would not allow them to raise money to spend on services, but that the Government would do a double somersault&#x2014;described by the current Secretary of State for Education and Science as intellectually unjustifiable &#x2014;and bring in poll tax capping.<br/>
The last vestige of justification in terms of making people pay for what they vote for has now been stripped away. The poll tax capping reveals the Bill for what it is &#x2014;an attempt to undermine and dismember the whole concept of public services. People will be told that they have one choice only&#x2014;the choice of the market economy. People can do what they like, say what they like, think what they like, but in the end they will get what the Conservative Government believe is right for them.<br/>
Imagine if someone went into a supermarket and chose from the shelves the long-lasting, high-quality, value-for-money goods that they are willing to buy rather than cheaper goods that they saw on the shelves below. Just as they reach the check-out counter, however they hear over the Tannoy the voice of the matron or the sneer of the bully who suddenly steps forward and says, "I'm afraid you may have decided that that is the produce you want, but we have decided otherwise. In this supermarket you buy only the discredited and low-quality goods that we have decided are good for you."<br/>
4.45 pm<br/>
What sort of society would we be faced with if, instead of announcing that one could not buy the goods that one wanted in that supermarket, there was an announcement over the Tannoy that it was a BUPA market where one could have only the quality of health care that one could buy through private insurance in the private market? Imagine if it was announced over the Tannoy that people had to have private schooling, that people had to have private old people's homes and that the only choice was the private choice of private privilege. That is what is offered in the Bill.<br/>
The Bill represents a major dupe of the concept of citizenship and the concept of people choosing freely what they will and are willing to pay for the services that they want for their children, parents or themselves.<br/>
We should be concerned not simply with exposing the fact that the poll tax is unfair, unjust and unequal&#x2014;the House has debated that at length and many Conservative Members have voted with us. We should also expose, once and for all, the idea that the Government believe in diversity and in freedom of choice. We should expose the idea that the Government believe that people have the right to determine for themselves the quality, extent and quantity of goods and services that they wish. That principle has gone out of the window once and for all.<br/>
As the debate is being reported I hope that we can get over to people outside that others have been called irrational, excessive and irresponsible for wishing to vote for decent education, decent care of the old and the disabled. That is the biggest insult that the Government could ever give to the electorate. The electorate will give its answer on 5 May and at the general election.<br/>
Poll tax capping should be the final nail that scuppers the flagship and exposes the bilges to the tide of public opinion. That public opinion will sweep us forward to victory and it will demonstrate that the nation rejects the concept and the principle behind the Bill.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way for old time's sake, if for no other reason. He knows that Lord McIntosh, as leader of the Labour party

in London, fought on an election manifesto that was inherited by my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone), when he took over as leader of the GLC. There was no argument about policies. It was simply a question of personnel. Let us get it straight. In this case, we are talking about policies, not personnel.</p>

<p>I am very fond of the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks), but he knows perfectly well that the present hon. Member for Brent, East (Mr. Livingstone) went round deselecting all of Lord McIntosh's friends. There was internecine war in the Labour party. The hon. Gentleman should ask Lord McIntosh what really happened when the moderates were kicked out of the GLC.<br/>
If Opposition Members do not accept that argument, let me put it this way. When I was a member of the GLC, it was under Conservative control and Sir Horace Cutler often had to deal with a Labour Government. The Labour Government at the time insisted that they were the masters of macroeconomic policy. I remember Sir Horace telling a Conservative group meeting that he had just been to ask the Secretary of State for the Environment&#x2014;the right hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Stepney (Mr. Shore)&#x2014;for something and had been told that he could not spend the money. Sir Horace abided by the decision because he accepted, as local government has traditionally accepted, that we live in a unitary, not a federal, state and that central Government have the right to lay down macroeconomic targets by which local government must abide.<br/>
Although the Bill will ensure that, over time, local authorities will be more accountable to public opinion because of the new, more sensible rate support grant, because of the introduction of the community charge, which many more people will pay, and because of the introduction of the new business rate, we must legislate against a recurrence of what happened with the GLC in May 1981. That is especially true of the transitional period, during which an authority may use the transitional arrangements to impose excessive demands on community charge payers before it becomes truly accountable under the system. The capping power is a reserve power that will be used only rarely, but it is an essential safeguard that the Government must leave in the Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman should read <i>Hansard</i>. I have quoted what he said.<br/>
The amendment shows the hollowness of the Government's argument. Amendments Nos. 157, 158, 159 and 160 deserve our support, and when it comes to the Division in half an hour I and my colleagues will vote for them. I am not so sure about amendments Nos. 161 and 162. They provide that, under poll tax capping, we would retain the system of rate capping, which means that authorities would be capped after the event. I see some logic in intervening in the relevant year rather than the subsequent year. To give an obvious example, my colleagues in Tower Hamlets thought that it was unfair that their rates were capped as a result of decisions taken by the previous Labour administration, which was entirely different politically. I accept the argument for that system being changed.<br/>
Instead of listening to the hon. Members for Spelthorne and for Gainsborough and Horncastle I would rather listen to experts whose views on local government are objective, not subjective. When the Minister announced poll tax capping in the autumn, the lead article in the <i>Local Government Chronicle</i> said this:
<q>Poll tax capping an illogical humbug.</q>
<q>Local Government Minister Michael Howard has finally destroyed the Government's argument in favour of community charge. Since the proposal surfaced &#x2026; assorted secretaries of state and ministers have been declaiming whatever technical and financial problems it posed, the community charge had one over-riding merit&#x2014;it would ensure the accountability of councils by giving every voter a direct stake in financial decisions.</q></p>

<p>No. Other hon. Members wish to speak and we have only half an hour left.<br/>
The system which the Government believe would make local government accountable has been proved to be defective. They must know that in their heart of hearts. The article in the <i>Local Government Chronicle</i> concluded:
<q>To cap community charge smacks of dishonesty and selective vengeance.</q>
That is reminiscent of the debate in 1984 on rate capping, when the right hon. Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (Mr. Heath) said:
<q>I do not believe that these powers should be given to the Minister."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 17 January 1984; Vol. 52, c. 188.]</q>
The former Secretary of State for the Environment, now Lord Rippon, said that the Bill which introduced rate capping was "deplorable", raised "major constitutional issues" and was a classic example of "elective dictatorship". When we reach the Division, I guess that it will be the fifth vote during the Report stage of this Bill when some Conservative Members will have the courage of their convictions and will vote against the Government's policy.<br/>
The Minister made his case in Committee on 17 March &#x2014;this deals with one of the points made by the hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle&#x2014;when he said:
<q>Over time, the system"&#x2014;</q>
that is the poll tax&#x2014;
<q>will curb even a council which, ignoring the ultimate electoral consequences, irrationally embarks on a policy of excessive spending to the clear detriment of those whom it claims to serve. But the new system of local finance will not guarantee instantaneous relief from an outbreak of irrational behaviour where, perhaps to prove some kind of distorted political point, an authority decides on excessive spending policies contrary to all reason and to the interests of its electors. In such a situation the public will expect&#x2014;quite

reasonably&#x2014;that the Government should take some rapid action."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee E</i>, 17 March 1988; c. 1472&#x2013;3.]</q>
That summarises the Government's patronising, derogatory and nannying attitude to local government. They believe that Whitehall always knows best. The Government realise that they are in trouble because of arguments similar to the one advanced by the Minister that day.<br/>
I rephrase the Minister's remarks in this way. Over time, the system of poll tax will curb even a Government who, ignoring the ultimate electoral consequences, irrationally embark on a policy of excessive unfairness to the clear detriment of many of those whom they claim to be helping. The old electoral system does not guarantee instantaneous relief from an outbreak of irrational behaviour where, perhaps to prove some distorted political point, the Government decide upon an absurdly unfair taxation policy contrary to all reason and to the interests of all but their wealthy electors. In such a situation, the public&#x2014;that is where the debate will go after today&#x2014;will expect that anyone who can, including Opposition, Government Back-Bench Members and the House of Lords, should take rapid action. We have no doubt that they will. If only we had legislation to cap the Government when they embark upon Irrational, excessive policies. [HON. MEMBERS: "Decapitation."] Decapitation is an option, but it is slightly less likely to be produced.<br/>
5 pm<br/>
There are many other ways forward. The Government's folly is that they have not hearkened to advice from elsewhere. Instead of introducing masses of ever more complex legislation year after year in the search for a system that can be made to work, the Government should perhaps face up to what the <i>Mail on Sunday</i> recommended only yesterday and other papers have recommended before. The way to make councils accountable is to change the electoral system and have proportional representation for local government. [HON. MEMBERS: "Oh."] Conservative Members say "Oh," because it would work, and they know that it would work; the only trouble is that such a system would not necessarily put as many of them into power as the present system. They are concerned not about local government working but about taking local government over.<br/>
No doubt the Minister will have seen the <i>Mail on Sunday</i> editorial early yesterday morning. As he knows, that paper does not always come out on our side; on the contrary, it often comes out on his. On this occasion, it said:
<q>The best solution for the Government is to cut its losses and plump, albeit through gritted teeth, for a progressive tax based as much on ability to pay as on demand for services. And if the Government is serious about making local government properly accountable to its electors, it should stop fiddling about with taxes and bring in proportional representation for council elections. Radical, brave politician though she is, has Mrs. Thatcher the courage to do either or, preferably, both?</q>
We now know that if the poll tax comes in&#x2014;it is a very big "if"&#x2014;the Secretary of State will ensure that every poll tax payer receives an at-a-glance guide to council efficiency on the back of his poll tax return to show him how his council compares to councils around the country. What it will not show is what independent studies say will happen under the poll tax. As the Minister knows, the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy has


calculated that if the community charge had been in operation between 1986 and 1988 not one authority in the whole of England would have been able to claim that changes in its spending per adult had been met by comparable changes in its community charge. For 29 authorities, variations in grant in that period would have meant that, even where they had cut their spending, the community charge would have increased. For 21 councils, community charge would have gone down when spending went up. For 228 councils, the community charge would have increased when spending increased, but faster. There will be no direct accountability anywhere. There will be no direct match between what councils spend and the poll tax that they levy. Nevertheless, we are to have capping&#x2014;on a blanket basis involving the application of uniform principles. That will ensure that, in the end, whatever council is elected and no matter how many electors vote &#x2014;it could be 100 per cent.&#x2014;the Government could still say, "We know best."<br/>
The poll tax is meant to make local authorities accountable. We should ask, "Accountable for what and accountable to whom?" The Government have made their answer clear. The local authorities will be accountable not to their electors for carrying out the policies for which they have been elected but to central Government for administering central Government policies. If they do not do what central Government want them to do, they will be capped and given directions. For any democrat, the case against poll tax is overwhelming. Sadly, we do not have a Government of democrats.</p>

<p>I note that the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) has again stated his objection to rebates and to some of the exemptions included in the Bill. I would not accept any part of his analysis of the Bill, but no doubt he, as an honourable person, will be giving serious consideration to voting against Third Reading, as the Bill includes measures that he interprets as contrary to the principles of accountability.<br/>
Given all the pressures and devices in the Bill to force authorities to act within given parameters, it seems strange that we should then have capping. The majority of people may have decided&#x2014;perhaps very firmly&#x2014;on a policy that favours services. Under this provision, however, the Government can insist that such a policy is not followed. My hon. Friends the Members for Easington (Mr. Cummings) and for Barnsley, East (Mr. Patchett) were here earlier. In their constituencies, there is vast support among working people for the provision of services. Even if 75 or 80 per cent. of the electorate vote in local government elections in favour of spending their own money collectively to provide services and do things that they could not do individually, they will be stopped by diktat of a Government who can claim only 42 per cent. of the votes. That is an obscenity.<br/>
Some Conservative Members argue in favour of the Bill for the one simple reason that the proposal was included in their manifesto and that they must therefore stick with it solidly. I do not accept that argument. I ask them to consider what the manifesto said about the poll tax:
<q>We will reform local government finance to strengthen local democracy and accountability.</q>

The accountability argument has already gone out of the window over the question of joint and several liability. It goes out of the window entirely in the light of the poll tax capping provisions. Whatever local authorities decide to spend to provide services, they will be prevented from doing so. A local authority cannot be made accountable by being made to spend more money but only by being made to spend less.<br/>
The manifesto continues:
<q>Local electors must be able to decide the level of service they want and how much they are prepared to pay for it.</q>
The poll tax capping runs contrary to the manifesto commitment, which says that the local electorate must determine what services it wants and how much it is prepared to pay. I hope that those Conservative Members who stick with the rather simple notion that because the proposal appeared in the manifesto they must go along with it will take that on board, because we may then have some chance to do something about this obnoxious provision.</p>

<p>What is a manifesto? A manifesto commitment means something if it has been fully and fearlessly discussed by the electorate&#x2014;if it has been put in front of them so that they can make a solid decision about it. In the last election, that did not happen with the poll tax, except in Scotland, where the proposal was solidly rejected. I accept that, all other things being equal, hon. Members are committed to their manifesto proposals, but all other things are not equal in this case. The poll tax was not a major subject of discussion at the last election and other issues and values are at stake. Democracy depends not just on a document on which people have voted but on feelings, understandings, pressures and democratic pluralism in society.</p>

<p>I shall return to the main attack.<br/>
On Thursday we discussed contingency funding and grant provisions, and from the debate it was quite clear that the contingency fund provisions are not adequate. Problems have emerged about emergency expenditure and Parliament recently applied the Bellwin rules to expenditure on gale damage. That type of expenditure still requires local government money. The legislation will increasingly require the full amount to be met out of the poll tax provision rather than out of the unified business rate or from the grant provided by central Government.<br/>
That situation will be made excessively worse by the introduction of poll tax capping. When an emergency arises, an authority will have to spend money out of the


poll tax provisions to meet it, but will then be capped. The only way in which it will be able to meet its commitments in an emergency will be by further cutting the services and provisions in its area. The Minister needs to answer that point.</p>

<p>I support the amendment. It is quite clear that this part of the Bill exposes the total hypocrisy of the Government. They have introduced the poll tax because they say that they want to make services more closely accountable to the electorate; then they come up with the proposal about poll tax capping.<br/>
The Government want to set up a system of local government finance that creates maximum pressure for the reduction of local council services, and they have done that in three stages. First, they have created a penal and unfair tax system that puts caring councils in the difficult position of having to impose the tax or cut services. Secondly, the tax gives a financial incentive to people in need of local services to vote against them. Thirdly, via poll tax capping, the Government give themselves the power to impose service cuts on councils and electorates that have not been bullied into making cuts themselves.<br/>
It is clear from the Government's proposed poll tax capping that they want to leave nothing to chance. The Government are not interested in local democracy because, ultimately, they do not trust the local electorate, believing that their judgments are preferable to those of local people elected to take the decisions. The Secretary of State has already given us his vision of what local authorities will be. He has said that they should meet once a year and should sit down and discuss the way that all the contracts for services are to be given to private companies.<br/>
Then, in the words of the Secretary of State, the councils will retire and have a good long lunch. The Secretary of State knows all about good long lunches. I notice from the latest figures that the Department of the Environment spent &#x00A3;66,000 on official hospitality last year. Perhaps that is what the Secretary of State thinks local authorities should do.<br/>
As I have said, this part of the Bill exposes the total hypocrisy of the Government. It will make the already difficult task of local authority treasurers in drawing up their budgets that much more difficult.</p>

<p>I shall be brief. I think that it is generally accepted that central Government are responsible for macroeconomic policy. However, there may be disputes in central Government about the efficacy of some aspects of macroeconomic policy. We have heard of a dispute between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer about the exchange rate. In the light of difficult decisions, that is perfectly understandable. It should not be in dispute that, if the Government are producing a poll tax in order to advance accountability, hon. Members and the electorate should be entitled to take them at their word.<br/>
In a speech on 19 March, the Secretary of State for the Environment uttered some graphic words. He said:
<q>One Labour pressure group described the Community Charge as 'a straightforward attempt to create conditions for taxpayers'revolts against council spending plans.'</q>
I have no doubt that some Conservative Members would say, "Hear, hear" to that. The Secretary of State went on:
<q>They've got it in one! Councils who are efficient and frugal have nothing to fear. But with Community Charge

figures in some areas of &#x00A3;500&#x2013;&#x00A3;600, of course local people will rebel. They will rebel against profligacy and inefficiency and throw the guilty councillors out.</q>
<q>The weapon of democratic accountability is a very powerful one for us Conservatives: use it. The message is: if you want a lower Community Charge&#x2014;vote for it, and vote Conservative.</q>
What happens if people do not obey the Secretary of State? The answer is that the Government will need back-up powers. Such powers are in the Bill and in the Scottish Act because the Government are fearful of democratic choice. They ought to come clean about that. Accountability is not written in concrete. It will vary. People may have a different view of the need over a five-year Parliament.</p>

<p>The debate on these powers has largely been a re-run of the debate in Standing Committee. There have been one or two changes in the cast, but on the whole we have heard similar arguments. We are delighted to see back with us after his illness the hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett). Quite clearly his illness has done nothing to dull his appetite for controversy. I think that he was the only speaker to advance the arguments beyond those that were put in Committee. He introduced to the debate the metaphor of the supermarket which, as far as I can recall, played no part in the previous proceedings on the Bill. I was delighted to hear the hon. Gentleman make use of that metaphor because it shows that all that we have been saying about the importance of value for money in the provision of local government services is at last getting home to the Opposition.<br/>
I do not think that the analogy was quite as compelling as the hon. Gentleman seemed to think it was. Of course, the relationship between the customer in the supermarket and the supermarket owner is not quite as unbridled as the hon. Gentleman seemed to suggest. Transactions in the supermarket are always subject to the intervention of the trading standards officer, although I have to concede that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State probably does not often think of himself as a glorified trading standards officer.</p>

<p>Does the Minister accept that if we have poll tax capping it is unlikely that the trading standards officer will any longer exist?</p>

<p>I do not accept that anything of the kind is likely to happen.<br/>
One of the newcomers to the debate, the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes), raised a


point on the basis of some of the calculations by CIPFA. The hon. Gentleman should know that those calculations are based on a projection of the existing grants system and include, among other features of the existing grants system, the penalty system, which, of course, will not be part of the new regime. If such calculations are based on the existing grants system, it is not surprising that the results lead to anomalies.<br/>
We recognise that the existing grants system has instabilities that would lead to such results. That is one of the reasons why we think it important not to have that feature in the new grants system, but to have in its place a much more stable grants system that will enable people to assess to a greater and more effective extent the performance of their local authorities.</p>

<p>The Minister cannot confirm to the House that there is any certainty or objective agreement that the new system will produce for each local authority in England a commensurate rise in poll tax with a rise in spending and a decrease in the poll tax with a decrease in spending. There is no guarantee that that would follow from this legislation.</p>

<speech hansard_id="551159" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-04-25a.51.1" hansard_membership_id="105" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2846" speakername="Mr. Howard" colnum="51" time="17:15:00">
<p>We are certainly objective. We intend to produce a given figure for a standard level of service, which will provide a ready reckoner on the basis of which people will be able to understand whether they are getting value for money.<br/>
We have made it clear on more than one occasion that we see the capping power introduced in the clause as a reserve measure. It is not a measure to be used as a matter of course or in the circumstances referred to by the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas). The people of an area certainly will be able to vote for a relatively high-spending authority if they so choose. Because of the greater accountability which the new system will introduce, all the people of the area will be paying towards the cost of the spending of that authority and no doubt they will take that into account.<br/>
Nevertheless, there is a need for a reserve power to deal with the circumstances referred to by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh). There is a particular need for a reserve power during the transitional period in those areas where there will be a dual system running, with a combination of the rating system and the community charge and where accountability will not be as clear as we should like it to be when the system is fully in force. It is important that there should be such a reserve power&#x2014;rarely, if ever used we hope&#x2014;to protect the charge payers of an area against extreme cases of extravagant and irresponsible local authorities.<br/>
All the evidence shows that, when the Government have intervened to extend such protection to ratepayers under the existing system, that protection has been welcomed by the people who live in the local authority areas concerned. We saw some of the results of that protection to the residents of Ealing during the election last year.</p>

<p>How would the Minister respond to the fact that within three months of rate capping being levied in the city of Sheffield the Conservatives lost two seats in an area that they had previously held for 60 years? Is he aware that such a swing would ensure that if the hon.<br/>
Member of Sheffield, Hallam (Mr. Patnick) were standing for election on 5 May he would lose his seat on Sheffield city council?</p>

<p>We have to consider all the evidence. I do not suggest that it applies universally in all cases, but the evidence of the way in which people voted at the general election, when they had to decide between a Government who were prepared to extend that protection and a Government such as that who would be provided by the Labour party, which would abdicate all responsibility in those matters, shows that people have tended to vote, when they have had a real choice in those matters, for the party that would extend that protection.<br/>
The Labour party promised in its manifesto that it would no longer afford such protection and that it would let local authorities spend to their hearts' content. That is an extremely irresponsible attitude and an abdication of responsibility in an important area in which central Government have a role and should continue to have a role. Because we recognise the responsibilities of central Government to extend protection in those extreme circumstances in which it is necessary to intervene on behalf of local people we wish to keep a capping power in the legislation.</p>

<p>The one thing which the clause reveals is the Government's total lack of confidence in their own legislation. I have faced incredulity when I have explained to people as honestly as I can&#x2014;I have never been accused of not telling the truth about the Government's legislation &#x2014;that twice as many people would be involved in direct payment, and that the Government's reason is that those people have the vote and that more people will be forced to vote because they will get a bill. Part of the theory is that people will have to pay for the consequences of the vote.<br/>
I have explained all that, and I have then reminded people that when they have voted, knowing what the poll tax will be because the budget will be fixed before the election, and the party which wins has a higher poll tax perhaps because it wanted to spend more on nursery education&#x2014;or, in county council areas, on introducing concessionary bus passes for old age pensioners&#x2014;once the election is out of the way the Government can say, "Hang on. You have won the election and you were honest about the poll tax, but we do not like your poll tax and we are ging to use section 104 of the poll tax legislation to change it retrospectively." People just do not believe me when I tell them that, because it contradicts all that Minister have said about accountability and democracy. The arguments about universal accountability go straight out of the window.</p>

<p>No. The hon. Gentleman voted for the guillotine. We are to have a vote shortly.<br/>
The clause shows the Government's lack of confidence in their own legislation. If they were to replace the clause, they could get around the problem that they do not trust the electorate. In London and in the shires councils are elected for four years and they do not have to face their electorates annually. The answer is to replace the clause with annual elections. We would vote for that. There would not need to be a vote, as no hon. Member would


oppose such a measure. The Government could have on the nod a Bill for annual local elections all over the country.<br/>
That is Labour party policy. We have demanded it in the House and in Committee and we have published Bills, yet the Government are scared stiff to promote legislation for annual local elections. They would not even come to the House to force annual elections in metropolitan districts of the great cities such as Sheffield and Birmingham where in 1988&#x2013;89 there is a gap because of the abolition of the metropolitan councils. We want that gap closed and we want annual elections in those areas and for every local authority. That is the way to bring about accountability and democracy in local government, instead of undermining those on both sides of the political divide who go into public life to serve their fellow citizens.<br/>
What self-respecting person will go into local government knowing that all his decisions will affect only one quarter of local government expenditure after the Bill instead of one half before the Bill? Why should they bother when they know that, even for a quarter of local government spending, even if they fight an election and win, the Government can say, "We don't like your budget. Here is a new budget." They can do that not only in May or June after the election but in any month during the financial year. They can even come back the following January and retrospectively change the local authority budget for that year.<br/>
That is absolutely outrageous. It has nothing to do with democracy or accountability. It has everything to do with Whitehall Ministers saying that they know best and absolutely nothing to do with the arguments that they put forward. It is against that background that we are opposing this clause root and branch.<br/>
Local authorities are not, in the words of the Minister, spending any old money that they can get their hands on. They are spending money that they have raised, not Whitehall money. They put their budgets before the electorates and they won their elections on that basis. The Minister's argument that they have freedom to spend what they like is incorrect. Each one has to raise the money in advance of the elections, with a budget. That is honest and democratic. It is what accountability is about.</p>

<p>I beg to move amendment No. 223, in page 68, line 18, at end insert&#x2014;
<q>`( )In subsection 4 of section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972, for the words from "the product of a rate of 2p in the pound" to the end of the subsection there shall be substituted the following words&#x2014;</q>
<ol>
<li>"(a) &#x00A3;4 per inhabitant of the area, except those mentioned in subsections (b) and (c) below;</li>
<li>(b) &#x00A3;8 per inhabitant in the metropolitan counties;</li>
<li>(c) such a sum, not less than &#x00A3;8, as the Secretary of State shall by order prescribe for Greater London; or</li>
<li>(d) such other higher amounts as the Secretary of State may by order provide.".'.</li>
</ol>
Under the constraints of the guillotine, it is the agreed intention to spend only a few minutes on amendment No. 223 before we move to the major item under the guillotine relating to the Scottish business.<br/>
Amendment No. 223 is a further probe in respect of section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972. Effectively, that means discussing the issue of what we all understand to be the product of a penny rate. Local authorities can use the product of a penny rate for a variety of matters outside the normal remit of the legislation.<br/>
Obviously the product of a penny rate will have no significance once rateable values have disappeared and the poll tax is introduced. Therefore, amendment No. 223 refers to pounds per inhabitant of an area, whether they be in the metropolitan counties or the Greater London area. We really only want to press the Minister to discover whether the Government have given the matter any more

thought. In Committee the Government implied that they did not intend to abolish the concept completely, but obviously the product of the rate poundage would have no significance in future.<br/>
The issue is essentially important because local government uses section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972 in three ways. First, it is used for job creation. I understand that about 75 per cent. of section 137 money is used for economic development issues of various kinds. I do not have the time to go into that in detail.<br/>
Secondly, section 137 money is used to fund and assist the voluntary sector. That includes grants to citizens' advice bureaux, law centres and other bodies not covered by mainstream funding. That includes voluntary groups working on issues not related directly to the responsibility of local authorities, for example, local voluntary groups opposing projects&#x2014;although I have never heard of a local voluntary group "proposing" such projects&#x2014;such as the siting of a new airport or nuclear power station. Those groups may want to put a case at a public inquiry or lead a campaign.<br/>
Airport construction and nuclear power generation are not local government issues. However, it is possible for local authorities to assist voluntary groups in work related to those issues which are of crucial importance to the local communities.<br/>
5.45 pm<br/>
Thirdly, section 137 money is used valuably where one tier of local authority funds a voluntary group related to another tier of local government. I refer to the examples given in Committee in which a district council would fund work relating to social services or education projects. A district council in the shire areas would not deal with those matters because that would be a county council function.<br/>
Section 137 money is not a great deal of money in terms of local government expenditure. However, it gives discretion and a degree of flexibility. It enables parts of local government to help and cope with the unexpected. It assists innovation and variety at local government level. I sincerely hope that the Government will not try to impose a complete block on those aspects of local government. I hope that the Government will consider or accept amendment No. 223&#x2014;if they do accept it, I would probably fall through the floor&#x2014;because it would meet the thrust of the arguments. Indeed, both sides of the Committee shared an understanding of the arguments on these points.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will not say that the Government will leave this matter to another place. If Ministers are to be believed about the other place, the other place will not be able to touch the Bill as it relates to money. Therefore, the other place will not be able to cope with the replacement of section 137 effectively. Therefore, we must deal with section 137 in this House.</p>

<p>I support the amendment and the arguments put by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker). I remember the old days when we debated this matter in other Committees, on other Bills, in years past. The issue is the same. I have read what the Minister said in Committee.<br/>
The issue remains that local authorities should he given a greater amount of discretionary power within a small limit to raise the spend on things that they regard to he important locally. The hon. Member for Perry Barr


referred to citizens' advice bureaux. I visited Warwickshire a year or so ago. Warwickshire county was very keen to fund the increasingly important network of citizens' advice bureaux. It is the voluntary sector and voluntary services which most need the expansion of the tuppenny rate, as it is coloquially called.<br/>
The argument across the Floor of the House has concerned how much discretion local authorities should have. The Minister will know that some local authorities have reached their ceiling and are already committed. There are some good voluntary sector agencies whose requests have been turned down because there is no capacity to grant-fund them. The Minister will know also that the argument that extra money will be used only to fund lunatic and fringe activities is not supported by any evidence and that 67 per cent. of the total of section 137 money has been used for promoting economic development and employment. A substantial percentage was for legal, advisory and other welfare services.<br/>
All the indications are that one of the key areas that will need help if poll tax is to be enacted is that of money advice. With the increasing amount of debt that there is and the growing volume of difficulties into which people get, the services of the voluntary sector in particular will be needed in respect of consumer advice and financial counselling. Those are just examples of where discretionary powers will be necessary in local government.<br/>
The Minister has said that the Government will answer questions on that aspect when they know the result of the Widdicombe report. That report was promised early this year and is now overdue, and I should like to know when we shall be receiving it. If we had that information, I would be half happy. If we had that information plus a commitment either to accept this amendment or something similar, for one brief moment during the passage of this Bill there might even be some smiles on the Opposition Benches. I hope that the Minister will take this rare opportunity to find favour at a time when it seems that he and his colleagues on the Front Bench are increasingly unpopular and isolated, even among their own supporters.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="551178" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-04-25a.59.0" hansard_membership_id="2425" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2525" speakername="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr. Christopher Chope)" colnum="59" time="17:15:00">
<p>This amendment is unnecessary. It is not necessary to pass an amendment either in this House or in another place because the present basis of section 137 limits can continue until the introduction of the community charge. Following upon that, clause 122 will allow the Secretary of State to make regulations to change the reference in section 137 to the product of 2p in the pound to some other factor, as appropriate.<br/>
I have nothing to add to what was said by my hon. and learned Friend about the future of section 137 when we discussed the matter in Committee. He said then that the Government would announce their views in the light of the Widdicombe proposals and recommendations. I hope that it will not be too long before those announcements are made. When they are, we can discuss alongside section 137 powers the specific issue of local authority development activity and the other pertinent points raised during this short debate. I give way to my hon. Friend.</p>

<p>This amendment deals with a clause in the Bill that refers to statutory references to rating. It raises an important question relating to my own constituency of Stafford, with particular reference to an area named Knighton, which is governed by an Act of Parliament passed in 1660, when Charles II was on the throne.<br/>
The significance of that provision, in referring the application of section 137 in the context of clause 122, is this. Under the terms of the 1660 Act, residents of Knighton are not liable to rates, taxes, assessments or charges, whether passed by Acts of Parliament or otherwise. Furthermore, that provision was granted in good faith in 1660, in recognition of services rendered by the local inhabitants to Charles II.<br/>
It so happens that in 1927 Gnosall rural district council itself continued that exemption under the then Rating and Valuation Act 1925. Furthermore, and with specific reference to the General Rate Act 1967, to which reference is made in the statute in question, section 117 further continues the exemption for those constituents of mine. They comprise 31 occupiers, a pub, and a smithy. The pub is known as the Haberdasher's Arms. There is also a factory, together with&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>Since 1660, its inhabitants have been under no obligation to pay rates. I appreciate that we are under the guillotine, so I shall bring my remarks to a swift conclusion. It would be most unfortunate if the Henry VIII clause, normally used to revoke, amend or repeal an Act, should be used in this instance to remove an exemption that was granted in such express terms in 1660. I look to the Minister to continue the exemption for my constituents on the grounds that it was made in good faith and has been continued on numerous subsequent occasions. I ask my hon. Friend, when he replies, to give the assurance that I seek.</p>

<p>With the leave of the House, we accept the Minister's reply as far as it goes, but I recommend that all right hon. and hon. Members find time to read amendment No. 237, which relates to the speech that we have just heard and to the bunch of free-loaders in the constituency of the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Cash) who do not pay any rates. How do they benefit from the product of the tuppenny rate anyway, under section 137, if they are not paying rates? There is a point to be made here about accountability and democracy, but I shall not make it now &#x2014;otherwise I shall have my hon. Friends from Scotland down on me like a ton of bricks. I take it as being implicit in the Minister's reply that the same amount of money will be available under some equivalent form of procedure


when the poll tax is introduced as currently exists under section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972. That being the case, I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p>Most of the amendments in this group relate to registration issues, and, like the other Scottish amendments to the Bill, they fall into three broad categories. Some bring provisions in the Scottish Act into line with the equivalent provisions for England and Wales; some make minor and technical changes to the 1987 Act; and a few introduce new provisions.<br/>
Of the amendments in this group, two fall into the first category; that is, they bring the Scottish provisions into line with the equivalent English provisions. Amendment No. 95A gives registration officers power to make inquiries of individuals who are, have been or are about to be resident in their area.</p>

<p>The Minister talked about bringing the Scottish provision into line with the English provision.

<p>As the hon. Gentleman knows, my responsibilities in the context of the amendments relate to the Scottish provisions. I can only assume that my right hon. and hon. Friends who represent English constituencies and who are Ministers at the Department of the Environment have not come under the same pressure from local government practitioners.<br/>
Amendment No. 95A gives registration officers power to make inquiries of individuals who are, have been or are about to be resident in their area. At present, the basic source of information for registration officers is the canvass of responsible persons. It is clear, however, that at a certain stage in the canvass process, registration officers may wish to seek information direct from individuals&#x2014;for example, those who claim to be students or to be exempt &#x2014;and the amendment gives them power to do so. As the power will relate to identifiable individuals, it will not supplant the general canvass process but will be a useful supplement to it. A similar power is contained in paragraph 10 of schedule 2 as respects England and Wales.<br/>
Amendment No. 96 also falls&#x2014;or at least partly falls &#x2014;into this category. Among the amendments it makes to section 20 of the 1987 Act is an amendment to allow the Secretary of State to prescribe other persons who will he entitled to inspect the register. This power will be used to allow auditors to inspect the register in line with the equivalent provision for England and Wales. Amendment No. 96 also amends the part of section 20 which requires regional and islands councils to sell copies of the public part of the register.<br/>
A number of interests have objected to this requirement and have suggested that, if it is retained, provision should be made to allow individuals to request the removal of their name. Amendment No. 96 therefore replaces the relevant part of section 20 with a provision empowering the Secretary of State to make regulations providing whether, and on what terms. the public part of the register may be sold. It brings section 20 into line with the corresponding provision for England and Wales in paragraph 18 of schedule 2 to the Bill.<br/>
Three of the amendments in the group introduce what are effectively new provisions. Amendment No. 91 amends section 13 of the 1987 Act to make it clear that the register should not be divided into three parts, relating to the personal, standard and collective community charges respectively. If the register were organised in this way it would, at least arguably, feed through into the public part of the register and would thus completely negate our intention that it should not be possible to identify second homes from the register. A separate part would also make it easier to identify women's refuges, undermining the anonymity that we intend to achieve for them.<br/>
Amendment No. 93 amends section 15 of the 1987 Act to overcome difficulties which might otherwise arise in the case of deaths. As that section stands, registration officers are required to notify persons whose register entry is changed or deleted using a form prescribed for that purpose. The form addresses the registered person in the second person singular, and it would clearly he unfortunate if such forms were sent out bearing the names


of people who have died. Amendment No. 93 therefore amends section 15 to provide that in such circumstances the notification should be sent to the deceased's executors.<br/>
The last amendment in this category is amendment No. 95. It inserts into section 18 of the 1987 Act a new subsection, which provides that when a person dies his executors must notify the registration officer of the date of the death within one month. This will help to ensure that the register is kept up to date.</p>

<p>No; I am sorry. As the hon. Gentleman will know, the registration process has just started. Although in some regions it is quite well advanced and is proceeding smoothly, in others some of the information is not yet available.<br/>

<p>On a point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I know that we have a truncated debate, and I do not wish to detain any hon.

<p>Further to that point of order, Mr. Deputy Speaker. Substantial changes are being made under a guillotine. I shall respect your ruling.

<p>My hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) has made a very good point. This is a very short debate to cover many Government amendments that are both technical and important. I think that it would have been more sensible if the Minister had taken some time at least to say a word or two about the other amendments&#x2014;as we

must finish the debate by 7.30 pm&#x2014;or even for the amendments all to have been grouped together, so that we could have talked about all of them. Some of the others are also important, but there will be no time to debate them all.<br/>
I intend to keep my remarks relatively brief, because I am well aware of the shortness of time, and we want to get through as much as possible. I do not know about the Minister, but I spent considerable time during the past weeks canvassing in my constituency. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I know that the hon. Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro) never does that, but I do. I have found, on doorstep after doorstep, people who voted Tory even as late as June last year saying, "I shall never vote for that woman again." The major cause of that is, of course, the poll tax. Our canvass returns in Cathcart show Labour support 6 per cent. higher than it was in June last year, when the majority was increased from 4,000 to 11,000. That is why the Government are doing so badly. I say to English Conservative Members loud and clear: if they want to experience the same thing as their Scottish colleagues did in June last year, let them continue to vote for this legislation.</p>

<p>I should be delighted to read it, if my hon. Friend lets me have a copy.<br/>
The Minister and I both spoke at the rating and valuation conference in Dunblane last Friday. He did not impress the experts, the people who must put the system into practice, by arriving at 11.30, speaking for 20 minutes and leaving to do a press conference. He did not answer a single question that the experts wanted to ask. Those experts said loud and clear to me that they will keep all their valuation rolls for domestic properties because their view is that the tax will collapse in a matter of years and the Government will have to return to the rating system.</p>

<p>None of them did. Equally, every single one was opposed to the concept of a non-payment campaign.<br/>
One thing which the Minister said, which is important in regard to the amendments, was:
<q>It is our clear intention that no change made to the Bill should prejudice the timetable for the introduction of the new system in Scotland.</q>
When the hon. Gentleman spoke to the press later, he said:
<q>Our legislation is through. It would not upset the timetable for Scotland. The driving force is to abolish the discredited and grossly unfair rating system and we are determined to bring early relief to domestic ratepayers in Scotland. That is what the change is all about.</q>
That is a major shift in Scottish Office thinking. Until now, the Secretary of State has made it abundantly clear that if there are any major changes in the English legislation, inevitably it will mean the holding back or withdrawal and repeal of the Scottish legislation. [HON. MEMBERS: "No."] Oh yes. That is what the Secretary of State has said time and again.</p>

<p>That is not what the Minister is quoted as saying. He said:
<q>It is our clear intention that no change made to the Bill should prejudice the timetable".</q>
That is astonishing. Are they saying that if the Bill is defeated on Third Reading tonight&#x2014;it may be a remote possibility, but it is not impossible&#x2014;the Scottish Act will go ahead? If the other place amends the Bill, as the House came close to doing on Monday last week, will the Government say that they will still press ahead with the Scottish legislation, despite such a major change in the English Bill? If so, that is a direct contradiction and a major shift in the view of the Scottish Office and its Ministers.<br/>
The amendments are about registration. As the registration process is taking place in Scotland, chaos is developing. Repressive measures are having to be used &#x2014;I say that advisedly&#x2014;by registration officers to try to get the information. Jack Woods, the registration officer for Strathclyde, made it clear that he had to use postcards giving people three days to return the information because, if he did not, it would have been impossible to obtain the information in time to complete the register by October this year. He is having to use means which, if legal, are not strictly within the spirit of how the process should be carried out.<br/>
The amendments try to tighten up further the registration procedure, to try to make sure, if at all possible, that nobody dodges the tax.</p>

<p>The hon. Gentleman nods. Every time that is done, the expense increases and the return decreases because every time one pushes up the expense of registration one gets a smaller return.<br/>
Many people in Strathclyde are returning their forms, not just because we are asking them to and saying that that is what they should do. My hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) referred to the date of birth. Many people ask why on earth they should give that information and why they should provide information that is not required under the English Bill. What absolute guarantee can the Minister give that the information of the date of birth will be kept secret and not be made available to a much wider public? We must deal with the registration procedure.<br/>
The amendments are bizarre and threatening. For example, amendment No. 95 deals with what happens when someone dies. That is right. It is amazing that when we went through the Committee on the Scottish Bill Ministers forgot that people died. Ministers did not remember that and did nothing about it.</p>

<p>It was not my responsibility to ensure that the Bill was correct. It was the hon. Gentleman's responsibility. [NON. MEMBERS: "No."] I am sorry, I take that back. Of course, it was not the Minister's direct responsibility; it was the responsibility of one Michael Ancram, who pushed the Bill through. We all know what happened to him.<br/>
It is important to know whether there will be penalties if the executor does not inform the registration officer that someone has died. In my constituency, for example. a husband who has been unemployed for the past 20 years may die. The couple may have no property except the contents of the House. An executor will not be appointed. The widow is left with the responsibility to ensure that arrangements are made&#x2014;an executor will not do it. It is she who has to arrange the funeral and go through all the procedures; she will be the executor in fact, if not in law. Will she have to return the forms and make sure that she sends back the information within a month? If she does not, will she suffer a &#x00A3;50 fine, on top of all the other things that she is suffering? That would be absurd.<br/>
Through the amendments, the Government are seeking further information. It is not clear from the amendments whether this is the case, but the Minister said at Dunblane that under the new system DHSS payments are now subject to court orders and local authorities will be able to seek deductions from DHSS payments. The Minister also said that the DHSS will be able to provide information to registration officers. If someone seeks income support, he will be given a form to claim a rebate on his poll tax, but he will be informed that if he does not send in the form the DHSS will inform the registration officer accordingly. That is a breach of the commitment given by Michael Ancram in the Committee on the Scottish Bill, that DHSS records would not be available for the registration process. He said that time and again in Committee. We have yet another breach of the rules as Ministers realise that they are having more problems with the tax and that they are in difficulties.<br/>
Visiting service men are now to be exempt. I do not know what that will mean in Argyll. I do not know how much American service men living in Dunoon pay in rates on houses that they rent or own. If they rent or own their houses, presumably they pay rates. Now they are to be exempt. I assume that if the service man is married to a Scots girl she will be exempt too. As I understand it, a spouse will be exempt as well. That makes some sense, but there is something obscence about well-paid American service men and well-paid diplomats living in Scotland &#x2014;I do not know whether the consuls are in the same position&#x2014;being exempt from the poll tax when the Government intend to impose the tax upon the mildly mentally handicapped, the severely physically handicapped, the old, the unemployed, the ill and the sick.</p>

<p>Does my hon.

<p>My hon. Friend is right. The Government are making nonsense of the argument that the tax is about ensuring that anyone who makes use of local services should pay something towards them. An American service man living in Dunoon will make use of local services, perhaps the full range of such services. However, he will not have to pay the poll tax. The Government are in a considerable mess.<br/>
I shall quote what the Secretary of State for the Environment said about the unified business rate on Thursday of last week. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) raised the matter in the same debate. The right hon. Gentleman said:
<q>Scotland will move towards a unified business rate at the English rate poundage after rateable values have been harmonised. No changes to the Bill are proposed, because it is unclear how fast harmonisation can proceed."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 21 April 1988; Vol. 131, c. 1026.]</q>
As I understand it, we do not have any legislation for the introduction of a uniform business rate in Scotland. Perhaps some of the technical amendments before us will make the necessary legislative provision. I should think that separate legislation will be required. Is the Secretary of State for the Environment telling us something that we in Scotland do not know, or is he just plain ignorant?</p>

<p>My hon. Friend is making a valuable point, but what the Secretary of State said to me was much more specific:
<q>The idea is that the rateable value bases of the two countries should be brought entirely in line as soon as possible so that there is no distortion between arrangements in England and Scotland."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 21 April 1988; Vol. 131, c. 1025.]</q></p>

<p>Perhaps I can help the hon. Gentleman in a small way. There may be other changes that will require legislation but that will not be necessary when it comes to valuation practice. The hon. Gentleman may not realise that the Inland Revenue has different practices for the decapitalisation rate for different types of hereditament. It is that area in which harmonisation is required, where valuation opinion is involved. That would be likely to benefit Scotland.</p>

<p>Now that the hon. Gentleman has resumed his place, I shall inform him of his ignorance. Valuations in Scotland are not carried out by the Inland Revenue. Separate legislation would be required to make properties in Scotland liable to valuation by the Inland Revenue. We need to know from the Minister exactly what is going on.<br/>
The poll tax is obscene and it is not wanted in Scotland. The time has come for the Government to withdraw their proposals, even for their own political good. If they fail to withdraw the legislation that will apply in Scotland, there will be no Conservative Members representing seats in Scotland after the next general election.</p>

<p>The comments of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) about the anomalies in the valuations of non-domestic properties in Scotland are interesting and astonishing. He must know that hon. Members on both sides of the House have introduced private Members' Bills to eradicate anomalies between the Scottish and English valuation systems. Caravans and reed beds, for example, may ring some bells for the hon. Gentleman. The bringing into line of the two rating and

valuation systems is long overdue. The distortions have worked substantially to Scotland's disadvantage, and that is something we should never forget.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cathcart talked about visiting service men and I expect that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State will take up his remarks. I understand that the hon. Gentleman was referring to visiting service men who take up rented accommodation. The owners of such properties will have to register them under the legislation. That applies also to second homes, for example. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will agree with me that visiting service men should not broaden our elections. I hope also that he will agree that service men should make their contribution, as they have in the past. Military bases have had their own system for ensuring that that happens.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cathcart told us that he has been canvassing in his constituency. It will come as no surprise to him that he is not the only one who has chosen to go out knocking on doors. He is not the only one who has been canvassing.</p>

<p>I happened to suffer some injuries to my eyes over the weekend. I find that the more sensitive hon. Members are sympathetic to anyone with such problems. The less sympathetic and understanding usually find it amusing when someone suffers such injuries. I leave Labour Members to decide which cap fits them.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cathcart has told us that he has done some canvassing. As I have said, I have been canvassing in my constituency. Over the weekend, I spoke to Health Service managers in Edinburgh and to the Association of School Meals Organisers at its annual conference on Saturday. I went through the community charge proposals in some detail with both bodies because I knew that they were interested in them. The hon. Member for Cathcart will be surprised to hear that in the main they were responsive to the Government's position and attitude. Indeed, they were constructively helpful and responsive. The gentleman who replied to my speech and thanked me at the conference of the Association of School Meals Organisers said that he was one of the converts. I found that interesting.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cathcart has said that his constituents are saying that they will never again vote for the Conservative party. I did not expect to be received favourably at the association's conference. Indeed, I expected to have to defend the Government's policy on these matters, including the amendments that we are discussing. I was pleasantly surprised when there was a warm response and a positive reaction to what I had to say in going into detail on the community charge. It is the misinformation about the Bill that is causing the public to be concerned. When one deals with facts, one should present them as they are.<br/>
This morning, I received a letter from some individuals who said that they had never voted Conservative, but, having had the opportunity to hear me speak and to study in detail the booklet that the Government sent out, they now believe that the Conservative party is the only party bringing forward sensible proposals in respect of local


government finance. That is why the amendments, particularly those in respect of registration and other matters that require tightening up, are before the House.<br/>
Of course, there were problems with deceased individuals being notified. Whoever the dependants may be, they have other sensitive matters to deal with. As everyone knows, a bereaved person has many difficult and sensitive matters to deal with. In most instances bereaved people are assisted by relatives and others. It normally falls to someone else to carry out such activities. That will become the norm in respect of many things that must be done. We all know that, at some time or other, our parents will be deceased, and we must deal with the matters that must be dealt with. It is nonsense to suggest that, somehow, there is something different about this matter.<br/>
I welcome the amendments. They will help to tidy the Bill and will make it easier for people such as myself, who have been out positively canvassing the benefits, also to explain what will happen.</p>

<p>I, too, regret that we are faced with all these amendments and, once again, are not allowed sufficient time properly to debate them. Some amendments, such as No. 95A, refer to obtaining information. As we know, preparation for the poll tax has been under way in Scotland for some time. Forms are dropping through people's doors throughout the country. I should have thought that the alarm and, indeed, the chaos that seem to be threatening would be a warning to England and Wales.<br/>
What I could most usefully do is to read a letter that I recently received. It is one of many such letters to registration offices from various people in my constituency. One gentleman states:
<q>Firstly I have never signed to promise money without knowing the figure involved. I appreciate that you cannot know the exact figure but an estimate to the nearest &#x00A3;20 would suffice.</q>
That gentleman strongly objects to putting his signature to a hit of paper, promising money when he does not know how much will be involved. He went on:
<q>Secondly, although I may be a responsible person under the terms of the the Act, one can only be responsible for oneself. I cannot be responsible for any information regarding names and dates of birth of any additional occupants of the above address.</q>
An awful lot of people are objecting on such grounds. That gentleman objects also on the ground of fairness. As hon. Members will probably realise, that constituent lives on an island. He does not see why he should pay the same as a resident in a town,
<q>when I have neither street lighting nor a footpath in front of my house, have no access to recreation and leisure facilities and suffer the obvious penalties of living on an island.</q>
<i>[Interruption.]</i> He was not forced to live on that island &#x2014;he was born and brought up there. His parents before him and his grandparents before them lived there. I shall never accept the argument that, if one does not want to take on the penalties of living on an island, one should get out or not go there in the first place.<br/>
It was interesting to see the registration form that was delivered to my house at the weekend. At the top, it states:
<q>A responsible person can be required to provide information, but being a responsible person does not make that person liable to pay a community charge on behalf of any other person.</q>

That is misleading. Often, those who are designated as responsible are husbands or wives. Most often, it is the husband, because, in the past, they have been the ratepayers. The form does not make it clear that a husband could be responsible for his wife's poll tax if she is not an earner. Registration officers must examine and solve that problem.<br/>
Going back to amendment No. 95A relating to obtaining information, an article on the fairness of the poll tax in this week's editon of <i>The Observer</i> was particularly instructive. It stated that, when canvassers tried to obtain information from council estates, they were sent packing. In fact, the only welcoming ports of call for poll tax canvassers were those that had BMWs in their drives or, perhaps, had double-glazed windows.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will examine, albeit briefly, amendment No. 81, which refers to visiting forces. It is causing some concern, particularly to my council in Argyll and Bute. I hope that he will be able to tell us what the consequences will be for visiting forces and their wives. Clause 128 refers to people who have relevant associations with members of visiting forces. Who are such persons? Does it mean that the wives of men in visiting forces are not to pay the poll tax? If so, all the girls in Dunoon may rush off to marry United States naval chaps.</p>

What will happen if a United States naval officer is posted back to the United States and his wife and children must stay in Dunoon? Will they continue not to pay the poll tax? I am not clear about the consequences, and I shall be glad if the Minister will say a word on the matter.<br/>
Unfortunately, nothing in the amendments does anything to ease the additional burden that has been heaped on church and crofting communities. Because of the inequity of the poll tax, the Government have lost the argument. That inequity will never be forgotten&#x2014;certainly in Scotland.</p>

<p>I welcome the amendments, just as the House should welcome them. They refine and improve the legislation. Anything that does that to any measure going through the House of Commons should be welcomed in the interests of the people in this country. I advise the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) that the explanatory notes on the form that I received clearly show what the figure will be &#x2014;&#x00A3;210. I am surprised that her local authority has not given her constituent the same valuable information. Some Opposition Members have been shouting about &#x00A3;300 and &#x00A3;400 in my part of the world. That shows just how they have gone out of their way to mislead the population about the community charge. As has been said, it is most unfair and unreasonable of Members of Parliament, and candidates in the election, to cause alarm and despondency by quoting figures which are way out of proportion to what they will be in a year's time.</p>

<p>I have just given the hon. Lady the average figure in Dumfries and Galloway, as quoted by the regional council and the local government information leaflet published last week. That was &#x00A3;210 for Dumfries


and Galloway and for the districts therein. That is as accurate as can be ascertained at present. <i>[Interruption.]</i> If the hon. Lady laughs about that, she had better stick to her own district and not interfere with other people's.<br/>
I believe that the wishful thinking of the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), that this important Bill might be in jeopardy at Third Reading, is totally without any foundation. He will discover that shortly. If that is so, then the legislation will proceed in any event in Scotland. I am glad that the regional authorities are making such important steps towards collecting the information as required by the Act, and proceeding with all pace to carry out the procedure satisfactorily. I wonder what the policies of the various parties opposite&#x2014;including the Scottish National party, the Labour party and every Tom, Dick and Harry&#x2014;are to the implementation of the community charge. Some hon. Members say, "Take illegal action"; others say, "Take legal action."<br/>
The general public is thoroughly muddled by the deliberate attempt by Opposition Members to make life as difficult as possible for the people of Scotland, when they should be assisting them to introduce a scheme that is much fairer to all the people in Scotland. They certainly believe that in Scotland.<br/>
It is fascinating that, when I have been knocking on doors, in which I suspect I have been more effective than the hon. Member for Cathcart, I have found a very different response. Hon. Members opposite also fail to explain during their tours of their constituencies the very effective rebate system which is so important to the community charge. Once people understand that rebates operate on a sliding scale, going up to 80 per cent., and perhaps beyond for those on very low incomes, they will begin to realise that the rebate system is a valuable and important one</p>

<p>I hope that the four English Conservative Back Benchers who have stayed to listen to this debate, and who, perhaps, are "beginning to understand" the full implications of this legislation, will find the Scottish debate instructive.<br/>
We have reached a fine pitch in the poll tax debate as it applies to Scotland&#x2014;a fine pitch of argument and also a fine pitch of absurdity, which is reflected in some of the amendments that the Government are proposing.<br/>
Amendment No. 92, for example, substitutes "registered person" for the phrase
<q>person whose name is entered in the register".</q>

In amendment No. 97, "registered person" is defined as someone
<q>who is registered in the register".</q>
That was an amendment crying out to be tabled!<br/>
The Minister has already given us an insight into the only two certainties of life, which are death and taxes. Amendment No. 95 contains what must be the Government's major and generous concession in the Scottish legislation. The Minister releases dead people from the responsibility of telling the registration officer that they have died. That responsibility is placed on the executors. If the Minister is concerned about the feelings of the relatives of the deceased, will he say how many deceased people have received, as responsible people, a registration form, because of the use of the electoral roll? If the Minister is so concerned with the feelings of relatives, perhaps he will try to estimate how many such forms have been distributed and what the Government propose to do about it.<br/>
6.45 pm<br/>
There are a number of other serious matters in these amendments. Amendment No. 95A, for example, extends the list of people to whom the registration officer can elicit information to anyone
<q>whom he reasonably believes is, has been or is about to be resident in the registration area.</q>
How can a registration officer know who is "about to be" registered in his area? The only source of information is other registration officers in Scotland, who have supplied him with the names of people who are leaving their registration areas. We have to square that with the question on page 10 of this multi-coloured brochure "You and the Community Charge" from the "Ministry of Truth":
<q>Will it be a national register?</q>
The answer was<br/>
"No."<br/>
There will not be a national register for the poll tax only &#x2014;in the same way as there was not a national police force during the miners' strike. There will certainly be shared information and the exchange of information between registration officers. That is clearly implied within the amendments.<br/>
In amendment No. 96, we see another breach of civil liberties in the legislation. That extends the list of people who can seek information from the register:
<q>any such other person as may be prescribed shall be entitled to inspect the register to such extent and for such purposes as may be prescribed".</q>
In other words, an extension of those who are allowed to inspect the full poll tax register.<br/>
The original legislation detailed that the assessor and the electoral registration officer would have that entitlement. This amendment is a major extension of those who are going to be allowed to look at the full register. The hon. Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes) asked the Minister why date of birth information was required in the Scottish legislation. We have the answer in this amendment. It is that, within a fairly short period, the poll tax number, including the date of birth information, will be the "passport", without which a member of the public will not receive, or be able to receive, access to any entitlement of right of any state service. The lie to the Government's position on the matter is given in that amendment, with the extension of those who can look at the full poll tax register.<br/>
We are debating the Scottish amendments at the fag end of the English legislation. As several hon. Members have said, it will mean that many important amendments receive no discussion at all this evening. I doubt very seriously whether the 38 officers and gentlemen who revolted last Monday night are going to revolt on these Scottish amendments. Of those 38 hon. Members, no fewer than 30 voted for the Scottish poll tax in the last Parliament. Indeed, two other hon. Members were not in the Parliament. These amendments will not be decided by Scottish Members, 63 of whom are now opposed to the poll tax. These amendments will be decided by the English Members who are not even present in this Chamber to hear the arguments. The revolt of the officers and gentlemen makes it clear that English Members of Parliament vote blind on Scottish legislation. We are seeing yet another example of that this evening.<br/>
The anger in Scotland, I should tell the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton), is expressed not just in terms of opposition to the poll tax but takes in no less than 71 per cent. of the supporters of the Labour party who wish to go further. According to an opinion poll last month, 71 per cent. wanted a campaign of non-payment, in line with 78 per cent. of the supporters of my party, a majority of the supporters of the Democrats and even 20 per cent. of the supporters of the Conservative party. They all wanted a campaign of non-payment.</p>

<p>If the Scottish National party is so keen on a campaign of non-payment, why is Angus district council assuming a policy that payment and registration should be carried out? Will the hon.

<p>I am slightly surprised that the hon.

<p>If the hon.

They will stand shoulder to shoulder with many people in Scotland who cannot and will not pay. That is the point behind the mass campaign of non-payment.<br/>
In conclusion, when English Conservative Members do not even attend Scottish debates, vote blind on Scottish legislation and ram issues such as the poll tax down the throats of the Scottish people against the wishes of the vast majority of Scottish Members, it is little wonder that there is the level of resentment and anger in Scotland that will sustain a mass campaign of non-payment. There can be no more eloquent testimony to the need for a Scottish parliament than the circumstances and the decision of this evening's vote.</p>

<p>The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) might reflect that many of the Labour Members who served on the Standing Committee that considered the Bill were from Scotland. We commented on that at the time. Indeed, we welcomed the interest that they were taking in what is predominantly an English Bill, which affects Scotland only peripherally. It is a little disappointing that only one of the Scottish Labour Members who served on the Standing Committee is participating in this debate. Perhaps that reflects the interest of Scottish Labour Members in the legislation.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) chastised me when I intervened to say that I am ignorant of Scottish affairs. I assumed that valuations in Scotland were carried out by the Inland Revenue, whereas, as he correctly pointed out, they are carried out by the local government valuers. However, the principle of what I was saying&#x2014;that valuation practice does not require legislation&#x2014;is absolutely correct. The hon. Gentleman would do well to reflect that properties that are valued according to the contractors' test, such as extractive industries and large-scale petrochemical industries&#x2014;many of which are important to Scottish industry&#x2014;operate at a disadvantage compared with their competitors in England, which have a decapitalisation rate that is a good deal more favourable.<br/>
My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has said that he thinks that that is an anomaly which should be corrected and that he is considering how best it should be corrected. He has suggested that we might have an automatic mechanism for adjusting the decapitalisation rate which might require an amendment. I would have thought that that should be welcomed by Opposition Members. It is something of which the hon. Member for Cathcart would have been aware if he had taken the trouble to read the <i>Hansard</i> of the Committee proceedings.</p>

<p>The reason why my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) is absent is simple. He is serving on a Committee. I do not know the reason for the absence of my hon. Friend the Member for Dumbarton (Mr. McFall), but, knowing his strong commitment to getting a lot done in this place, I can only assume that it is a good reason. It was unreasonable of the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) to assume that there is an inadequate reason for their absence.<br/>
I shall raise two points briefly, as other hon. Members wish to speak. We heard earlier from the Minister that people in Scotland are required to give their date of birth to the poll tax canvasser because the Government received representations on that in Scotland. When pressed on that point, we were told that the local government body that called for that was the Rating and Valuation Association. The people of Scotland will be amazed to learn that, in


spite of their strength of feeling and their vehement opposition to the measure requiring their birth date, they are getting it because of the wishes of a body of which the vast majority have probably never heard. I should add that the Rating and Valuation Association has conducted itself in a most responsible fashion by explaining clearly to people all along what the legislation is about and why it should not be brought into force. It is incredible&#x2014;it will certainly be noticed with anger in Scotland&#x2014;that that is the best reason that the Government can produce for enforcing the date of birth requirement on the Scottish population.<br/>
The main reason why I wish to speak is that only this weekend I discovered that in my constituency a poll tax canvasser had knocked on the door of a mentally handicapped person on Friday night. That man has lived all his life until recently in institutions and has managed to live alone and independently only recently, in a small flat in my constituency. He can do so only with the support of local social workers who give him advice on his budget. He lives in a block of flats in which other people are similarly placed. Many cannot read or write with any fluency, yet the poll tax canvasser went round on Friday night, handed over the poll tax form and said that she would be back on Monday. When the man, who was alert enough to have been taking in information from the television, said that he knew that he had 21 days in which to return the form, he got the reply that he had better return the poll tax form on Monday or he would be liable to be fined.<br/>
I should add that that man is able to work at a relatively undemanding job, with low pay of about &#x00A3;67 per week. He is on housing benefit, which is about to be cut heavily. At the moment it is uncertain what housing benefit he will end up with. However, it seems pretty certain that he will be liable to pay the full poll tax, considering that last week we learned that a single man with a take-home pay as low as &#x00A3;53 per week would be liable to pay the poll tax.<br/>
Since this sort of thing is happening in Strathclyde, we must assume that it could be happening elsewhere in Scotland right now and that there are dangers of its happening throughout England and Wales when registration begins there. As the Secretary of State has evidently not yet taken any steps to ensure that poll tax canvassing is carried out with some sensitivity, is it not reasonable to say that before people go around knocking on doors, they should at least find out in advance where people such as I have described are living, so that they can be approached far more sensitively than has been described? What training does the Minister propose shall be given to poll tax canvassers? What information will he ensure that they are given? People are being misinformed about their rights in the most aggressive manner. It is important that the Minister takes up this issue without any further delay.</p>

<p>Like my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries (Sir H. Monro), I support the amendments.<br/>
It is important to deal with the allegation made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) that the Government have changed their position. He did not produce any exact quotations of my right hon. and learned

Friend the Secretary of State to back up that allegation. As I understand it, the Government's position has been clear and unchanged throughout. It has been that, obviously, there might need to be detailed changes in this Bill to apply to the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987 because of changes that have been agreed to the legislation south of the border, but that that would not change the timetable. The Government have always made it clear that detailed changes such as the amendments entail might have to be introduced without changing the timetable.<br/>

<p>I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's confirmation that SNP Members of this Parliament will under no circumstances pay the community charge, so they will subject themselves to the inevitable penalties of the law. We shall see in due course. In the past, that question has been ducked by SNP leaders.<br/>
The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) raised an important point which my hon. Friend the Minister may wish to comment on if he is successful in catching your eye at the end of the debate, Madam Deputy Speaker. I have found a continuing confusion about the difference between the responsibility for filling in the form and the responsibility for paying the community charge. All hon. Members know what the position is, because we have been following the legislation. but it is important that people know what their joint and several liability is in relation to their spouse, and that their liability does not extend to other members of the household. A man came to my surgery, critical of the community charge, but when I explained that he did not have to pay for all his teenage children over 18, he was immediately transformed into a supporter. He left with the words, "That will get them out of the house a bit quicker."<br/>
The hon. Lady also said that people did not know what their community charge would be. Obviously, it is not known what the precise community charge will be, but I would have thought that we do know what it will be within &#x00A3;20, as she asked. The figure for Eastwood on the latest calculations is &#x00A3;264.<br/>
A disinformation campaign is continuing in significant parts of Scotland, and I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will not underestimate it. People who are not necessarily heavily involved and do not necessarily have


sources of advice easily available are particularly vulnerable to the disinformation which is being supported implicitly and explicitly by some hon. Members.</p>

<p>I never thought that I would find myself in agreement with the hon.

<p>I have been happy to sit and listen to my hon. Friends make powerful and persuasive arguments against all aspects of the Bill. But I am glad to have an opportunity to speak now, because last Thursday I was speaking at a public meeting in Cumnock town hall, where every seat was taken. It was a packed meeting, the like of which I have not seen since the miners' strike. Almost unanimously, those present wanted us to oppose and obstruct the process of registration by every legal means. They objected strongly to, and rejected SNP suggestions of, non-payment. In particular, one person remembered being pushed into a rent strike by SNP personnel and that the people who had been pushing had paid their rents, leaving the rest high and dry.</p>

<p>It is about time that the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues started attacking the real enemy, the Tories, instead of spending hour upon hour attacking the Labour party.

The other point that became clear at the meeting was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). In several areas registration officers are intimidating, threatening and harassing all sorts of people to return the forms within three days, and it is implied that if they do not a &#x00A3;50 penalty will come into force.</p>

The Minister should be careful and he should have a wee word with Mr. John Brewis about what it is like to be the ex-hon. Member for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale. Protest meetings are not only taking place in places such as Cumnock town hall. Let us consider what <i>The Galloway Gazette</i> said on Saturday 23 April. The headline ran:
<q>Larger hall needed as 200 turn out to Poll Tax 'Stop It' campaign meeting".</q>
That meeting took place in the Minister's constituency. Mr. Dangerfield, a Stranraer solicitor, chaired the meeting &#x2014;he does not sound like a Labour supporter to me&#x2014;and he is reported as saying:
<q>the way Tory voters who will benefit from the Community Charge had still opposed the legislation 'makes me proud to be Scottish'".</q>
He quoted from the Tory Reform Group&#x2014;I think that the Secretary of State used to be a member of that; Michael Ancram was. Mr. Dangerfield quoted from the Tory Reform Group pamphlet that said:
<q>Poll tax is fair only in the sense that the Black Death was fair&#x2014;it is indiscriminate.</q>
We did not say that, the Tories did. Mr. Dangerfield quoted those words in Stranraer&#x2014;part of the Minister's constituency&#x2014;at the packed meeting. <i>The Galloway Gazette</i> also reported that:
<q>Rev. Thomson said that his worry about the Poll Tax was both as a parish minister and as an individual &#x2026; Mr. Thomson said that people had to find 'any ways we can to help at a local level, to try to bring home to the Government our concern'.</q></p>

<p>I am grateful for that timely prompt from my hon. Friend. The writing was on the wall for all those people who served on the Scottish poll tax Bill Committee and the same will be true of the Minister.<br/>
The leader in <i>The Galloway Gazette</i> says:

If <i>The Galloway Gazette</i> is now calling for time to think again it must be time for the Minister to shake in his shoes.<br/>
At the meeting held in Cumnock town hall the feeling that came through loud arid clear was that we must obstruct and oppose registration by every legal means. That is what the "Stop It" campaign has said, that is what the Labour party says and I believe that is what the Scottish Social and Liberal Democrats&#x2014;what a mouthful &#x2014;are saying.

<p>I find myself agreeing with the hon. Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) and, since that is a dangerous position to be in, I shall return to the theme of my speech.<br/>
Over the weekend I got my poll tax registration form and I have already amassed a whole series of questions to put to the registration officer before I can even contemplate filling it out. Who is the responsible person in my household? <i>[Interruption.]</i> Apart from the person to whom it is addressed&#x2014;myself&#x2014;my wife and indeed my mother are also in the household. I have already told the Minister that that lady strongly objects to that part of the registration form where she must put her date of birth&#x2014; there is no conceivable reason for that. As Members of Parliament we have a legitimate question&#x2014;given that we also have to live down here&#x2014;regarding which is our main residence. That is not clear on the form. I have a young son of 17 who is currently in the middle of examinations. How do I know whether or where he will be a student during the course of the next financial year? I cannot answer that question, but that is just the beginning regarding the questions that need to be answered.<br/>
7.15 pm<br/>
Many of the officers who have been asked to administer the registration say that it is becoming an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare. The Secretary of State for the Environment has already said that the poll tax will cost twice as much as the rates to administer&#x2014;other estimates say that it will cost three times as much. The way things are going I believe that it will cost more than three times as much to raise exactly the same amount of money. Surely that is crazy.</p>

<p>Earlier on we needed clairvoyance to predict debts, now we need spirits to complete the form. My hon. Friend, in his usual eloquent and humorous way, has illustrated one of the many, manifest ridiculous aspects of the poll tax form.<br/>
The message that comes across loud and clear is that we must obstruct the poll tax. We are organising the obstruction campaign because we are convinced that sensible members of the House of Lords&#x2014;we have already heard from Lord St. John of Fawsley&#x2014;will throw out the legislation. We in Scotland must delay the implementation of the poll tax until it is defeated, if not in this Chamber, in the other place. We shall then hold the Secretary of State for Scotland to his promise, that if the legislation does not go through for England it will be scrapped for Scotland. In answer to the hon. Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart), that is what the Secretary of State said and that is on record.<br/>
The poll tax is unfair and unworkable. In Scotland we shall do everything we can to obstruct it. We shall do

everything we can to obstruct it for England in the House of Commons. We shall do everything we can to make sure that it never sees the light of day.</p>

<p>I have sat through almost all of the five days of consideration of the English Bill. It is curious that here, in the Scottish debate, it is as though the seasons are rather more advanced than they are south of the border. The English have got as far as the early spring; we are approaching high summer because we know more about the proposals.<br/>
The tragedy of all this is that the House of Commons is not being allowed to do its proper job because we are under the guillotine. If we were not under the guillotine the Bill would have what Enoch Powell, on another memorable occasion, called "the smell of death" about it. It would have been half way to destruction because of the kind of ribaldry to which it has been subjected by my hon. Friend the Member for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley (Mr. Foulkes). My hon. Friend has, quite properly, made a joke of many things, but they are serious points. They are creepy crawly things that are coming out from under the stones.<br/>
The trouble is that it was very difficult to interest the Scots in the first place. It was even more difficult to interest the English. During the last election campaign&#x2014;I hope that I am forgiven one personal reminiscence&#x2014;I was in the Hyndburn constituency visiting proud Accrington. I was rebuked by the Labour candidate for spending 10 minutes of my speech on the poll tax. We have come some way since then.<br/>
As is my wont during English debates, I wish to ask some questions. The first was also asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe). What has been said to those people who will receive 40p for each completed form? There is far more than anecdotal evidence that some of them are behaving roughly, and notices going up saying "Judas" are very unpleasant. We must ask whether it is worth the candle. Under what instructions and guidelines are they operating and what have they been told by the Government? Some of us believe that they may be exceeding what they have been told to do.<br/>
Secondly, in the debate late last Wednesday on joint liability, in which my hon. Friend the Member for Maryhill and other colleagues participated, we heard that even in England, which is a year behind us, people are deciding not to ask their grandmothers, their great aunts and others to live in the family home but are deciding that they should go elsewhere. All of us will have heard personal cases from our constituents. I do not wish to exaggerate the position because I do not believe that there has been much chucking-out of people, but in some cases the decision has been made not to take them in.<br/>
What have the Government done about that? I want the Minister to tell us whether the Scottish Office is monitoring the position. There is no evidence that it is taking into account matters such as the variation in need.<br/>
If the Bill goes ahead, many worthwhile people of all parties, not least the Conservative party, who would have gone into local government will have second thoughts. It may not be worth the candle to become a councillor. It is an honourable profession now, but in the future it may be rather different, and our country will be the poorer.</p>

<p>Whether the hon. Gentleman said that or whether he used the word "defeated", his purpose was clear from his reference to my former colleague in the House.<br/>
The hon. Member for Glasgow, Cathcart (Mr. Maxton) said that he had wanted to debate several other amendments. I should have been happy to debate them, and we have managed to debate some of the points in those other amendments. The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Glasgow, Maryhill (Mrs. Fyfe) referred to the use of postcards by Strathclyde community charge registration officer. The hon. Lady mentioned the alleged intimidation of a mentally handicapped person in her constituency. She will appreciate that I cannot comment on the case without knowing all the details, but I can say that intimidation has no part in the procedure.<br/>
The procedures adopted by the Strathclyde community charge registration officer were examined carefully in a recent court case brought by the hon. Member for Paisley, North (Mr. Adams). He was turned down on all four counts, and the sheriff found that the procedures being used were "convenient, sensible and practical". The postcard in question makes it clear that if there is a difficulty with the form, the canvasser will help in its completion.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cathcart and the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas) asked about the penalty on executors who fail to notify a death. The civil penalties in the 1987 Act do not apply to this provision. There is no provision for a penalty in the case of non-notification by the executors. The sanction on them is that until the deceased is deleted from the register, he and his estate will continue to be liable to pay the personal community charge. Therefore, it will be part of the executor's duties to the deceased's estate to ensure that notice is given to the community charge registration officer. When the officer is notified by the executor, he can amend the register retrospectively to the date of death. Any excess community charge that may have been paid will be repayable.<br/>
Moving from death to birth, the hon. Member for Cathcart asked me whether the date of birth would be kept private. I assure him that the date of birth will not be part of the section of the register that is available for public inspection. For the internal purposes of a local authority, the system may generate reference numbers from the date of birth for each individual, but they will not be numbers which a person is required to memorise or quote when he moves from one authority to another. Nor, as has been suggested in some quarters, will identity cards be issued.<br/>
During the passage of the Scottish Act, strong representations were made by local authority practitioners, including the Rating and Valuation Association, that an identifier was necessary to distinguish between people of the same name living at a single address or to allow the checking of the identifying numbers of individuals who move from one registration area to another. The need for that was subsequently underlined by Cipfa Services Limited in its report on the operational aspects of the community charge system.<br/>
The hon. Members for Cathcart and for Argyll and Bute (Mrs. Michie) and my hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North (Mr. Walker) asked about exemptions For visiting forces. The spouses of members of visiting forces who are citizens of the United Kingdom are not exempt. The exemption for members of visiting forces is an exemption from the personal community charge. If a member of such a force buys a second home in the United Kingdom, he may be liable for the standard community charge. I appreciate that that is important in the hon. Lady's constituency, since such a person is currently liable for rates.<br/>
Local authorities will not lose out financially, nor will their community charge payers, because of the community charge exemption for visiting forces. The rateable value of property occupied by visiting forces is determined by the Rating of Government Property Department in consultation with the local assessor. The department pays the rates for the property direct to the local authority and recovers a proportion, known as the beneficial proportion, from the visiting force. The beneficial proportion reflects the extent to which rates are payable for property services rather than personal services and is paid by the visiting forces by international agreement. The proportion is negotiated with the Governments concerned. The Government will be considering with those other Governments what similar arrangements may apply under the community charge system. Those arrangements will be designed to ensure that authorities need not bear an unreasonable burden as a result of the exemption for members of visiting forces who live in their areas.<br/>
The hon. Member for Cathcart asked me about the uniform business rate. We have always made it clear that legislation is likely to be needed to complete the harmonisation process. Legislation to introduce a uniform business rate will be needed after the harmonisation processes are complete, and it is premature to consider that now. In the meantime, we have made arrangements to freeze and index-link poundages.<br/>
The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond) said that amendment No. 96, which relates to inspection of the register, would mean that community charge registration would become a requirement for obtaining local authority services. That is the worst sort of scaremongering. The terms on which inspection of the register will be allowed have been made clear. They are limited to purposes connected with the administration of the community charge. The hon. Gentleman asked how a community charge registration officer would know that someone was about to be resident. An example would be when a house is sold and the seller's lawyer informs the registration officer of the name of the buyer well before he moves in.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Eastwood (Mr. Stewart) asked me to confirm that responsibility for completing the form and for paying the charge were not


one and the same. I am happy to do so. Indeed, the registration form mentions that point in three different places.<br/>
The community charge in Scotland is now the law of the land and anyone who advocates disrupting the procedures, as we have heard from Opposition Members, must bear in mind the penalties that can be imposed upon those who fail to provide information or who provide false information when they are properly required to do so by registration officers. My hon. Friend the Member for Tayside, North was absolutely right to refer to the shocking distortions and misrepresentations among the Opposition parties. By their antics in opposing the community charge they have shown their carelessness not only with the truth but with the rule of law. When I accused them in a recent debate of flirting with lawlessness, I think I was being too kind; now, day after day, week after week, in this House and outside it, Opposition Members demonstrate their contempt for parliamentary democracy, and in doing so they reveal that they are unfit for Government.<br/>
I urge hon. Members to approve the amendment as one more step towards the smooth and efficient implementation&#x2014;despite the worst endeavours of the Opposition parties&#x2014;of a new system of paying for local government that will abolish the discredited and unfair domestic rates system and put in its place a better, fairer system.</p>

<p>These new clauses and the consequential amendment in the title of the Bill were foreshadowed in the statement that I made on 9 March. Together with the regulations, they deal with two major defects that have become apparent in the existing legislation and regulations dealing with capital controls. The regulations, which are down for debate later, give effect to the statement about the leasing changes, lease and leaseback. They are temporary, in that they will hold the position until there have been consultations and further consideration. Amending regulations will be provided and these are merely a stopgap to hold the position until we have had time to consult.<br/>
First, some councils were raising money by lease and leaseback deals in order to avoid the consequences of not having balanced their revenue budgets. The law does not permit local authorities to borrow to cover revenue deficits, nor does it permit them to pledge their assets as security. It was clearly necessary to prevent them from achieving the same result and avoiding these restrictions by lease and leaseback.<br/>
Secondly, both leasing and barter were being used by more and more councils to undertake capital expenditure over and above that provided for in the Government's public expenditure plans. The measures do not prevent barter or leasing from being used, but bring such transactions within the spending limits laid down.</p>

<p>Would the Secretary of State like to tell the House how he makes these new capital expenditure controls consistent with the encouragement given by the Secretary of State for Wales to health authorities in Wales? He said that when they contemplate building new hospitals they should organise it in such a way that the private sector builds the hospitals and leases them back to the health authorities in Wales. That is encouraging public authorities to do sale and leaseback deals with the private sector and contradicts what the Secretary of State is saying.</p>

<p>All I am saying is that that has to be done within the system of capital controls and not as an addition to it. That does not mean to say that it cannot still be done, which is the point that I was making.<br/>
In broad terms, the new clauses deal with three matters. First, they bring barter fully within the capital control system. Part barter transactions have always been subject to control, so this hardly represents a major change of policy. Secondly, they amend the statutory rules that determine how much prescribed expenditure is scored when assets are acquired by leasing. Thirdly, they bring within capital controls the acquisition of share or loan capital in the making of payments under the guarantees of borrowing.<br/>
The new regulations provide that acquisition of a lease of property will be outside capital expenditure controls

only if it is for less than three years, if it is not renewable for a longer period, if it is not an extension of a previous lease or if it is not part of a larger transaction. That is a fair precis of the overall effect of these clauses.</p>

<p>I have listened with care to what the Secretary of State said, and I heard him say that barter deals will be included in the regulations if they are entire barter deals as opposed to part barter deals. Why has such concern been expressed by the Association of District Councils which, as the Secretary of State will know, said in response to his announcement on 9 March that the new clauses will put many carefully negotiated good schemes in jeopardy?</p>

<speech hansard_id="551437" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-04-25a.102.1" hansard_membership_id="11415" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/30571" speakername="Mr. Ridley" colnum="102" time="19:45:00">
<p>The reason is that district councils are doing a lot of barter deals. I have something to say later which may be of comfort to the hon. Gentleman.<br/>
I shall not go into the detail of the new clauses as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Southampton, When (Mr. Chope), will provide any information that hon. Members ask for at the end of the debate, but I should like to enlarge on the reasons for the measures. All Governments control local authority capital expenditure, which is part of public expenditure. That is not a proposition that any political party seriously opposes. I think that the hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) agreed with that proposition.<br/>
A short definition of public expenditure is that it involves things that are paid for now or later out of taxation. I emphasise the words "or later". Like individuals, the Government have some scope for deferring, or advancing, the actual payments, whether by borrowing, by credit or by hire purchase, but the commitments once entered into have to be paid for eventually. It is the normal accounting convention, and has been ever since public expenditure planning was introduced in its modern form, that expenditure should be recorded when assets are acquired or when work is done and not when the payments are actually made.<br/>
That is the basic philosophy of the local authority capital control system. When capital assets move in and out of the ownership or control of the local authority sector, the full value of those assets should be counted as public expenditure. Equally, when improvements are carried out to assets already within that sector, the full cost should be counted. The amount that is counted represents the call that is being made on the nation's resources. It does not and should not depend on the precise arrangements made to finance the expenditure.<br/>
Similarly, when assets move out of the local authority sector, a capital receipt is recorded. Again, the amount of the receipt does not necessarily reflect the financial terms of the disposal. It measures the worth of the assets that have been released.<br/>
The purpose of the capital control system is to secure that public expenditure and local authority capital assets, less capital receipts from the disposal of such assets, match the public expenditure provisions that have been made. We do not intend to stop barter deals, merely to bring them within the capital control system. They have been used to avoid it; why else would authorities go to the trouble of keeping the transaction off their books?<br/>
Barter involves transfers of assets into and out of the public sector. It cannot be right that such transfers should


take place outside the system under which the acquisition of assets by local authorities is controlled. Barter often does not offer good value for money. In some cases, it involves a middleman, who takes a cut. It usually involves selling to a single bidder who might not want it for himself. That is no way for a local authority to realise the best price of its assets on behalf of its ratepayers, because it cannot test the market.<br/>
Any scheme which takes place off the books is not necessarily the highest priority, nor subject to the same financial scrutiny that would apply if it was competing against other schemes within the capital control system. It may be claimed that barter schemes do not affect public expenditure, but I do not believe that. There is an opportunity cost involved. If a local authority sold a piece of surplus land for cash, public expenditure, and often public debt, would be reduced. If it swaps the land for a swimming pool, the opportunity for that reduction would be lost.<br/>
Barter was taking place on such a scale that it had to be brought under the capital control system. Since 9 March, we have been able to find out much more accurately what was happening. Two things have emerged. First, many schemes of both types are in the pipeline where commitment has been made or expenditure incurred. Secondly, the prescribed proportion rules bite harshly on some barter schemes such as land swaps and property rationalisation.<br/>
Therefore, I have two important and major relaxations to announce to the House this evening. The first concerns schemes that are in the pipeline. In my statement on 9 March, I said:
<q>I and my right hon. Friends will consider issuing additional capital allocations where we are satisfied that the agreements were not entered into for the purpose of evading capital expenditure or borrowing controls."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>. 9 March 1988; Vol. 129, c. 327.]</q>
I propose to use two criteria in interpreting what one might call cases in the pipeline. The first involves the extent to which expenditure has already been incurred or other commitments entered into, whether by the local authority or by any other party. For example, sites might have been acquired, design work might have been undertaken or tenants might have been rehoused, or perhaps there is evidence of some other commitment.</p>

<p>In a moment.<br/>
The second criterion is the extent to which the scheme is designed neither to increase the stock of assets over which the local authority has effective control, nor to raise money on the security of the authority's assets. If local authorities consider that schemes which were in the pipeline on 9 March meet both those criteria, they should apply to my Department for extra capital allocations.</p>

<p>Will my right hon. Friend say something about the case of a small and careful local authority&#x2014;the North Devon district council? The sheer scale of expenditure on harbour improvements at Ilfracombe, the building of marinas and the dredging of the docks will be far outside the capital ability of such a council. The only way that such a development can be achieved is to go to a developer&#x2014;in fact, it is seeking ideas from more than one company. They involve barter between council land and developer money. If the council goes outside the normal capital expenditure controls and, although our authority is allowed to spend only some &#x00A3;250,000 annually, on this one occasion only it seeks to spend &#x00A3;2 million, and barter is essential for the finance, will this form of harbour and commercial improvement be ruled out?</p>

<p>I have no knowledge of the scheme that my hon. Friend has described. If he will send me details of it, we shall certainly consider it.<br/>
I was coming to the second major relaxation which possibly could be of help in that case. Obviously, I cannot make a decision without having seen the details. It applies only to barter deals.<br/>
The representations which I have received since my statement on 9 March have also persuaded me that the existing legislation and regulations are a particular constraint on what I might call "in and out" transactions. By these I mean schemes where a particular asset is acquired so that another asset, or possibly the same asset, can be disposed of and where the disposal can happen only if the acquisition happens first. The inhibiting effect of the capital control system on property rationalisations was commented on by the Audit Commission in its report on local authority property which drew attention to the massive scope for local authorities to make better use of their property holdings.<br/>
We already have a limited back-to-back scheme under which additional allocations can be given to facilitate the acquisition of assets and their subsequent sale, as might happen when a council uses its land assembly powers to facilitate a private sector development. I propose to replace that scheme by an "in-and-out" scheme. Additional allocations will be available for three classes of transaction: first, the exchange of land for land; secondly, the replacement of existing assets held by the local authority by assets to be used for broadly similar purposes; and, thirdly, schemes in which the main intention is to facilitate investment by the private sector in assets which, when the scheme is completed, will be owned, operated and controlled by the private sector.</p>

Would it be possible to make some effort about the problems of Carrick district council, and for somebody from the Department to meet an all-party delegation, as has been requested, to try to sort through these problems? Secondly, can he comment on the circumstances that arise in one case, where a major asset is in urgent need of renewal or replacement and the council is considering disposing of another asset to pay for that? That would be completely impossible within capital restraints, but the asset will otherwise waste away. Will that come within the terms of the Secretary of State's concessions?</p>

There is now to be a period of consultation with the local authorities on these proposals, and when that is concluded the Government will bring forward new regulations which will be the opportunity to comment on the final plan.<br/>
One of the difficulties with this matter has been that, until my statement on 9 March, I did not know what was going on or how much of it was outside the law. [HON.

<p>I am grateful to the Secretary of State. I am not surprised that he made a statement without knowing the full implications of the situation. Equally, he is now asking us to understand some fairly complicated proposals without being 100 per cent. certain of what is involved. I only hope that he is more certain than he was on 9 March. The London borough of Newham is involved in a number of leaseback and barter deals, all of which are aimed at doing something about the growing homelessness problem in the area. In general terms, would such schemes be acceptable, as we are trying to address a serious problem?</p>

On the second point, the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) must study the particular schemes in relation to what I have said. I know that he cannot assimilate this and entirely understand it just like that and without some advice. However, there is an opportunity for consultation and representations before we come forward with the final regulations, which will be designed only after the matters have had public discussion.<br/>
I trust that these two major relaxations will be of considerable comfort to those hon. Members who have been alarmed by particular cases which local authorities have brought to their attention. I think that they will deal with many of those that we have already seen, and they should make for a fairer transition and an easier new regime.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State's important statement is a massive climbdown from his statement of 9 March, which he made, as he has admitted in his curiously disarming way, when he did riot know what was going on.<br/>
It is a new doctrine of Government that Ministers come to Parliament and announce major changes in capital investment programmes for the length and breadth of the country when, on their own admission, they do not know what they are talking about. That is extraordinary. Tonight, we have seen just how ill-considered arid downright wrong that politically motivated statement was. It was motivated not by any common sense, evidence or investigation into the circumstances. It was a political response, partly, I regret to say, engendered by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton (Sir G. Young) and others. The irony of it was that the project that the hon. Member for Acton complained of was, on the admission of the Secretary of State, lawful and in order and it went ahead.<br/>
The Secretary of State should have said this in his announcement but I invite him to say it now. He should withdraw the regulations that he is asking the House to approve after 10 o'clock tonight. We knew before his statement, but it is even clearer now, that those regulations are simply a stopgap measure. Why is the Secretary of State so unclear about all this when his own Green Paper, published in 1986, asserted that the Government had had these matters under consideration since 1984? Here we are in 1988 and the Government still do not have a clear idea of what they are seeking to do and why.<br/>
The reality is that the Secretary of State has been forced to make this announcement not least because of the massive protest from his own colleagues in local government. When he made his statement on 9 March, he implied that the statement was necessary because of the activities of a handful of mainly Labour-controlled local authorities. We knew that it was not true then, and we certainly have the evidence to demonstrate that it is not true now. That is one of the reasons why the Secretary of State has backed off.<br/>
The Secretary of State has manoeuvred oddly throughout this whole business. On 9 March, certain members of the press were provided with a background briefing by officials of the Department of the Environment. That information was never presented to Parliament or published formally. It named certain projects in certain


local authorities. It emerged that much of it was based on anecdotal hearsay evidence, as the Secretary of State was subsequently forced to admit.<br/>
When I asked, through my office, for a copy of the information, my private secretary received a letter from the Secretary of State's private secretary dated 10 March, which said:
<q>I attach a copy of a note which I gather our press officers gave to some members of the Press who asked for examples of the kind of local authority schemes which might be affected by the terms of the Secretary of State's announcement. This was not a note prepared with formal distribution in mind. You will see that it is a list of examples of some of the schemes that the Department has heard about from various sources, primarily MPs, councillors and press reports. It is not in any sense intended as a definitive list of such schemes.</q>
It is outrageous that the Secretary of State should make statements of such importance based on hearsay, gossip and innuendo. That is what the note confesses to. When the Secretary of State&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

When the Secretary of State was challenged on these points by councillor Jack Layden, the leader of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, he said in his reply dated 29 March:
<q>The list was a list of examples of large proposed leasing schemes. It was not intended as a full summary of available evidence and neither was it prepared for publication.</q>

As the hon.

<p>We are quite familiar with these unsubstantiated allegations, unsupported by any definitive statements or evidence. We are aware of the general smear on local government. If the Secretary of State has evidence, why does he not name the authorities involved? He has made a very serious allegation. Which authority is he talking about? Will he name one, two, three or four authorities?<br/>
The hon. Member for Bournemouth, West and the Secretary of State have referred to concealment. They must think that we have very short memories. Have they forgotten about the leak of correspondence between the Secretary of State for the Environment's office and the Prime Minister's office which occurred a few days ago? There can be no better example of concealment and deception in recent political history than that. Secret memos were sent back and forth aimed at misleading not the Opposition, but Conservative Members of Parliament. If I were a Conservative Member, I would keep pretty damned quiet about concealment at the moment.<br/>
The Secretary of State said in his statement:
<q>I have to inform the House that, once again, a minority of local authorities are employing artificial devices to incur capital expenditure and to undertake borrowing over and above the levels permitted to them under the existing capital control system. Only a minority of authorities are involved".</q>
That certainly was not true then and the right hon. Gentleman knew that. All the evidence on the record now shows that that was not true. It was an attempt to mislead public opinion about those decisions in local government.<br/>
I challenged the Secretary of State later on in his statement. I asked:
<q>Will he confirm, for example, that his proposals will affect large and small local authorities right across the country, under Tory as well as Labour control? Will he confirm that the proposals will affect the capital programmes of many of those authorities, including house-building programmes, redevelopment programmes and capital expenditure on leisure centres?"&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9 March 1988; Vol. 129, c. 326&#x2013;29.]</q>

<p>May I refer my hon. Friend to column 1170 of the <i>Official Report</i> of 22 April 1988 in respect of the leaks between the Department of the Environment and the Prime Minister which are being thoroughly investigated?

<p>As ever, my hon. Friend has made an important point. It is perhaps worth asking the Secretary of State whether his ministerial colleagues are being questioned along with the civil servants. As we know from the recent past that a number of these alleged leaks have not been leaks at all, but deliberate acts authorised by no less a person than the Prime Minister&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Of course we know that. Sir Crawley should observe the normal behaviour of a Parliamentary Private Secretary and be seen and not heard.<br/>
To reinforce my point about authorities under the control of different political parties, I want to list a few examples almost at random. The Association of District Councils has claimed that 150 of its members had schemes affected by the announcement. Nearly 150 local authority projects worth more than &#x00A3;350 million may be abandoned because of the Government's clampdown on leaseback


and barter deals. Those are overwhelmingly Tory-controlled authorities&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Lancaster (Dame E. Kellett-Bowman) is shaking her head. I will cite one or two examples. The first relates to Spelthorne. Where is the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) now? That authority is Tory controlled. It has a scheme for a town centre redevelopment, involving the disposal of a council-owned site to provide leisure facilities. Tory-controlled Tamworth has a scheme for the modernisation of a housing estate. Tory-controlled Vale of White Horse in Oxfordshire has a scheme for major renovation works to a block of flats and the provision of new dwellings. Tory-controlled Wyre in Lancashire has a scheme for the renovation of a windmill&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. Lady's first point. The windmill renovation is a sensible project. However, it is a pity that the hon. Lady did not make those comments on 9 March when she almost certainly supported her right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment.<br/>
As there is apparently some dispute or lack of knowledge about Tory-controlled local authorities, what about Tory-controlled St. Albans? It has a scheme for the exchange of land with North West Hertfordshire health authority to enable hospital expansion. Can we accept that Basingstoke is Tory-controlled? Will the hon.

<p>I am grateful to the hon. Member for Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) for finally springing the trap on the hon. Lady.<br/>
The reality is that the Secretary of State, as is often his wont, dived into the situation without the slightest idea of where he was going&#x2014;without a scintilla of evidence to

support his actions. He has been lambasted by Tory-controlled local authorities up and down the country and he is backing off fast. As is usual with his decisions, that is to be welcomed.

<p>I am deeply concerned about the contents of the new clauses. I do not consider myself bound to support them in the Lobbies tonight. They are new clauses tabled towards the end of debates on an important Bill. I am an honorary vice-president of the Association of District Councils, and I have received much of the briefing material to which Opposition Members have referred. I have also had a lengthy meeting with my own Macclesfield borough council, which is one of the few in the north-west having overall Conservative control. Sadly, my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton (Mr. Hamilton) could not be there, but he has been subsequently fully briefed. The new clauses will adversely affect a well-managed authority in the north-west of England, which is Tory-controlled and which, over the past 10 years, has achieved the lowest rate precept rise in the whole of Cheshire. It is often accused of penny pinching, and yet some of the most necessary and vital projects currently being planned by that authority are being jeopardised as a result of the new clauses.<br/>
My right hon. Friend has received a letter from me, and he has paid me the courtesy of responding personally because his Department has not had time to prepare a detailed reply. I shall listen to the Front Bench response to this short debate before deciding what I shall do in the Division Lobbies. However, I must tell my right hon. Friend that, as matters currently stand, I shall be voting against the new clauses. I believe that they will be very damaging to many responsible, well-managed authorities. I say to my right hon. Friend that there are also some well-managed Labour authorities. One or two of them are close to my constituency in Cheshire, in the Greater Manchester area, and it is wrong that authorities which have shown themselves to be responsible should be treated in that way.<br/>
The technicalities of the proposed changes and my right hon. Friend's concessions are complex&#x2014;but, in short, they will bring further types of transactions within what I can only describe as already restricted control, whereas they were previously considered a legitimate supplement to the use of capital receipts. The need for such a supplement is illustrated by the extent of the permissible borrowing approval allowed by the Government to the Macclesfield borough council. For all non-housing projects&#x2014;such as car parks, pedestrianisation, public lavatories and pavilions&#x2014;the council's allocation is in the region of &#x00A3;387,000, to which may be added a percentage&#x2014;&#x00A3;30 per cent., as my right hon. Friend knows&#x2014;of capital receipts. That latter aspect adds a further sum, averaging &#x00A3;500,000, to the amont of money that my borough council can spend.<br/>
The council's current allocation for its housing improvement programme of &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;4 million is reducing and, even with capital receipts, that programme&#x2014;which is much needed, much in demand and well planned&#x2014;must be constantly rephased, with the result that projects are delayed. I shall quickly spell out several of those projects, though as a result of the relaxations my right hon. Friend


has made tonight, one or two of them may be allowed to proceed. First, Macclesfield borough council has an ambition to create centralised headquarters. The benefits deriving from increased efficiency, better communication and avoidance of duplication are widely recognised&#x2014;as I hope they will be by my right hon. Friend's Department.<br/>
In addition, a number of the council's existing offices in various parts of the town are in poor condition and require considerable capital expenditure if they are to be put into a reasonable state. Work on that scheme has proceeded for more than 12 months and we are within a week or two of the final submission of offers from the private sector. The scheme involves a commercial element, the value of which would be offset against the cost of offices. That value will now score under the proposed restrictions.<br/>
I turn to another important matter that relates also to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton. Our area has tremendous potential for economic growth and there is great pressure for new car parking, if that potential is to be fully exploited. In Macclesfield, the council has already agreed a lease and leaseback transaction to provide funding in due course for the Jordan Gate scheme. It is unlikely to be funded in the foreseeable future in any other way.<br/>
In Wilmslow, in the Tatton constituency, the Church street scheme is a proposed barter deal, where the freehold of the land for development will be exchanged for a decked car park, providing an additional 100 spaces in Wilmslow town centre. My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton and I know the area very well, and that development is vital if the area is to react to the demands placed upon it and to exploit fully its potential.<br/>
In Macclesfield, again, there is a proposal for the Churchill way scheme, containing a mixture of lease and leaseback, together with barter, which would provide much-needed parking spaces in the town centre. I say to any right hon. or hon. Member who does not know Macclesfield&#x2014;and there may be many of them&#x2014;that it is currently choking to death with cars, particularly at weekends, because there are inadequate parking facilities. With the growth of commercial development, there is demand for it. The Duke street scheme would provide 800 parking spaces under a leaseback arrangement.<br/>
It was intended to achieve a much-needed opening up of land in East Titherington by a development agreement with the private sector, encouraged by my right hon. Friend; again, there would be an element of barter and exchange for provision of costly infrastructure. That scheme is now in jeopardy.<br/>
I turn to another vital area, and it is one that my right hon. Friend may admit falls within the concessions that he made. It concerns a serious problem that arises in relation to Airey houses in the Macclesfield borough council. It is a matter with which both my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton and myself are concerned. Last year, we received numerous inquiries from tenants of those houses asking about their future. I have many Airey properties in my constituency, in the villages of Bosley, Poynton, Adlington, Lyme Green, Rainow, Lower Withington and Nether Alderley. My hon. Friend the Member for Tatton has such houses in Tabley.</p>

<p>I must tell the hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) that, initially, I was totally unaware that my council would be caught in that way. Indeed, I suspect that my right hon. Friend the Minister was also unaware, but he has been fair enough to say so from the Dispatch Box. Subsequently, I have naturally taken a deep interest in the matter, having served in local government for a number of years.<br/>
If I may return to the subject of Airey houses, after much tenant consultation, the council proposes, subject to planning difficulties and considerations, to demolish the Airey houses. It will do so in an interesting way, replacing them with other houses under a partnership arrangement with builders in the private sector, using private finance for the initial construction.<br/>
Tenants wishing to do so will be able to acquire their new houses at the discounted rate subject to the cost-floor provision. Those unable or not wishing to buy will continue to live in a property of their choice as secure tenants of Macclesfield borough council. Thus, the council will have to buy the properties at cost from the developer. Any remaining properties in the various locations will be sold on the open market.<br/>
8.30 pm<br/>
The proposals prior to my right hon. Friend's announcement would have enabled the council to set off 100 per cent. of sales income against the cost of acquiring properties for continued renting. That would minimise the impact on the council's housing improvement payment allocation of just &#x00A3;1&#x00B7;4 million for 1988&#x2013;89. The understanding of the new arrangement requires the cost of providing the accommodation for renting to score as prescribed expenditure. This will be between &#x00A3;2 million and &#x00A3;3 million, depending on how many tenants exercise the right to buy. I am sure that I do not need to explain further to my right hon. Friend or the House how the measures in the new clauses and amendment that we are debating will adversely affect the very sound and prudent policy being implemented by my local authority.<br/>
I sometimes find it difficult to understand the Treasury when it is seeking to limit the expenditure of capital receipts. The Treasury says that it will be bad for the PSBR if that is not done, but we no longer have any problem with the PSBR, because the position is currently negative. If my right hon. Friend believes in local government, as I certainly do, he should say so, but if the Government do not believe in it any longer, they should say that it is no longer wanted. However, if we want well-managed local authorities such as mine and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Tatton, they should be encouraged and not kicked in the shins for managing not only their assets, but the local government functions for all those who live in the district.<br/>
I hope that the concessions made tonight will allow many of the proposals that I have outlined, if not all, to go forward, because they have been properly planned and properly financed. My local authority is not trying to bridge a short-term revenue problem by selling capital assets; it is trying to provide better facilities and a better


infrastructure for all the people in the Macclesfield borough area, the vast majority of whom are Conservative supporters.</p>

<p>As the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) said, the new clauses have come forward very late in our proceedings. It is particularly unfortunate that we did not have the opportunity to scrutinise them in Committee.<br/>
I shall ask a specific question, which I hope will be answered by the Minister who winds up the debate. In view of the new clauses and the announcement made by the Secretary of State, I should like to know how a council will be affected if an agreement was concluded before 9 March. What I want to raise, and would have raised in Committee had it been possible, is the effect on schemes in the pipeline. There are different stages in the progress on an agreement. I appreciate that, as the Secretary of State explained, there will be some concessions; that he will look at particular schemes, and perhaps exempt them from the constraints of the new clauses. Nevertheless, I should like to know the answer to my question.<br/>
Let us suppose that a council concluded an agreement before 9 March, and it was signed, sealed but not delivered &#x2014;in the sense that it had not taken effect, so that the land had not been transferred, although the agreement to do so had been made. The council, of course, would have done that in the confident belief that it was acting according to the law, as it existed before 9 March. It would have received no indication that the Secretary of State intended to change the law. Would the council be able to proceed without the scheme having been scored against its capital expenditure?</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House for long. I was grateful for a helpful comment from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and wish to develop only two points, which may affect not only my area but other areas in the more rural parts of the west country.<br/>
First, let me say that there is dismay and consternation among good local authorities which see perfectly well the reasons to stop what might be called less intelligent councils from seeking ways around logical Government control on excessive capital expenditure. Councils such as mine&#x2014;the North Devon and Mid-Devon district councils &#x2014;accept that entirely, and are in no way against the principle. Nor, indeed, am I.<br/>
The danger comes when the relatively low-spending and low-resource authorities without a large ratepaying base seek a substantial development that involves occasional major expenditure, perhaps once or twice in 10 years. It is then that they are scared of being&#x2014;as they would put it&#x2014;capped.<br/>
My other point goes beyond that. We need to extend the harbour and build at Ilfra.combe, and the only way that we can finance that development is by using a developer's cash on our council land. I hope that there is no problem here. It is a one-off, and we hope for exemption from control on such capital expenditure. However, on the hills behind Ilfracombe we have a hydro plant and what we hope will be a large wind farm to produce for the generating board. We shall have problems there if we are not permitted to reduce rates and exchange land for development. It will involve a big development and big expenditure.<br/>
I merely ask my right hon. Friend to think kindly of authorities that have no intention of excessive spending, but which occasionally have to engage in work for which their rate-borne income could never provide. I ask my right hon. Friend to treat those authorities well. They are not trying to swap or to cheat. They are merely seeking to use their assets in a sensible, logical manner, for the economic benefit of their communities.</p>

<p>This has been a strange debate. First, it is clear that it is a debate about barter deals and not about leaseback. That will come later. Secondly, the Secretary of State effectively came to the House to admit that he had been taken by surprise by his own announcement. The policy of the Government had turned round, as it were, and bitten the hand that feeds it. The Government have become used in the past to making decisions first and asking questions later, but in this instance they announced the decision, made the inquiries later, and then suddenly discovered what horrible things they had done. There is, however, the consolation that perhaps occasionally messages get through.<br/>
Let us look at some of the headlines that have appeared in the specialist press in the past few weeks. <i>Surveyor</i> of 7 April has the headline
<q>Tories attack barter deal ban".</q>
The magazine <i>Building</i>, on 8 April, stated:
<q>Housebuilders rage against end of council barter deals</q>
The article below the headline began:
<q>Construction of 50,000 homes a year could be scuppered and inner city regeneration project wrecked if Government proposals to end land deals between councils and contractors go ahead.</q>
Later in the article, the director of the House-Builders Federation is quoted as saying:


<q>The Government must realise that this is a standard way of doing business, particularly in the inner cities. This could scupper as much as 25 per cent. of the housebuilding programme. If they made a mistake on this one, they could have shot the whole inner city drive in the foot".</q>
A headline in <i>Surveyor</i> on 21 April was:
<q>Housing for elderly and disabled under threat from Finance Bill".</q>
The finance officer of the Association of District Councils said:
<q>While the Secretary of State clearly aimed at ending the excesses of a few, he has really gone too far and is putting in jeopardy a large number of schemes".</q>
The <i>Financial Times</i> of today said:
<q>Nearly 150 district council projects worth more than &#x00A3;350 million may have to be abandoned &#x2026; The schemes range in value from under &#x00A3;1 million to a &#x00A3;45 million housing development in Oxford and a &#x00A3;40 million redevelopment of Bournemouth's Pavilion entertainments centre.</q>
We could give many examples. Yet again, the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) showed that the evidence is contrary to what the Government thought. On some matters, the councils have done just what the Government asked. Tower Hamlets, which my colleagues control, has been trying to find money for more housing for the homeless. If it had suggested a scheme exactly on these lines, it would have been caught by the ban. I should be interested to know whether my own council of Southwark would be caught. It has not started actual work on such schemes, but if they are precluded, all that Southwark will be able to do is sell land for cash and spend 20 or 30 per cent. of the capital receipts.<br/>
That seems to fly in the face of Government policy. Other people have said that the Government's policy&#x2014;whether we in the Opposition like it or not, we have to accept it&#x2014;is that partnership deals with local authorities are what is required and that councils should work with the private sector and come to the best arrangements for them and the communities. Barter deals are not mortgages of the future as leaseback is&#x2014;that is a different issue. They do not involve a cost to the ratepayers, because they are assessed as valuable in themselves. They offend against capital controls technically, but not fundamentally in terms of economic policy.<br/>
We do not expect the Secretary of State to apply his new concessions to every scheme. The Government entered this area of policy, like the poll tax, with the same motivation, saying, "The Government must control everything, no matter what local councils decide." The Government have now realised that that was a foolish way forward.<br/>
In the past year, many barter schemes have come before the Secretary of State. Many local authorities have asked him to confirm that one or other barter scheme is legal. Such schemes appeared then to be legal, and it appears that the Government have now accepted that they should be. I hope that the reality behind the concessions, which we welcome, is that in the event all such schemes that are good will be allowed through and eventually the Government will have the good grace to admit that they made a terrible mistake and that, quite often, local government knows what it is doing.</p>

<p>On Report, once or twice I have supported the principle of a clause but have been worried about the implications of the wording. I am in that position again tonight. I very much welcome the

concessions announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, especially the promise of consultation before new regulations are introduced.<br/>
As my right hon. Friend stated in his announcement on 9 March, the reason is to catch
<q>a minority of local authorities &#x2026; employing artificial devices to incur capital expenditure and to undertake borrowing over and above the levels permitted to them". &#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9 March 1988; Vol. 129, c. 326.]</q>
I concur with that objective, but I fear that the legislation is drafted so widely that it will catch many worthwhile schemes across the country, as we have heard from other hon. Members in the debate.<br/>
8.45 pm<br/>
It is true that certain local authorities have used the present regulations to fund revenue deficits, using schemes such as mortgaging municipal buildings and selling off parking meters to meet current expenditure, but most local authorities, certainly my own in Exeter, have adhered strictly to the law and the intention of the law. In Exeter, we have six schemes that are affected by the revised rules. All of them relate to matters of a capital nature. They all enjoy all-party local support. They are supported by commercial interests and are generally intended for the enhancement, improvement and future prosperity of the city and the area. There is no adverse effect on the ratepayers of the city, which has the lowest district rate in Devon. It is difficult to see why those much-needed schemes, which I should like to describe, should not go ahead without delay and without undue bureaucratic delay by officials.<br/>
I look forward to looking more closely at the details of the changes announced tonight. The legislation as presently drafted appears to have been produced in haste and, in my view, needs to be withdrawn for further consideration and amendment.<br/>
The first scheme that has been affected by the revised rules concerns the relocation of the livestock market in Exeter. Exeter is not just a regional centre for administration and shopping, but it is an important centre in a large agricultural county. The city council owns and operates a thriving livestock market in a partnership arrangement with a private sector consortium of market auctioneers. The market has been on its present site since the 1930s and is now inadequate by reason of its location, its means of access and its size. It also fails to meet present-day standards of hygiene and convenience of operation.<br/>
The council, in full consultation with all interested parties and following a consultant's report, has decided to relocate the market to a new site, which the council owns. It is a complicated and costly project, estimated to cost &#x00A3;4&#x00B7;04 million. It enjoys total support from all parties in the area. It is supported by the Devon Member of the European Parliament, the market auctioneers and the National Farmers Union. The value of the existing site for redevelopment is sufficient to fund the scheme, but the existing site cannot be sold until the new market has been built. In August last year the council entered into an agreement with a merchant bank for the funding of the works in a manner that clearly did not give rise to prescribed expenditure under the law as it then stood, save for a small part of the cost, which would be funded directly by the council. The council has agreed terms for the sale of the existing site to a developer for a sum sufficient to meet the entire costs of the project. An application has been


made for an EEC grant, supported by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Member of the European Parliament, and is now at an advanced stage in its progress at Brussels.<br/>
The whole scheme may be in jeopardy, depending upon the correct interpretation of new clause 11, subsections (6) and (8), and upon the announcement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The essential point is that the agreement to construct the new market was made before 10 March 1988 and the new section will come into force as from that date. Consideration, not in money, was given for the works prior to 10 March and although the work has commenced, a considerable amount remains to be done. I must ask for the reiteration of the assurance that works carried out after 10 March, pursuant to a legally binding agreement made before that date, are not intended to be caught by new clause 11. It would be wholly unreasonable for retrospective legislation to make unlawful work that is contractually committed by an agreement made perfectly lawfully prior to 10 March. I ask for a specific assurance on that point. There is no option as such to be exercised, but there is a mechanism whereby, as the project develops, the council has to produce building contracts, which the bank enters into as we go along.<br/>
One other area of great concern in my constituency of Exeter and in other parts of the country is that we should provide sufficient car parking spaces in the central areas of the city, particularly for shoppers and tourists visiting it. That view is endorsed by the chamber of commerce and trade and the English tourist board. It should be borne in mind that a city such as Exeter is the centre of a huge tourist region. It is also a major shopping centre. It is now faced with the challenge of several regional shopping centre proposals on the outskirts of the city, where there will be a generous provision of car parking. The Secretary of State is due to determine later in the year several planning appeals and applications for those out-of-town shopping centres.<br/>
To enhance the car parking provision in the central areas, the council has proposed three schemes for the provision of new car parks. It has been decided to grant a 125-year lease for office development of council-owned land adjacent to the civic offices on terms requiring the developer to construct a 290-space car park for the council. The important point is that the council will not receive a money consideration. The value of the lease will be set&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Does the hon.

<p>No, I shall not give way. I have allowed the hon. Gentleman to intervene once, and I think that in the interests of time it would be worth while if I continued with my speech. I am trying to advance some serious arguments.<br/>
The effect of the Bill will be to draw in a range of proposals from local authorities, including Exeter, that would not incur extra expenditure for the ratepayers. No loss of capital would be involved. The technical provisions of a hastily drafted clause mean that the local council in my constituency is faced with the prospect of proceeding with schemes that are in the pipeline, or schemes which have been carefully formulated, or withdrawing them. If it proceeds with the schemes and it is found that they are not eligible within the framework that we are considering, the council will find that it is necessary to lower expenditure on other worthwhile schemes.<br/>
If the schemes that the council proceeds with are found not to be falling within the letter of the law and they are withdrawn, many important projects such as car parking, the development of leisure facilities, the provision of a new shopping centre and the development of the county ground where the county show is held each year might have to be put into cold storage at a time when there is a desperate need for them to be implemented.<br/>
I hope that when my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State replies he will give further details of the concessions that have been announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The debate on the Local Government (Prescribed Expenditure) (Amendment) Regulations 1988 will provide ample opportunity for Opposition Members to voice their opinions. In that debate we could further discuss the various concessions and announcements that have been made by my right hon. Friend.</p>

<p>I shall be brief because I hope to be able to speak again on these matters when we discuss the Local Government (Prescribed Expenditure) (Amendment) Regulations 1988 after the Bill has been given a Third Reading.<br/>
If the Secretary of State had any sense of shame, he would apologise to the House for the way in which he inadvertently misled it during his announcement on 9 March. We know that that was not done with malice


aforethought. It happened because he did not know the facts, but that is something that we have come to expect from the right hon. Gentleman. He stumbles around like some poor old derelict from one balls-up to another. He should re-read what was said on 9 March. I shall not spare the Secretary of State's blushes, because it is clear that my hon. Friend the Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) knows so much more than he about what goes on in local government. My hon. Friend said:
<q>May I ask the Secretary of State to reconsider his announcement that these amendments will be presented to the House only on Report?</q>
The Secretary of State's response suggested that he knew all about this at the time, but he now confesses that he knew nothing when he was making his announcement. He said:
<q>Since the hon. Gentleman appears to be going to support the new amendments that I have said will be tabled, I cannot think why he wants such a great deal of time in which to debate them".&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9 March 1988; Vol. 129, c. 335&#x2013;36.]</q>

<p>My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has been criticised for having announced important changes to the capital control regime on 9 March without having consultation beforehand. My right hon. Friend was right to take that course because experience shows that local authorities, when we have consulted before making an announcement, have taken advantage of the consultation period to take action to avoid consequences of the controls that we have sought to introduce.<br/>
In October 1986&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> This may not be within the recollection of the hon. Member for Dunfermline, West (Mr. Douglas), who continues to interrupt. In October 1986, we announced our intention to bring the acquisition of vehicles, plant and machinery within the prescribed expenditure with effect from 1 April 1987. We subsequently consulted local government about the regulations to bring this into effect. Between the time of that announcement and the new regulations, local authorities entered into nearly &#x00A3;2 billion-worth of advance leasing deals. Many of the deals were rushed through in the laying period for the regulations. Recent reports have shown how imprudent some of the deals were. Some of the brokers who arranged them did not work out correctly the tax consequences and some authorities are now faced with substantial additional costs. Our approach in this instance is preferable to that which we adopted in October 1986.<br/>
The pipeline concession will make a great deal of difference and will go a long way to meet the anxieties which have been expressed. When the criteria are satisfied &#x2014;when there is a commitment, there is no net increase in the stock of assets and it is not sought to raise money on the security of assets&#x2014;the pipeline concession will apply. My hon. Friends the Members for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton), for Exeter (Mr. Hannam) and for Devon, North (Mr. Speller) spoke about the way in which the controls will affect small councils. It is worth emphasising the way in which we already take account of the position of small district councils by&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

The concessions that have been announced this evening by my right hon. Friend will apply to many schemes.

He has been told quite clearly that the schemes in Exeter that were in the pipeline before the announcement on 9 March will certainly not be affected by the changes. The same is probably true of some of the Macclesfield schemes. They will satisfy some of the criteria to which my right hon. Friend has referred. The same is true also in relation to north Devon schemes that satisfy the criteria that have been announced by my right hon. Friend. As other hon.

<p>I beg to move, That the Bill now be read the Third time.<br/>
Our debates have been long, but conducted with good nature and courtesy. I thank the hon. Members for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) and for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) for that. The details of the Bill have stood up to examination remarkably well, although there are a number of improvements that we have undertaken to make. The principle of the Bill has been challenged repeatedly, but no superior alternative has been found.<br/>
The policies of the Opposition parties&#x2014;local income tax for the remnants of the alliance and their ex-friends, and local income tax plus capital value rates for the Labour party&#x2014;have been shown to be fatally flawed and unworkable, so much so that both Opposition parties have tried to avoid discussing them, let alone pressing them, throughout our entire debates. That has made their opposition "vacuous"&#x2014;in the words of the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley). He said:
<q>Simply to oppose is a sort of vacuous opposition which the people of this country despise".</q>
I sympathise with the hon. Member for Perry Barr. He started the debates "naked", and is now accused by his deputy leader of ending them "vacuous". He has done a good job on the bill and he deserves better than that, especially from his own party.</p>

<p>I shall not give way. Many hon. Members wish to speak.<br/>
The debate came to life last Monday, when my hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire, East (Mr. Mates) advanced a possible solution that, he argued, combined the advantages of a flat rate charge with his desire for the better off to contribute more. At least that was a positive alternative&#x2014;unlike anything offered by the Labour party. In fact, his scheme combined the disadvantages of a step system with near unworkability without meeting the egalitarian instincts of the Labour party, although it supported him against its better judgment, as expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, in a cyncial attempt to stop the Bill.<br/>
The fact is that all the many alternatives we have considered&#x2014;banded community charges, local income tax, capital value rates, and my hon. Friend's proposal for a three-band community charge&#x2014;have been shown to have fatal flaws, because it is in principle thoroughly undesirable, and costly and complicated in practice, to have a progressive element in the raising of revenue locally. That is why we suggest that only a quarter of local revenue should be raised locally. That enables us to overcome the practical problems of a progressive local system, by providing for half of local spending through the national tax system, which is progressive.<br/>
Some of my hon. Friends would go further, and provide more from the Exchequer, to reduce the size of the


community charge bill. The Bill enables us to take that decision when we come to it, which is not now. I should point out that the great advantage of this system is that, whatever level of Exchequer grant is chosen, the principle of accountability is still preserved, because extra spending above assessed need will always be paid by the community charge payer and be comparable between different authorities. So, for example, if the grant was set so that at last year's spending the community charge for spending at GRE was, say, &#x00A3;100 rather than &#x00A3;178, there would still be the same disparities between London and Rochester, because of the profligacy of the one and the prudence of the other, though the community charge in both cases would be lower. That is not the case with rates, where we have attempted in the past to bring home the costs of local government spending to voters by reducing the grant total and altering the mechanisms by which it is paid. That is an attempt which has not been entirely successful, because of' the lack of accountability inherent in the rate system.<br/>
That reinforces the point that the progressive contribution to local spending must come from national taxation. I think that we have the split between local and national contributions about right. However, we can judge every year the proportion which we think is right to levy from progressive taxation when we set the level of Exchequer grant.<br/>
We have related our proposals to ability to pay. The new improved rebate system gives strong protection to the less well off. It has been shown to leave no one with an unfair burden, while still asking virtually everyone to make at least a small contribution to their council's spending, in the interest of accountability.<br/>
The new system of local government finance will usher in a new era&#x2014;a new attitude in local government. The relationship between councils and their electors will change to one where every council has to concentrate on local rather than national issues, on providing value for money in the services they provide and on serving their customers as their first priority. That will be a great improvement for many authorities controlled by Opposition parties&#x2014;high time, too. I believe that in time the community charge will come to be seen as a watershed in terms of the strengthening of local democracy.<br/>
I make no judgment about what another place may or may not do in relation to the Bill. However, I do believe that I am entitled to observe that the proposal has been endorsed at a general election, and I quote the relevant passage in our 1987 manifesto:
<q>We will legislate in the first Session of the new Parliament to abolish the unfair domestic rating system and replace rates with a fairer Community-Charge.</q>
<q>This will be a fixed rate charge for local services paid by those over the age of 18, except for the mentally ill and elderly people living in homes and hospitals. The less-well-off and students will not have to pay the full charge&#x2014;but everyone will be aware of the costs as well as the benefits of the local services. This should encourage people to take a greater interest in the policies of their local council and getting value for money.</q>
That is the end of the quotation from our manifesto, which spelt out in great detail what we propose to do.</p>

<p>I will not give way, because I want to give a lot of hon. Gentlemen an opportunity to speak. I will refrain from giving way.<br/>
The policy has since been endorsed in a Second Reading debate in the House lasting two days, a Committee stage of 147 hours, and a Report stage of five days. That included a memorable debate on the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire, East when I believe the House, with a perfectly respectable majority, took a clear decision to align the system of local government finance with the reality of a society where prosperity is even more widely spread and in which most people can afford a reasonable, flat rate charge and, collectively, they can afford generous help for the less well off. I am sure their Lordships will bear all these points in mind when they come to discuss the Bill.<br/>
I thank my Minister of State, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, my officials and all our many supporters for the immense efforts they have all made to get us to this historic point. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="551661" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-04-25a.138.1" hansard_membership_id="3075" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2607" speakername="Dr. Cunningham" colnum="138" time="21:09:00">
<p>I join the Secretary of State in expressing thanks for the continued courtesy with which these contemptuous, not to say outrageous, matters have been discussed. He could have added that they had been discussed with considerable humour, although not always intentionally, as I gather from some of the things that he has said.<br/>
This must be the worst Bill to be introduced by any Government in this country this century. Its provisions are deeply and manifestly unfair. We remain fundamentally and vehemently opposed to it. After four months of discussion and debate, the proposals are worse than at the outset. Fundamental questions remain unanswered, for example, the real level of the tax burden that is to be imposed. We do not know how the rebate scheme will operate or who will benefit. The Government cannot explain how their new business tax will be introduced. We do not know how the new local authority grants system will operate in practice.<br/>
However, we do know that the British people now bitterly oppose the whole idea. We know that all British local government associations remain implacably opposed to the idea of the poll tax. We know that the Government's policy on the poll tax has been widely condemned in the British press. A leader in <i>The Times</i> on 20 April was highly critical. In a leader on 21 April, <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> called upon the Government, "to think again."<br/>
In a leading article on 20 April, <i>The Independent</i> stated that the Prime Minister should,
<q>pluck up courage and admit that when she and her colleagues committed themselves to the poll tax, they made a mistake.</q>
<i>The Guardian</i> described the poll tax as "a stricken flagship".&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Apparently, all that counts for nothing in a democracy. <i>The Economist</i> called upon the Government to "scrap" the poll tax. In an editorial criticising the proposal, <i>The Observer</i> stated:
<q>Thatcher has lost poll tax argument".</q>
Perhaps surprisingly, and most witheringly of all, <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> gave the Government,
<q>Nought out of three for the poll tax targets".</q>
It is rumoured that it gave the Secretary of State nought out of three because it did not think that he could count any higher than that. The same leader then stated:


<q>Today, as the Government stumbles from ridicule to rebellion over the plan, it has achieved none of its primary objectives &#x2026; The best solution for the Government is to cut its losses and plump, albeit through gritted teeth, for a progressive tax based as much on the ability to pay as on demand for services.</q>
The General Synod of the Church of England has also &#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> Oh, yes, the General Synod has also condemned the proposals,
<q>believing that a flat-rate community charge is inherently unjust and fails to take sufficient account of ability to pay".</q>
However, apparently all that condemnation counts for nothing&#x2014;the Government plough on.<br/>
The Tory Reform Group did not have a kind word to say for the poll tax. <i>The Financial Times</i> called it, "The wilting poll tax", stating:
<q>The poll tax will never be the right solution to the complex problems of British local government finance. It will never, for this reason, be popular.</q>
It has been interesting to reflect on the wrigglings and writhings of Ministers in the face of all that. The Home Secretary went to his Witney constituency and the local paper the <i>Oxford Times</i> stated:
<q>Hurd says system is the fairest".</q>
However, unfortunately for the right hon. Gentleman, on the same day, the front page of the same newspaper reported the mayor of the Tory Burford council in the right hon. Gentleman's constituency as stating,
<q>Poll tax will 'double rates bills'</q>
That is the kind of confusion and disarray that exists in Government circles, the Conservative party and the country.<br/>
On Second Reading I pointed out that there were 344 places where matters were left for orders, ministerial decision or for a decision to be announced. By the end of the Committee stage there were 409 such instances and after one week on Report the total has risen incredibly to 649 such instances where no answer is available and it is left to ministerial discretion, orders or some other system yet to be announced or introduced in the House.<br/>
At least we have one achievement. On Tuesday 19 April the Secretary of State went on the BBC's "Today" programme and finally conceded that what we were talking about was not a community charge, but a tax. He said:
<q>is this tax too harsh on the least well off.</q>
He went on to describe it later in the broadcast&#x2014;I am quoting from the transcript&#x2014;as follows:
<q>And, as you see in the national press the Poll Tax has not apparently affected the rating of the Party in the country.</q>
The Secretary of State had better tell that to his right hon. and hon. Friends as they go about their business, working for the party in the local elections in the next few weeks.<br/>
The Prime Minister foolishly described the Bill as her flagship. It staggered off the stocks in December with almost all the officer class absent from the bridge. It sailed on in confusion through troubled waters and ran on to the rocks last Monday. I do not know why the Secretary of State thinks that the House of Lords will not ask some searching questions about his Bill. It certainly could not be described in any sense as a glittering, gleaming flagship now; it is more like a dirty Tory tramp steamer staggering along from problem to problem. Every time a serious argument arises, a few more of the crew jump ship and

disappear without trace. Every day last week and yet again today we have seen more and more deserters from the cause. It is not so much a flagship; more a Moby Nick.<br/>
There is no willing majority for this awful mess. There is no honest majority for it either, as Conservative Members realise. It does not deserve to move an inch further.</p>

I said so in my election address; I voted against it on Second Reading; I voted for the amendment of my hon. Friend the Member for Hampshire, East (Mr. Mates); and I shall vote against the Bill again tonight.<br/>
I was surprised that the Opposition turned out in such force to vote for the amendment last Monday. I thought that some of the troops would be unavoidably absent because, like the Israelites finding manna in the wilderness, they could not believe their good fortune. Oppositions do not win elections; Governments lose them. For 18 months to two years before the next election the demands for this Tory tax will be fluttering on to 10 million doormats. It will not be a paper reminder; there will be visits from council officers.<br/>
Anybody who read <i>The Observer</i> yesterday will know what I am talking about. What brave people they are, asking about Aunt Nellie, young Jim and all the rest of them. From now on there will be a spate of cartoons, jokes and bitter comment.<br/>
All that can save us is the ineptitude of the Opposition &#x2014;I suppose that we can count on that. The only other alternative would be for the Government to remove some of the burden on local authorities and therefore reduce the incidence of the tax.<br/>
My hon. Friends are all experienced canvassers and their efforts during the previous election campaign played a large part in the result. What reaction do they expect on the doorsteps in two years' time? Obviously there will be winners and they will approve, but I suspect that their approval will be muted. There will also be vehement opposition from the losers. But surely what there will not be is any acceptance that the local council is responsible for its position. Councils will blame the Government, as indeed they now blame the Government, for the rates.<br/>
No other Government in the western world have tried a poll tax. Some have thought about it, but they have all rejected it. I ask my hon. Friends, would Disraeli have introduced such a tax? Would Salisbury, Bonar-Law, Baldwin, Churchill or Eden have introduced such a tax? The answer must be no. It is against the tradition of our party. It is a new Conservativism. It may be new, but it is certainly not Conservative.</p>

<p>At the start of the final debate on the Tory tax&#x2014;the poll tax&#x2014;the Secretary of State prefaced his remarks by saying that the Bill had stood up remarkably well to examination in this House. A majority


of 25 for the showpiece of the Government is remarkable. I am not entirely sure that that is the type of remarkable event that the Secretary of State wanted his flagship to enjoy.<br/>
As the Bill has passed through the House we have, as in so many cases, seen a bad Bill get worse. Almost all the anomalies that appeared in the Bill are still there. It is still discriminating against those becoming mentally ill, it is still discriminating against student nurses. It is still penalising medical students and remand prisoners. It is still hurting those least able to stand up for themselves and least able to defend themselves against the tax. Worse still, the Government have surpassed themselves in their ability to make bad things worse because they have introduced measures to ensure that even the homeless&#x2014;the dossers &#x2014;will not escape the tax. They have introduced imprisonment as the penalty for those who cannot pay. They have instigated yet more expenditure controls on local authorities unable, even now, to provide a decent service for those within their authority.<br/>
As to the only possible improvement that the Government tried to give us&#x2014;the changes in the withdrawal on rebates&#x2014;the truth will out. The Government wanted to take back what they had given by the back door while presenting that change to their Back Benchers at the front door and asking for their support.<br/>
The Secretary of State says that there is no alternative that can work. His measure, however, is not supported by any other country. Even those countries that still have a poll tax are withdrawing it, whereas the local income tax is present in country after country&#x2014;it is made to work in those countries.<br/>
The Minister for Local Government should consider how he will explain to student nurses in Shepway why they would save 34 per cent. under our local income tax scheme in comparison with the Secretary of State's proposals. In the constituency of the Minister for Local Government, student nurses would save 36 per cent. The hon. Member for Gainsborough and Horncastle (Mr. Leigh) kept jumping up and down and telling us about student nurses. He should bear in mind that, under our scheme, student nurses would save 27 per cent. in his constituency.<br/>
There are alternatives to the poll tax&#x2014;we have heard of such alternatives from Conservative Back Benchers. Those alternatives have been put forward for various measures. With vote after rebellious vote the flagship has sunk deeper into the water.<br/>
The truth is that the Secretary of State cannot defend his proposals. He has to twist arms, using the Whips Office, and offices in the constituencies of Conservative Members, who are too honourable to permit the passing of the Bill without protest. I hope that at the end of the debate those hon. Members will show their honour once again by fighting this proposed Tory tax. They would be doing a service, because, if nothing else, this will be a one-Government tax. It will not just be thrown away as soon as another party comes into Government. It will be thrown away and recognised as a failure as soon as the Prime Minister changes, whatever party he or she may represent.<br/>
That shows the lack of support for the Bill, and Conservative Members know it. There have been no cheers for the Secretary of State, no smiles, and no pleasure in its passing. There is only fear on the Conservative Benches, because they know the havoc that it will wreak in the local elections and the general election to come.</p>

<p>I should tell the hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) that I am joining ship at this point. As I have not yet spoken on the Bill, perhaps I may be allowed to say a few words before we say au revoir to the Bill. It certainly will not be adieu.<br/>
I have long been a critic of the domestic rating system, and I have spoken on the subject in the House many times. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment has produced a Bill to abolish the domestic rating system, and we should not pass the Bill without noting that. In saying goodbye to the domestic rates, let us remember that they are unfair, overcomplex, out-of-date and deeply resented by many of the people who pay them. Let us also remember that, if we continued the domestic rating system, there would have to be a revaluation&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>I know. The hon. Gentleman makes a cogent comment. What happened in Scotland shows exactly what would happen if we had it in England and Wales&#x2014;<i>[Interruption.]</i> If Opposition Members had been in government, they would have taken the kicks for that revaluation. Any Government in power would take the kicks after such a revaluation.<br/>
It does not follow that a substitute local tax would be automatically superior to the domestic rates. It appears from our debates that not all my colleagues are entirely over the moon with the new community charge. However, like my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, I have not heard a superior solution offered during our debates.<br/>
We should also remember that it is no good advancing theoretical options that are administratively impossible to run. Nor is it any good to put forward proposals on taxes that are already pre-empted by national taxes. I think especially of a local sales tax. What my right hon. Friend has proposed in the Bill is a reasonable alternative to the domestic rate, provided that it is retained at the levels currently suggested for the shire counties. The knowledge that the charge is expected to produce only a quarter of local government revenue is a safeguard against its getting out of hand, but it always remains open to the Government to increase the taxpayers' contribution. That should be a great comfort to those who are doubtful about the future level of charges.<br/>
Furthermore&#x2014;it is sufficient for my purposes to note the possibility, and it was confirmed by my right hon. Friend in his speech on Third Reading&#x2014;the Bill provides a secure escape route for those who doubt whether the charge will be held at the present proposed level. It is also important to note that, should new duties of national importance be placed on local authorities by the Government or by Parliament, specific grants should be given to cover them. I have in mind in particular the current proposal by Sir Roy Griffiths that care in the community should move to local authorities.<br/>
With those two reservations, I shall be very content to vote for Third Reading.</p>

<p>This Bill is not about accountability but about redistribution&#x2014;the redistribution of taxation and therefore of income and wealth. The Bill's real objective is to shift the cost of local government from the


people with the highest incomes, living in the biggest and most expensive houses, to people with average and below average incomes, living in flats, bungalows, terraced houses and, many families living in typical three-bedroomed semi-detached houses&#x2014;owner-occupiers and council tenants alike. The people of this country reject this Tory tax, and that is one of the reasons why they will reject this Tory Government.</p>

<p>I voted against the Bill on Second Reading and, given that there was little change in Committee, it will come as little surprise to my right hon. and hon. Friends if my vote remains the same on Third Reading.<br/>
I bitterly regret the fact that, as a result of property revaluation in Scotland, my party has been bounced into arguably the worst solution of all in local government finance. I have asked my hon. Friends to raise their eyes to other countries. If one does that, one sees three options: a tax on property, a tax on individuals, based on income, or a level charge across the board. I have no doubt that the last is the worst option. My biggest regret as someone who for a number of years has followed the whole question of local authority funding and how to achieve a better system is that tonight we are probably postponing a long-term solution. My real fear is that in a few years' time a Government&#x2014;frankly, it could be under either of the major political parties&#x2014;will come back to the House because the proposals will have been found to be unworkable in many ways, and exorbitantly expensive.<br/>
It is with a heavy heart that I announce that I shall not be supporting the Bill tonight.</p>

<p>Patently, the Bill does not have the wholehearted consent of the House of Commons. It does not have majority support in Wales, any more than its predecessor had majority support in Scotland, and many Conservative Members must be praying that the House of Lords will let the House of Commons off the hook.<br/>
The Bill is inherently unfair, in charging the millionaire and those on relatively low incomes the same for local government services. What is proposed is an inefficient way of collecting money; the Bill will double the cost of collecting charges for the local exchequer.<br/>
The imposition that the Bill will place on small businesses will not only be a burden on those businesses; it will make a travesty of regional policy and make impossible any meaningful approach to regeneration in areas away from the south-east of England.<br/>
The Government's failure to introduce proposals to safeguard the position of community councils will be felt in Wales, and parish councils will suffer in England. The Government should be ashamed of their failure to ensure a coherent policy for care in the community, with the result that people with mental handicaps will find themselves better off in institutional care than at home in the community.<br/>
It became clear in an earlier debate that the real danger is that the Government will be looking for ways of offloading charges from local government. In the end, the

most likely candidate for transfer from the county councils to the central Exchequer will be education, or at least the cost of teachers&#x2014;another step towards the centralisation of services.<br/>
I appeal to Conservative Members who have the courage of their convictions to vote against this iniquitous tax.</p>

<p>No one will seriously mourn the passing of the present domestic rating system. It is riddled with anomalies and unfairness. It gives every incentive for local councils to be profligate and to write cheques on other people's bank accounts. It gives no real incentive for local councils to be prudent, as they have little accountability to those whose money they spend, often with gay abandon.<br/>
The arguments against the present rating system are legion. Nothing kills off more quickly than the prospect of revaluation any lingering idea of retaining the existing rating system rather than opting for something new. We could not carry on with the existing system without a revaluation, since the last revaluation was in 1973. A revaluation now after 14 years would inevitably lead to massive disruption for ratepayers.<br/>
The community charge has many advantages. It is straightforward, nearly every adult over the age of 18 will be liable to pay an equal share, and there is protection for the weaker and poorer members of the community. It will ensure that those who spend the money will be accountable to those who provide much of the money that is spent. It will ensure that business, commerce and industry will no longer become prey to the unreasonable demands of unreasonable councils and will be a fairer system because 69 per cent. of pensioners and 83 per cent. of one-parent families will be better off.<br/>
Estimates using sample information aggregated from family expenditure surveys show that most families will be better off paying the proposed community charge than they are with rates. On average, the community charge will be lower than the rates bill, at all income levels up to &#x00A3;150 a week. When it is fully implemented, 53 per cent. of households or 9&#x00B7;8 million families in England will gain from the community charge. Critics try to sink the community charge and to dream up as many obstacles as possible. It is a racing certainty that they cannot come up with an alternative that provides fairness and accountability by councillors to those who provide the money that they spend.</p>

<p>I was a member of the Committee and I can tell the House that we spent 147 hours debating the Bill. The first debate was about ability


to pay and the last debate will he about the same subject. I well remember the definition of the poll tax given by the Tory Reform Group. They said that it is fair only in the sense that the black death was fair. It is indiscriminate and strikes at rich and poor, young and old, unemployed and employed alike. That should be the theme of the last debate on the Bill.<br/>
Underlying the Bill is a let-them-eat-cake approach to social problems. It assumes a world of choice for everyone, but we know that choice is a function of economic viability arid, increasingly, the Government have denied that to many millions of people. The tax does nothing for individuals or for businesses. I asked the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment in Committee about registration for individuals using the Simon Community, an organisation that looks after the destitute in London, and I well remember what he said. He said that he would be surprised if the community did not know where the people came from and where they went. That is the Government's view of reality, and that is why they are so out of touch.<br/>
I shall leave the last word to a constituent who sent me a definition of poll tax. It comes from the 1961 "Odhams Encyclopaedia" which says that it is
<q>a tax per head of population&#x2014;not graduated, imposed in primitive communities where it appears impossible to ascertain individual capacity to bear the burden.</q>
I say that it is imposed by primitive political individuals on the Government Front Bench who have no sense of social responsibility. A leader in <i>The Times</i> said that it is a social Bill with wider social implications, <i>The Economist</i>, which is a friend of the Government, said we should scrap the tax, and <i>The Times</i> said it should he scuppered in another place. But Conservative Members who have spoken against the Bill should not confine their courage to their voices. They should transfer it to their feet by joining us and voting against the Bill tonight.</p>

<p>I shall not detain the House for too long. After seven days on the Floor of the House and more than 140 hours in Committee debating numerous technical amendments and a number of welcome concessions, the community charge remains essentially the same as it leaves the House as it was when it entered this place.<br/>
The reason for that is not unexpected. We fought the last election on a manifesto that clearly stated that the community charge would be a fixed rate charge. On Second Reading, a substantial majority voted for the Bill. In Committee, although there were many Divisions, our majorities were large. Last Monday, on an amendment to change the basic idea behind the community charge, the Government's majority dropped, but it should never be forgotten that there was still a majority of 25 votes. Indeed, 320 of my hon. Friends supported the Government.<br/>
Finally, as the Bill goes to the other place, its opponents are clamouring for help. The alliance parties are inspiring the will of the House of Lords to do the work that could not be done in the House of Commons because this House did not approve changing the Bill. Lloyd George certainly must be smiling in his grave at the ironic position of the Opposition. The Labour party is clamouring for help from the House of Lords. The Labour party now must be

pleased that the proposed reform of that body by the right hon. Member for Chesterfield (Mr. Benn) never saw the light of day.<br/>
As the measure reaches the other place, the Lords should think very carefully before they try to do anything substantially to change the Bill. The legislation was in our manifesto on which we won the election. Many Conservative Members voted consistently for the Bill I advise the Lords not to jump in too quickly to thwart the will of the House.</p>

<p>The defects of the poll tax are innumerable. It is cumbersome to administer, it is more difficult to collect and it creates the bureaucratic burden of maintaining the poll tax legislation. The fact that today we have heard that the poll tax will be subject to a capping mechanism shows that the Government do not believe their own promise that it will make local government more accountable.<br/>
The poll tax will increase the temptation to avoid registering to vote. Above all, the tax is not fair. It is hitting the poorest people in our society the hardest. Only last week I was told by a wealthy single man with two homes that he stood to gain &#x00A3;2,500 as a result of the measure. The people in Greenwich will lose almost universally. A survey of 1,500 people shows that 93 per cent. of the people in Greenwich will lose and 62 per cent. of them will lose by more than &#x00A3;500 a year. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

<p>I voted against the Bill on Second Reading because I thought it a bad Bill and I should now like to see it dumped in the legislative dustbin from which its major provision came. The community charge is regressive, inefficient and unfair. The arguments in its favour were always thin and they have grown shabby and worn with repetition. Claims about increased accountability are wildly exaggerated and the statistics deployed in aid are, at best, questionable.<br/>
The poll tax is generally unpopular. The Committee and Report stages demonstrated that much of the Bill has been ill-prepared. The 11th hour concession about rebates was an inadequate response to the widespread desire, and our earlier commitment, that the new tax should take account of the ability of the individual or the household to pay. The circumstances surrounding this concession leave a nasty taste in one's mouth.<br/>
I regard the manifesto argument and justification as largely bogus. The issue was not generally discussed and debated at the general election. Indeed, Ministers were astonishingly reticent. or perhaps politically wise, in saying little about it. Some candidates, including myself, were careful to distance themselves from the proposal.<br/>
I cannot recall any other major measure introduced by a Conservative Government since Winston Churchill returned to power in 1951 which is as potentially damaging to the long-term interests of the Conservative party as this Bill. As I look at its intrinsic unfairness and its bureaucratic implications, I am sorry and ashamed that such a Bill should be introduced by Conservative Ministers. However, it is not really a Conservative measure, but rather a product of what is labelled by the media as Thatcherism.<br/>
Of course the Bill contains some useful provisions, but, in my judgment, these are insufficient to outweigh the fundamental flaws of this unfair community charge proposal. I shall vote against Third Reading.</p>

<p>The right hon. Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Sir B. Hayhoe) and the hon. Member for Milton Keynes (Mr. Benyon) have spoken perceptively about the political realities of what is going through. Even when the Bill staggers out of this House and into the other place, the debate will not end. It is only just beginning. It will continue for another two years in the country. Day by day, people learn more about the poll tax, and there is a straightforward progression in all of this. The more that they know about it, the more they are opposed to it.<br/>
The hon. Member for Banbury (Mr. Baldry) has been the only Tory Back-Bench Member to speak in favour of the Bill. I can use the script that he used, because I have here a brief from the Conservative reseach department. I recognised the phrases in it. It is a gullible's travels of the poll tax which gives the more gullible Conservative Members something to cling to. It says that the rates are anachronistic because they are a property tax. We do not believe that there is anything anachronistic about a property tax, and it is better to have an old but imperfect tax than an infinitely worse new tax. Tory Members are told to talk about lack of accountability and to tell people that nearly half of all local voters do not pay rates. That is a myth which appeals only to the simple-minded who believe that the only person to pay the rates is the one whose name happens to be on the rates demand.<br/>
Tories are told to go forth and tell the public that the rates are unfair and that a poor widow&#x2014;presumably the same one who has just been hit by housing benefit cuts &#x2014;pays the same as four adults. However, they are not to go forth and say that in future, under the poll tax, a millionaire will pay a quarter of what four poor adults will pay.<br/>
Conservatives are supposed to go forth and tell people that domestic rates are highly complex. However, they will not go forth and tell people that domestic rates are a model of clarity, compared with the Kafkaesque poll tax. Those are the facts. Eighty per cent. of the people in Scotland have come to despise the poll tax and its architects. The same process will take place in England and Wales.<br/>
The poll tax is wicked. It was conceived by people with no social concern, backed by people who do not have the independence of mind to think for themselves. The poll tax will be defeated, if not in this House, in the country. The people who have imposed the poll tax will be defeated with it.</p>

The House and the nation have a right to know what the Labour party intends to foist on the nation if we are ever so unlucky as to elect a Labour Government.<br/>
The Labour party is afeared. It is afeared that it can no longer foist large business rates on an unsuspecting business community. It is afeared that it can no longer foist heavy rate rises on the community knowing that in many areas only one in four voters actually pays rates.<br/>
The Labour party is afeared. This is an historic moment. The community charge will be based on people's ability to pay because three quarters of the cost will be accounted for by business and taxation.

There is no member of the Cabinet on the Government Front Bench except the Secretary of State for the Environment. Ministers are distancing themselves as far from this Bill as possible.<br/>
This Bill is the Tory flagship. The flagship will sink as a result of design defects as the flagship of the Royal Swedish navy sank as it left the harbour in 1628 because of design defects. The Bill is flawed. It is unfair and undemocratic. Indeed, it is anti-democratic in its drafting. It is also, of course, anti-local government from the first clause to the last.<br/>
Conservative Members have refused to defend any kind of independent local government system in this country. Five million adults in England will lose under the poll tax, including 1 million single pensioners. Those are the consequences awaiting this flagship.<br/>
Someone referred to concessions. We still do not know whether monks and nuns will be on rebates or exempt from the tax. The Government have lost the argument. Day in, clause in, and day out, clause out, they have lost the argument.<br/>
Every day over the past week, different Conservative Members voted against the Bill. The Bill would not pass on a free or secret vote. I challenge any Minister who contradicts that to raise his hand.<br/>
Our opposition has been positive and honourable. We have promoted amendments to the Bill to change the nature of the tax to make it fairer. We are promoting amendments to the Bill to change the nature of the tax, to make it fairer. We have promoted amendments to relate the tax to income, and to keep part of local government taxation related to property. At every juncture, the Government have rubbished each alternative. They have rubbished also the alternative put forward by their own Back Benchers. They have twisted the figures for exemption on every occasion that they have been put forward by the Opposition.<br/>
The words of a Conservative Member should be borne in mind; nobody will be able to accuse the Opposition&#x2014;&#x2014;</p>

<p>No one will be able to accuse any Opposition party of seeking to make crude party political capital out of this Bill. We do not want this Bill. As I said on Second Reading, we do not want the Bill, even though it will damage the Government to the point that they will lose the next election. We care about the detail but we do not want the Bill. That is why we have suggested alternatives. We have no secret desire to see the Bill on the statute book to the advantage of our party. Conservative Members may jest and laugh, but for them there is no long-stop down that Corridor. Whatever they may feel in their hearts, they will not deliver. The Bill will get its Third Reading, whatever the majority. However, I tell the Government that this Bill will bury them.</p>

<p>I intended responding to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Rooker) by remarking on the absence from the Opposition Front Bench of members of the shadow Cabinet. However, I would have been doing the hon. Gentleman an injustice because a couple of minutes ago there crept into the recesses of the Chamber, and can still be seen hidden, none other than the right hon. Gentleman the deputy leader of the Opposition, the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook (Mr. Hattersley). It was he who described the opposition of his party to this Bill as vacuous&#x2014;not honourable and positive as was suggested by the hon. Member for Perry Barr, but vacuous, because the Opposition failed to put forward a policy of their own.<br/>
The Bill has occupied the attention of the House for a total of 188 hours. During the whole of our debate there has been one issue upon which almost all of us have been in complete agreement: we cannot continue with the existing system of paying for local government&#x2014;the status quo is not an option. Change is urgently required, and only the Government had the courage to put to the people of this country specific proposals for change.<br/>
We had two objectives in seeking to reform the way in which we pay for local government. The need for accountability was recognised as long ago as 1966, when the Labour Government White Paper complained that many people who could afford to pay for local government made no contribution. The fact is that one will never achieve accountability in local government until everyone makes a direct contribution towards the cost of local authority services. The community charge, and only the community charge, fulfils that objective. We believe that a standard level of service should cost the same in every local authority area in the country. That is what the community charge, and only the community charge, will achieve. We believe that any variations in local spending should be paid for by the local communities that benefit from that spending. That is what the community charge, and only the community charge, will achieve.<br/>
For years there has been a clamour across the party divide for an end to the domestic rating system. There is only one difference between ourselves and the Opposition parties. It is not that only the Government see the need for reform; it is that only the Government have the courage and determination to carry out that reform. It is reform

that will be good for local communities, good for local government, and good for the people of this country. I commend it to the House.</p>

<speech hansard_id="551705" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-04-25a.155.1" hansard_membership_id="129" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3141" speakername="Mr. William O'Brien" colnum="155" time="22:15:00">
<p>I beg to move,
<q>That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, praying that the Local Government (Prescribed Expenditure) (Amendment) Regulations 1988 (S.I., 1988, No. 434), dated 9th March 1988, a copy of which was laid before this House on 9th March, be annulled.</q>
My reason for moving the motion is that on 9 March the Secretary of State announced that he intended to introduce further measures to restrict local authority capital borrowing expenditure. He said:
<q>a minority of local authorities are employing artificial devices to incur capital expenditure and to undertake borrowing over and above the levels permitted to them under the existing capital control system."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9 March 1988; Vo. 129, column 326.]</q>
That was the Secretary of State's reason for bringing in the new measures. Again, the right hon. Gentleman is taking panic measures against local authorities, because councillors have found ways of providing for their constituents services that in many instances are important and necessary to maintain and to provide a worthy and Christian way of life in their communities. Tonight, the Secretary of State informed the House of further changes. His statement that he did not know what was happening further demonstrates the panic that the Government are in.<br/>
Furthermore, the new regulations come only three months after the Local Government (Prescribed Expenditure) (Consolidation and Amendment) Regulations 1987&#x2014;statutory instrument No. 2186 of 1987. The financing devices that were under attack in the new regulations did not suddenly come to the Government's attention. The regulations suddenly became necessary through a lack of foresight and the crisis of management facing the Government. Hon. Members will recall that, only a few months ago, the Secretary of State said that he was the only person who understood local government finance. Tonight, he admitted that he does not have a clue. He does not know what is going on.<br/>
It has been accepted that several local authorities checked with the Department of the Environment before entering into any barter deals and schemes with private organisations. The Secretary of State told the House tonight that he did not know what was happening. That is a measure of how much the Secretary of State realises what is taking place in his Department.<br/>
Obviously, the advice that was given to local authorities was affirmative, and they proceeded in accordance with that advice. The Secretary of State then said that he knew nothing about what was happening. In fact, more than 250 local authorities could be affected by the move that was presented by the Secretary of State. As a result of the new regulations, several local authorities will incur prescribed expenditure set out in agreements that have already been entered into.<br/>
The Government have promised to consider issuing more additional capital allocations when the Secretary of State is satisfied that agreements were not entered into for the purpose of evading capital expenditure borrowing controls. We are curious to learn from the Secretary of State how he intends to decide on the imperfections of

local authorities, and what information he has about the issuing of additional borrowing powers and to which authorities.<br/>
The Secretary of State said that there were no facts given on the issue. However, local authorities will be asking whether their particular schemes will be included in the exemptions that were announced by the Secretary of State. The Department of the Environment accepted that almost one third of local authorities could be affected by these regulations, where barter deals have been entered into. As I said, many authorities checked with the Department of the Environment on the schemes that they were considering before entering into any deals with the private sector. The action of the Secretary of State affects large and small authorities alike.<br/>
Cheltenham borough council intended to raise funds to provide a flood relief and draining scheme in their area. That was to be done by lease and leaseback deals, using a swimming pool complex to raise the funds. That is quite legitimate, but, because of the Secretary of State's action, that council will have to look for alternatives. It was not possible for Cheltenham borough council to find that amount of money from their allocations or capital receipts.<br/>
Gloucester city council had to stop a &#x00A3;5 million housing development on a former allotment site. That, again, was a necessary scheme. It will now have to find other means of raising funds for the scheme because of the Government cuts, both in the housing improvement programme and the housing investment programme, and because of the regulations that the Secretary of State announced that he would introduce.<br/>
Those schemes, and many others, were genuine capital schemes. The capital being raised was to fund existing capital programmes and not, as the Secretary of State implies, to bridge deficits in the revenue account.<br/>
Furthermore, local authorities are only copying the Government's attitude in using the assets available to them to finance other policies. The Secretary of State said that councils should transfer their asset base to the private sector. That is exactly what local authorities have been doing. It is devastating for people who serve on local councils, and wish to provide services for their communities, to discover that the Government are reneging on their advice to local government that it should be looking for other forms of financing capital schemes and that the private sector should be taken into consideration and into partnership.<br/>
I wish to question the Under-Secretary of State about the concessions that the Secretary of State said are to be made to local authorities. Wakefield district council, in the area I represent, used to boast of being the centre of the mining industry. However, over the past nine years we have watched the demise of the mining industry in west Yorkshire and, because of that demise, the district council wanted to retain some of the history of mining in the Wakefield area. With the co-operation of British Coal and other bodies, it was agreed to turn one of the smaller pits, which had closed, into a mining museum.<br/>
Caphouse colliery is a small colliery in West Yorkshire. It is a shallow pit, which is to be developed as a mining museum. The trust that was set up to develop the Caphouse colliery scheme applied to the European Community for a grant and was promised that a grant would be made. Suffice it to say that the Department of the Environment has told Wakefield district council that if the


application for the grant is approved and the grant is obtained, the council will have to give up an equivalent amount of loan sanction to cover it.<br/>
I ask the Under-Secretary whether the anomalous rules that the Government are introducing mean that that grant will count against that council's prescribed expenditure allocation. In other words, will Wakefield district council come under the provisions of the proposals that the Secretary of State has outlined, or will the grant that would be forthcoming from the EEC count against the capital borrowing levels of Wakefield district council? That issue can be mirrored in many other local authorities which are in the same situation of trying to develop something in their area under the barter system or the lease and leaseback arrangements.<br/>
I must also draw attention to the grotesque report that was issued by the Government on 9 March to try to substantiate their action in changing the law on capital spending. The chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, Councillor Jack Layden, made it clear in his letter to the Secretary of State on 22 March that the statement that was issued by the Secretary of State was dramatically misleading.<br/>
Southwark's reply to the Secretary of State's statement was that the statement
<q>could not be much further from the truth.</q>
Richmond's reply was
<q>Mr. Ridley's statement is entirely inaccurate as far as the reference to this council is concerned.</q>
Coventry replied:
<q>The statement contains a serious inaccuracy.</q>
Manchester replied:
<q>The Department should have been able to get the facts right</q>
<q>and stated that everything was discussed in public.</q>
Brighton replied:
<q>The section in the document is inaccurate and we have written to the Secretary of State to point this out.</q>
In other words, the Secretary of State's statement was totally misleading, and inaccurate in many ways and should have been withdrawn at the very beginning. It is true that my report does not suit Conservative Members, but those are the facts. Local authorities are still waiting for replies to the points that they have made about the Secretary of State's statement.<br/>
I draw attention to the report of the Audit Commission entitled "Local Authority Property &#x2014;A Management Overview." Paragraph 33 states:
<q>Resources necessarily tied up in property could be released to generate capital receipts. At a time of increasing pressure on resources it is vital that authorities seek to augment their capital allocations whenever possible. Despite restrictions on the use of capital receipts, they are still worth having.</q>
Paragraph 26 states:
<q>Capital receipts can also be used for the redemption of debt thus also bringing revenue benefits. A balance therefore needs to be struck between investing in the life of the asset and other conflicting demands.</q>
At paragraph 44, the Audit Commission states:
<q>Central government ought to place more emphasis on `carrots' rather than 'sticks'. Incentives to develop under-used land could be improved by changes to the system of capital controls.</q>
The Audit Commission is advising the Government that there is more to be gained from using incentives and offering support and carrots than from trying to beat local authorities with sticks, which is what the Secretary of State has been attempting to do for some considerable time.<br/>
The digest issued by the Association of District Councils refers to 150 district council projects which are in jeopardy because of the Secretary of State's proposed amendments to the new regulations. Of those, at least 31 are leisure schemes, more than 30 are housing schemes and a great many are to provide facilities for the elderly and the disabled.<br/>
The district councils are embarking on schemes to provide necessary facilities for their communities. Many involve development for industry, many provide office accommodation to release high-rented accommodation, some provide new market facilities in the communities and there are a host of other proposals. The majority of district councils are Tory-controlled or have no overall majority, so it is not Labour-controlled authorities that are pressing the Government for amendments to their regulations.<br/>
In view of what the Secretary of State said tonight, the most appropriate action is to withdraw the regulations. I ask the Minister to withdraw them. If he will not, I ask the House to reject them.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="551707" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-04-25a.158.0" hansard_membership_id="4296" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/14743" speakername="Sir John Farr" colnum="158" time="22:32:00">
<p>I cannot say that I give an enthusiastic welcome to these regulations, for many of the reasons which the hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) described and particularly because of their impact, which is unfair and harsh, on my district council. It is a modest, prudent, well-run, economically conducted affair, yet it finds these regulations wholly unacceptable.<br/>
I shall highlight one or two points in the letter I received today from the chief executive. He states:
<q>In view of the progressive decline in the annual housing and other services block capital allocations over recent years the Council has had to seek various ways and means to enable its high priority schemes to proceed. Some major projects have been by means of 'advanced payments schemes' but, of course such devices were blocked by the earlier Government controls introduced about a year ago.</q>
Accordingly, more recently and within the law, my district council
<q>decided to engage in a 'barter scheme' by the sale of existing Council mortgages to achieve a barter arrangement in conjunction with CIPFA Services Limited. This arrangement was due to have financed two small housing schemes for elderly persons' bungalows"&#x2014;</q>
the sort of project that one would imagine all sides of the House would welcome&#x2014;
<q>at a total cost of &#x00A3;400,000, in villages in which the Council had made no previous housing provision. The barter scheme was also intended to allow the Council to provide a sports pavilion, at a cost of &#x00A3;160,000, for a 50 acre multi-pitch sports ground which the Council has recently acquired after many years of negotiation with a multiplicity of owners.</q>
Such worthy projects will be blocked as a results of the regulations that we are discussing.
<q>The latest capital expenditure controls also appear likely to block a scheme for bungalow provision for the elderly in another village where the Council intended to sell part of the housing site to a private developer in consideration of the developer building a small group of elderly persons' bungalows for the Council.</q>
That scheme has been in the pipeline for many years and had unanimous support. As a result of inadequate housing investment allocation and limitation on the use of capital receipts, it has proceeded no further.<br/>
My council and I also believe that two further worthwhile projects will be prejudiced if the regulations re passed tonight. The first is a scheme relating to the provision of another group of bungalows for the elderly


under council control. In addition to that, the council has been negotiating to exchange land to provide sites for car parking and recreation.<br/>
Initially, it was difficult to believe that such modest requirements in the conduct of model local government should be blocked by any Government at Whitehall. Apparently the new proposals will prevent such exchanges. My council's chief executive has been in touch with the Department of the Environment and it has suggested that the council will be caught and prevented from proceeding with the schemes.<br/>
I want the Minister to explain why such model schemes designed to help elderly people and improve the running of small towns by the provision of additional car parking are to be blocked by the regulations.<br/>
My council would prefer not to resort to "unorthodox" means of financing capital schemes. The chief executive has, however, pointed out:
<q>with the Housing Capital Allocation for 1988&#x2013;89 at &#x00A3;640,000 and the Other Services Block Allocation at &#x00A3;171,000 it will be evident that capital investment is gradually nearing a standstill, even though the prescribed proportion of capital receipts now produces annually a spending potential almost double the capital allocations.</q>
In recent years, Harborough district council has been a model of well-conducted local government. In deference to Government pressure and as a result of declining means of finance since the introduction of the Local Government Planning and Land (No. 2) Act 1980, it has rephased or eliminated many other capital projects.<br/>
It will be obvious to the House that the particular schemes that I have mentioned were regarded as high priority by the council. I find it difficult to believe that it is the intention of the regulations to hamper good local government in such a way. I hope that when my hon. Friend replies he will give me answers that are sufficient to convince me to follow him into the Division Lobby.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="551709" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-04-25a.159.0" hansard_membership_id="148" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/3179" speakername="Mr. Peter L. Pike" colnum="159" time="22:39:00">
<p>This important debate is on a set of regulations that is another example of the Government's determination to clamp down on local government's ability to deal with its present problems. To some extent, local authorities have had to use such means to finance projects in their areas because of the Government's controls on capital expenditure. By introducing legislation on the powers of local authorities and their means of raising finance, the Government have repeatedly attacked and restricted their ability to function. This is yet another example.<br/>
When the Secretary of State spoke earlier about the poll tax Bill, he made it clear that when he made his statement in March he did not realise the exact position. As it is becoming increasingly clear that this means of financing local government expenditure is being used by local authorities of all political persuasions, the Government should be prepared to think again about the regulations. The Association of District Councils has said that the regulations will jeopardise 150 district council projects. That must worry the Government.<br/>
As local authorities can use only a limited amount of their capital receipts, the Government must realise the problems that they are creating. The regulations would affect the ability of local authorities to tackle some of the

Government's so-called priorities on housing problems and urban decay. Since the general election, they have said much about tackling the problems of the inner cities, yet the regulations would make the task even more difficult.<br/>
The hon. Member for Harborough (Sir J. Farr) mentioned the problems that would be created in his constituency, and in the earlier debate the hon. Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) listed the range of problems that would be created in his local borough if the Government do not change their mind. I hope that the Minister will respond to one or two points that I shall make about Burnley.<br/>
A few years ago, Burnley sold more than 100 unmodernised semi-detached council houses to Wimpey. The intention was to renovate the houses and sell them in the private sector, but most of them had been empty for some time. Instead of taking cash for those houses, because the council could have spent only 20 per cent. of it, it agreed that Wimpey should modernise 12 houses that remained in council ownership. It meant that 12 families could have their houses modernised immediately, instead of the smaller number whose houses could have been modernised by the limited amount of capital receipts that the council could have spent.<br/>
The chief executive officer of Burnley borough council told me that it is involved in a neighbourhood revitalisation scheme in conjunction with the Government. Indeed, the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mrs. Roe) visited the area recently to examine the problems of the Hargher Clough and Stoops estates. Those schemes could also be affected if the Government are not prepared to consider sensibly how they will be financed.<br/>
The central area of Burnley also needs modernisation, and we must deal with the car parking problems in the town centre. Those examples are similar to those cited by Conservative Members. It seems sensible that local authorities should be able to deal with the problems; let us have regeneration rather than allowing dereliction and decay.<br/>
The Government repeatedly say that local government and the private sector should work together. Surely such schemes are a good example of local authorities and the private sector working together to deal with problems in their areas. The chief executive pointed out to me a scheme in the neighbouring authority of Pendle. The authority is to form a company and take a lease or enter a leaseback arrangement to enable it to build a swimming bath. That scheme, too, could be jeopardised if we continue to move in this direction. The regulations have nothing to commend them; they do nothing to enable local authorities to deal with their problems. They will serve only to ensure that the problems get worse rather than tackling them now.<br/>
I hope that the Minister will think again. As I said, the Secretary of State made it clear that much more information had come to his attention since he made his statement in March. In the earlier debate, the Minister said that he would grant two concessions to the schemes in the pipeline, but that does not mean that similar schemes will be able to go ahead in future. The Minister may have faced up to reality with regard to schemes that have already been negotiated or are being negotiated now and may have solved the problems they pose, but if he believes that they are valid and justified now, he ought to permit similar


schemes in future. If he does not do that, he must once again accept responsibility for creating problems for local government.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="551711" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-04-25a.161.0" hansard_membership_id="1693" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2491" speakername="Mr. John Butterfill" colnum="161" time="22:47:00">
<p>One of the principal problems that the Government faced when they came to power was the indebtedness, not just of national Government but, significantly, of local authorities, particularly as local authorities account for 25 per cent. of all public expenditure. It is significant that, when the controls on the use of capital receipts were first introduced, many local authorities asked, "Why should we not be able to spend the money that we receive from the sale of assets? It is our money and we have it there in the bank." But of course, they did not have the money in the bank. Had they paid the money into the bank, they would only have reduced their indebtedness. That is true of local authorities up and down the land. They are all heavily borrowed and there is a need to reduce the amounts that they borrow. That is why the Government rightly introduced controls on the use of capital receipts.<br/>
The measures that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State introduced on 9 March proved to be absolutely right. It was necessary to introduce them to ascertain the scale of avoidance of the capital receipts rules through the use of barter. My right hon. Friend has done the nation a great service by introducing the regulations.<br/>
Nevertheless, my right hon. Friend was absolutely right to respond, as he did earlier this evening, to the particular problems that have been revealed in many places, arising from the regulations. It was right, for example, to make exemptions to allow local authorities to deal with existing unavoidable contractual arrangements. It was right, too, to examine individual proposals for expenditure&#x2014;par-ticularly where those were necessary to achieve comprehensive redevelopment or to assist in land assembly or with similar problems.<br/>
I thank the Secretary of State for his action, which has been very helpful to my own constituency of Bournemouth, West. My hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Atkinson) and I have made a number of representations to the Secretary of State about particular projects in Bournemouth. One was the major redevelopment of an area in Boscombe in which the council was involved in a major programme of land assembly and in promoting with private interests the redevelopment of a rundown area. That was absolutely right and I hope that it will fall precisely within the exemptions that my right hon. Friend has announced.<br/>
The other proposal was to refurbish the pavilion in Bournemouth. Again, we proceeded with a partial privatisation of that asset, which all Conservative Members think is entirely laudable. I hope that that project will also fall within the terms of the exemptions announced by my right hon. Friend.<br/>
In general, the principle that we need to control public expenditure must be right. In particular, we need to take action where it is clear that avoidance measures are being taken by some local authorities that do not accept the need for such control. The regulations laid before the House on 9 March by my right hon. Friend are right and have been proved right by subsequent events.</p>
</speech>
<speech hansard_id="551713" id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/1988-04-25a.162.0" hansard_membership_id="6662" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2863" speakername="Mr. Simon Hughes" colnum="162" time="22:50:00">
<p>In a way this is part two of the debate on the Local Government Finance Bill, because earlier we talked about new clauses to do with barter, and we are now talking about regulations to do with leaseback. I shall join other hon. Members in praying against the regulations.<br/>
Two sorts of arrangements will be caught by the regulations if they are approved by the House. One is sale and leaseback and the other is lease and leaseback. I entirely understand the Government's general economic policy, about which the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) has just spoken. I ask the hon. Gentleman to consider that in many respects, and not just for specific constituency reasons that we put forward when we seek to have an exemption granted, it would be quite consistent for him to argue the Government's policy while at the same time opposing the regulations. I hope that at least I have the hon. Gentleman's understanding of that.<br/>
One cannot be dogmatic in asserting that leaseback arrangements need necessarily mortgage the future or the massive increase in public expenditure that the hon. Member for Bournemouth, West implied in his speech. We do not take the view that one ought to condone leaseback schemes that allow the elected representative of tomorrow to charge their poll tax payers a massive amount for the expenditure of today.<br/>
There can be perfectly reasonable leaseback schemes in which the method of arranging the lease and the finance does not build up the cost towards the end of the term. The cost is charged reasonably at the beginning, when people pay for what they receive. Many local authorities, mainly metropolitan authorities, will be caught by these arrangements, and not all those authorities are controlled by the same party. Outside London, Doncaster and Newcastle will be caught. Inside London, Greenwich, Lewisham and Southwark, which are Labour-controlled, will be caught, as will Merton and Westminster which are controlled by the Conservatives, and Tower Hamlets and Richmond which are controlled by my colleagues.<br/>
All those authorities have schemes that were worked out over months or years with Government approval, and different arrangements were made along the lines that the Government said they were keen to support. Sometimes it is necessary to go further and to do a true sale or leaseback in order to raise money to meet the bills of today. When the Government impose enormous cuts on local government, that often drives local authorities to extreme positions.<br/>
Of course, the capital control system is the main reason for councils trying to be creative and to get around the controls. Like other hon. Members, I have always accepted that there must be an upper limit on capital expenditure and that the Government must set reasonable parameters. However, example by example, scheme by scheme, lease by lease is not the way in which the controls should be implemented.<br/>
I shall make a couple of points that, as far as I am aware, have not been made. First, I resent the fact that the scheme has not been subject to prior consultation. The Minister will know that in the past there has been consultation. I know that his first line of reply will be to say that this is a temporary scheme which runs only until October and that the regulations have a limited life and will have to be renewed. I understand that, but I can tell


the Minister and the hon. Member for Harborough (Sir J. Farr) whose speech I heard and understood, that the legal advice received by some councils suggests that, even in these regulations, the Government may be acting illegally.<br/>
I say that carefully. I do not make an allegation wildly but on the basis that it has been held in advance that regulations brought about without consultation and which would act to the severe detriment of local authorities who had entered into arrangements on the basis of expectation and prior practice could well be illegal. I warn the Government about that and hope that they do not find themselves in the same political difficulty as in the past when they have brought to the House measures which were later held to be illegal by the courts.<br/>
Secondly, I must repeat the complaint by the hon. Member for Copeland (Dr. Cunningham) in the earlier debate. My research assistant wrote to the private secretary of the Secretary of State following the announcement of 9 March and she replied&#x2014;no doubt in similar terms to the reply given to the hon. Member for Copeland&#x2014;enclosing a copy of the notes which the press officers gave to
<q>members of the Press who asked for examples of the kind of local authority schemes which might be affected</q>
The words ring amusingly hollow. It continued:
<q>This was not a note prepared with formal distribution in mind.</q>
The next day it managed to get into the papers, including <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, the local papers in Southwark and Richmond and many others.<br/>
The trouble is that what was asserted was patently untrue. It is extremely poor practice for the Government to distribute to the press&#x2014;although it was not an official document marked, "Press release from the DOE"&#x2014;a list of facts and assertions about practices in local authorities which are inaccurate or insubstantial. Will the Minister explain how that came about? I have no doubt that those allegations, probably from Conservative party political sources, were disseminated and publicised unchecked and gave many of the councils concerned&#x2014;including Conservative councils&#x2014;a bad name.<br/>
Richmond, a council run by my party, was in that list. <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> stated:
<q>Richmond-upon-Thames planned to raise &#x00A3;10 million to finance a leisure complex by leaseback of assets.</q>
Richmond has not attempted to raise money for a leisure complex by a leaseback scheme. The reference is entirely erroneous.<br/>
Tower Hamlets has two leaseback schemes which have had to be abandoned as a result of the 9 March statement. The first involved buying accommodation for providing temporary housing for homeless families before they were rehoused permanently in ordinary council stock. The temporary accommodation was outside the borough. Such accommodation can be used only in ways of which the Government approve. Tower Hamlets would have been doing just what the Government have been asking it to do &#x2014;provide units for large families averaging six members and involving in total to 2,400 people. It would have been cheaper than bed and breakfast and would have used private finance.<br/>
The second scheme was to set up an "arm's-length" development company in Globe Town which would raise private money to buy sites locally which would be sold to

housing associations and then leased back to the council. In this case, &#x00A3;300 million expenditure would have provided 800 homes for shared ownership schemes over three years and 300 to 400 ordinary rented homes for people in Tower Hamlets.<br/>
The great problem is that, if those schemes, or any others, are caught under the Government's proposals, the councils have to seek exemption. The theory is fine, but the reality is that sometimes, it never happens administratively, I can give a specific example to show that the after-the-event approval is not working, and things have clogged up in Marsham street. In February 1987, certain schemes were outlawed&#x2014;for example, some in Tower Hamlets. The council sought approval for a scheme&#x2014;the Minister may know it&#x2014;involving the National Leasing and Finance Co., Merrill Lynch and the United Kingdom Housing Trust Ltd. As of today, 14 months after the request, no answer has been received.<br/>
Tower Hamlets wrote to the Department of the Environment seeking an exemption on 13 February 1987, received no reply, chased it on 3 April, received a holding reply on 8 April, heard no more. I raised it when I went with a deputation in the autumn; there was a letter back from the Department on 19 November, saying that it was seeking legal advice, and would be writing again. Tower Hamlets has still heard nothing, 14 months after asking for an exemption for a scheme that the Government encouraged. It is not acceptable for the Government to change the rules to say that they will make the decision and then not to decide anything. This scheme would have allowed a &#x00A3;50 million rented housing scheme, but it cannot happen.<br/>
I shall give an example from my constituency, to pre-empt what might otherwise be a similar delay. Southwark was mentioned in this list of what was envisaged by local councils. The article claimed:
<q>Southwark raised &#x00A3;30 million by leaseback of offices and fixtures and fittings in council houses. The deal will cost &#x00A3;96 million over 20 years.</q>
Sadly, that, too, was completely false. Southwark did not raise the money, the scheme did not involve the leaseback, of council house fixtures and fittings, and money was to be used not for revenue purposes but as capital resources. The important thing is that Southwark is affected, because the announcement on 9 March has frozen expenditure, so all capital schemes have had a moratorium placed on them.<br/>
This is an excellent scheme that the Government have applauded as a partnership between the London docklands corporation, the council, the Housing Corporation, the Nationwide building society and Barratts. The Amos estate is the place, in the old, downtown area of Southwark docks. This is just the sort of scheme which the Government have smiled upon and encouraged. It involved a public, voluntary and private sector partnership, with the knowledge of the previous Minister for Housing, and approval intimated by officials.<br/>
The scheme was agreed and signed in September, and it was due to be opened by the Queen Mother in June. Now, it has effectively been banned retrospectively. This is ludicrous. We cannot do anything to help that, but although my constituents and my local council do not agree on everything, like any logical people, we ask the Government to get their act together, instead of producing regulations that ban a scheme that they have encouraged, and which partnership deals have been implemented, that is ready to go and due to be opened.<br/>
I hope that the Government will look at schemes such as that in the Amos estate in Southwark and realise that this sort of ex post facto legislation banning the lot and then seeking to undo the effects is the wrong way round. Leaseback, and sale and leaseback, can be a perfectly reasonable way forward. For heaven's sake, will Ministers not be so paranoid about local government?</p>

<p>I second all that my hon. Friend the Member for Bournemouth, West (Mr. Butterfill) said, no doubt with a great deal more eloquence than I can command. He raised an important point: some quarter of all Government expenditure in this sector is conducted by local authorities, so we must examine it. After listening for the last half-hour, I wonder whether there is any form of control over local government expenditure that Opposition Members consider right and proper. We heard something from their Front Bench about a carrot. Carrots help one to see in the dark, and that would be an asset in the activities that Labour councils control.<br/>
I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to look at the difference between those local authorities that are selling or leasing assets merely to balance the books and those that are doing it to achieve some form of capital expenditure as they carry out many forms of worthwhile activities, particularly those authorised under the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 and subsequent Acts. I believe that there are many enabling powers that we do not want to hamper.<br/>
I listened with great interest to details of the new scheme this afternoon and especially to the third part, or that part of it I could hear&#x2014;I will read the report in <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow with interest&#x2014;about the assets that can be finished and then owned or managed by the private sector. Perhaps my hon. Friend the Minister can tell me when he replies whether the private sector will include building societies and housing corporations. Will they be able to take over the activities from local authorities?<br/>
I would have thought that these measures would have satisfied all but the most avid empire-builder in local authorities. They leave a great deal of scope and I welcome them. I also suggest that Opposition Members should not criticise any part of the proposals until they are quite sure that local authorities in their constituencies do not have scores of empty council houses.</p>

<p>These regulations are a clear example of the Government believing in their own propaganda. They are an example of the Government legislating in haste and repenting at leisure.<br/>
As my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) said earlier, local authorities have got themselves into this situation not because they are wilful, or spendthrift or because they like dancing rings around the civil servants at the Department of the Environment, but because they have been forced into it by the circumstances imposed on them by central Government policies.<br/>
The Government have been panicked by what they have read in the newspapers. The mealy-mouthed comments, innuendos and downright lies now seem to inspire the Government in terms of their relationship with

local government and it is causing them to make asses of themselves. That is precisely what the Government have been doing over this measure.<br/>
The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) spoke in that vein, as if this matter dealt with intransigent local authorities that just wanted to carry on spending money for the sake of it. I do not know what experience the hon. Gentleman has of local government. However, I want to inform the Minister that a whole range of Labour-controlled authorities in London have viable schemes which might now be threatened&#x2014;although we cannot be sure whether they are threatened because further changes were announced earlier this evening.<br/>
We have already heard a litany of complaints from Conservative Members about how their local authorities will be affected. I hope that the Minister was able to listen to his hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (Mr. Winterton) who described the kind of schemes that would be caught. I also hope that the Minister heard the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Hannam) detailing the schemes that might now be jeopardised by the Government's proposals.</p>

<p>My hon. Friend may recall that one of the schemes referred to was intended to solve the problem of Airey houses and homes that have been classified as defective by the Government. Will my hon. Friend care to remind the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman), who referred to scores and scores of empty council houses, that one of the great problems has been defective houses which councils have not been able to improve because no system has existed to enable them to do so? When people have bought those houses, they have been blighted because mortgage companies would not give mortgages for them unless the authorities could find solutions to those problems. It comes a little cheap from Conservative Members to refer to houses being boarded up if they do not look at the facts and the evidence and without providing the funds to do something about the problem.</p>

<p>I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. This is an example of Conservative Members speaking from the depths of their prejudices and bigotry rather than from the experience that Opposition Members and others have of the problems that we have to confront in the inner cities.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) mentioned a problem that also exists in the London borough of Newham where there are Taylor Woodrow Anglian blocks. Ronan Point is in the constituency of Newham, South. A development brief has been issued for the disposal and development of those blocks. They are all empty: 800 units of accommodation are now void because they are unsafe and cannot be used. Therefore, the council has become involved in a proposal that could involve an element of barter. I want to know from the Minister whether that particular scheme in the London borough of Newham involving the Taylor Woodrow Anglian blocks, which he knows much about, will go ahead under his new proposals.<br/>
I turn now to some of the "wilful" schemes in Labour boroughs. Hammersmith and Fulham council made a last-minute bid to escape the deadline and on the night of 9 March it entered into a &#x00A3;25 million deal which involved retaining the freehold on non-residential property and leasing it back through a company wholly owned by the


council. The money will be used both to refurbish existing housing stocks and to build new houses; what a waste of money&#x2014;seeking to improve existing homes and build new ones. What an irresponsible council Hammersmith and Fulham has become! I mention also its 1988&#x2013;89 HIP allocation of &#x00A3;14&#x00B7;3 million and its estimated bed-and-breakfast bill of &#x00A3;7 million. What do Conservative Members know about the problems that confront councils serving London's inner-city areas?<br/>
Haringey has been caught with a scheme comprising 45 units of accommodation, all destined for use as temporary housing. Lewisham has a scheme of 48 one and two-bedrooms flats caught by the rule change. It is another of the boroughs that now finds that it must allocate all its housing to homeless families, with the remainder going to urgent transfer cases. Those are the problems with which London local authorities are trying to deal, and by using the very schemes and arrangements which the Government and Conservative Members roundly condemn, without knowing precisely why they were proposed.<br/>
Before the Minister attempts to defend the indefensible, I may ask him what will be the situation for a number of the schemes in Newham. We have short-term private property having leases of from five to 10 years for the homeless. We have also the leases of office accommodation for more than three years, and leases and leaseback deals for newly built housing with housing associations or developers&#x2014;for example, the Winsor and Moore Paragon schemes. Then there are the barter deals; package deals with developers, whereby the council receives land, works or buildings as part of the package; package deals undertaken through the medium of a private company, whereby land, works and so on are funded by private finance; and other developments with private developers, whereby the council receives land or works, depending on how the legislation is drawn up.<br/>
Those are just some examples, and while it sticks in the throats of many Labour local authorities to make so many deals in the private sector, they do so because they wish to look after the interests of the people in their boroughs. It is for that reason that they will sit down and sup with the devil&#x2014;and that includes the Secretary of State, who would perhaps be an even less attractive proposition as a dinner companion than the devil himself.<br/>
With regard to private sector leasing, Newham's current policy is to lease private properties for the homeless for a period of between five and 10 years, without needing&#x2014;at present&#x2014;to use any capital resources. As from 10 March 1988, such leases will result in prescribed expenditure to the full freehold value. Newham's schemes are designed not to get around capital controls but to alleviate the homeless crisis that exists there. It is a major crisis. In 1983&#x2013;84, Newham was spending only &#x00A3;52,000 per year on bed-and-breakfast charges. In 1987&#x2013;88, that increased to more than &#x00A3;5 million. The borough must do something to deal with that grave social problem, which afflicts not only Newham but the whole of London's inner city.<br/>
The Government deny councils the resources to deal with the problem on the ground, as it were, by building new council accommodation. However, councils are bound to enter into such arrangements and it would be a dereliction of their duty if they did not do so. I hope that

when the Minister replies he will say that where a borough such as Newham has made barter or leaseback deals to deal honestly with its housing problem, those schemes will be approved by the Department of the Environment.<br/>
I have already mentioned the Taylor Woodrow-Anglian blocks. Let me also mention the Woodlands estate, the Upton park goods yard/Cleves road development, and the docklands and other planning proposals. All are known to the Department. Letters have been going backwards and forwards. At least, they have been going towards the Department; we have not received many replies yet. Will the Minister give me an assurance that tomorrow he will go to his Department and ask his civil servants to dig out all correspondence relating to the various deals that have been received from the London borough of Newham, and that a speedy and urgent reply will result?<br/>
Earlier, the Secretary of State made it clear in a very disarming way that when the announcement was made on 9 March he did not know very much about the position. He now realises that it was not as he had thought: that it was not as he had read it in <i>The Sun</i>, the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the <i>Daily Express</i> and the <i>Evening Standard</i>. It did not resemble the propaganda put out by Conservative Central Office. It did not even resemble what had been caught up in the fevered minds of the right hon. Gentleman's colleagues on the Front Bench and at No. 10 Downing street.<br/>
It was a case of local authorities, both Conservative and Labour, trying to deal with the problems that now confront them&#x2014;many of those problems exacerbated by central Government policies. Because of the way that they have done this, they should gain the Government's support, not their opposition. I hope that the Minister will at least be able to tell me something good for once, so that I can go back and tell the people of Newham.</p>

<p>This is, in a sense, the second part of a debate that was started earlier this evening when we discussed the new clauses to the Local Government Finance Bill. Perhaps I could start by making some general remarks about the regulations, and then reply to the specific points that have been raised.<br/>
The regulations have two main purposes. First, they shorten from 20 years to three the maximum length of lease that is exempt from prescribed expenditure control. Secondly, they provide that certain capital receipts shall not give rise to additional spending within the capital control system.<br/>
It has been suggested that the regulations mark a major new restriction on local authority activity. That is not the case. The regulations are a response to a growth in local authority activity outside the capital control system. The previous regulations exempted from capital controls leases which were for less than 20 years, and which were not building leases in the sense that it was envisaged that buildings would be built on the land for the local authorities concerned.<br/>
If local authorities had been content to accept the spirit of the regulations then, there would have been no need for action. In the event, however, leasing has become a growth industry. We have seen a flurry of leases for a period of 20 years less one day, sometimes with recitals that it is the


intention of the parties that they should be renewed after 20 years. We have seen elaborate option agreements which appear to have no purpose other than to avoid the provisions on building leases.<br/>
The regulations therefore reduce the exemption period from 20 years to three. They also remove the exemption from leases that are part of a wider transaction. That leads me to the question of lease and leaseback.<br/>
I fully accept that lease and leaseback and sale and leaseback are well recognised commercial techniques. Their commercial purpose is well known. They are a means of allowing a loan to be raised on the security of property. They are in fact loans, although they may not in law be loans.<br/>
There is no reason why a local authority should need to raise a loan by this means, other than to avoid borrowing controls. Local authorities have exellent credit ratings, and the Local Government Act 1972 secures the loans that they raise on their revenues. The regulations therefore provide that a lease taken by a local authority is always within capital controls if the authority already holds a freehold or superior leasehold interest in the property.<br/>
One of the principles underlying the 1980 Act is what I might call the "duality" of prescribed expenditure and capital receipts. If a local authority disposes of an asset, or ceases to possess an asset, it is treated as if it had received a capital receipt equal to the amount of prescribed expenditure that it would have had to incur to acquire the asset. Regulation 2 preserves that principle. It provides that no capital receipt is generated on the acquisition of which no prescribed expenditure, or nil prescribed expenditure, was scored.<br/>
The regulations have a temporary effect. They will expire on 1 October, and will be replaced by permanent regulations on or before that date. That is because they were of necessity introduced without prior consultation and with immediate effect. I regret that experience dictated that the legislative changes had to be introduced without consultation. I drew attention earlier, however, when we were discussing the Local Government Finance Bill on Report, to what our experience has been. I am sure that the House will accept that it was prudent to announce our decision in the way that we did on 9 March.</p>

<p>On 9 March, the Secretary of State said:
<q>if time permits, we intend to legislate, in the autumn, for a total reform of the capital control system."&#x2014;[<i>Official Report</i>, 9 March 1988; Vol. 129, c. 333.]</q>

<p>Certainly. It is the policy of central Government to reform the capital control system. We hope to introduce legislation at the earliest opportunity to bring that into effect.<br/>
In recognition of experience on consultation, the regulations are temporary. We are consulting the local authority associations on what changes should be made before permanent regulations are laid. Even tomorrow, there will be a meeting between the officials of the Department of the Environment and local authority representatives to discuss some of the detail of the regulations.<br/>
One of the proposed relaxations concerns the transfer of new town houses. The present regulations provide that, where a local authority has acquired assets since the start of the present control system without incurring prescribed

expenditure, the disposal of those assets will not generate a capital receipt. This is to ensure that local authorities that have acquired assets outside the capital control system do not get credited with spending power within that system if they sell them.<br/>
It has been brought to our attention that this will prevent district councils which have taken transfers of new town houses and other assets from having the benefit of receipts from sales. That was not the intention of the regulations, and the anomaly will be corrected in relation to new town assets and other transferred assets when permanent regulations are introduced. The Department will take administrative action in respect of disposals in the meantime.<br/>
I do not think that it is appropriate in the time available to enter into a long discussion about the list of schemes that was released to the press and the circumstances that surrounded that. That is history. It was not part of an organised press release. I am sure that the Government would have been criticised by Opposition Members if we had not had available some examples of the sort of abuses that were taking place.</p>

<p>The document was much more accurate than some Opposition Members might care to admit. It made it clear that there were many schemes in the pipeline and others that had already been implemented. Not all the schemes had come to the notice of the Department in detail. Our experience is that councils are reticent about some schemes. The substance of the document was to a large extent correct. In a letter to the chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, my right hon. Friend set out the issue clearly. That document is a public letter that has been released to the press.<br/>
The hon. Member for Normanton (Mr. O'Brien) referred to the EEC grant to be paid on the mining museum in Wakefield. That has nothing to do with the regulations that are before us. He also raised a point about


agreements that are already entered into. If a local authority took a lease under an agreement to which both parties were fully committed on or before 9 March, the new regulations do not apply. They apply to agreements that become binding on or after 10 March.<br/>
The hon. Gentleman referred also to the Audit Commission report. My right hon. Friend also referred to that report in his remarks in the debate on the new clauses. We accept the point that the Commission made, although not the wider conclusions that the hon. Member for Normanton drew. The report is relevant to barter and to the new clauses that the Opposition did not vote against, but not to the regulations, which are about leasing and not property rationalisation.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Harborough (Sir J. Farr) asked for an explanation of the reasons for the measures announced on 9 March. From his description of the schemes, they are affected, if at all, by the new clauses that we debated earlier, rather than by the regulations. I urge him to read in the <i>Official Report</i> the explanation that my right hon. Friend gave when moving the new clauses. I urge him and the council in the area that he represents to consider the terms of the concessions announced earlier.<br/>
I confirm to my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Knapman) that, for the purposes of the regulations, building societies and housing associations are classed as private sector.<br/>
The hon. Member for Newham, North-West (Mr. Banks) raised several points. He did not tell us the extent to which, in the past, Newham incurred capital expenditure. It has now accumulated capital debt of &#x00A3;450 million. That is the figure for 1986&#x2013;87. That is a &#x00A3;2,199 debt per head of population. The hon. Gentleman wants to allow that council to have freedom to incur more and more debt without any restraint whatever. We have a capital control system to prioritise capital spending by local authorities.</p>

<p>I specifically put to the Minister a point about delay in dealing with exemptions, and cited the example of a 14-month delay. Will the Minister admit to the House that that is entirely unacceptable and that, if he wants to go ahead with the scheme, it will not be on the basis that local government cannot get an exemption or a reason from the Department?</p>

<p>I shall certainly draw the hon. Gentleman's remarks to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister who is responsible for that matter.<br/>
Again, schemes were introduced in which approvals can be given. Some of them have turned out to be a lot more complicated than was at first thought.<br/>
The Government have an excellent record on capital controls and on capital allocations to local authorities. Indeed, in 1987&#x2013;88, there was gross capital expenditure by local authorities of over &#x00A3;6&#x00B7;7 billion. That is 30 per cent. of all public sector capital expenditure, civil and military.<br/>
The debate is about definitions. It is about bringing within the control system those schemes of a capital nature that should be brought within the control system. Surely that is sensible and should commend itself to the House.</p>

<p>The Minister has not convinced his colleagues or the Opposition. Each hon. Member who has spoken in the debate has outlined to him the shortcomings and problems that, because of the regulations, authorities in their constituencies must meet.<br/>
The Minister said that the press release from the Secretary of State's Department was accurate. Yet local authorities have submitted evidence to show that the statements in the press release were totally inaccurate. The Minister should have agreed that it should have been withdrawn. Local authorities have been slighted by some schemes that were genuinely entered into in accordance with the law and in line with the previous regulations that were set by the Department of the Environment.<br/>
Referring to the Wakefield scheme, I take it that there will be no problem with EEC grants financing local authority capital schemes and that the Minister has assured the House that they will not be taken into consideration.<br/>
Finally, I make one point concerning the question of the 20 years less one day. In Wakefield, there is a residuary body scheme for the provision of office accommodation. Is the Minister saying that the residuary body will be able to reclaim that scheme in 20 years' time? That was the implication which the Minister gave in his reply to a question from one of my hon. Friends. In view of the uncertainty of the regulations, I ask the Minister to withdraw them. If he will not, we shall vote against them.</p>

<p>I wish to present a petition on behalf of the Leeds Church Action on Poverty Group and residents of the city of Leeds. This petition is a protest against the reductions in social security benefit that have been taking their toll on the disposable incomes of many of the less well-off since the beginning of this month. The benefit reductions and the result of the implementation of the reform of social security which, despite great public criticism, became the Social Security Act 1986, have resulted in cuts in housing benefit in particular. Its effects are now being felt and, my petitioners believe, will lead to a real increase in poverty for many people in our society. The petition reads:
<q>Wherefore your Petitioners pray that your honourable House will repeal the Social Security Act 1986 and introduce a social security system that protects all the poor in our society.</q>
I beg leave to present the petition.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Minister for being here to reply to this debate and to my colleagues, my hon. Friends the Members for Devon, North (Mr. Speller) and for Cornwall, North (Mr. Neale) for their support.<br/>
The background to the debate is the Secretary of State's decision to transfer the Hartland search and rescue responsibilities to Swansea and to close the sub-centre. The Secretary of State was good enough to see me immediately he announced his decision and I expressed the concern of the public and myself at the decision. My right hon. Friend offered me the opportunity of having the chief coastguard, Captain Peter Harris, with me for a public meeting. The purpose of the meeting&#x2014;as I suggested&#x2014;was to test the community's response and to try to find evidence that would enable me to persuade my hon. Friend to change his mind. That meeting has taken place and the main point of my speech is that the community would prefer to keep Hartland as it is.<br/>
The sub-centre should be kept because the coast is treacherous and dangerous and local fishermen are at risk. The growth in tourism has been enormous and the north Devon link road and the Okehampton bypass are rapidly developing. Facilities are being provided to tempt local people and holiday-makers to use the sea more. There are now five adventure training centres in the Bideford area alone, with sea canoeing, surfing, sailboarding, coast and cliff activities offered. There is an estuary ski centre, two rowing clubs, four small sailing clubs, the north Devon yacht club and other marinas planned.<br/>
Perhaps a thousand people, many of them children, use the Bideford bay and estuary each week. Is it any wonder that many of the facilities provided by the search and rescue service help those users of the sea? Indeed, we encourage people to come to Devon and Cornwall to enjoy our coastline. Both the population and the tourist industry are growing.<br/>
At the same time as the great growth in amateur and professional activity on the sea and cliffs, Trinity House is ceasing to maintain the Bideford bell buoy and the leading lights. The Royal National Lifeboat Institute is withdrawing the Bristol channel lifeboat at Clovelly. Now we are faced with the closure of the Hartland search and rescue sub-centre. As a result of those three impending, separate moves, there has been a severe and natural loss of confidence within the fishing community, among other local sailors, their families and visitors, about future safety at sea.<br/>
The swiftness of the provision of the information did not help. The local coastguards heard of their impending transfer from the BBC. Their worries were immediately passed on and shared by the entire community. The loss of the coastguards and their families will be felt most keenly by the community who know them personally as well as in their professional capacity; they are admired and valued. People are also worried about the auxiliaries whose part-time work is also at risk. In such a small town, the 20 or so jobs matter very much. Work is not so prolific in our area that we can afford to lose even a single part-time job.<br/>
The entire community wants the Minister to keep the Hartland search and rescue sub-centre open and based at home. If the change must go ahead, can the Minister give me any assurance regarding the job security of the auxiliaries? Indeed, is there a chance that he could strengthen their role? Is there no work that could be left behind&#x2014;no tasks connected with the maritime rescue sub-centre that the auxiliary rescue company could take up? The Minister will be aware that the auxiliaries are a hard-working and dedicated body of people. With the impending loss of the coastguards, it would be good to extend their service to the community still further.<br/>
If the proposed closure does take effect, I am pleased to hear that there will be no job loss among the coastguards, but that they will be transferred.<br/>
Our sector officer, of course, will remain. Would it be possible to strengthen his post if not by the appointment of a second sector officer, perhaps by concentrating his geographical area or in some other way? He is our community policeman in sea-going terms and he must not be stretched too far. Indeed, he will be the only full-time officer left.<br/>
As for Swansea&#x2014;that dreadful place which strikes fear into the hearts of all at Hartland&#x2014;there is a rumour that there will be inadequate staffing there, that there will not be sufficient officers on the watch and that not enough people will be in charge. Can the Minister assure me that there will be adequate staffing at Swansea? After all. it will have to cope with a double work load. Double the number of accidents will be sent through to the Swansea area.<br/>
There is a great worry that the telephone system will be inadequate. People who dial 999 complain constantly that they cannot get through. Will the telephone system be strengthened so that 999 calls will get through? That still leaves the fear that the general public, who report so many accidents, will not bother to make a trunk call. It is easy to make a local call, and we hope that they will still take the trouble when it becomes a long distance call.<br/>
Great concern was expressed at the meeting about the problem of distance. Everyone accepts that the new technology high-frequency radios will be effective, but not everyone has them. Many of the very small sailors, including sailboarders, do not have such equipment. However much we press them, they just will not have it.<br/>
But will the distance matter in terms of safety? Some people expressed fears about the distance because of the radio. Can the Minister assure me that he will monitor the speed of responses and that., in the coming months, if the decision takes effect, he will look carefully to see whether the response is genuinely as rapid as though the local coastguards were still at Hartland? Can he tell us honestly that it will be as swift and effective? That is the deepest fear of everyone, allied with the natural worry that, in the necessarily lengthy period of transfer, the coastguards based in Swansea will not know the local coastline well.<br/>
I was reassured by Captain Peter Harris's statement that he was transferring local coastguards more slowly so that they could teach their colleagues, but, as one local fisherman said: "They know me. They know where I fish, and when I get into trouble they know where I am. How can anyone in Swansea have that local knowledge?" That was a personal statement, but it expressed the community's fears.<br/>
I have a petition signed by 1,300 people which was gathered together swiftly in only five days. Treble the number of signatures could have been attracted had the


period been longer. One of the most important points made at the meeting was the need for a visual watch. I know, because Captain Harris told me, that we have not had a visual watch at Hartland since 1983, and that in many ways it is an archaic mthod of preserving safety at sea. As one of the coastguards said, at the exact moment that an accident happens he may be looking sideways. He may not be getting a cup of coffee, but something else may happen. The visual watch may not provide the guarantee of safety that the community believes it does.<br/>
None the less, especially with our great influx of tourists, I believe that a visual watch is important. The 1,300 people who signed the petition that was brought to me at 8 am on Sunday morning certainly feel that most deeply. Can the Minister reassure me that he will guarantee to set a visual watch when it is genuinely needed?<br/>
I cannot accept the Secretary of State's decision with peace of mind for sailors without the Minister's guarantee of continuing safety through these and other measures.</p>

<p>It is normally a great pleasure to ally myself with my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson), and I do so wholeheartedly, but not gladly. Now is not the time to reduce cover for the small boat brigade, let alone for the airbed brigade who bob gently out to sea on the tide, knowing nothing of the sea and its ways. My hon. Friend's constituents know about the sea, and have preserved the watch for a long time.<br/>
I understand entirely the reasons for the ministerial decision and I do not query it, but my constituents from the Ilfracombe and Croyde coastguard stations have come to me, not alarmed for jobs&#x2014;as my hon. Friend said, the jobs are safe&#x2014;but desperately alarmed for the safety of those who venture out in small boats without the knowledge that is desperately needed. For that reason, I am honoured, as always, to ally myself with my hon. Friend's views. I ask the Minister to keep a most careful eye on what happens. One child lost is too many, and if that loss can be blamed on the loss of the coastguard, neither he nor we will be easily forgiven.</p>

<p>I, too, am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) for including the interests of north Cornwall, and the part of the coast that joins Hartland, in this Adjournment debate.<br/>
Let me reiterate two or three of my hon. Friend's points. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to clarify exactly what the future will be for the auxiliaries, because there is great concern among those who are involved in the tourist industry, and know that coast well, about the difficulties that visitors get into. They also know that many more people are indulging in adventurous sports and pastimes off the coast, which can cause considerable difficulties.<br/>
I also look forward to hearing what my hon. Friend the Minister says about Swansea and staffing there. Naturally, there is a lack of peace of mind as a result of the

announcement, which arises in no small way from the lack of confidence in Swansea's ability to deal with the problems&#x2014;given that it is so far away.<br/>
My hon. Friend is quite right to have raised this issue and she is doing a great service to the people of Hartland, as well as to those who visit it while on holiday.</p>

<p>Good fortune has shone on my hon. Friend the Member for Torridge and Devon, West (Miss Nicholson) and secured her the opportunity to raise both the proposed closure in March next year of Hartland Point maritime co-ordination sub-centre and the adequacy of coastguard services planned for the north and west Devon coast.<br/>
Understandably, my hon. Friend seeks reassurance about coastguard services, not only on behalf of residents in her constituency but with an eye to the welfare of the thousands of visitors who flock to the area that she represents and to its attractive coastline.<br/>
My hon. Friend raised a number of important points. She referred to the huge number of people who use the coastal sea, especially in the summer, to concerns about Trinity House and Royal National Lifeboat Institution changes in the area, to the possible redeployment of those no longer required in the Hartland Point centre, to the possibility of a second full-time officer, on changes to reduce the sector officer's work load, to the adequacy of manning at Swansea and to the monitoring of the speed and efficiency of rescue services. I shall endeavour to cover all those points in my reply. My hon. Friend the Member for Devon, North (Mr. Speller) also raised the question of breeches buoys and rocket facilities, and I shall cover those points too.<br/>
For many people, including some hon. Members, the role and duties of Her Majesty's coastguard are something of a mystery. For that reason, it may be helpful if I start by explaining what the coastguards do and how they are organised to do it.<br/>
The United Kingdom coastline is divided into 110 sectors, each of which is manned by a group of part-time, but thoroughly trained, local auxiliary coastguards who perform varied duties from cliff rescue to visual watches at times of danger, under the command of a regular sector officer. The auxiliaries are recruited, trained and administered by the sector officer, a full-time professional coastguard.<br/>
Around our coast, there are 24 rescue co-ordination centres, whose job it is to receive information on incidents requiring search and rescue and to bring into operation the most suitable form of rescue service. The rescue co-ordination centres are manned 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and they receive their information from satellite or radio distress signals, 999 calls and local coastguard sectors. The VHF radio is constantly monitored and, by means of 39 direction-finding VHF cross-reference systems, it is able to locate, or nearly locate, the source of the VHF distress signal.<br/>
Each co-ordination centre is responsible for a certain number of VHF aerials. It is a very effective system. By cross-linking one set of aerials with another, one can tell the precise direction from which a signal is coming. Where the direction lines from the two sets of aerials cross, one can identify the spot or be very near to the spot from which


the distress signal has come. The rescue co-ordination centre calls out the appropriate rescue service&#x2014;the RNLI, a helicopter, or the auxiliary cliff rescue service.<br/>
I should add that even though it is not technically the responsibility of the coastguard, it also helps non-mariners who are in trouble on our coastline. I should like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the constant work that is done in that way by the auxiliary and full-time coastguards.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Devon, North raised the question of breeches buoys. At the time of its introduction well over a century ago, the breeches buoy was the only practical way of taking survivors off stranded vessels. Not only has stranding become much more rare, but most vessels that run ashore do not break up quickly. The possibility of rescue by boat or aircraft, or even by walking ashore when weather and tide permit, have led to the end in practical terms of the breeches buoy. On many parts of the coast it has not been used at all in living memory, and in other parts it has been employed very infrequently. Across the nation it has been used to bring people ashore only twice in five years, and even then it is doubtful whether it was the only or best method to use. Consequently, the efforts and money devoted to this complicated, limited and largely unused system are being diverted to other forms of assistance.<br/>
My hon. Friend the Member for Devon, North also asked about rocket-firing lines&#x2014;I think that is what he had in mind&#x2014;to people in trouble in the sea, including those on air beds. Such rockets are not very accurate and may even puncture or otherwise damage the air bed containing the unfortunate person that it is hoped to rescue. That is not a wholly desirable way to proceed.<br/>
An immense amount of technological advance lies behind the provision of rescue services. New methods and new equipment provide ways of achieving an improved service for mariners in distress, whether they are on large commercial vessels, fishing boats or on one of the huge fleet of pleasure craft that crowd our coastline, especially the attractive parts such as those in the constituency of my hon. Friend.<br/>
I shall now turn from the general situation to the precise arrangements on the north and west Devon coasts, and shall deal first with visual watches. A visual watch from the Hartland coastguard look-out station is of limited value because one cannot see much of the near coast. However, there are very good long-distance sight lines. In practice, the visual watch is generally kept by Land Rover-equipped teams on appropriate vantage points and that has not been mounted continuously for five years. Visual casualty risk watches have instead been mounted and will continue to be mounted when the risks to mariners can be expected to rise.<br/>
That covers about 30 per cent. of the time and involves particular situations&#x2014;either severe weather or a sudden deterioration in the weather or expected severe weather. The other characteristics which call for extra visual watches to be mounted are when there are many pleasure craft about. That means regattas, weekends in the summer, bank holidays and similar situations. In those situations when there are large numbers of craft about, especially when there are many amateurs on them, and in deteriorating weather conditions, extra visual watch is mounted and will continue to be mounted.<br/>
In the light of my hon. Friend's representations, I can say that it is intended to strengthen the auxiliary rescue

company at Hartland Point by deployment of additional auxiliaries&#x2014;either some or all of those now tied up in the Hartland Point rescue centre and not on visual watch duties. I am sure that that announcement will reassure my hon. Friend and some of her constituents. I can promise that no compulsory redundancies will arise from the proposals for the Hartland Point rescue co-ordination centre.<br/>
My hon. Friend raised the question of the sector officer and asked me whether a second, back-up sector officer could be appointed or whether his work load could be eased so that he could give more time to that area. I can make a second announcement tonight, which I am sure my hon. Friend will welcome, that it is now proposed that the sector officer's length of coastline should be reduced by one third, and that the number of auxiliary companies for which he is responsible should be reduced from five to three. I am sure that my hon. Friend will be pleased to report that.<br/>
Another point raised by my hon. Friend, which slightly puzzles me, concerned the adequacy of the 999 system. The coastguard deserves considerable praise for its ingenuity over the matter of the 999 system. It has aligned the coastguard sectors with British Telecom's 999 call districts. As a result, if one makes a 999 call and asks for the coastguard, British Telecom automatically connects the call to the right coastguard rescue co-ordination centre. Of course, if someone from north Devon wants to get in touch with Swansea, he will not be successful because at the moment he will be put in touch with Hartland Point, as British Telecom is tied in with the coastguard. Once the change has taken place, he will automatically be put on to Swansea. My hon. Friend can be reassured on that point. I add that there is no question of her constituents worrying about long-distance calls, as such calls are automatically free.<br/>
My hon. Friend also raised the question of the merging of districts. There is a technical benefit from merging two districts on opposite sides of the Bristol channel. In a variety of ways this will simplify radio surveillance. Because of the configuration of the coastline, the best location for some of the VHF aerials is on the opposite side of the Bristol channel. Thus, Hartland has control of an area of Cardiff and Swansea is connected to an aerial site at Combe Martin behind Ilfracombe. By opetating all the aerial sites from one operations room, mutual interference will be avoided and there will be an improvement in the technical operation of the radio side of the rescue operations services. Because all the aerials are expected to be retained, there will be no diminution in the cover. The changes in the routes of the control lines and the concentration of traffic in bigger, better-manned stations will help.<br/>
It has been asked why the merger is not the other way round, with Hartland being retained instead of Swansea. That is because substantially better facilities which are necessary to cope with major problems, particularly major disasters, are available at Swansea. Unlike Hartland, the building is permanent and has capacity for expansion.<br/>
The coastguard depends for its effectiveness on local knowledge and it takes considerable pains to enable watchkeepers to gain and acquire familiarity with the full extent of their guard, not only by visiting and exploring, but by developing an intricate network of contacts which can be used to obtain up-to-date information. Above all, the auxiliaries, under the regular sector officers, who live


all along the coast, provide invaluable sources of background, and immediate operational intelligence when required.<br/>
I can add to that that there are a number of other ways in which contact is made for example&#x2014;with the harbour-master. It may help if I add that when the change to Swansea takes place, not only will the senior officer being added to the team at Swansea come from Hartland, and bring that knowledge, but it is anticipated that probably four others with some knowledge will go from Hartland. That will ensure not only that there is a pool of such knowledge but that those who are responsible at Swansea will be going across the Bristol channel meeting people along the coast, talking to the auxiliaries and the sector officers, getting to know their contacts so that they know to whom they are talking and the conditions that they are describing.<br/>
My hon. Friend expressed anxieties about the recent RNLI decision to replace the Lundy lifeboat with an improved craft at Appledore. That is entirely outwith my responsibilities. However, I have to say that the overall lifeboat coverage in the area has been substantially improved by the introduction of the Tyne class boats at Tenby, Padstow and the Mumbles as well as at Appledore. Furthermore, one of the new fast carriage boats is due to be stationed at Ilfracombe next year, and that RNLI capability is certainly much appreciated by the coastguards.<br/>
The House will be aware of the helicopter coverage of the area, with RAF search and rescue helicopters providing first-class cover in the Bristol channel by day as well as by night, and in thick weather.<br/>
My hon. Friend mentioned the important point of the staffing level of regular coastguard offices at Swansea. This will be augmented to take account of the increased responsibilities of the station. Four extra watchkeeping officers and an extra officer to reinforce the district management team will be provided, at least until such time

as the merger has settled down. Some of these, and at least the senior officer reinforcing Swansea, will come from the north Devon coast, bringing with them their intimate local knowledge. Moreover, the full-time senior watch officers at Swansea will be visiting north Devon to examine the coastline, and, as I described earlier, to meet the sector officers, auxiliary companies, harbour masters, RNLI, coxswains and so on.<br/>
My hon. Friend also raised the question of monitoring the response. We see no reason why response times should be changed, but we shall monitor them. On average, there are 230 marine incidents a year in the Hartland district. Each incident will continue to be investigated in the future to determine whether there have been any delays, and whether the response was correct.<br/>
We are approaching the summer season, when many more people take to their boats, some of them amateurs, and some of them very professional. It is time to remind them of the need to make sure that they have VHF radio with them, especially if they go out of sight of land. It would be extremely foolish to sail without VHF radio, which gives the means to summon assistance if need be. Those who are not familiar with the coast should ask the coastguard for advice before setting out, and at all times people should ensure that they have life-saving equipment on board.<br/>
My hon. Friend can take back to north and west Devon the knowledge that she has secured from me the announcements of increased staffing levels at Swansea, the reduction in the length of coastline covered by the full-time sector officer looking after the auxiliaries, the strengthening in the auxiliary forces at the Hartland area by redeployment of some of those now employed in the maritime rescue sub-centre, and the continual monitoring of the speed of response to any incidents that occur in this area. I hope that with those four announcements, my hon. Friend will feel that her time in this short Adjournment debate has been well spent.</p>
